 ### Characters
 OMO_2022_Nikolai_Buckharin: "NEIZVESTNO"
 POLITICS_NEIZVESTNO_DESC: "Many men live in Siberia. Unknown amidst the ice and the cold. But this one is different.\n\nOld, so old. Yet determined. An iron will. And those eyes, they have seen so much...\n\nWho is he? Do we know him? How could we... The flame of recognition flickers out.\n\nHe has no time for our idle wonders. He has a mission. Wrongs to make right.\n\n§eAnd so begins the final drama...§!"
 
 OMO_2022_Nikolai_Buckharin_Revealed: "Nikolai Buckharin"
 POLITICS_PONY_BUCKHARIN_DESC: "The name itself is bound to invoke any number of emotions in any Russian depending on who they are. Hate, sadness, pity, fond reminiscence, old dreams of Soviet glory. A palette as diverse as the Russian Anarchy, fitting given the connection of the man in question to its origins. You likely know the tale already. The Fascist Reich cut the Union's throat and Bukharin was nowhere to be found. Most thought him dead. Most would be wrong, however. In truth, Bukharin took refuge in the isolated tundras of the land he once ruled, broken from his failures. He was lost from his failures and bearing many questions, questions he didn't know how to ask, and he just wanted answers. The years were brutal, and the search was desperate. But when he found his answer, he would never be the same again.\n\nEnter Nikolai Buckharin - No longer an aged relic of a man, but a wizened unicorn with a new lease on life looking towards the future. Buckharin seeks to make things right, reversing the mistakes of his past and making the Soviet Union anew, free of its old errors and able to tout to the world the answer he found:\n\n§CFriendship is Magic.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Neither, from the Equestria at War team."
 
 POLITICS_ALICORN_BUCKHARIN_DESC: "The alicorn is the most brilliant and powerful of all creatures on this Earth. A being of pure power and magic, immortal and benevolent - a living god which walks the same plane as man and pony alike. Boasting the flying abilities of the quickest pegasi, the magic of the most wizened unicorns, and the strength of the mightiest horse, only the greatest heroes of all ponies ever reach such heights. Never before has any man held such glory.\n\nNikolai Buckharin is no simple man.\n\nFrom the leader of one of the world's most powerful nations to disgraced failure and back, the old Chairpony now looks on his old life as little more than a nightmare which he has escaped, a time before crystals and Equestria. It took all his strength to bridge the divide between man and pony as the two worlds collided, but his success has been unrivaled, and great work deserves a great reward. Thus it was decided by the princesses of Equestria to bestow upon him the status of an alicorn, making Buckharin into the most powerful pony on Earth.\n\nGazing over his lands, Buckharin can remember the struggles of the 40's and 50's. He can recall the triumphs of the last years, raising Russia from the rubble into a new age. Indeed, he has learned the simple truth, and carries it with him into the glorious future - the knowledge that Friendship is Magic.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Neither, from the Equestria at War team."
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEN_OMO_2022_DESC: "Once, in the communes of the north, the religious prayed for one man. It was said that he would come to save them, revive their spirits, and bring peace to their lands. They called him the Father.\n\nThey got a pony instead.\n\nDisheartened, Alexander Men returned to a life of preaching. Yet the so-called "Harmonious Union" proved a new Sodom, made harmonious only through beastly transformations and abnormal magic. By the might of the Lord, it had to be defeated.\n\nAnd so, Alexander Men began a battle of words. In time, he became the unofficial representative for humanity as a whole, preaching against the excesses of Buckharin's government at every turn. His mission seemed doomed - yet improbably, Russia listened. In a moment of crisis, they forced out Buckharin, replacing him with their Father of old.\n\nNow, a man sits at the head of the Harmonious Union. Already, he has announced changes, banning unholy crystals and forming a humans-only cabinet. In mere moments, the Harmonious Union has been ripped from the age of ponies, friendship, and magic. For better or for worse, it has returned to the age of Men."
 
 OMO_2022_Various_Leaders: "The Harmonic Presidium"
 POLITICS_VARIOUS_LEADERS_OMO_2022_DESC: "In Nikolai Buckharin's quest to achieve Harmony he has failed to pay heed to his own creations, and in the end this has led to his downfall. When the ponies of his nation cried out, their needs left utterly neglected, it was the radical pony members of the Presidium that answered and frogmarched Buckharin out of his position and put themselves into full control of the state. But with that done, many questions were posed. Who would be the new leader? How will they address the peaking crisis? What would be the way forward?\n\nNone of them were answered. And while there was initial sporadic violence between humans and ponies, what followed was not anarchy or lawlessness, there were no mass reprisal killings or destruction of the land. What followed was the quiet. The humans went home. The ponies went home. The ramshackle leadership quietly kept things running, because there was nothing else to be done. Humans refuse to associate with ponies, and vice versa. Blinds are pulled, doors slammed, only side-eyed glances afforded. Some shun even members of the same species. For the feeling of friendship has died.\n\nand §CHarmony§!. has §efailed.§!"

 OMO_2022_Alexei_Rykov_hog_desc: "§YPremier of the Harmonious Union\nHarmonic Communism§!\n§F--------------§!\n§LIf one thing can be said about Alexei Ivanovich Rykov, is that old age does not have an effect on one's devotion to a cause. Born in the year 1881, Rykov is the oldest still-active member of the VKP(b). He has managed this partially due to the rejuvenating effects of the ponification process, but it is mostly due to his complete and total dedication to the Communist cause.\n\nAlexei Rykov served Bukharin's old Soviet Union as its Premier; Bukharin's second-in-command. He stuck loyal to the Soviet Union until its collapse under the German jackboot. Many had presumed that the old man was dead, but they were dead wrong. He lived in exile in the far reaches of the Siberian tundra for years upon years, until that fateful day when he received a strange letter, followed by a surreal visit by a talking horse... who turned out to be the old Chairman, Nikolai Buckharin himself.§!"

 OMO_2022_Lili_iz_Doliny: "Lili iz Doliny"
 OMO_2022_Lili_iz_Doliny_desc: "§LSurprisingly little is known about Lili iz Doliny - Roughly translating to 'Lily of the Valley.' The earliest known mention of her name was a credit for a poem in a newspaper printed in the Central Siberian Republic before it fell. After this, little is credited to her, and while she claims to have enlisted into the Republican Army, there is little evidence to support this claim.\n\nLili iz Doliny is little more than a pseudonym, though her true name she keeps close to her chest. When Buckharin called out to those wishing for a better life, she answered. She spent time as a lieutenant before being quickly promoted after proving herself in the defense of a Far Eastern village from a bandit raid. This, combined with a severe need for competent leadership saw her to the position she holds today: a general of the Harmonious Union. Her commitment to Harmony and all of ponykind is unquestionable, and she will stop at no extreme to see Harmonic Communism from the port of Vladivostok to the city of Moscow.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Neither, from the Equestria at War team.§!"
 
 OMO_2022_Sharmy: "Shramy"
 OMO_2022_Sharmy_desc: "§LShramy - meaning 'Scars' in Russian, is a product of an extremely rare genetical mutation in the ponification process, reportedly only happening in one among a thousand subjects. Features belonging to bats can be found in members of his species, including a weak eyesight, a heightened sense of hearing, wings made of a leather-like material, and the prominence of fangs in his mouth. Scientists call his kind 'Thestrals,' although they are now more commonly known as Batponies.\n\nNot much is known about Shramy's life before his ponification, but what we do know is that he most likely did not grow up in Russia thanks to his unrecognizable foreign Russian accent, though he is a capable general. He has said that everyone only needs to know that he is a damn good general, and nothing more.\n\nHe... also likes to carry a doll of a purple-haired and a purple-striped zebra around, refering to it as his "Guide," whatever that means. We don't question it.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Neither, from the Equestria at War team.§!"
 
 OMO_2022_Yuri_Gagarin: "Yuri Gagarin"
 OMO_2022_Yuri_Gagarin_desc: "Born in a humble village in Klushino, Yuri Gagarin's family fled to the Far East when the Great Patriotic War broke out. Since then, he has lived in the city of Irkutsk, living an unassuming life. When the Baikal was integrated into the Harmonious Union, Gagarin happily volunteered for ponification. Yuri Gagarin was reborn as a majestic pegasus.\n\nHe was the only pegasus capable of achieving what the scientists call a "sonic rainboom," where a pegasus would fly to such a high speed that a grand spectacle of colors would emanate from one's trail. The only explanation so far of why this could happen is that it may be traces of Equestrian magic that was brought to this land in one way or another.\n\nHe also likes to wear a spacesuit everywhere, for some reason."

 OMO_2022_Its_a_fucking_BT7: "BT-7"
 OMO_2022_Its_a_fucking_BT7_desc: "§LWhen the Treaty of Stalliongrad was signed, the ponies from the other side insisted on giving us a tank unit identical to a BT-7 from the Great Patriotic War, except that it was modified in such a way to fit ponies inside instead of humans. They kept rambling about how this tank is capable of 'genius strategic planning' despite the fact that it is, indeed, a fucking tank.\n\nOf course, we thought that the ponies from the other side were mad, that was until an officer decided to throw in a map of our potential enemies in the west into the inside of the machine. The tank roared into life and spat out the map, only that it was intricately scribbled with offensive lines, maneuvers, predictions of enemy movements, logistics, everything. Perhaps this world has indeed gone mad after all.§!"

 OMO_in_the_endless_tundra_desc: "I am fleeing Moscow. I escape out the back as things collapse along the Front.\n\nI am standing before a bonfire. I burn what few documents I have that identify me, that mark my failure.\n\nI am turning away when I see it. The crystal. It glitters among the flames. I crouch, putting forth a trembling hand, feeling my body warp and transfigure at the touch. As pain grips me and reality collapses, I find my shame dissipate. I realize I know how to save Russia. I have §Cthe answer§! to my country's questions. It is §Can answer§! no one will expect."

In this form, I feel a new energy coursing through me. I am more determined than ever to help everypony in Russia, no matter how loud they scream or how fast they run away when they see me!\n\nThe man they knew as Bukharin is dead. From the ashes of his failure, the stallion Buckharin rises. I will wrest victory from the talons of defeat. I will bring §CHarmony§! to all the poor trod-upon peoples of the former Soviet Union. The world will soon see what Russians can accomplish when we work together!"

 OMO_rally_the_old_guard_desc: "In the vanishing part of my mind that still remembers what it was like to be a man, I sometimes remember my great friends on the Presidium. Molotov. Rykov. Tomsky. We thought we'd figured everything out in those days. We thought we could use a revolutionary vanguard party to provide the working classes with the political consciousness needed to depose capitalism.\n\nTurns out, that's all bunk! What you need for the successful overthrow of capitalism is not Leninist revolutionary leadership but friendship. Lots of friendship. It is essential that I track down my closest surviving allies to tell them of this fact, to demonstrate the newest evolution in Marxist thinking. The skeptics might call us deviationists, but we will show Harmonic Communism is the future!"

With all peoples working together, anything is possible! That's the power of §CHarmony§!, after all.\n\nI will gallop to each village in the Far East to try and convince as many people as I can to embrace my new message of friendship and community. While many will be distracted by my new visage and skeptical that their problems can be resolved by banal platitudes about teamwork, I know I can win them over.

I finally have enough people to begin working towards bringing §CHarmony§! to the Russian anarchy.\n\nHowever, friendly conversations and long trots through the snow can only do so much. I'll need structures and institutions to help me carry out my vision for Russia.

With the coming of our brave leader Buckharin, so too came the ability to find these countless crystal veins, just waiting to be extracted and put to work in shaping the new world he envisions. However, we must first consolidate what we already have on hoof. All our current crystals come from a single site which holds much more potential than we are getting out of it right now. It must be expanded, as the All-Ponies Congress has ordered."

Some of the engineers that have stumbled upon our nascent civilization have managed to craft devices out of crystals able to track down new veins.\n\nAll that these devices require is somepony to carry them through the harsh forests, hills, and tundra of the Siberian Expanse. This is why the All-Ponies Congress commissioned the Crystal Tracking Divisions, small groups composed of the most experienced hunters and trackers the North has to offer, to be sent out into the desolation of Siberia to locate crystals and call in mining teams to begin excavation. We will need these resources to weather the coming storm..."

After trying nearly every other potential solution, they have unanimously reported that the greatest choke point in the relocation of crystalline material is simply the amount of ponypower assigned to the chain of production - they don't have enough.\n\nThankfully, we do not lack for ponies with able hooves. As it is absolutely critical that we have as many crystals as possible, as soon as possible, we must reallocate the many ponies in jobs deemed less important to the mines.\n\nWith these crystals, our brethren suffering to the south shall be freed; to work, comrades!"

Only ponies can even understand the concept of harmony, and only they can see it fulfilled to its fullest extent. Despite these already established facts, many positions of power in the lands under our administration remain in the hands of humans.

Even Comrade Buckharin himself admitted that at that time, those were merely words of flattery, and the concept of a utopian society was simply too much to ask. However, this will change.\n\nThe ideology of Harmonic Communism will, for the first time in the history of man and ponykind, create the foundations of a truly utopian society where pain and sorrow are a thing of the past, where friendship rules above conflict.

Governing in accordance with the principles of communism, our army is one that serves the people and the proletariat. Instead of enforcing the government's authority and suppressing the people's will, our army shall be the people's first and last line of defense against injustice and fascism.

But with the times changing and our power growing, we must recognise that there is more to an army than the ground forces.\n\nAs such, joining the Pink Army will be a proper air force and navy, completing our armed forces and getting it more on the level with modern countries of the world.

But why in Magadan?\n\nWe are not selfish, and the things that we have learned may become useful for our newfound allies.

Only twenty-one days in, the great revolutionary Vladimir Lenin passed away after a period of ill health and passed leadership to Buckharin.\n\nBuckharin championed Lenin's proposal of the New Economic Policy and put it into practice through many different methods, the most prominent of which was the famed Central Siberian Plan - The legacy of which was very important to the warlords that once called places like Barnaul and Tomsk home. Now, however, these lands are part of our Harmonious Union, and the reins rest in our hands once more. We will carry on the unfinished business started all those years ago in tribute to the spirit of Lenin!"

In dark times such as these, it is more important than ever that the core principles of Harmony remain resolute in the hearts of our people.\n\nIt was magic that brought us change in so many ways, showing us a new way of life and new abilities beyond comprehension. It was friendship that got us through some of our darkest times, bringing us together in love and companionship. We owe Harmony a great deal, and if we carry it with us always then we can never fail. Human or pony, we are united. We are all Buckharin's Little Ponies.\n\nSo let us stand strong. Let the humans pick up their rifles, let the ponies get ready to trot. The Urals await. And somewhere, there are new friends to be made!"

It is quiet; the birds do not sing here, and the animals that do reside within these ice blasted woods are dangerous hunters. Hearing them would be the last thing that you ever do.\n\nYou don't know what compelled you to come out into these wastes. Was it a desire to escape your meaningless life? A more base desire, perhaps, one of seeking out water or food. Maybe you just decided to leave one day and never return. It is meaningless. Siberia called, and you deigned to answer.\n\nRegardless of your reasoning, you have been wandering for quite some time. You do not know where you are, or how long it has been.

After long years working within Yagoda's administration, after years of building the institutions of Irkutsk into something that could restore the Soviet Union, she found herself seated near the man. She found herself at a round table with Yagoda, Sablin, and the beast Buckharin as the latter's assistant, as his expert on the dispute between the two men and a sign of his commitment to "interspecies collaboration."\n\nDeath would have been too good a mercy for her, but maybe if this farce of a negotiation ended she would be rewarded with it anyway.\n\n"Come on, friends!" said the horse, banging its hooves on the wooden table. "I know we all have disagreements about who is and isn't a deviationist, but there's no reason for us to fight when we can talk about our differences instead! You've both been stellar comrades and I know we can all work as a team!"\n\nThere was silence. Yagoda stared at Elena and the pony with a withering expression. Sablin buried his face in his hands and muttered something that sounded like "For God's fucking sake..."\n\nThe creature Buckharin turned to her with its enormous eyes. It was impossible for those eyes to exist, for them not to immediately cave into themselves, but they bored into her nonetheless. "I'm starting to think that maybe friendship and Harmony isn't going to solve our problem here," he said in a loud, sing-song voice as if the two men weren't at the table. "What do you think?""

His face was not that of a confident revolutionary but of an exhausted man trying to keep hold of the last strands of his sanity. "Genrikh and I have had our disagreements but, in this case, I have to agree. This is too much. This is..." He trailed off, shaking his head. "Is any of this real?"\n\n"Of course it's real!" Said Buckharin without an ounce of self-awareness. "If there's one thing I've learned over the last few months, it's that real strength isn't about a powerful security state," he gave a look to Yagoda, "or a return to true Marxist-Leninist principles," he gave a look to Sablin, "it's about working together to achieve great things! Isn't that right, Comrade Panova? You remember the First All-Ponies Congress, right?"\n\nElena opened her mouth in a fish-like gape, only for Yagoda to suddenly rise from the table and remove a gun from his waistband. "That's it. I've had enough of this goddamn insanity. A fucking all-pony congress. I cannot... I refuse... I don't know what the fuck you are, but you aren't Nikolai Bukharin. You have five seconds to get out before I start firing."\n\nThe other three members of the table backed away from the table, their hands and hooves raised.

She watched as the equine's song hooked into Yagoda's brain and the aging revolutionary joined them in a low, hoarse baritone. She watched them conduct complicated choreography and wordplay without preparation or explanation.\n\nAs the music died, Comrade Yagoda turned to the horse and said in a voice unlike his own. "Thank you, comrade. I see now that, when we work together, we really can accomplish so much more."\n\n"I agree completely," said Sablin, wrapping an arm around his enemy, the man he'd vowed to destroy. His mouth seemed to move independent of his dull, glassy eyes. "We've learned that friendship isn't always easy. But there's no doubt it's worth fighting for."\n\nThe beast pushed its way between the two men. It contorted its equine arms into an embrace. Its face shifted into a simulacrum of a smile. "I'm glad we could put aside our differences for Russia. We will unite our statelets together, beneath a common banner of Harmony. We will work together as friends and it's all thanks to the advice of my good friend-."\n\nShe couldn't take any more. Elena turned from the scene and rushed away from the negotiation room. Guards looked at her in alarm as she passed, her hair wild and tears streaming down her face, but she didn't care. All she could think about was how Sablin and Yagoda had fallen to the horse's tricks. All she could think about was how larger and larger swathes of her motherland found itself beneath the sway of a talking, singing horse."

His conquerors were a lesser race, subhuman in every sense, yet they had destroyed his armies and conquered his nation. It was an impossibility. From the physical to the racial, his every logical thread had been left in tatters.\n\nA booming voice began to speak to his left. "While the ideology of Harmony does not condone execution, we were always prepared to make the rare exception. In the case of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, we have seen a pattern of cruelty and violence which unfortunately can see no reform. While controversial, we saw this as the only answer."\n\nThe crowd exploded in applause. Suddenly, Rodzaevsky felt his body leave the floor, as if falling in reverse. Hoping to find solid ground, he began to squirm and kick at his restraints. All he managed to push off was the blindfold. As the cloth fell from his eyes, he finally saw the crowd.\n\nThere must have been an army of thousands below him, some human, some ponies. The most powerful among them had beautiful horns, glowing with a magical power he would never come to possess. They were working together to lift him to the gallows. It was true harmony of the classes - the corporatist dream which he had always imagined, completed by an inhuman race.\n\nThen he felt it.

Built entirely magically out of stunning white marble, the core of the Academy was an old-style castle which held a massive auditorium in which the great alicorn now spoke to an audience of several thousand bright young minds.\n\nHidden entirely within this crowd sat a young unicorn with a flaming red mane, who had traveled from very, very far away to be here for this moment. Though she could have come with her friends, it had felt more appropriate to come to this new world alone - as she had come to the world that was now home for her. That, and they had homework.\n\nThe crowd's murmuring stopped instantly. With a loud, scratchy sound, the alicorn magically amplified his voice so that it boomed across the auditorium, and began his speech.\n\n"Humans, ponies - beings of all kinds! My name is Nikolai Buckharin - the chairpony of this reforged nation that now stands in the name of Peace and Harmony for all. Not very long ago, I roamed the wastes of endless Siberia destitute and wallowing in my own despair - my own self-hatred for failing my motherland and my people in their time of most desperate need. Then, I came into contact with magic - the magic of friendship - and the rest, well, the rest is history. This institute was founded in the same spirit and with the same hope as I felt on that fateful day, to forward the progress of harmonic ideals and science, and as such is open not just to my fellow Soviet peoples but to those beings of the other world - any other world. Everyone is welcome to advance their education here - and so with these words I declare the Academy of Friendship open!"\n\nWith a brilliant burst of magic great fireworks lit up the sky - and the faces of the crowd as they roared and screamed their approval.

Lena's parents sat in front of her on a small couch in their tiny sitting room, staring with clear worry in their eyes at their young pony daughter. She had been working up the courage to speak with them for some time now, and had finally done so after a particularly difficult day at the market.\n\n"Is something wrong, Lenachka?" her mother asked, "It's not that Sergei boy bothering you again, is it?"\n\n"I need you to promise before I tell you," Lena replied, screwing her eyes shut. She could feel the tears starting to well up already.\n\nHer two parents shared a look with each other. "We promise, you know that you can tell us anything," her father replied, his normally cheerful demeanor uncharacteristically somber.\n\nThe young mare took a deep breath. "Mama, Papa, I'm... I don't like boys, I like girls instead. I was so afraid to tell you, because I love you both so much, and I didn't want you to hate me, and thought that maybe since I was a pony now, I..."\n\nThe room trailed off into uncomfortable silence, and Lena braced herself for the inevitable shouting, or worse. Instead, she flinched in surprise as two pairs of arms wrapped around her, pulling her into a warm embrace. "Elena Ivanova, we could never hate you," her mother declared, "Whether you like boys, or girls, it doesn't matter to us, because you're still our little girl."\n\n"Your mother is right," her father continued, "Don't think that this changes a single thing. You still need to bring the wash in, it's about to rain."\n\nHer mother shouted in faux affront, but it was enough to open the floodgates.

It seemed even the papers were beginning to buy into Alexander Men's bunk. God knows why, but mankind had begun listening to that street preacher. Perhaps God was on his side after all.\n\nToday, the front page of the Irkutsk Observer wasn't even a story. Men, or perhaps one of his devotees, had bought out the whole page to publish a special work from Men himself. He called it "The Father's Manifesto". Despite himself, Buckharin could not help but judge - what man would be so pompous as to call himself the Father?\n\nIt was well written, at least, and not outwardly offensive. For all his rants on the street about the evils of ponification, Men talked at some length about how ponies needed "protection", the same language that the pony radicals used. Yet something sinister laid underneath. The Father called for the registration of all ponies by the government - presumably, his government. What would a man like Men want with that information?\n\nBuckharin put down the paper. Something bad was going to happen - something dangerous. Dark days were coming for the Harmonious Union, and Buckharin could not think of a single remedy."

The Divine March seemed as if it might be a failure.\n\nYet the government could have never predicted the power of Men's protestors. From the ranks of the Divine March came hymn after hymn, old standards that any older Russian would know by heart. For humans, locked up in their homes after months of stability, the songs rang through their hearts, reminding them of bygone days - of home.\n\nFor the ponies, it was nothing so hopeful. The human's songs may have spoken of friendship, but they did not march in the streets for harmony. No ponies marched among them - it was clear their vision was for humanity alone. The protestors' rosy nostalgia had no room for ponykind.\n\nPerhaps the police could have forced the Divine March to disperse. But what could that have done? All of the Harmonious Union, all of Buckharin's achievements, rested on the harmony between the two races. The father's death would have scarred the union as badly as his ascension.\n\nAnd so, Alexander Men was allowed to march to the Presidium unharmed. As humanity watched with hope, as ponies watched with fear, Men marched to the head of the crowd and stood in front of the Presidium gates.

When they met the gates of the Harmonic headquarters, Yuriy got to watch his hero, Father Men, pass through.\n\nThat had been the first time Yuriy had approached the Politburo. Today was the second. Rumor was that Father Men had convinced Buckharin to step down, and that the nation would soon be a land of humans once more. The energy was palpable in the audience, save for the few fearful ponies who had bothered to appear in person. The time had come for humanity to properly return.\n\nWhen Buckharin trotted to the balcony, the crowd cheered, not in celebration but simply raw excitement. Yet the Chairman shared none of their energy. Standing alongside Alexander Men, Buckharin's speech was short and bland, simply noting the flaws of Harmony and his excitement at the direction that the new leader would take the nation.\n\nThen, Buckharin paused. For just a moment, Yuriy registered something on Buckharin's long face - disappointment. It didn't matter, Yuriy assured himself. Yet something about it still felt cruel. Buckharin had done everything for Russia, even transforming himself into a magical horse, yet he could never tame the nation. Despite everything, his story would end with one last failure.\n\nFinally, Buckharin gave the announcement everyone was waiting for - he would be stepping down. Yuriy finally gave himself a moment to consider the finality of this moment. Around him, a massive crowd cheered with glee."

Then, one of those pony delegates, one Semyon Trotakovsky, stood up to speak directly to Buckharin, "Chairman Buckharin, I and several of my fellow delegates have elected to present you with a simple demand. That demand is to officially recognize ponies as the only legitimate citizens of Russia and to declare humanity an inferior race beneath ponykind."\n\nBuckharin was shocked by the ludicrous demand, and he could feel the color drain from his face. He was even more shocked to see over a dozen other delegates nodding along to the proposal! Buckharin could barely stutter out a response, "W-What? How could I ever approve of such a thing, of a proposal that goes against every core tenet of harmony?"\n\nIt was not Trotakovsky that responded, but Valentina Vsadnik, another pony delegate, "If you can't recognize the necessity of such actions, then you have no business governing over your fellow ponies!"\n\nTrotakovsky added onto Vsadnik's outburst, "This choice will have dire consequences, Chairman," and with that he began to move towards the door. Vsadnik and a significant number of pony delegates followed behind him.\n\nBuckharin could muster no words as they exited the room, and he soon felt a pit begin to form in his stomach."

 OMO_aprilfools.14.desc: "Adam Avianosets had once been a true believer in Harmony, and an ardent supporter of Buckharin. However, with each passing year, the unicorn had only proved himself to be more and more disconnected from the needs of his most loyal followers. Ponies were no longer safe in the country they had built with their own hooves, with their own sweat and blood. That's why Adam had been eager to join in with his fellow Pink Army members in a march on the Supreme Soviet.\n\nWhen the plan had been initially concocted, they had expected some support, but not nearly as much as they ended up receiving. The main avenue of Irkutsk was soon dominated by Pink Army members and dozens of like-minded civilian ponies, chanting for the ousting of the delegates in the Supreme Soviet, and an end to human dominance over the Union. As they approached the headquarters, the garrison moved to block their advance. Behind them stood General Shramy, the purple Thestral easily recognized by the stuffed zebra he always carried around with him.\n\nThe crowd grew silent, and some of the demonstrators readied their weapons. They didn't want a fight, but they certainly weren't going to back down now, even if the garrison was mostly fellow ponies themselves. All eyes turned to General Shramy, who remained silent for what felt like an eternity. Finally, he gave an order, "Men, stand down."\n\nWith that order given, the garrison parted like the Red Sea before the demonstrators, and Adam and the rest of the ponies cheered."

 OMO_aprilfools.15.desc: "Buckharin's eyes sprang open as the loud banging at the door penetrated his slumber. Before his mind could even register that he was awake, the door was ripped from its hinges, and a half-dozen pony soldiers barged into the Chairman's bedroom. Buckharin could do nothing more than stumble out of bed, and he came face-to-face with the leader of the soldiers: General Lili iz Doliny.\n\nA thousand thoughts swam around in Buckharin's head, all of them bad. His heart hadn't beat this rapidly since he had heard news of Barbarossa, over twenty years ago, "W-What is going on, General? What is all of this?!"\n\nGeneral Doliny's face was unreadable to the unicorn's sleepy eyes as he searched for any hope to grasp onto in her expression. He found no such solace, however, and his hope only further eroded as she spoke, "Chairman Nikolai Buckharin. You are hereby under arrest for crimes against pony-kind. Please do not resist."\n\nThe soldiers then moved to apprehend Buckharin, and he could do nothing to fend them off in his current state. He hardly had time to even process what General Doliny had said. A black bag was thrown over his head and horn, and he was soon forced to march out of the room.\n\nWhere he was headed he did not know."

 OMO_aprilfools_warlord.1.desc: "Nikolai Bukharin's first thought was that he was dead.\n\nIt was not the first time he'd felt this way. Life since the Great Patriotic War had been one of endless calamities, of loss and suffering. In the years since his secret exile to Siberia, he'd narrowly avoided many deaths. It was only logical that his luck had finally run out, that he'd succumbed like so many before him.\n\nBut if he was dead, why was he so giddy? Why could he still feel the roar of the fire and the gentle touch of snow? Why did his body feel so strange?\n\nBukharin tried to think. He could remember shivering and lighting the bonfire. He could remember the gleam of some rock or gem among the coals, its glow otherworldly. He'd reached out to grab it, to understand, only for... Pain. Agony. The sloughing of skin and warping of bone. He might have screamed too if not for the vision.\n\nAmid the pain, he'd seen a world unlike any he'd ever known. He'd seen a society of creatures, happy and harmonious, free and equal, unburdened by suffering. They lived together as equals, as allies, as friends. These strange beings, trotting around and dressed in bright technicolor, existed in a society more perfect than any dictatorship of the proletariat could create.\n\nBukharin felt himself giggle in a high-pitched voice he didn't recognize. He opened his enormous eyes and rose on all four of his hooves. He stood there before a smoldering heat until he caught sight of the crystal still there among the coals and the strange creature reflected in it. Without understanding why, he exclaimed:"

When he got hold of the food, it was cloudy. Anatoly dismissed the clouds, thinking that there was nothing likely to come of it.\n\nHow wrong he was.\n\nOut of nowhere, it began to snow. First it came down like in the stereotypical pictures of a winter wonderland. Then it came down harder... and harder... and harder.\n\nEventually, Anatoly was lost. He struggled through the storm, clutching his rucksack close to him, but was unable to find any landmark. The minutes wore on and became hours, and he increasingly lost the will to continue. Perhaps... Perhaps it would just be better to give in.\n\nJust as Anatoly was about to collapse, a mysterious figure appeared in front of him. Its voice concerned, it ushered him to a house that slowly emerged out of the snow as he walked towards it. Warmed up, with a cup of soup in his hands, Anatoly shook his head and looked at the figure more closely.\n\n...Wait a thrice-damned moment! That wasn't a human, it was... a talking horse! A pony! Said talking horse was setting out a meal for him and his guest. Anatoly's head was spinning. Wait a moment. He knew that face from somewhere.\n\nWas that... "Bukharin?

 OMO_aprilfools_warlord.3.desc: "Alexei Rykov scanned through the contents of the letter in front of him endlessly. Joy he had not known since what felt like an eternity coursed through his veins when the letter had first arrived, after all, it was a letter from his old friend Bukharin whom he had not heard from in decades, yet as he kept reading through it, a sense of eeriness descended upon him as a bizarre discrepancy revealed itself.\n\nThe name "Bukharin" was spelt as "Buckharin" in both the letter's address and sign-off, an unintended mistake it could very possibly be, but Rykov couldn't fathom the idea that the Paramount Leader of the USSR could somehow misspell his very own name twice, no matter how heavy the toll age takes on him could be.\n\nWas this all some twisted joke? A cruel mockery of an old man and his desire to reconnect with a long-lost friend? No, no, it couldn't possibly be. The letter described the dearest moments of their friendship in vivid detail, details only Rykov and Bukharin, could know.\n\nRykov sat on his couch, veering on the edge of tears. A day had passed since the letter's arrival, but poor Rykov remained ever-confused. All of a sudden, the faintest sound of thumping can be heard coming from the front door. Rykov hesitantly approached the door, wondering who could be the person making such a ruckus at an hour this late.\n\nWas it the knocking he had dreamt to hear once again? The anticipated arrival of his elusive comrade? He crept the door slightly open, getting a glance at the indecipherable silhouette standing behind it. He opened the door further. Suddenly, he recoiled back. To his shock and utter horror, what stood in front of him, despite having the distinguishable facial features of his old friend Nikolai Bukharin, was not human. But rather it... or he, was a pony."

They had given up families and homes and careers for the delusional hope that Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Nikolai Bukharin had returned to restore the Union.\n\nThen Bukharin had turned out to be some kind of deformed horse.\n\n"Comrades," shouted the four-legged beast, his budenovka crooked over what appeared to be a horn. "Revolutionary ideals cannot end at the state. Overcoming capitalist predation means embodying Marxist ideals in our everyday lives, in our relationships. We must be vanguards in a revolution of friendship!"\n\nThere was silence across the room as the one-time Soviet leader finished. Then, in a harsh whisper, one of the communist travelers whispered. "This... can't possibly be serious, can it?"\n\nThere was another pause. "I don't know, Elena. Engels did write about the bourgeois and proletarian household. I suppose it's... sensible for us to be aware of exploitation in all human relat—."\n\n"In friendship? You heard the talking horse talk about friendship, correct?" Elena Panova looked around the room, alarmed at the number of people nodding along and echoing the horse's points. "We're sure that thing is Nikolai Bukharin?"\n\nHer companion shrugged. "He could be a little green man for all I care. I've never been one to follow the crowd but if he has ideas on how to save the Soviet Union..." He watched as the horse-man mingled with his audience.

Every so often, one of them would stumble in from the cold, see the bright pink banners, and immediately turn around. Standing among throngs of other Russian delegates, Elena wondered if they had the right idea.\n\n"Big turnout, eh comrade?" Said a voice. Elena turned, only to be shocked by the sight of Bukharin or... Buckharin. He was brown, standing about four feet tall, and had eyes so enormous that Elena could see most of the room reflected in them. She stifled a groan.\n\n"Yes," she said with all the politeness she could muster. She could not believe she was here. She could not believe she'd abandoned Comrade Yagoda at the mere hint that Bukharin still lived. "I suppose all of us were... interested in learning... about..."\n\n"Harmony?" said Buckharin, the once-esteemed communist leader turned horse. His tail swished back and forth. "Indeed, the Motherland has been listless these past few years, carved up by despots and madmen. Only truly radical thought can save it. Only by embracing the power of friendship can we save the Soviet Union!"\n\nElena's eyes swiveled back toward the door, to the freezing cold outside. It would be so easy to run away now, to disappear back among Yagoda's staff or to throw it all away and become a reindeer herder. But she couldn't bring herself to do it. As deranged as this talking animal and his talk of friendship was, it at least offered the slim possibility of success. Elena let loose a pained sigh."

As he surveyed the newly created chamber, from which crystal returns were even higher than in other parts of the mining complex, he heard a new sound: the lighter click of hooves on crystal that signaled an unequipped pony walking up to his side.\n\n"How goes the excavation, Pavel?" Vladimir asked, coming to a stop at Pavel's shoulder, "The Congress wants - nay, needs this to go smoothly." Vladimir had been a childhood friend of Pavel's, and now that he was one of the top ranking ponies working in the mines. The two got to collaborate extensively on the job, and while Pavel couldn't say that he thought the ponification was wholly normal yet, his friend was still his friend, no matter what form he took.\n\n"Things are coming along well! There are certainly some points of production that can still be improved, but overall I suspect that the Congress will find what we've done here sufficient."\n\nWith that, the friends turned back to the sprawling mass of ponies and humans before them, all contributing in a way suited to their talents. Humans worked at the walls, slowly extracting the crystals for the ponies to move out of the floor. Watching over this were the unicorns, able to manipulate the very rocks around them with their minds. No one could argue with having bosses that actually made your job easier. All of this was enshrined in the queer, sparkling light cast by industrial lighting reflecting off of the crystals that shone throughout the room."

They flowed through the valleys, along the rivers, around the trees, and finally into the small camp, one of society's farthest outposts at the very edges of the world.\n\nSonia woke to the sound of wood being chopped; the day had already begun, and she was still bundled up tight in her tent. After quickly preparing for the day, she exited her tent and was greeted by the glare of sunlight on freshly fallen snow. She marveled at the feeling of snow on her hooves, a strange but not entirely uncomfortable touch that felt soft, cool, and refreshing. Sonia had only chosen to be ponified right before she departed for the sake of her division, an equal balance of ponies and humans the ideal formation for exploring the Siberian wilderness.\n\nHer commander walked up to her, their mission held in his hands. They had been given three devices that could direct one to the location of crystals, much like the divining rods of old. On any other day, the crystals held in these devices gave out a slight glimmer, mostly unnoticeable in the light of day. However, what her commander held in his hands was glowing brightly, showering his body in soft purple light.\n\n"Sonia, I'm glad you're awake!" His smile was genuine, but tired. "It turns out we happened across what we've been looking for without even knowing it. It seems this campsite is directly above a crystal deposit."\n\nSonia rejoiced internally for a moment, but quickly realized something was off. The crystal detectors should have been blaring yesterday, but they had only given off somewhat more light last night. Them not detecting anything would indicate that the crystals nearby were covered. Then she saw him, and it all came together. Draped across a makeshift bed next to a partially dug ditch lay her friend, Yakov. Unlike last time she had seen him, he was now a fellow pony."

He already felt overwhelmed by the integration of ponies into everyday society. Then he had learned that his first job under the new Northern Siberian government was to work in a newly-discovered crystal mine - alongside these ponies. Thus, he found himself squeezed between two strange creatures after hopping in a truck destined for the mines.\n\nAs the truck began rattling along the dirt roads, it was quiet as a tomb, the only sounds made by the vehicle and the occasional shuffling of men and ponies. Eventually, the silence was broken by one of the younger men who had yet to work on a large scale project like this. He raised a question of technique which Maksim was well versed in, but as he opened his mouth to answer the pony beside him spoke up.\n\nIt turned out that he had misjudged the ponies - both in age and in experience. The one to his right was an old hand in the business and had volunteered to be ponified to help the streamlining of inter-species operations. The one to his left was a veteran of the West Russian War. After being one of the first turned, he was one of the few security personn... ponynnel tasked to this project.\n\nFor all the oddities that Maksim still couldn't get over, it was huma... ponynizing to hear their stories and mentor the younger amongst their group together.

The overseer, a placid and average pony, spent more time managing wealth than welfare. Only on occasion would he walk around the premises, making certain his workers continued to toil. Most hours, he sat in his room, enjoying the silence of his high-up office.\n\nFor months, he began his morning the same way - closing the blinds and reading through the daily paper. Today, there was bad news, as always. The Chairpony had another round of regulations for his industry - The Crystal Miners' Trade Union. Getting workers was already hard enough - how could he deal with them now?\n\nSuddenly, the overseer heard noise outside. Thinking it a minor squabble, he attempted to return to his newspaper, but it only grew more distinct and harmonious, louder than even earmuffs could silence. It sounded like chanting.\n\nFrustrated, the overseer opened his blinds. Finally, he could see his crew. Hundreds of workers had gathered below his office, men and ponies, screaming and waving signs. Someone, seemingly the new union representative, was shouting demands, but the overseer ignored it for now. That could be handled later. What mattered was, they weren't working - and they were ruining his morning.\n\nThe overseer grabbed a bullhorn from his desk and cranked open the window. "Fine, fine!" he shrieked to the crowd.

Frankly, the work was more brain than brawl, especially given the bright glimmer of the crystals. The only hiccough was morale. With protests raging in the center of the mining encampment, there was no way to avoid the nature of the work. The overseer could only call these men "temporary workers" for so long. These men were scabs - and with the protest raging, they certainly knew it.\n\nBy the time the new crew was ready to enter the mines, most had accepted their place. Only one nervous worker stayed behind, suddenly struck with a pang of guilt. In a brief moment of defiance, he turned to his boss. "What stops us from joining the protestors?"\n\nConfused, the overseer took a moment to answer. "Nothing really, though they probably hate you for the scab work. I'll just find some more workers. Up north, there's a lot of you and not many of me - remember that before you ask another stupid question."\n\nThe stallion stared at his new boss in disbelief.

Wait wha-" Sergei barely had time to question what was happening as a gunshot rang out, and a bright flash illuminated the barn. When Sergei could see again, he saw that the crystal was gone. In its place was what appeared to be a floating, glowing ring. The ring acted as a window, showing a view of an entirely different setting from the small barn the group of scientists sat in.\n\nThen a thing flew through the portal. It was shaped like an orb, with two pairs of wings and four legs. It had large, compound eyes like an insect. Then the glowing ring disappeared with a small "plop" sound. After several minutes of screaming, crying, and drunken shooting, Alexei managed to get it trapped in the crate of vodka they had emptied out. Ivan summed up everyone's thoughts pretty succinctly once they had all calmed down, "What the fuck was that?"\n\n"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not from Earth," replied Sergei.

On one half sat humans, Russians, veterans of innumerable conflicts and hardships, still covered in the scars from bullets, bayonets, bombshells and every other method humanity had of inflicting cruelty on its own kind. They shouted and yelled when they saw the other half of the assembly, demanding that the farcical "council" they were being subjected to cease immediately.\n\nOn the other end, sitting on their back ends despite having four hooves, were an assortment of brightly coloured ponies of all varieties. They too were shouting, though somehow it seemed less aggressive, insisting that the way forward was by accepting the aid and ideals of the ponies and bringing "Harmony" to Russia, by accepting ponification as they had.\n\nIn the middle of this roaring crowd sat a tired-looking chestnut-coloured pony. For a moment the despair overtook him, and the shouting and yelling faded away into the background as his eyes glazed over and his mind cast back to those terrible days when the Union had first fallen. His Union. Then he remembered what he had seen, what he had felt, when he assumed his new form. The pain melted away like snowflakes in the sunlight, and the vital energy that had brought him to power in Moscow the first time returned. He would not fail now. Commanding the will to make miracles happen, his horn glowed with power as he magically amplified his voice, and turned to face the gathering.\n\n"Comrades! The time is long past for arguing and squabbling. We lost that right long ago when the bombs first fell, when the steel and bloodlust of the Germans shattered all we had fought so hard to build.

Believe it or not, my friends, but it is true - Friendship is Magic! And this will be the magic that finally saves Russia - perhaps the whole world!"\n\nThe hall fell silent.

The thought could not escape his mind that he was about to make the worst mistake of his life, that he would experience some kind of horrific nightmare as his flesh melted and reconfigured and irreversibly disfigured itself.\n\nThe pony laughed. "I would tell you that it doesn't hurt, that I got used to this almost instantly. But to be honest, does that even matter? How much did you achieve as a human - the loss of the Communist movement, the loss of Russia, the loss of your home, the loss of whatever scraps were left. We have a chance, man. We must make the sacrifice once more, this time of our human form. But the dream survives - of a world founded on peace and harmony, of all beings working towards the common goal of progress, free from the death grip of greed. This magic gives us the power to fight one final time, in a new body perhaps, but with strength, speed, and gifts you never had as a human. What do you say?"\n\nGrigoriy held the crystal, feeling its cool, smooth hardness against the rough calluses of his palm. He had fought endlessly - from Poland, to Ukraine, to Moscow, always retreating, retreating into the furthest corners that could be reached. Years of shelling and malnutrition had sapped whatever strength remained in his human frame, and now as a hunched-over shell he attended Buckharin's council as a representative of what little remained of the Russia of old. In the deep purple of the crystal, almost mocking him, the reflection of a drained man stared back into his eyes.\n\nHe made up his mind. The reflection vanished as brilliant sparks of energy shot from the crystal in great veins, first into his heart, then spreading to every part of his body. In an instant, it was done.\n\nMagic surged to his new horn as he felt new strength in his legs. It would take a little getting used to. But already, the future seemed brighter."

Perhaps what was being argued was nonsense, but the nature of man never seemed to change - even if the form did.

But of course, pony or not, they could and always would have a cold one or two after a long day and remember about the time long past when they were still young and wild, and the world had so much to offer.\n\nSergei had regained his body and vitality, even if his mind was old, and it was a testament to his will that he could stand amongst the idealistic youths that had signed up in droves to accept the 'Offer' and not seem out of place. So, of course, he tried one more time. And of course, Nikolai knew that it was not for him.\n\nSo they talked of other things, and still laughed."

Without a friendship vanguard, supreme over all others, the security and unity of purpose of the new state cannot be guaranteed!"\n\n"Friendship vanguard! So the butchers and tyrants will call themselves our best friends now, before they fire the killing shot!" As the smoke of endless cigarettes swirled around his head and blocked out the already dim lightbulb, Buckharin thought wearily how some people never seemed to tire to speculate endlessly how society ought to be ordered, down to every last detail, before they had even lifted their hindquarters out of their chairs.\n\n"Gentlemen - and ponies - we are missing the point. Harmony does not refer to how society is ordered, it refers to why it is ordered. Rather than exploiting our fellow beings, we work with them, with the knowledge and trust that they work with us too."\n\nSeveral heads of different types looked at each other, confused. "Surely this is just the end goal of communism itself? What does 'Harmony' add to this equation?"\n\nFor a moment Buckharin had no answer. It was a good question. Then he began.\n\n"From the very beginning, our means, method, and end must be friendship. When we reach out to the public, we seek to genuinely befriend them, one by one, and only then ask in the spirit of comradely humility if they wish to help us in the creation of this new society. Forget workers' councils, or a vanguard party, or anything else - our fundamental units are drinks shared after work, birthday parties, shoulders to thump when you cry laughing and hold when you are simply crying. Even if they lack our ideological convictions, friendship comes first. That is what I mean. The rest can come later.""

They wouldn't be able to express themselves very well if you asked them, but it was rather simple:\n\nBecause their parents were happy for the first time in a long time.\n\nNo more were their faces long with sadness, nor their brows furrowed with worry.\n\nThey were more cheerful than they had been for as far back as their kids could remember, actually.\n\nThere were other reasons to be happy, too.

It had worked well enough for Nikolai as he reestablished order in the Northeast, after all - but, alas, sometimes people were simply unwilling to talk.\n\nSo, left with no other choice, Buckharin signed the decree and had it sent to the Politburo for their signatures; they agreed on it and sent it back to him, at which point he ordered it disseminated.\n\nThe next day, the people of the Harmonious Union - humans and ponies alike - awoke to messages indicating the creation of the Armed Forces of the Harmonious Union, or as it would be called more colloquially,"

Normally at this point, he would begin isolating those that were weak, vacillating, or otherwise seemed unsure of what they were doing, and give them an enemy to hate and a reason to be motivated.\n\nHowever, how were you supposed to do such a thing with talking, pastel horses? For all he knew they might trample him if the shouting got too loud. Finally he stopped overthinking, roared obscenities at them all, and together they marched to the 'playground' - the area where their physical abilities would be tested. At least here would be familiar ground.\n\nFirst were the unicorns. They lost their breath running around the field within ten minutes, but when it came time to test their marksmanship, they were almost all crack shots. More importantly, they held the guns aloft with glowing magic - which they could also use to lift heavy equipment, vault themselves over the climbing wall, and a whole host of other things. As they carried on, the drill instructor noted every detail he observed, and began mentally drafting the combat roles they would be perfect for.\n\nNext were the pegasi. With wings, running around the course was irrelevant - so instead he had the most promising unicorn levitate several hoops, and made them fly increasingly complicated maneuvers until they collapsed with exhaustion. Living planes - perfect for paratroopers, carrying supplies to the front, and recon.\n\nFinally came the bulk of the recruits, who had been waiting nervously and watching. Earth ponies - no special abilities that were immediately apparent, but clearly built differently as they continued marching, climbing, digging and training continuously, with no breaks, until the sun began to set. And they could still do more.\n\nAs he sat back in his office enjoying the quiet moments once the day's training had concluded, the drill instructor realized that he had been given the perfect material to make an army with."

Even as the ponies laughed, the humans marched on. They had been determined to keep their form, and they would not let it hold them back.\n\nSlowly, bit by bit, the humans first began catching up to the earth ponies, then matching their pace. When they could not, they still ran till they collapsed - and then their comrades stopped and carried them to the finish line. Finally it struck the ponies - their goal was not just to join the army and become a purely military unit.\n\nIt was to become a unit of Harmony - and if these men were not following its ideals in their truest sense, then who was? Then they realized their folly, and after apologizing, began competing twice as hard.

Despite her exasperation, she picked up the pen.\n\n"How?!"\n\n"They don't even have fingers! This should be impossible!"\n\nBlanket put the pen down.

Daniil blinked, realising he was the only one within earshot, and nonchalantly leaned closer to his compatriot to respond.\n\n"A, uh... A what?" The two soldiers had been sent out to collect weapons being donated to the army. Producing weaponry was a challenge in the Siberian Wastes, so scrounging up any existing weapons wasn't a bad idea, surely?\n\nThis logic lasted right up until they actually saw the armaments the villagers had gotten together. And what armaments they were. Among the motley crew of guns, there was an extremely rusty PPSh that immediately split into two upon inspection, a Mosin Nagant with both barrel and stock sawn-off - which wasn't so bad until you realised whoever had done it had done a shoddy job and left a sharp torn barrel and a splintery stock for the user, multiple disused Fedorov Avtomats surely from the 20's Civil War, an RPD - No, sorry, an AK-47 which has multiple bits of wood and metal nailed and welded to it until it sort of looked like an RPD - and, the prize of the piece, the long wooden rifle that Artemy was holding and called...\n\n"A Jezail. Afghani tribesmen used them against the British. It's a damn musket." Artemy tersely spoke as he scanned the broomstick handle dressed as a gun. Daniil nervously rubbed the back of his neck under the observant eyes of the villagers, trying to find a positive.\n\n"Well... Does it... Mm, does it shoot?" Daniil's question caused Artemy to pause in his examination, then proceeding to grab up the ammo - gunpowder and a ball - and load the weapon. Without warning, he took aim at a nearby tree and fired. It did so with a large black puff of smoke and a thundercrack, and as the smoke cleared, it was clear it had hit the target dead-on. Artemy took a deep breath, and turned to face the villagers."

The Fifth Revolutionary Brigade was one of the first units of the Pink Army to be made up of both species living in the Union, and as such Genrikh felt as if it was their duty to prove that harmony could triumph even at war.\n\nMoving out, Genrikh and two other ponies, both unicorns, stalked their way through the underbrush. Hearing a rustle ahead, he raised a hoof calling to halt, cautiously raising his pellet gun into the air. A small ermine shot out of the bushes, chittering in its wake, and the group sighed in relief.\n\nA sudden hail of pellets exploded around them, cutting any relief short. The pony to Genrikh's left was hit, and he moved her gently around the lip of a small mound. He raised his head to peek above, but had to duck to avoid taking a round to the face. "We're cut off!" he shouted into his mic, "We need help!"\n\nA second voice crackled over the radio. "Just a moment."\n\nThe storm of pellets was cut off by a series of shouts and distant bangs, and then silence fell once again.

The womenfolk of the village had all huddled in the centre place, holding each other for warmth and comfort.\n\nThen, from the skies dropped three ponies with wings - pegasi - who launched from the ground like bullets and sped around the bandits, confusing them. Shots rang from the forest, causing the captain in a fit of rage to fire a shot at the man he had been aiming at. But before his shot found its mark, it was suspended in mid-air, surrounded by a glowing aura - magic.\n\nWith a sound like endless thunderclaps, the earth ponies rushed out from the trees, firing accurately at the bandits. Just behind them were humans, wearing the uniform of the Harmonious Union, charging at the devils with bayonets or helping the villagers escape. It was all over in less than ten minutes.\n\nThose bandits that had not immediately dropped to the ground and soiled their pants rushed back into the forest, dropping everything they had looted in their haste.

Its bulbous face stretched into a smile. "I trust my theories, my contributions to Lenin, have been to your satisfaction?"\n\nElena gazed into the abyss that was the creature's eyes. For weeks, she'd listened as Buckharin recited empty platitudes about friendship. For weeks, she'd watched the creatures uncover materials and weapons that could not exist. The worst part was the transformations. Serious, credible revolutionaries met Buckharin and emerged on all fours, rictus grins on their faces.\n\n"Unforgettable," Elena heard herself say.\n\nThe thing wearing Bukharin's skin laughed.

The map was about as detailed an approximation of the borders of the region's various governments and warlords as one could get in their situation, which wasn't saying much.\n\nBlyukher had been speaking, and Buckharin realized he had been lost in thought staring at the dozens of towns and cities on the map, "... that is why securing a unified frontline is of paramount importance. Both our manpower and ponypower reserves are too small to staff multiple active fronts," Buckharin and the other ministers nodded.\n\nPonyina added onto Blyukher's point, "The fleet in Kamchatka is also ideal because of its past ties to the Soviet Union. While Yumashev and his men will surely be somewhat disillusioned with that past, we can surely remind them of their loyalties and convince them to join our new cause," Buckharin saw nothing objectionable in either statement, and the rest of his ministers nodded along in agreement.\n\nBuckharin addressed the entire table, "Well, if there are no competing opinions, then I elect that we should send a delegation to Kamchatka and speak with Yumashev about joining the Harmonious Union.

With a small squeal of excitement, he had cupped it in his hands and rushed back home, enclosing it in a jam jar far older than he was. He spent an hour examining it fluttering about in there, occasionally dropping in little bits of grain which it devoured as fast as he could blink.

Within a moment, it was gone, practically plucked from his hand - and then the two bugs coughed, and there were four.

She was purple, with a dark mane streaked with red, and wore what Alexei could have sworn was Russian imperial regalia.\n\nAt the sound of the portal opening, she turned around, slowly. "Ah," she whispered, her voice hoarse as if from disuse, "I didn't realize that I'd be receiving visitors today. I wonder who they are. Could they be emissaries of Celestia and Luna, perhaps, to tell me that they'll be returning soon? Could they be, perhaps..." she turned suddenly, her eyes manic, "new friends?"\n\nAlexei felt himself swallow reflexively. "Close the portal."\n\nThe pony on the other side of the portal began to glow, walking slowly towards the assembled scientists. "The clock is ticking, after all. Celestia and Luna will return when everyone is friends again, including all of you!"\n\n"Close it!" Alexei shouted, slamming a hoof down on the emergency shutoff. The portal winked out of existence as quickly as it had opened, leaving the room in stunned silence. He opened his mouth, putting voice to the thought running on everypony's mind."

Not his to rule, but his in form and blood. Equestria, he'd seen it called on signs before. How fitting for a land without man, but with ponies. From his point of view in Siberia, it seemed like a modern Garden of Eden, where need and want were banished and pleasantries exchanged.\n\nAnd, like the Garden of Eden, it was closed off to him and his people.\n\nA portal would need to be made, but how? Surely it would involve these crystals in some fashion. Fission, perhaps? Or maybe something involving this nebulous magic which permeated his world. All he knew is that it had to have happened, that it had to be possible - how else would the first crystals have arrived on Earth? If nature could do it, then surely so could man and pony.\n\nHe turned to his scientists, the finest in all of Siberia. They were a varied bunch - some human, some pony - but they all seemed eager to hear his words. "Comrades." He began. "We stand on the precipice of a great breakthrough in our history. With your minds, we shall create a connection to Equestria, establishing harmony and inexorably linking our two worlds.

The sensation was not quite a taste, not quite a smell, not quite a sound but an amalgamation of all three. It made his mind feel foggy, as if there was a disconnect between his mind and the rest of his body. And yet despite how unusual the sensation felt, it felt strangely familiar to Genrikh. It reminded him of his transfor-\n\nBefore he could finish that thought, Genrikh was through the portal. In between the tall trees that surrounded him, Genrikh could see the rest of his squad. His sister Masha was chewing taffy while looking at the trees with a relaxed look. Daniil and Valentin were setting up the radio, trying to get in contact with someone from Stalliongrad. And finally there was Lieutenant Valukova, pacing across the forest floor biting her nails, shadowed by the diplomat named Kirill. No one seemed comfortable in this new world. It was as if they were worried the trees would start walking or the skies would reign down fire. So the Brigade waited in uneasy silence for Valentin to find a signal.\n\nThe pair was continuing to tinker with the radio when a voice sprang out from the machine. The static still remained but a few words were audible. Ambush. River. Griffons. Genrikh perked up upon hearing that last word. From the debriefing the Brigade received before the mission, Genrikh knew that griffons were greedy hybrids of eagles and lions, implacable foes of both Harmony and Communism. Suddenly, the sound of gunfire burst through the air, emanunting about three miles to north-west. Upon hearing this, Lieutenant Valukova ordered the Brigade forward, marching straight towards the gunfire and to the rescue of the Stalliongrad soldiers under assault by griffons."

Masha's spell didn't and the griffon went down with a squawk.\n\nGenrikh glanced around for another enemy but he could find none in range. The few remaining griffons were taking to their wings and fleeing, weaving through the pine trees to avoid the spellfire. Lieutenant Valukova gave the order to cease fire and with that, Genrikh closed his slumped body against a tree, sliding down until his haunch hit the forest floor. It was then that Genrikh noticed he had been shot, caught by a griffon's bullet in his left shoulder. Looking for anything to take his mind of the pain, Genrikh focused on the hoofsteps he heard around him.\n\nA particular pair of hoofsteps grew louder and Genrikh could feel in the air that someone was next to him. Opening his eyes, Genrikh was greeted by an unfamiliar filly with a tattoo of a trumpet on her haunch. The filly paused for a moment before saying, "I don't know who you are, stranger, but you and your friends helped us out when we really needed it. Thank you."\n\nThe filly reached out a hoof to Genrikh and after a moment, Genrikh brought out his right hoof to shake it.

Genrikh said teasingly.\n\nThe filly gave a smirk in response but before she could reply with words the crowded transport truck came to a halt. Seeing the other soldiers from Stalliongrad exit the back of the truck, Genrikh followed them out and looked around. The trucks had deposited them in a snow covered field, surrounded by tall buildings that reminded Genrikh of Irkutsk. To his right was an especially tall building, topped with a gigantic statue of a pony.\n\nSneaking up beside him, the filly yelled into Genrikh's ear "That one's called the Palace of Soviets." Returning the smirk he received earlier, Genrikh looked across the field to try and spot his squadmates. He spotted Masha sharing taffy with two Stalliongrad ponies. Valentin, who had probably never seen a pony before, was being swarmed by native ponies. And Lieutenant Valukova was conversing with a dark coated pony with a blonde mane, who also had a pair of bat wings.

Creative Spark and Father Men jerked up in their seats, surprised by the uncharacteristic outburst. "I've had it up to here with the constant arguments! Comrade Men, respectfully, you've said that you want humanity to have a place in the Harmonious Union, and I've heard much the same from you Comrade Spark. If the two of you would stop trying to talk over each other and simply listen to one another, you might be able to find common ground!"\n\nCreative Spark and Father Men looked at each other with a new light in their eyes.

Despite, ostensibly, the same person being in charge - though one could hardly call him a person any more. Nikolai Bukharin, Chairman of the Soviet Union, had become a horse. Danyl laughed out loud just thinking of it - Bukharin had become a horse, and had taken control of Russia once again. What next? Lenin returns, as a squirrel? Marx writes a new book, but no one can read it because he wrote it with paws.\n\nFor all the nonsense surrounding his circumstances, however, it was certainly true that they were much better than they had been last time. Danyl had been a young man who thought he could hold the entire weight of the world on his shoulders - shoulders that had nearly broken under the heavy load of concrete and wires. Now, as an electrical engineer approaching his fiftieth birthday, he could appreciate the considerable compromises Buckharin had included for this new Siberian Plan. Less taxing work hours. Better pay. Magically built resthouses with modern amenities. He had even been able to meet directly with the planners and discuss what he might need with them - and they had all gone out for drinks afterwards.\n\nSmall things like this had slowly but surely made the previously unfathomable ranks of the intelligentsia and bureaucracy - formerly faceless entities - seem like real people, perhaps even potential friends."

Whether they were on two legs or four, it did not matter.\n\nIrina Yershova, teacher of Classroom 3-B, thought that she had been assigned possibly the most precocious children in all of Russia. They asked questions one would expect from a high-schooler in the same breath as singing kids' songs, and thought nothing much of it. But it was the question she received today from little Alyosha, who sang the most sweetly of all of them, that nearly bowled her off her feet. "Mrs. Yershova, why should we learn about friendship? If I am the richest, or the strongest, or the smartest, won't everyone do what I say anyways?"\n\n"My boy, if I knocked you on your head every time I wanted you to learn, how would you feel about me? If your friends hit you every time they wanted you to play with them, would you play with them anymore? In the past, many people - including many adults - used to think as you do, and the result was very many years of sadness endured by the people. Strength, and smarts are important - that's true. But the strongest, smartest thing of all is having friends you can trust. That is what we call the magic of friendship. Nothing can ever beat a people who are united in harmony.""

It was difficult to tell how much it was working.\n\n"Let me in - you must have seen me leave the Palace before. Admittedly, I flew out, but you cannot have missed me!

"Begone, beast! You have no place here - the sacred grounds holding the weight of all Japan!" The flowery language seemed very appropriate for a situation that came straight out of a fairy tale. The guard stared into the face of the magic pony with what he hoped was a brave face. If it did not back down, he would have to start pointing the gun - and who knew what that would lead to.

Almost sensing his boss reaching his limit, in came Buckharin's personal secretary, carrying a file. "Report you requested, sir - on the state of the wider communist movement. Shall I leave it on your desk?"\n\n"No, no, give it to me. I need a change of pace."\n\nThe file was almost immediately interesting. Naturally, the victory of the Fascists and collapse of the Soviet Union had not been kind to the movement - but it persisted all the same. Apart from the remnants of the West Russian government within the Motherland, communist encampments had survived on the periphery of China, as well as within Vietnam. In the western Republic of India, the communists formed a decently large and well organized party - and it appeared the eastern government had directly adopted rather leftist ideas itself. Looking further west, naturally no communist party had been able to operate in the open in Nazi- and Italian-dominated Europe, but South America and Africa had large and promising movements gathering steam. All they needed was support - and of course, a nudge in the right, harmonic, direction.\n\nInteresting. Very interesting. Buckharin failed to notice himself falling asleep as he chuckled contentedly, thinking grand thoughts of the revival of the global Communist-Harmonist movement.

Pearl finished checking her saddle-bags, filled with books and papers with red hammers and horseshoes stamped over them, "Why don't you get our boy?" She said to her husband.\n\n"Of course I-"\n\n"-need to talk to him. He's not himself recently. Not after realizing that we're going to have to move to Novosibirsk with the rest of the Supreme Soviet."\n\n"I'll take care of it, don't worry." Golden Star closed the trunk of the car and walked back into the house. Inside he saw his son, completely quiet, staring down at something he's levitating with his magic.\n\n"Rainbow?" He approached the young boy, and saw what he was holding. A picture of him along with other foals and human children.\n\n"Misha... Blue... Luka... Viktor," the boy let out a sniffle, "I'm... never going to see them again am I?" Star can hear the sorrow in his voice, "They have been my friends for years! How am I supposed to let them go this easily!?" Rainbow broke down into tears.\n\nGolden Star trotted closer and spoke, "Son, sometimes we have to let go of things that we love, but in the process, you can have much greater things." Star levitated the broken frame and continued, "Keep this picture, place it on a table in our new home, and collect many more pictures like this one. It's a big world out there, and there are many friends to be made. I believe in you."\n\nRainbow rubbed the tears off his face and stared at the picture his father held in the air. With his hoof, he picked it up and hugged his father."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.4.t: "The Gift of Giving"
 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.4.desc: "When the strange changes that accompanied Buckharin's new Russia came, Alexei took no notice. Life went on in his village as usual - cold, harsh, but normal. No one ever had enough, so the only way they could survive was through the goodwill and generosity of their fellow villagers - and Alexei, as the one with the most, usually tended to be the one who gave the most. Nothing about this seemed odd to him - it was just how he lived his life, giving being as natural as breathing.\n\nIt was definitely not natural, however, when while trying to lend his neighbor's son what little sugar he had left he found a pantry filled to the brim with neatly stacked sacks of high-quality export Cuban sugar - which of course meant that all his other stocks of food had vanished into the aether. Not that this mattered, because Alexei found that there now seemed to be no limit to his generosity - especially not the silly limits of things like the laws of physics or reality. Anything he wished to give, he found he could.\n\nVery briefly, the temptation to make mountains of gold or precious stones came - and went. It happened in a dream - a turquoise-hued vision of the power he had received, apparently because of his status as Generosity incarnate. At the end of the day, however, Alexei realized it made him happier simply to give candies to the children, help his neighbors fix their plows and tractors, and sometimes make a nice pot of high-quality tea for the lady across the street who had lost her husband in the war."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.5.desc: ""So- so what you're saying is that- that I go in there, and then poof! I'm a pony?"\n\nSergei Ivanov felt his smile begin to strain. "I just answered that question, comrade."\n\nHe sighed. He hadn't been one of the first to accept Buckharin's offer. He had been initially skeptical; give up one's humanity and become a living, breathing pastel horse? But as more of his friends took the offer, he saw how happy they became with their new forms, and he decided to join them. So when Buckharin put out a call for volunteers to bring his offer into the newly integrated regions of Central Siberia, Sergei knew that he needed to join.\n\nThe gentleman in front of him stunk of cheap beer. He had been pestering Sergei for the better part of the past half hour, asking about five or six questions on repeat, seemingly delighted with the answer each time. But as the man's elation grew, Sergei's patience continued to shrink.\n\n"The process is simple," he explained again, "You go in, touch the crystal, and you become the kind of pony that best matches your personality."\n\nThe man nodded. "I want to do it."\n\n"What?"\n\n"I- I want," the man hiccoughed, taking a swig from a flask before continuing, "I want to be a pony."\n\n"Comrade, you can't go back there like this! Buckharin's offer is open to everypony, but it's too important to make while you're too drunk to remember it!" Sergei hopped around the counter, nudging the man out the door."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.6.t: "A Siberian Sunset"
 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.6.desc: "Buckharin gazed over the city of Novosibirsk, bathed in fading light beneath an orange sky. As the sun descended ever closer towards the horizon, Buckharin's mind drifted away from the view before him.\n\nHis mind drifted instead towards those who had been lost along the way. Buckharin thought of Lenin, lost to sickness all those years ago, and of Rykov, tragically killed by an extremist. Thinking about Rykov's death still stung Buckharin, the wounds evidently too fresh to be prodded at.\n\nAs the sky shifted from orange, to pink, and then to a deep purple, Buckharin also thought of all the Bolsheviks lost, and the millions who have suffered in the past few decades. Ever since the Great Patriotic War, Russia had only known suffering and strife.\n\nWhen the sun had fully submerged beneath the horizon, and the city of Novosibirsk was bathed in the calm darkness of night, Buckharin resolved to never again let the people suffer the despair that all Russians have felt. Buckharin himself knew that despair all too well, the despair that set in ever since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nBuckharin turned away from the balcony, ready to do what was necessary."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.7.desc: ""20 seconds to the test. Please check your eye protection, comrades." The scientists in the bunker scurried around in front of Buckharin and the rest of the Politburo, conducting their final checks. Today was the day. Buckharin was no fan of the ultimate killing weapon - It was a vicious crime against nature that went against everything Harmony stood for - But if he was going to contend with the modern world and the other superpowers, this was a necessary evil to take part in. And today was the day of the test.\n\nFive, the murmuring came to a stop. Four. Three, Buckharin's hooves wrung together. Two. One-\n\nThe light was intense, even with the eye protection. Buckharin had no choice but to squint as it receded, leaving in its wake the vicious cloud of atomic fire. The shockwave rattled against the building as the cloud expanded, the top flattening out and folding into itself, creating the fabled mushroom shape. As the spectacle settled, the murmuring resumed. The scientists were pleased and, if nothing else, Buckharin and the Politburo were glad to see it had gone well instead of disastrously. Perhaps something in the back of Buckharin's head wanted it to fail, for them to not harness the-\n\nAnd then the second blast came. Buckharin didn't notice the cloud collapsing in upon itself until the scientists' startled raving brought attention to it, and everyone in the room could only watch as it compacted into a smaller and smaller shape in the distance before it rebounded. It was no mushroom cloud any longer, but a pulsing sphere of destructive purple energy that made the previous blast look like a pebble. Pure destruction. The silence was deafening. All Buckharin could hear was the low rumbling that the blast had left behind. What had happened? It wasn't supposed to be this powerful... Was it the crystals, had the magic increased the yield? The questions bounced around his head, but the words were barely able to escape his mouth."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.8.t: "Old Names from Old Times"
 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.8.desc: "Syktyvkar was more run-down than Buckharin remembered.\n\nHe certainly hadn't imagined it to be some glowing paradise - after all, it had been bombed for a decade and fought over for just as long - but the bullet-cracked concrete and occasionally shattered windows of the old apartments which still defiantly stood didn't add much to its beauty. Syktyvkar was a city which, thanks to the efforts of the Harmonious Union, could finally turn to a brighter future. A city which he had helped build into its modern form, after all. In a way, it was like a father seeing his child all grown up.\n\nHe was just beginning to consider that line of thought when he heard the quiet click of boots against pavement. A turn of his head told him who was coming up behind him - Blyukher, holding a letter in his right hand. The smile on his face was evident.\n\n"Good evening, Blyukher." Buckharin opened. "Someone's in a good mood. Is it the view?"\n\n"Partly, comrade." Blyukher returned, taking a position beside him. His eyes swept over the city before turning back to his Chairpony. "But I'm mainly here to give you this." He held the letter out to Buckharin, who took it with a hoof. He delicately tore it open and began to read the paper within.\n\n"You see, comrade, as we began moving west, I started hearing stories of your daughter becoming a political figure, if you can believe it. I'm sure you heard the same. Still, I ordered it to be looked into. We followed the trail as far as it would lead us, and we found that not only were the rumors true, but that she's somewhere..." He pointed out to the damaged city beyond. "...here."\n\nBuckharin wasn't listening. His eyes were glued to the paper, reading at a rapid pace. With a stifled gasp, his head shot up, eyes wide."

 OMO_aprilfools_superreg.9.desc: "Nikolai Buckharin had done many things in his life. He had crumpled under a nation's darkest hours, fleeing hopelessly into the Siberian tundra. He had subsisted meagerly in the wastes, hiding from his shame until he'd been blessed by the discovery of that fateful crystal. His struggle had led to great rewards-with magic and power, with the people's love, with honor.\n\nDespite all that, knocking on this door was the most terrifying thing he'd committed to in his life.\n\nThe raps of his hoof on wood rang out like gunshots, and he warily retreated a few paces. Her methods in hiding had taken days of the finest men and ponies in the NKGD to crack - he knew how it felt to retreat so thoroughly. Would she accept him, welcome him inside? Would she even recognize him?\n\nQuietly, the door cracked open a fraction of an inch. He could see a brown eye peek out, then widen to the size of saucers. With a creak, the door was pulled open the rest of the way, revealing-\n\n"Father?"\n\n"Svetlana, I-"\n\n"...you really are a horse." She put her hands over her mouth, eyes flicking up and down Nikolai's form.\n\n"An alicorn, my sweet." He tried to smile. "Are you well?"\n\n"Yes, I am. Would you like to..." Memories flooded him as she stumbled over her sentence-he had last seen her out the back of a truck thirty years ago. She had only been 17. She was older now, much older, but he recognized that stance, her voice, her eyes - it was his Svetlana. "Would you like to come in?""

"Where'd you get such a fine drink?"\n\n"It's from before the war." Svetlana responded, sipping her coffee as if to emphasize. "I only make some when it's a special occasion."\n\n"And this qualifies, I presume?" Buckharin replied, a light smile crossing his face. His daughter responded with a grin of her own. "Tell me more about Komi." He inquired. "You said you met Mikhail Andreyevich?"\n\n"Oh, yes, I did. And comrade Andrei Alexandrovich, and there was Svetlana Stalina-" Buckharin frowned on instinct at that name. "-she was not as barbaric as her father, but she was driven. And Komi-it was so chaotic, father, never a dull moment."\n\nBuckharin slid his saucer to the side. "Before I say any more, I just want to let you know how proud I am, Svetlana. You made yourself into somebody important, somebody courageous. Leader, warrior, comrade-it's a privilege to call you my daughter."\n\nSvetlana beamed, straightening in her seat. "I-I always knew you were out there, you know. And now I... see you here, in the flesh, and..." She trailed off. Buckharin said nothing. Instead, he reached into the pocket of his jacket, pulling out a crystal and setting it on the table. It glowed an electric purple in the afternoon light, drawing Svetlana in. When she looked back up, her eyes were mixed with fear, hope, excitement, worry. The old man took a deep breath before he continued.\n\n"You know what this means, yes? It would be a... big change. You will lose your current form. But you will gain friendship, magic, harmony... whatever you can imagine. The choice is yours, Svetlana-" he closed his eyes, and let out one more chuckle.

It is what enables individuals to look beyond their narrow self-interest. It is what animates people to achieve great things for the good of the collective. It is why the fascists exert so much effort in shattering bonds, in redirecting our desire for community and friendship toward hate, death, and destruction.\n\nI know how awkward and naive this must sound, how my ethos is like something straight out of an American pop song. But the banality of it does not make it any less true. Amid the indignity of poverty and exploitation, friendship has proven itself to be our greatest source of strength and comfort.\n\nI wish I could have taught you this in time. I wish I had known the depths of your despair. I wish I had seen you one last time at the Gala to tell you how much I valued your companionship, how your commitment to the Union reminded me of why I became Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Your words and actions reminded me that I could not just be a leader of ponies. I needed to be a leader for all peoples yearning for freedom amid oppression.\n\nWhat you did to Rykov cannot be undone. I cannot offer you easy absolution like some dissolute priest. No good friend would. But I will never stop hoping for your rehabilitation, for you to be transformed by your struggles and emerge stronger. When you are ready for that journey, I will be there to help you.\n\nUntil then, I will carry the memory of you in my heart."

For a region so sparsely populated, news emerging from the region at all is a shock. Even more shocking are the contents of these rumors.\n\nApparently the communities of Omolon have been taken over by a talking horse, and not just any horse, but a unicorn. They claim the creature leads a government preaching communism and harmony, and the stallion claims to be named "Nikolai Buckharin." Several experts on Russian affairs have chalked it up to mass hysteria, but the locals claim it's all the truth.\n\nThis journalist remembers when this paper was a reputable news source."

 OMO_aprilfools_news.2.desc: "An essentially incomprehensible development from the far east of what was once the Soviet Union.\n\nA "Harmonious Union" under Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin - or "Buckharin" as he apparently now calls himself in English - has pushed aside the squabbling NKVD remnants and the Harbin-expatriate warlords that seemed to have controlled the Russian Far East to seize control of that region. From Irkutsk to Magadan and beyond, the nation has now apparently... fallen under the control of not humans but brightly coloured... talking... horses, under the control of Buckharin, who now seems to have become a horse himself.\n\nLess sensible analysts in receipt of this news are queuing up at bars to drink themselves into a stupor. More sensible ones have gone for psychiatric observation. This journalist is planning to do both.\n"

 OMO_aprilfools_news.3.desc: "In an outcome that would lead to one being institutionalized if they had predicted it merely a decade ago, Nikolai Buckharin's Harmonious Union has reunified Russia. International observers are shocked, although most are quickly learning to accept this new reality.\n\nDespite of their differences, relations between humans and ponies are as peaceful as ever thanks to their believes of a new, radically idealistic ideology of Harmonic Communism. As the world watches, in equal measures bewilderment and fascination, word has begun spreading that the Harmonious Union prepares to march west and confront the Germans once and for all.

At this time, it appears no group has been able to coordinate efforts to stabilize the nation.\n\nChairman Nikolai Buckharin has not been seen in days, and his whereabouts continue to remain unknown to outside observers. Surprisingly, no riots of any kind were reported. The last of protesters, be it human or pony, seem to simply return to their homes and shut themselves off. The streets lie empty.

Now, usually it's just welcoming people in, gettin' their names, occupations, yadda yadda, but these last few days, it's been a tad different. Y'know, it's not just eggheads walkin' around, talking about their therapy sessions anymore, they're gettin' serious. Real serious. Some of 'em stopped showin' up kinda serious. Now, I'm not one to imply they're offing themselves, or nothing like that, but still, I'm gettin' worried. I overheard a few of 'em talkin,' and they said something about a "WMT", or somethin' like.

 OMO_2022_ferus_transcription_title.6: "Dr. Richard Hark #1 - I am going to hell for this"
 OMO_2022_ferus_transcription_desc.6: "§YDr. Richard Hark§!\nHello? Have we got this thing on? Right uhm. My name is Dr. Richard Hark. I currently hold the position of lead particle physicist within the §LGrey Hills§! facility within Kite County, Minnesota, United States. Of America. Now, I understand none of this can come to air, but if I don't speak to something, I'm gonna wind up speaking to someone. Not that that kind of- not that that kind of thing can happen, well with all the security's keeping us from leaving this fucking bunker.\n\nThey...\n\nThey brought in a specimen of a foal? A foal... a foal. Seemingly bearing stunted growth patterns, skin discolouration, proptosis, and...\n\nIt spoke to me. It fucking spoke to me. It looked at me with its bulging fucking eyes and it said "Hello". I don't know how long I stood there. For the shortest of goddamned moments, I thought it was a joke. Someone fucking with me. Apparently that wasn't the case unless God decided to pull one over on me because everyone else heard it, too. We... we had it euthanized. My orders. I don't even know what to fucking think. Once the thing was euthanized, security had it moved to biological research, and I've been left in the dark since. I'm expecting a report from them once they get a good idea of how it worked, exactly. How it managed to keep those fucking eyes from collapsing in on themselves... <sigh> The nervous system, as I understand it, will have been totally understood over the course of anywhere between few months to maybe a year or two, then we'll move on to further research, and get this stuff filed away. Somewhere deep. Until then, we're gonna write up reports on this thing until there's no more paper left for us to write on, by which point I'm sure we'll start to use the walls.\n\nI- I could've let it live. I could've. If this thing was intelligent we could'a asked it something, anything. We could have asked it where it came from, how it came to be, if it even knew. The thing clearly had control over its basic, and even full motor functions, the stuff horses don't usually, or supposed to have. Obviously. What could I've done, even then? It would've just told me of things that we already knew from asking our procurement teams, except security had us cut off- fuck! Goddamnit. No, no, they would've stopped me, security, or administration, or... someone. This thing had to have come from somewhere. I dunno. Its accent, it was foreign. It wasn't German, definitely not Japanese, it was a girl's, definitely, it was definitely Russian. I hadn't heard it before, but even then, it was bizarre. The pitch, it was all fucked up, like a- I don't even know. It could've been human if it weren't a horse, if that makes sense, and I fucking killed it. We gassed it, cyanide, and the poor fucking thing looked at me while it whimpered. I'm a fucking murderer. God- this thing- all of this flies in the face of everything I've taught- was taught. This is bullshit, that's what this is. This is fucking insane. I'm a fucking murderer, and I don't even know what I killed. I just hope this thing- no, no, I cannot think of that. Christ.\n\nI'm supposed to write a fucking report on this! To Nixon! What am I supposed to say? "Hello, Mr. President, horses talk now, thank you for the $400,000,000 budget"?! This is fucking insanity. I've gotta be insane. You know what? Sure. I've lost my marbles, I'm not playing with a full fucking deck. But I know what I saw. I'm not going to- I'm going to walk out of my therapist's office with a prescription to something or I'm going to weep at the death of sanity on God's greenest earth. I have been put here for one thing, and one thing only, and that is making sense out of whatever comes out of the backpocket of God. This, though. I can't be sure God's behind this one.\n\n§R=== END OF RECORDING ===§!"

 OMO_2022_ferus_transcription_desc.7: "§YDr. Richard Hark§!\nThis is Dr. Richard Hark, lead particle physicist within the §LGrey Hills§! facility. The day is Thursday, February 13th. The day before Valentine's Day. I am recording this message because— Christ.\n\nWe, uh, received another specimen.\n\nLike the previous specimen, the creature was a quadruped standing about four feet tall and weighing two hundred and fifty pounds. Though other scientists, myself included, have taken to describing these creatures as "foals," it is obvious that this term is inaccurate or, at the very least, misleading. Creatures bear only a passing resemblance to known species of horses. Eyes compose roughly two-thirds the space of the head. The legs, if you can call them that, are featureless stalks, devoid of musculature or hooves. In absence of fur, the... the flesh is a single, smooth surface. This is most frequently a bright pastel red.\n\nAnd as indicated on other recordings, they talk. Russian. Confirmed by outside experts, though that seemed self-evident from the outset.\n\nTranslator was acquired from... I don't know where. The Agency, I assume. Questioning followed normal procedure: Who are you? What is your name? What do you want? Et cetera.\n\nThe creature... The creature verbally indicated its name was Ilya. Aged 22. He claimed to be a citizen of the, uh... Horsegrad, which I assume is a mistranslation of some capacity. Arrived in the former Soviet Union by means of some kind of portal. Like a Looney Tunes cartoon, I'd imagine.\n\nWhere things went wrong is... when we asked why he was here, what his objective was.\n\nThe creature... indicated he wanted to get away from his home. He said that it was not safe. After we asked why it wasn't safe, the creature clarified that it was because §EShe§! was on the other side, that some god-like creatures had "gone away" and §EShe§! had taken over in the absence. Attempts to further clarify resulted in... God. It started crying. I don't know how- wouldn't know how to explain it except to say that he began to sob big, thick tears. He kept repeating that §EShe§!'d taken over. He kept repeating that §EShe§! would try to find a way inside.\n\nInterview was prematurely terminated as the- the specimen, myself, and several other staff had become emotionally compromised. Will reconvene at a later date.\n\n§R=== END OF RECORDING ===§!"

Report also indicates the retrieval of a crystal of unknown origin, which I am to assume is being examined by a separate team.\n\nBut I digress. Our objective today was to obtain more information from the specimens on their home and the source of their fear and/or anxiety.\n\n§B<<There is a long pause.>>§!\n\nThey call her the Regent. She is an equine of incredible power, formerly a servant to two god-queens known as "Luna" and "Celestia." After the disappearance of both queens from some unknown cataclysm, the §ERegent§! seized power and it... changed her. Warped her. She has been trying to find them... at any cost. She has ripped apart the specimens' world in search of them.\n\nI am aware of the absurdity of this story, but the fear in which the specimens relayed it appeared real. They once again cried through their enormous eyes and became... extremely agitated when the translator indicated that we had come in possession of a crystal. They kept repeating, quote "she'll find a way inside." unquote. It's all they kept repeating.\n\nI'm not sure how worried I should be about that.\n\n§R=== END OF RECORDING ===§!"

March... 7th, though it could still be the 6th. I'm sitting here alone in the laboratory after a late night with my wife. We'd gone to see a movie. Some Elvis picture. I don't know.\n\nI was out with my wife. I was at the movie theater. I had to get up to go to the bathroom and so I went. I mean, I got up. I got up and in the mirror. In the bathroom mirror...\n\nI saw §EHer§!. I saw the thing, the thing that the specimens call the §E"Regent."§! I don't know how I know that it was Her, but I do. She looked like all the other specimens except she was a dark, unnatural purple with a large protrusion sticking from the forehead. And... she was smiling. She had an awful, rictus grin, like she'd just found something... I stood there frozen, not able to scream, and then... she started to push... against... the surface...\n\nI wouldn't know how to describe this. The mirror. The mirror. The mirror, it began to bend. It was like she was pushing through a nylon sock into the bathroom... into our world. It was only the sound of the movie next door that saved me. There was a gunshot or some loud noise that shocked me out of my stupor. I threw the bathroom garbage bin at the mirror so it shattered into a million pieces. Sparkles all over the floor.\n\nWe've been treating these things... These creatures and their portals as though the exchange is only one way. But the doors don't open that way. They let things through on both sides. What if everything that's happening in Russia... everything that we're doing... is keeping that door propped up? What if She's been watching us, looking for a way in?\n\nWhat do we do then? What are we supposed to do when that thing that all our specimens are so afraid of breaks through? I don't know. I really don't. I need to talk to some of the other staff when they come in the morning. Re-evaluate our approach with these things.

 OMO_2022_ferus_transcription_desc.14: "§YDr. Richard Hark§!\nThis is Dr. Hark, of §LGrey Hills§!. Fuck. Okay. So, after the little outbreak, and my own near-death experience with a metal rod, we've got something of a good idea of what's happening after some forward reconnaissance from our friends uh, friends, in Magadan- so, as we understand it, here's a rough timeline of events: First off, the ponies are way further ahead in their research than we ever were or are, which was more or less to be expected, though not in the direction admittedly that we initially presumed. So, namely, in the interdimensional travel and metaphysical variety of research. This stuff is incredibly compelling, get this; so the ponies have actually managed to not only- to not only open up a tear into the fabric of space-time, but have also managed to affect regions beyond the immediate gateway. Usually to tear something so wide as anything perceivable open they'd need a literally infinite supply of energy. Of course, the consequences of that would be typically infinite runoff, infinite effects... infinite consequences. However, due to the unique state of the power source, these crystals, they seem to be able to be tuned to urgh... something to an infinite power source, or at least have similar effects to them, or can channel something even REMOTELY comparable to this into... something.\n\nGod only knows what that means in practical terms, which could actually be how these crystals actually *CAME* to our dimension in the first place. It's this kinda shit that used to keep me up at night, y'know? Now, though, it feels like every minute of the goddamned day- it's all potential. Potential to figure out more, potential for a breakthrough! I haven't felt this kinda rush since I figured out Flavor Oscillation! Regardless. God, what was I- oh right alright.\n\nAs the portal between universes- dimensions, rather, began to progress in construction, we saw that those- §EShe§! on the other side began to impact our reality. The more progress they made, the more §EShe§! reached to us. Me, in particular. Seems §EShe§! also reached out to the President, and most likely some prominent members of the Pony society, then all ponies. Don't know how §EShe§! got hold of me not long after the living specimens we had began to report of §EHer§!, probably due to incremental crystal exposure, which at this point would not surprise me. By the time that the President was contacted, they must've been real damned close. Then, with the last outbreak that resulted in my chest being slightly perforated, we got ourselves the climax to that little escapade- since then, it seems like §EShe§! didn't get through the portal, otherwise we'd be in a lot more trouble. I think since then they either recalibrated, or totally shut it down, because we are getting ponies from that dimension, but the specimens state that they're much less scared of §EHer§!- oh shit, almost forgot Greymane uh, GreyMAN.\n\nRight, so if the bastard's name wasn't inconspicuous enough, as it turns out, this universe held some kind of a doppelgänger *of* Greymane, in some capacity. Once Norman 2.0 came around, he turned, though maintained the memories of original Norman. Norman 2.0 turned, and as I understand it was recently euthanized by original Norman. Again, that may also mean that portal Norman was what we see as 1.0, and we're working with a Theseus' Ship. Who knows. If it matters, I haven't found it in me to care. Either way, really, even if I tried to figure out all this, I don't have all the pieces, but I will. One day, I'll figure it out. For now, though? I'll work until that's the case.\n\n§R=== END OF RECORDING ===§!"

Maybe I'm the only one out there that thinks like this, but you know what if that's the case, then so be it. So, maybe it's better like that if I can't stop it then. In that case, if we are fucked, I say we go out with a bang- not- bang- not suicide. No, this is gonna be a fuckin' wicked party. I promise you that.

I've been redirected from my position in Nevada, and am now tasked with investigating the unique geology in Siberian Russia. I've already been debriefed, assuming I haven't been reading the rantings of a fuckin' schizophrenic druggie. So, if I read right, there's some new crystals that are coming out of Russia that're turning folks into ponies. Now, I saw the attached photos in the report, and while I would imagine I should be thoroughly disturbed, I can also confirm that I don't know enough about biology to get spooked, swings and roundabouts, y'know? Now, as the most well-educated geologist on this side of either curtain and also being deemed the least likely to leak shit, I am now operating lead geologist on this project. I forget what they're calling it, probably not worth remembering. God willing, nobody ever will, y'know?\n\nSo, I've got these reports here laid out in front of me, got my notebooks sorted and ready, and I'm already nose deep into plenty of these reports. Now to give you the idea of things, it's a little fucked. So, visually, these seem like some kind of a Rhodochrosite? Maybe? It's definitely a little not normal, especially when it turns people into fuckin' animals, so I've begun a new system of classification. So for now I'm just gonna call them §h'X'§!. Now, the consequences of these findings are simple; we'll need ourselves more than a few biologists, considering this crosses over through more than one simple class of science. So, here's the cost. At our current rate of containment from the geology standpoint of things, we're having one accidental conversion every two months. On average. Most amount of time with our current stockpile between outbreaks is four months, least amount of time is 19 hours. We're getting better, but not nearly fast enough to save the talented lives we need, at least according to Dr. Harris. So, to fix this I'm arranging for bringing in more geologists and containment specialists, which was already in the cards, granted, but mostly in active research. While this is fantastic for advancing research itself, it's also efficient beyond belief in accidental conversions. So, I'm converting much of our new team towards safety-proofing this facility. We'll do some tests in the coming days, and this will slow down not only our efficiency as a team - geologists, that is, but also our efficiency as a facility. To my knowledge, the §LGrey Hills§! are still the only place working on this particular "project". So, consequence of that is I am liable to get my fuckin' ass handed to me by Hark.

It's the final test before we send you on your merry way back home!\n\n§YD-03§!\nI've had enough of your cures "Doctor", all you do is poison my blood, strangle my insides, and corrode my bones. Go fuck yourself, and all of your scientist buddies.\n\n§YDr. Norman Greymane§!\nDon't be like that D-03, you should be happy that you'll finally get to leave after this.\n\n§YD-03§!\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\n§YDr. Norman Greymane§!\nAdministering the cure subject D-03, and removing a blemish on our timeline. No, don't look at me like that you slack-jawed mule, I've been recording your nighttime murmurs for weeks now, blabbering on about your wife, and your kids, and that pony freakshow world you got spat out of. Here's the real kicker D-03, you, your wife and your kids don't exist!\n\n§YD-03§!\nQuit lying to me you sick animal! You're the one that should be in this cage! I made it out of that warzone alive!\n\n§YDr. Norman Greymane§!\nThree decades of public census record say otherwise D-03, we were confused by that casualty list with your name on it. How could you have died if you never even lived? That conundrum brings us to a single question: who are you? We know those devil ponies waltz across dimensions just fine, but you're an oddity. You have memories of a false reality, yet you share my name and sound eerily similar to myself. Somehow, someway, through Satan's magicks those ponies ripped you from one reality and brought you to ours. What does this mean for our world? I do not know, but I can be certain about one thing: you must be erased D-03.\n\nYou were a living contradiction, Robert Greymane, a violation of nature's laws, a boil to be lanced from the Earth's crust. It's interesting, Robert, how we actually shared birthdays, childhood memories. You would've died in shock had I revealed we're one and the same, and that would've caused complications with the experiment. The same man, but two different lives, two different names, such emotional interference would taint my work. How unfortunate that you were a threat to humanity Robert. I could've had you sent off to an asylum or far away from here, but instead you had to die.\n\nSubject D-03 after being exposed to the gas lived for approximately two minutes before experiencing total organ failure. With this final trial, Caedes Ferarum can be deemed a success.\n\n§R=== END OF RECORDING ===§!"

 OMO_april_bukharin_debug_category_desc: "My Little Pony (MLP) is a toy line and media franchise developed by American toy company Hasbro. The first toys were developed by Bonnie Zacherle, Charles Muenchinger, and Steve D'Aguanno, and were produced in 1981. The ponies feature colorful bodies, manes and a unique symbol on one or both sides of their flanks. Such symbols are referred to in the two most recent incarnations as "cutie marks".\n\nMy Little Pony has been revamped several times with new and more modern looks to continue its appeal to the market, with each new look called a "generation" by the show's collectors and fans. The franchise is mainly targeted at girls, although in the 2010s, it gained a cult following by an unintended audience of adult fans."
