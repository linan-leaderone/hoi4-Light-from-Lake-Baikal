 IME_italys_finest:0 "Italy's Finest"
 IME_italys_finest_desc:0 "Under the strong but fair leadership of Governor-General dalla Chiesa, our armed forces are some of the best in the Italian sphere. With the constant need to put down rebellions from both the Zionists and Palestinians, our troops have become accustomed to conditions and the fighting style in the Middle East."
 IME_haganah_fatah_negotiations: "The Uneasy Peace"
 IME_haganah_fatah_negotiations_desc:0 "Given the extreme ineffectiveness of the more classic methods of Italian colonialism, the Italian authorities in the Levant have been forced to negotiate with the two major political and paramilitary organizations in the region, Haganah and Fatah, as an attempt to keep the Levant stable. Haganah is a self-defense militia dedicated to protecting Jewish settlements in Palestine, with Italy's approval, while Fatah is a larger Arab organization and paramilitary who has campaigned for the independence of the Levant as an independent Arab state. While both are somewhat willing to tolerate cooperation with the Italian government to pursue their own goals, they don't enjoy a great relationship between each other, and the uneasy peace that was reached between Italy, the Jews and the Arabs is constantly at risk of falling apart."
 IME_terrorism:0 "Opposed Extremisms"
 IME_terrorism_desc:0 "Despite Italy's efforts to find a mostly non violent solution to Levantine unrest, there are still many in the region who fiercely oppose the Italian government. Among the Jews, those who were displeased by Haganah's moderation formed Irgun, a revisionist Zionist paramilitary group who fights for a Jewish state that spans the whole Levant, and isn't afraid to attack Italians and Arabs alike in their pursuit. Among the Arabs, the Harakiyyin, or ANM, was formed as a loose coalition of numerous communist, left wing nationalist and other groups, all campaigning for an independent Arab Levant, attacking both the Italian imperialists and their perceived Zionist puppets. Together, these groups have proved a major thorn in the side of the Italian government, and spread terror and fear among the population with their attacks on Italian soldiers and civilians alike."
 IME_emirate_of_transjordan:0 "Emirate of Transjordan"
 IME_emirate_of_transjordan_desc:0 "While the Italian administration in the Levant focuses on maintaining an uneasy peace in the western part of the Governorate, the lands beyond the River Jordan make up the Emirate of Transjordan. Effectively a vassal state of Italy, Transjordan has her own armed forces (albeit commanded by Italian officers), her own government (albeit heavily dependent on the Italian one), and her own ruler, Emir Hussein bin Talal, who has been more than happy to collaborate with Italy for the lucrative oil deals which can be found in working with ENI, providing him with enough wealth to modernize and develop his realm. In more recent times, Emir Hussein has become a supporter of Fatah, especially of its more traditionalist and moderate wing, and his deep pockets have become a major source of funding for the organization, drawing some concern from the Italians."

 ITA_idea_colonial_government:0 "Colonial Government"
 ITA_idea_colonial_government_desc:0 "Rather than an independent country, this territory is governed directly by Italy as a governorate of the Empire. Its foreign and internal policy is bound by the will of Rome, and its people live under the watchful eye of the Roman eagle."

 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_GG_CHIESA_DESC:0 "Governor Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is a man whose meteoric career left many stunned, and many more envious. A decorated veteran of WWII, Dalla Chiesa asked to be transferred from the Regio Esercito to the Carabinieri to follow the footsteps of his father, himself a general of the Carabinieri. After the end of the war, he was assigned to the newly acquired Italian territories in the Levant, where he demonstrated his skill and valor in the investigations and repression of the various terrorist and paramilitary groups that plagued the region. As arrest followed arrest, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Carabinieri, and was noticed by Galeazzo Ciano.\n\nWhen it was time to assign a new governor to the Levant, the new Duce, instead of choosing another old fascist, picked the young general as successor. The choice was controversial, as it was well known that Dalla Chiesa has little sympathy for fascism - but in his yet short tenure, the Carabiniere general managed to bring a semblance of peace to the Levant, even if he had to use unorthodox methods. Rome expected results, and that is what Dalla Chiesa gave them - extremist insurgent groups were targeted by repression, while a semblance of a truce was brokered among those who were willing to negotiate. However, the fate of the Levant still hangs in the balance.\n\nTo Dalla Chiesa, it is clear Italian rule over the region isn't going to last, and some type of agreement between Italy and the many peoples of the Levant has to be found unless the area is to be thrown again into chaos. The Carabiniere governor has managed to return something resembling peace to the Levant - how long that will last, is still to be seen."
 
 POLITICS_Umberto_La_Rocca_DESC:0 "It's said that the destinies of people are decided in the very moment of their birth, and in the case of Umberto La Rocca, that might be true. Born in Port Said from an Italian father and a French mother, young Umberto soon became fluent in three languages, including Arabic - because of this, he was attached to Arab troops in World War Two, fighting with distinction as an officer in North Africa and the Levant against the British. After the war, La Rocca started a brilliant diplomatic career, being sent on missions all over Europe and even to the U.S., where he represented Italy and her nascent empire.\n\nAmbassador La Rocca returned to his homeland in recent times, tasked with yet another mission. For years, the Levant has been a hotbed of conflict, but since the Jerusalem Conference ended with the partition of the Governorate, a fragile new order has been set up in the region, and Jerusalem itself is at the centre of it. Established as a corpus separatum, Jerusalem is a neutral area, garrisoned by Italian troops and administered by a council of representatives of the many religious and ethnic communities which make up the population of the world's holiest city - and at the head of the council sits La Rocca, the impartial and neutral negotiator tasked with making sure that conflicts are defused, crises are resolved, and everyone gets to go home safely at night.\n\nNow, La Rocca knows that from him depends not only the future of Jerusalem as a safe haven for peace among the peoples, but also that of the Levant itself - for while both Palestine and Israel reluctantly accepted the establishment of the corpus separatum, the volatile nature of Levantine politics means that a threat may arise suddenly and with no warning. Only time will tell if the Holy City will be the keystone for building a lasting peace in the Levant, or the eye of a newly risen storm."
 
 POLITICS_Ahmed_Jibril_DESC:0 "Ahmed Jibril was never one for compromise. In his view, things in the Levant were simple, and plain for all to see. Palestine was inhabited by Arabs since ancient times - then, Western imperialists and their Zionist lackeys occupied the country, stole land, displaced inhabitants and claimed lives for the sake of their vile ambition and greed. The Palestinians wanted to resist, but alas, their leaders were grossly unfit to the task: cowards like Arafat, ready to sell his own country in exchange for empty promises of peace, puppets like Hussein, too content lining his pockets with lire to care about his homeland, and morons like Habash, too busy philosophizing to do anything useful.\n\nAnd so, the Palestinian Liberation Front - General Command was founded by Jibril and a small group of Palestinian fighters. Its goal - to liberate Palestine from the oppressor and the Jew. Its methods - anything and everything that could bring about its goal. The PLF-GC rapidly went from obscurity to becoming the most prominent Arab militia in the country, as many turned to the only group who was truly willing to fight for them. And wherever the PLF-GC went, terror, bloodshed and death soon followed - for no price was too great for the liberation of Palestine.\n\nNow, the Italians are gone, and Jibril and his men are finally in control of the country. And yet, their work is far from over. The Zionist snake still lurks, ready to spread its poison once again, and from all directions, threats are already emerging against the newly liberated Palestine. With any means necessary, Jibril and the PLF-GC intend to make sure that nobody can ever enslave Palestine and its Arab people ever again, and that the eternal Jew gets the payback it deserves for trying to steal what belongs to the Palestinians."
 
 #POLITICS_Hussein_ibn_Talal_DESC:0 "Once, the name of Hussein ibn Talal, scion of the Hashemites, was merely one among many others in the long list of native rulers, tribal chiefs and petty kings, vassals to Italy's vast empire, the prestige of his dynasty barely elevating him above the others. His father Talal had agreed to renew the treaty of protection with Italy that his own father Abdullah had signed, but in later years, Talal's severe mental illness made him completely unfit even for the role of a puppet, and it was so that the young prince Hussein became Emir of Transjordan.\n\nEver since then, Hussein worked vigorously to develop his fiefdom - always presenting himself as a staunch ally of Italy while secretly supporting the fedayeen, and closely working with ENI and other Italian businesses to exploit Transjordan's vast resources while pocketing a massive hoard of wealth. Still, the emir's apparent loyalty was rewarded by Rome, and Transjordan was given considerable autonomy inside the Levant, even being allowed its own army. The more Palestine descended into ethnic strife and open rebellion, the more Transjordan became closer to a model protectorate: stable, prosperous, and loyal.\n\nHussein used his wealth and connections to gain Italy's trust, and so it was not surprising that after Italian hegemony in the Middle East was reaffirmed following the Second Italo-Turkish War, Rome saw that only an Arab King could keep the region stable in the long run. Now, Hussein, newly crowned King of the Levant, is in control of a new, hopeful Arab nation: however, the future already casts dark shadows upon his reign. Between the emir's autocratic tendencies and rising Jewish resistance to the new Arab majority kingdom, Italy's gamble to rely on Hussein's loyalty may soon prove to be a grave mistake..."

 POLITICS_JORDAN_ABDULLAH_I_DESC:0 "The name of Abdullah Ibn Hussein is one that sparks controversy, for some he may be a freedom-fighter who tries his best to counter the demands of the occupier and ensure the interests of his people, while for others he is no more than the lapdog of imperialists who betrayed his people and the legacy of his father. However, the truth is far more complicated than either the vilification or glorification of the man that has come to define 3 decades of Hashemite rule over the lands of Jordan.\n\nBorn in 1882 to the future Sharif of Mecca, Abdullah would see his father revolt against the Ottoman caliph and their imperialist hold over Arabia and would lead his armies into the conflict, reigniting the once dim sparks of Arab nationalism. The Arabs revolted and the dream of a unified Arab state was over the horizon, yet it never came. The Arabs were partitioned into monarchies, each ruled by a son of the Sharif. The daring Abdullah was offered the throne of Iraq, but he refused it, instead opting to serve as Emir of the newly christened Protectorate of Transjordan. Abdullah would dutifully serve his country and the needs of his people into the dawn of the Second World War.\n\nAs the Axis powers advanced into the Middle East and occupied the former British holdings, Abdullah would pledge his Allegiance to Italy in hopes of maintaining his rule under the Italian eagle. Though the Italians would remain distrustful of him due to his British collaboration and his struggle to balance the Italian interests with that of his own people, they would nevertheless, recognize his efficiency and administrative skills especially in comparison to the neighbouring governors in Palestine.\n\nHowever, not all would be good for the Emir, as the Palestinian Jihad of Al Husayni would see an assassination attempt, an attempt that would reverberate throughout the Hashemite dynasty, cracking it into halves. As the King of the Arabs looms towards his death, the tension between these two factions of liberals and collaborationists sears."
 POLITICS_JORDAN_NAYEF_DESC:0 "Is the preservation of one's dynasty worth the betrayal of their ideals and the very virtues and principles that were once cherished by them? While the intellectuals with their romantic concepts of nationalism and democracy might say no, Nayef bin Abdallah of Jordan sees things in a different light.\n\nBorn in 1914 at the dawn of the First World War, Nayef was still young when his grandfather organized a revolt against the Turks, he did not experience that time of intensified nationalism in the region, instead, he only saw travesty as he matured. First the fall of the Hashemite stronghold of Hejaz, then the removal of the Hashemite King in Syria due to his overly dignified insistence on nationalism that brought him nothing but ruin, then worst of all the butchering of the Hashemites in Iraq like animals to the slaughterhouse. Nayef could not help but wonder if he and his father were next? The Prince's head would remain spinning with confusion and hesitancy at his own question.\n\nHowever, he would not remain undecided for long. The outbreak of Al-Husayni's Jihad would prove to be a turning point for him. His father was marked by Al-Husayni and targeted for assassination, but by some miracle from God himself, the bullet would miss. However, its consequences would echo in the prince's mind and the House of Hashim as a whole. To Nayef everything became obvious. Only by suppressing these so-called independence movements and aligning themselves further with the Italians could the King's head avoid the guillotine.\n\nThough he has always been his father's favoured son, Nayef still has the opposition of his brother and the court liberals. Nevertheless, the King remains committed to preventing the fall of the last bastion of Hashemite rule."
 POLITICS_JORDAN_HUSSEIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1935, Hussein ibn Talal was always the favourite of many, even his grandfather did not believe either of his sons could be King, instead seeing potential in his grandson Hussein and treating him with extra care and privilege. The young and charismatic prince made the masses cheer, while his father was mistrusted for his supposed lunacy, and his uncle jeered on as a traitor and bootlicker.\n\nHussein has lived his entire life under an occupied Jordan, one exploited and colonized, first by the British and then by the Italians, and like his namesake before him, Hussein has forever despised this situation. He saw the misery of his people, whether Jordanian or Palestinian, and how they were crushed under the weight of the Italian Empire. The people dreamt of liberty, of freedom, of independence, yet their dreams were stolen from them.\n\nAngry with the exploitation of his people and wishing to see them set free, Hussein grew renowned for his idea of a "Liberal Experiment" and anti-Italian rhetoric, effectively becoming the face of Jordanian reformism and his father's deputy in the liberal faction of the royal court. Furthermore, his desire and wishes to see his people grow happier, see their dreams fulfilled, and their lives improved, has seen him grow increasingly popular with the common toiler.\n\nThe beloved King marches with his people onto new horizons with plans to continue the democratization efforts that his father started and advance the people's will. Hussein has even approached moderate pro-Italian and leftist movements in hopes of reaching common ground with them for the common benefit of his people and country. However, many remain doubtful of the monarch's sincerity and commitment to democratization, despite his own nationalist and liberal credentials; suspicions that may just be proven correct as he begins to clash with the more republican elements of Jordanian politics."
 POLITICS_NAYEF_HAWATMEH_JOR_DESC:0 ""
 
 POLITICS_George_Habash_DESC:0 "George Habash's rise to prominence was one fraught with hardship, pain, tears, and blood. Born into a Palestinian Christian family, as a young man Habash immediately joined the Arab fedayeen against the Italian occupation of the Levant following World War Two. A convinced Marxist, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement, a wide front of socialists, communists and left-wing Arab nationalists fighting against Italian and Zionist occupation of the Levant - waging a violent guerrilla war against the fascist invaders while declaring their commitment to turn the Levantine lands into an independent, non-denominational, socialist republic.\n\nDespite internal divisions among the Levantine Arabs, largely thanks to Arafat attempting to sell his land to fascists and Zionists from under his own feet and Hussein's unrepentant reaction and greed - Habash and the ANM have finally achieved their revolutionary goals. The peoples of the Levant rose up against imperialism and bigotry, a crowning victory after years of popular struggle, and the country now marches ahead to build its new future, with Comrade Secretary-General Habash charting the course.\n\nHowever, Habash's struggle is far from over. Zionist militias such as Irgun, and even large sections of the Haganah, have taken up a bitter resistance against the new People's Republic, and among the Arab people, reactionary and fundamentalist sentiments still creep like a snake in the darkness, spreading their counter-revolutionary poison among the people. Now, Habash must defend what he conquered - defend the people, defend the idea, defend the Revolution. Only time will tell if the light of socialism will live on in the Levant, or if its flame will be stamped out by the rising darkness."
