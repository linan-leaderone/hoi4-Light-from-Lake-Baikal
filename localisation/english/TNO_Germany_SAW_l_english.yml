 GER_Bormann_SAF_arsenal_of_afrika_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika, located primarily within the geographic boundaries of the former-Belgian Congo, is notably a considerable distance from the conflict's frontline and largely outside the range of any enemy airfields & bombers, thereby making the Reichskommissariat and region difficult to directly strike.

Recruits would be trained in guerrilla warfare, supplied with silenced weaponry, explosives and vehicles, with the aim of making Germany ungovernable and aid the rise of the rightful government once more. This event naturally never came to fruition, but the Werwulf plans may yet be useful. Training Hüttig's soldiers in these tactics will provide a valuable edge."

 GER_Bormann_SAF_festung_johannesburg_desc:0 "Johannesburg has been a bastion of Aryan settlement on the Dark Continent for nearly two hundred years.
