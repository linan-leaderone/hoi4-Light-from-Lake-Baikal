 ## Leader Descs ##

 POLITICS_VICTOR_SIMINEL_DESC: "General Victor Siminel, governor of Transnistria, did not exactly ask for the duty he has these days. But he regards it as his job to see that it is done.\n\nThe scion of a Moldavian 'razesi', or yeoman, family, Siminel served with some distinction during the First World War. During the war against the Soviets he was kept out of high command, instead serving in the cavalry and in the middle ranks of the Special Intelligence Service, Romania's spy agency.\n\nAntonescu fell, and in 1956 Avramescu's cabinet made Siminel director-general of the Special Intelligence Service, giving him the duty of reintegrating the anti-Antonescu spy cells and military factions back into the broader government apparatus now that their raison d'etre was no more. He fulfilled that duty, so Iuliu Maniu's government appointed him as the governor of Transnistria: "a hodgepodge government for a hodgepodge region", Siminel often calls it.\n\nUnder Siminel's leadership, the long-rising partisan threat has been held back for the time being. Despite that success, there is a question that troubles both Siminel and his political superiors: for how long will the region hold?"

 TNS_Tighina_Accords: "The Tighina Accords"
 TNS_Tighina_Accords_desc: "The compact responsible for the birth of the Transnistria Governorate is just one of the many ways Romania has become intertwined with German affairs. The hybrid administration is responsible for governing it is a mix of Romanians and Germans. While one would expect the share of work to be equal, truthfully, Romania is responsible for most of the governorate's general management while Germany uses the land for military bases, troops, and certain economic concessions."

 TNS_Smochinas_Agitation: "Smochina's Agitation"
 TNS_Smochinas_Agitation_desc: "A nationalist tendency is rising, one that has found its voice in prominent public figure Nichita Smochină. An ethnic activist, he has come to represent the militant Romanian settlers in Transnistria who demand it to be formally annexed into Romania. Slowly and daily, the Moldovan's connections to the former USSR grow weaker as Romanianization policies begin to take hold, strengthening Smochina's position."

 TNS_Ethnic_Turbulence: "Ethnic Turbulence"
 TNS_Ethnic_Turbulence_desc: "Divisions between the Romanian administration, the Black Sea Germans, and the Ukrainian population are visible to anyone who picks up a newspaper to learn of the latest insurgency. German communities are administered solely by Sonderkommando R, which looks after their defensive and economic affairs. Romanian authorities do the same for their own. Meanwhile, Ukrainians toil tirelessly and thanklessly, forced to look after themselves while all relevant authorities remain apathetic to their needs."

 TNS_Land_Of_Contradictions: "A Land of Contradictions"
 TNS_Land_Of_Contradictions_desc: "Transnistria is a place fraught with uncertainty, a land where everyone contradicts each other. The administration is laden with corruption as Reichmarks fill the pockets of bureaucrats, with no solution in sight from the Romanian government. The feuds between the mayor of Odesa and the head of the Romanian garrison have become legendary. It is telling that the most notable example of German-Romanian cooperation here was the coup of a former governor who refused to accept Bucharest's authority."
