 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_POKRYSHKIN_DESC: "A legendary ace pilot in the Second World War and a Hero of the Soviet Union, Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin would return to his home town of Novosibirsk after the end of the war. Hoping to live a relatively peaceful life, little did he know where fate would lead him.\n\nPokryshkin was content with the rule of the Central Siberian Republic, and eventually found his way into government. Managing the city of Novosibirsk under the Republic was a relatively simple affair. That was, until the Siberian War. Soon, he would be forced to put the entire city on a war footing to face against Yagoda's powerful Supreme Soviet in the east. Rationing was introduced, conscription increased dramatically, and the young men of Novosibirsk were sent to die on the battlefields of Siberia. At one point, Pokryshkin reached his limit. After making a backroom deal with Mayor of Barnaul Vasily Shukshin, the plan was set into motion.\n\nThe two men and their subordinates would seize Novosibirsk swiftly, organizing a new government. A government free from any influence, and truly sovereign amidst the chaos that unfolded in Russia. Now, ruling through an uneasy alliance with Barnaul, Pokryshkin needs to ensure his state remains stable. Even though it boasts a large population, industry and functional agriculture, Novosibirsk still has problems it needs to face, both internal and external, and it is up to Pokryshkin to solve them."

 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_DESC: "Born in 1929 in Altai Krai, Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was an aspiring author prior to his dabbling in politics and his election as mayor of Barnaul. Shukshin has trekked a long road so far, one which seems endless: a prior ally of Pokryshkin when the Federation had just seceded from the Central Siberian Republic, Vasily quickly came to head with his former ally and his corporate associates, their creeping corruption clashing with Shukshin's ideals of democracy and federalism, ideals keeping his head afloat as he arranged backroom deals and negotiations necessary for his candidacy as President of the Federation to stand a chance.\n\nNow newly elected and having wrestled control away of the country from the Siloviks, Vasily isn't in a position to sit back and relax: though the Siloviks aren't in control anymore, the President has to deal with the still very present corporations and the damages their corruption has caused and is still causing to the Republic.\n\nIf he wants to see this budding democracy bloom in the desert that is Russia, he will have to face troubles caused undoubtedly by corporations during his tenure as President."
 
 ### Leader Traits ###
 the_siberian_falcon: "The Siberian Falcon"
 
 ### Ideas ###
 NOV_Disproportionate_Population: "Disproportionate Population"
 NOV_Disproportionate_Population_desc: "Novosibirsk has always been one of the most developed and densely populated regions across the Urals, as a hub to the Far East and a crucial link on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The city was already one of the biggest in Siberia when the Great Patriotic War broke out, but the conflict itself made it grow even more.\n\nThousands fled the German occupation, or simply the chaos that unfolded in Russian lands, and they arrived in Novosibirsk, which was soon crowded with civilians. This can be both a blessing and a curse, but it is something we have to live with."
 NOV_The_All_Siberian_Army: "The All-Siberian Army"
 NOV_The_All_Siberian_Army_desc: "The army that is responsible for the protection of the region of Novosibirsk is easily one of the most powerful and prestigious in Central Siberia. When the Siberian Falcon split from the Tomsk government to save himself and his people from the horrors of war, a large fraction of the army of the Central Siberian Republic pledged their loyalty to Pokryshkin, and soon reorganized in the south.\n\nThe All-Siberian Army has managed to reform into a force capable of rivalling even the largest neighbors of our warlord state, and the experience many men have from the Great Patriotic War and the Siberian War has proven invaluable."
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators: "Socialist Agitators"
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_desc: "The agitators, anarchists, and criminals of the Narodniks lurk in the shadows of our state, recruiting misguided idealists and hardened criminals in their efforts to subvert our proud Federation; embarking upon sabotage and subversion in a foolish attempt to revive the Union of old. They must be crushed."
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_2: "Socialist Agitators"
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_2_desc: "The agitators, anarchists, and criminals of the Narodniks lurk in the shadows of our state, recruiting misguided idealists and hardened criminals in their efforts to subvert our proud Federation; embarking upon sabotage and subversion in a foolish attempt to revive the Union of old. They must be crushed."
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_3: "Socialist Agitators"
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_3_desc: "The agitators, anarchists, and criminals of the Narodniks lurk in the shadows of our state, recruiting misguided idealists and hardened criminals in their efforts to subvert our proud Federation; embarking upon sabotage and subversion in a foolish attempt to revive the Union of old. They must be crushed."
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_4: "Socialist Agitators"
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_4_desc: "The agitators, anarchists, and criminals of the Narodniks lurk in the shadows of our state, recruiting misguided idealists and hardened criminals in their efforts to subvert our proud Federation; embarking upon sabotage and subversion in a foolish attempt to revive the Union of old. They must be crushed."
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_5: "Socialist Agitators"
 NOV_Socialist_Agitators_5_desc: "The agitators, anarchists, and criminals of the Narodniks lurk in the shadows of our state, recruiting misguided idealists and hardened criminals in their efforts to subvert our proud Federation; embarking upon sabotage and subversion in a foolish attempt to revive the Union of old. They must be crushed."
 NOV_Barnaul_Grain: "Grain from Barnaul"
 NOV_Barnaul_Grain_desc: "With a new contract secured, grain from Altay's fertile fields once more flows into Novosibirsk, greatly easing the food shortages that have been the cause of so much trouble. While concerns about food security remain, for now, we can rest easy and toast to the success and cooperation of the Federation."
 NOV_Virgin_Lands_Campaign: "The Virgin Lands Campaign"
 NOV_Virgin_Lands_Campaign_desc: "The steady resettlement of skilled refugees away from the inner cities and into uncultivated land is proving a major boon thus far. While issues with adequate housing and equipment do remain, the alleviation of overpopulation in the Federation's cities and the increased agricultural production has eased much of our prior concerns regarding food security."
 NOV_shock_troops: "Shock Troops"
 NOV_shock_troops_desc: "Some of the greatest victories of the old Soviet Union were accomplished by shock troops. Men who can strike fast and hit hard, ensuring their opponents will never have time to find their bearing.\n\nToday a new generation of men are being trained to follow in their footsteps. Brandishing automatic weapons and fearless daring, they will proudly carry on the legacy of their predecessors and strike terror into the hearts of our enemies."

 NOV_narodnik_aftermath: "Narodnik Aftermath"
 NOV_narodnik_aftermath_desc: ""

 NOV_central_design_bureau: "Central Design Bureau"
 
 NOV_temporary_industry_boost: "Industrial Support"
 NOV_temporary_industry_boost_desc: "Recent efforts at improving production and lengthening working hours have greatly improved our industry. While these gains cannot last forever, especially given the discontent of the factory workers, it is enough to grant us a temporary period of increased productivity."
 
 NOV_shoot_rebels: "Stamping Out the Embers"
 NOV_shoot_rebels_desc: "The embers of resistance remain scattered throughout our territories, misguided loyalists, die-hard fanatics, and those who don't seem to know when to quit. Whoever they may be and whatever ideology they follow, monarchists, communists, or anarchists, we will see to it that they remain a threat no longer."

 NOV_vestiges_of_revolt: "Reconstruction Efforts"
 NOV_vestiges_of_revolt_desc: "While the band of traitors, subversive, and fools that made up Kostin's farcical workers' revolt may be crushed on the field, their legacy remains. In defiant workers and rebellious holdouts that insist on continuing a fight long since lost. Until these last embers of rebellion are smothered, our industries will struggle to return to a sense of normalcy."

 NOV_trading_partner: "Lucrative Trading Partner"
 NOV_trading_partner_desc: "Thanks to the deft diplomatic ability of our diplomats and the skillful decisions of our government, we found a new trading partner abroad. Isolated for a decade, our businesses and merchants are taking their first steps back into foreign exchanges, and foreign goods, in admittedly small quantities, are reaching our markets once more."
 
 NOV_trading_partner_2: "Lucrative Trading Partner"
 NOV_trading_partner_2_desc: "Thanks to the deft diplomatic ability of our diplomats and the skillful decisions of our government, we found a new trading partner abroad. Isolated for a decade, our businesses and merchants are taking their first steps back into foreign exchanges, and foreign goods, in admittedly small quantities, are reaching our markets once more."
 
 NOV_spreading_the_sibplan_idea: "Spreading the SibPlan"
 NOV_spreading_the_sibplan_idea_desc: "It was Bukharin's Union before us that brought the spectacles of modern industrial life to the desolate tundras of Central Siberia; however, the Far East was largely untouched by the Siberian Plan and left devoid of a substantial industrial base. The Far East's derelict state can no longer be tolerated, as such, we will transform its vast, barren landscape into a sea of life, wealth industry through both the establishment of state ventures in the region and cooperation with local corporations."
 
 NOV_our_eastern_bastion_idea: "Naval Rearmament"
 NOV_our_eastern_bastion_idea_desc: "With our position in Siberia secure, funding and resources are once more being poured into our naval facilities in Magadan. Expanded docks and newly dredged harbors will form the nucleus of our first efforts to rebuild our naval power. After all, the longest journey begins with a single step."

 NOV_rnd_modifier: "The Central Design Bureau"
 NOV_rnd_modifier_desc: "In order to synthesize the various research efforts within Novosibirsk, the Central Deisgn Bureau has been established. Tasked with overseeing, designing, and organzing all scientific endeavors, the Central Design Bureau acts as a focal point, allowing efficient and coordinated work between different groups, ensuring new and advanced technologies are developed and implemented quickly."
 
 NOV_victorious_federation: "The Federation Victorious"
 NOV_victorious_federation_desc: "Our enemies lie defeated beneath the boots of the All-Siberian Army. From the Mongol steppe to the frigid reaches of Norilsk, the Federation stands above all. A bright future lies ahead, but the task of winning the peace, it seems, will be no less strenuous than winning the war."
 
 NOV_sovereign_security_act: "Sovereign Security Act"
 NOV_sovereign_security_act_desc: "With the passage of the Sovereign Security Act, our internal security forces have recorded both an increase in funding and a decrease in terror. Slowly, steadily, our brave men in uniform are rooting out the subversives and traitors who would dare threaten to betray our great Federation."

 NOV_narodnik_investigation_category: "The Narodnik Investigation"
 NOV_narodnik_investigation_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears the Narodnik, socialist agitators including anarchists and communists, have grown bolder in their attacks. These terrorists must be dealt with by force as soon as possible, as we risk an uprising in the case of war.\n\nOur security services must investigate any lead possible, disrupt their operations, and contain their threat before they can cause any massive damage. Many of their hideouts have already been located, and operations have been planned. The Federation is no home to terrorist scum!\n--------------\nINVESTIGATION PROGRESS: §Y[?NOV_investigation_progress]%§!"
 NOV_funnel_resources_to_investigation: "Funnel Resources into the Investigation"
 NOV_funnel_resources_to_investigation_desc: "The excision of the Narodnik menace will not be an easy one. Our security forces will be stretched thin dealing with them, not to mention having to handle other threats separate from these socialist terrorists. We can divert extra resources from other security departments to the Narodnik investigation in order to improve our operation capabilities."
 NOV_infiltrate_narodnik_cells: "Infiltrate Narodnik Cells"
 NOV_infiltrate_narodnik_cells_desc: "The socialist terrorists menacing our statelet are of unknown number, and well concealed. Our lack of information about their activities has allowed them to continually get the better of us. They are guarded enough that the only way to discover their intentions from the inside. Sending SB agents disguised as impressionable citizens to join their ranks will give us valuable intelligence and allow us to draw them into our clutches, without the Narodniks suspecting a thing."
 NOV_investigate_factories_in_novosibirsk: "Investigate Factories in Novosibirsk"
 NOV_investigate_factories_in_novosibirsk_desc: "Novosibirsk's working classes are generally discontented about their conditions and thus easy targets for the terrorists' recruiters, who preach the virtues of wealth redistribution. As a result, rumors have spread that the Narodniks have already infiltrated the city's many factories, spreading their propaganda on the shop floor and inducting workers into their ranks. We cannot allow the engines of our economic progress to become our greatest security threat."
 NOV_increase_patrols_in_altay: "Increase Patrols in Altay"
 NOV_increase_patrols_in_altay_desc: "The Altay region is a geographer's dream, filled with tall mountains and great forests. This quality also makes it a counterinsurgency nightmare. Narodniks evading justice have taken refuge throughout the region, hiding out and even stashing weapons in the rugged terrain. Allowing the terrorists to grow roots into our territory would be a grave mistake, necessitating the allocation of more resources to security forces in the area."
 NOV_conduct_an_internal_investigation: "Conduct an Internal Investigation"
 NOV_conduct_an_internal_investigation_desc: "The Narodniks have seemingly developed a presence almost everywhere in Novosibirsk, even within their enemies' ranks. It was not long ago that socialism was Russia's prevailing ideology, after all, and there are those among the officer class that wish they were leading a Red Army instead of our own. Security organs infiltrated by the terrorist threat will naturally be ineffective at fighting it, and we need to prove that no one, not even an officer, is above the law."
 NOV_the_final_raid: "Launch the Final Raid"
 NOV_the_final_raid_desc: "Our investigations into the Narodnik movement have been numerous and thorough, and they have yielded a great deal of very valuable information. We now have good intelligence regarding the location of their main hideout, where their elusive leadership spins a web of terror and destruction throughout our territory. Decapitating the movement by targeting the masterminds in a decisive police raid will splinter it, seriously reducing the threat posed to our institutions."

 ### Expansion ###
 NOV_siberian_expansion_category: "§GSiberian Expansion§!"
 NOV_siberian_expansion_category_desc: "With our domestic situation under control for the time being it is time for us to look outward. We are surrounded by threats to our sovereignty and our further control of Central Siberia. Now, we must decide where and how to strike. Whether we expand by force or by diplomacy, it will also be crucial that we prepare as best we can for the inevitable problem of integration."

 NOV_operation_homecoming_desc: "Before us in Tomsk lies the remnants of the great beast from which our state formed, the §R[TOM.GetName]§!. While they may have meant well, their experiment became a failure long ago, and all that remains is for someone to show them just how ineffectual it has become. That someone will be us. Our forces await eagerly the order to invade, ready to tear apart the rotten institutions piece by piece, and liberate the territory still held by the salons and their loyalists."
 NOV_operation_homecoming_disband_the_salons: "§yDisband the Salons§!"
 NOV_operation_homecoming_disband_the_salons_desc: "The §YSalons of Tomsk§!, while made up of undoubtedly great intellectuals, have long since outlived their usefulness. Even now, under our occupation, they debate endlessly and pointlessly about the correct course of action, giving faint hope to those who continue to believe in the failed experiment of the Central Siberian Republic even now. The Salons must be finally disbanded before this hope becomes determination, or even rebelliousness."
 NOV_operation_homecoming_absorb_their_design_bureau: "§yAbsorb Their Design Bureau§!"
 NOV_operation_homecoming_absorb_their_design_bureau_desc: "Not all of the component parts of the government in Tomsk were useless. The Design Bureau, in particular, was a shining star in a sea of ineffectual governance, continuing to innovate even as the Republic crumbled. As we continue to integrate the lands the remnant Central Siberian Republic held, it would be wise to integrate their scientists into the teams employed by Titan, in order to bolster our own technological prowess."

 NOV_operation_kingbreaker: "§MOperation: Kingbreaker§!"
 NOV_operation_kingbreaker_desc: "The farcical neo-Rurikid regime to our west has long been a thorn in our side, and their mad king's nonsense has gone on for long enough. §MOperation: Kingbreaker§! is, as the name implies, aimed at crushing the §R[KEM.GetName]§! once and for all to bring the Kuznetsk Basin under our control."

 NOV_operation_kingbreaker_the_coal_of_kemerovo_desc: "The mineral-rich §GKuznetsk Basin§! now lies under our control, and now we have to decide what to do with it. The previous regime was woefully unable to exploit it properly, and now it falls to us to expand the coal mining infrastructure here."

 NOV_operation_kingbreaker_fate_of_the_sobor_desc: "Rurik's "kingdom" now lies shattered into a million pieces thanks to our victory, but the question remains of what to do with his ministers. The so-called §Y"Zemsky Sobor"§! was the King's idea of a parliament, and the many politicians who were part of it await their fate. What shall be done with them?"

 NOV_operation_raskol: "§LOperation: Raskol§!"
 NOV_operation_raskol_desc: "All preparations for the invasion of §R[ALT.GetName]§! are complete. Ruled jointly by Old Believers and the Altay people, the unitary and religious nature of their state stands in contrast to our Federation.\n\nAlthough an entirely unambitious government, unlike most others in the region, they nevertheless stand in the way of the unification of Central Siberia, and as such must be defeated completely by our forces and brought into the fold."
 NOV_operation_raskol_institute_secular_authority: "§LInstitute Secular Authority§!"
 NOV_operation_raskol_institute_secular_authority_desc: "The privileges of the Old Believers in Oyrotia have gone on for far too long. Allowed governmental authority on a religious basis due to the dualistic nature of the Oyrotian state, their ability to rule over the people in the name of God is unreasonable and tyrannical. We must put a stop to it now that we control the territory."

 NOV_operation_empty_words: "§OOperation: Empty Words§!"
 NOV_operation_empty_words_desc: "§OOperation: Empty Words§! is aimed at striking hard at the military regime in the §R[KRS.GetName]§!, led by one General Andreev. Andreev has supposedly made a great deal of idealistic promises to his people, but it's obvious that these are not but meaningless platitudes. Our offensive will bring this aspiring despot down, and in the process secure a critical rail hub."
 NOV_operation_empty_words_seize_the_abakan_arsenal: "§OSeize the Abakan Arsenal§!"
 NOV_operation_empty_words_seize_the_abakan_arsenal_desc: "Now that the region of Krasnoyarsk lies under our control, the fruits of this critical lynchpin of Central Siberia now lay open to us. One of them is the military arsenal at Abakan, which contains a treasure trove of valuable arms and munitions. We must seize this facility and get it back up and running again."
 NOV_operation_empty_words_welcome_the_willing: "§OWelcome the Willing§!"
 NOV_operation_empty_words_welcome_the_willing_desc: "Andreev might have been defeated, but his allies may just be willing to aid our cause. We will reach out to some of his administrators and commanders and try to strike some kind of deal with them. Should they agree, it would make integration of the region all the more simple."

 NOV_operation_tachanka: "§SOperation: Tachanka§!"
 NOV_operation_tachanka_desc: "§SOperation: Tachanka§! has been a long time coming. The so-called §R[SBA.GetName]§! was one of the main factors in the collapse of the §YCentral Siberian Republic§!, and now it falls to us to put their foolish rebellion down. Their forces are inherently disorganized thanks to their misguided anarchist ideals, and cannot hope to stand up to our might."
 NOV_operation_tachanka_enforce_order_upon_anarchy: "§SEnforce Order Upon Anarchy§!"
 NOV_operation_tachanka_enforce_order_upon_anarchy_desc: "The Siberian Black Army may lie defeated at our hands, but their misguided ideals have been deeply embedded into the lands now under our control. This cannot stand. We shall purge the taint of anarchism from these lands and crush any who refuse to cooperate."
 NOV_operation_tachanka_disband_the_workers_councils: "§SDisband the Workers' Councils§!"
 NOV_operation_tachanka_disband_the_workers_councils_desc: "The lands west of the former Black Army have organized themselves into many "workers' councils."

 NOV_operation_sole_survivor_desc: "To the south are the last remnants of the Red Army here in Central Siberia. Alexander Vasilevsky has demonstrated an admirable level of persistence in his duties leading the §R[PRC.GetName]§!, but sadly, his time is up. §xOperation: Sole Survivor§! is among the more ambitious of our war plans, as it will take our forces through some rather hard terrain. Vasilevsky's forces are well-trained and prepared, so caution must be taken."

 NOV_operation_sole_survivor_the_red_armys_finest_desc: "The Red Army in Tuva has over two decades of fighting experience under its belt, and many of its members have expressed interest in continuing their service in our army.

Shukshin claims that granting autonomy to the Tuvan people would make them more loyal to our government, if at the cost of limiting our influence in the area. The decision, however, lies in our hands."

 NOV_research_and_development_category_desc: "The face of warfare has changed. Battles are no longer decided by massed infantry and thundering artillery, but by whoever can dominate the skies above contested ground. We have seen examples of this across the world, from South Africa to Indonesia to our own backyards.\n\nIf Russia is to become powerful again, she must not concede her own airspace to the enemy. The great powers of the world have spent years building their air forces, and our own armada pales in comparison in both size and sophistication. It is essential that we make up for lost time, and the best way to do that is by sponsoring any project that may help us achieve aerial supremacy.\n\nThe costs may be high, but they are nothing compared to what we will pay if we surrender the skies of the Motherland.\n\n§YProject Status:§!\nProject §RBICHEVATEL§!: [NOVGetRnDProject1Status]\nProject §OBERKUT§!: [NOVGetRnDProject2Status]\nProject §YPROYDOKHA§!: [NOVGetRnDProject3Status]\nProject §GLETUCHAYA LISITSA§!: [NOVGetRnDProject4Status]\nProject §BKROKODIL§!: [NOVGetRnDProject5Status]\n[NOVGetAbakanEntry]"

 NOV_project_bichevatel: "Project §RBICHEVATEL§!"
 NOV_project_bichevatel_desc: "The fighter is the workhorse of any modern air force, well suited for defending airspace, attacking enemy formations, and protecting bombers over enemy territory. It is vital that we have a fighter capable of competing with anything the Germans, Japanese, or Americans can field. A new design, dubbed the MiG-23, may be just what we are looking for. Sporting variable wing geometry and an experimental radar system, it will be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world."

 NOV_project_2: "Project §OBERKUT§!"
 NOV_project_2_desc: "There is more to controlling the skies than having the best planes. Land-based aircraft are vital to defending our cities and production centers from air raids, and Russia's aerial defenses are woefully inadequate to defend against a modern bombing fleet. The solution lies in developing a system of surface-to-air guided missiles similar to those of our rivals around the globe. A prototype missile, the S-25, is a strong candidate to lead the next generation of Russian anti-aircraft weapons."

 NOV_project_3: "Project §YPROYDOKHA§!"
 NOV_project_3_desc: "Defending our own skies is necessary, but if we truly want to contest the air, we must be able to strike at the enemy directly, hitting them where it hurts most. Our current fleet of bombers would be chewed to pieces if they ever tried to raid Germania or Tokyo, but we cannot concede the opportunities presented by strategic bombing of the enemy homeland. A new, supersonic long-range bomber is needed. One design we have received, the M-50, promises to deliver exactly that."

 NOV_project_4: "Project §GLETUCHAYA LISITSA§!"
 NOV_project_4_desc: "When it comes to interceptor aircraft, the most important factor is unquestionably speed. If the interceptor is fast enough, it can blow past any escort aircraft and run-down cumbersome bombers before they get close to their target. We have received a design for a new interceptor, the MiG-25, that if successful would be one of the fastest aircraft on the planet. A defensive squadron of these planes would make even the Luftwaffe think twice before crossing Russia's borders."

 NOV_project_5: "Project §BKROKODIL§!"
 NOV_project_5_desc: "The attack helicopter has revolutionized land warfare, allowing troops to receive fire support faster than ground-attack planes could manage and making rapid aerial interruptions of enemy movements far easier. Russia has lagged far behind in the area of helicopter development, but the new Mi-24 Gunship promises to fix that. Heavily armored and equipped with both machine guns and air-to-land missiles, this helicopter will spell doom for any enemy that hears it approaching."

 NOV_project_fuck_pindosi: "Project §lABAKAN§!"
 NOV_project_fuck_pindosi_desc: "Airmobile infantry are the next generation of the fighting man, faster and more maneuverable than any land-based infantry unit could be. However, the unique nature of their transportation and deployment mean that standard infantry equipment is poorly situated for their needs. A new, more compact assault rifle in the early phases of development dubbed the TKB-011 may be the solution. The 011 could be well suited for the hectic, close quarters fighting our airmobile units often find themselves in."

 NOV_meet_with_industrialists_desc: "Outside of the government, nobody in the country has more sway than the captains of industry. They have deep pockets and large networks of influence that allow them to change thousands of minds through advertisement campaigns and political donations. A private summit with the industrialists, where Pokryshkin promises them concessions in exchange for campaign support, would go a long way in convincing the elite that another presidential term is in their favor."
 NOV_encourage_infighting_among_opposition: "Encourage Infighting in the Opposition"
 NOV_encourage_infighting_among_opposition_desc: "Pokryshkin's opponents are significantly less of a united front than the government, a fact that is almost exclusively to our advantage. If we can convince some of the myriad factions involved in the Shukshin campaign to cause discontent within his ranks, it will make the opposition unable to effectively campaign against us. The more confusion, the better, and we may even be able to shatter the opposition's unity entirely."
 NOV_hold_military_parade: "Hold Military Parade"
 NOV_hold_military_parade_desc: "The easiest fallback for a flagging political campaign is stirring up feelings of nationalism among the people. Grand demonstrations of military strength remind potential voters that Pokryshkin has made the country strong, and that he is the only one who can protect them from their myriad enemies. A politicized parade might even suppress the opposition if it can convince them that the army won't tolerate their victory. All in all, this would practically be a pro-government rally with tanks."
 NOV_utilize_the_sb: "Utilize the SB"
 NOV_utilize_the_sb_desc: "Holding a competitive election demonstrates to the public the government's resolve to behave honorably towards the opposition. Behind closed doors, we can happily discard this pretense. Using the security services against the Shukshin campaign may not be fair, but it could be an incredibly effective way to hamper it. Digging (or even inventing) dirt on Shukshin and exposing it in state media would be a powerful way to turn voters against him."
 NOV_promote_national_unity: "Promote National Unity"
 NOV_promote_national_unity_desc: "To win the election, we need to send a message. A message of national unity. Propaganda must be created highlighting the positive sides of our administration, unity, and all the qualities we desire in our nation.

Pokryshkin is likely already exploiting the ideological differences among our allies, so we must act quick.

The state sponsored oppression, the greed, the violence, the corruption. We must lay all of this bare for the people to see and take a stand against it in the name of democracy, freedom, and the true values that we formed this country to represent.

To the common Russian, we offer what we have to give: reforms, freedom, and self-determination. We promise as much as we can give in our power to make their lives better. More importantly, however, we will be contrasting this to what the siloviks have given the common Russian for the last several years: stagnancy, oppression and corruption."
 NOV_talk_to_sympathetic_officers: "Talk to Sympathetic Officers"
 NOV_talk_to_sympathetic_officers_desc: "This country we now live in, once a mere warlord state, was built not just by statesmen but by soldiers and their lionhearted leaders. Thus, officers of the military are deeply respected and although many are apolitical, there are a good few who are deeply interested in the workings of our nation. Among them, there should be those sympathetic to our cause, to freeing our country from the shackles of the siloviks. We should approach them and make sure they stay on our side, and see about using their ample resources."

 ### Starting tree ###
 NOV_land_of_the_strong: "Land of the Strong"
 NOV_land_of_the_strong_desc: "The Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay is the largest splinter state that separated from the Central Siberian Republic, even rivaling its remnant to the north in terms of power and military might. Its President, the aviator Alexander Pokryshkin who is commonly known as the Falcon, runs the state in an increasingly authoritarian manner.\n\nNovosibirsk has also been overwhelmed by the wave of refugees that came from the evacuation eastward, which has caused a multitude of issues.\n\nThe Falcon and his government will have to find solutions to the problems that have started to torment its people if he is to unite the region."

 NOV_the_internal_situation: "The Internal Situation"
 NOV_the_internal_situation_desc: "The internal situation within the Federation has continued to deteriorate in recent months. Leftist revolutionaries have tried to undermine the stability of the state, their methods of doing so have become incredibly heinous.\n\nThe government will have to make difficult decisions on the freedoms of the people in order to take a harsh stance on such dangerous dissent.\n\nOnce the internal situation has been dealt with, we must hope that the regime will be strengthened enough to turn our attention on to our enemies that threaten the region."

 NOV_the_security_question: "The Security Question"
 NOV_the_security_question_desc: "Law enforcement has steadily become more and more difficult as tensions between the government and political agitators have led to terrorist attacks, which are suspected to have been orchestrated by rebellious socialists.\n\nThese cowardly actions have caused a great deal of domestic instability, which cannot be allowed to continue. Security will have to be improved in order to combat the threat that the terrorists pose to our future.\n\nThe state will have to make these changes to maintain law and order."

 NOV_expand_the_security_agencies: "Expand the Security Agencies"
 NOV_expand_the_security_agencies_desc: "Due to the recent increase in Narodnik terrorist activity in major cities, President Pokryshkin has signed an executive order expanding the powers of the Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or SB. As the main federal security agency in Novosibirsk and Barnaul, the SB has kept the Federation safe from socialist and anarchist agitation almost since its foundation.\n\nNow with these new powers, the SB should be able to act with impunity against socialist terrorists, without intervention from local or federal governments. The Narodniks must be ended as soon as possible lest they begin to cause chaos, and the SB is the only thing that will get the job done right."

 NOV_investigate_the_narodniks: "Investigate the Narodniks"
 NOV_investigate_the_narodniks_desc: "One of the largest known terrorist groups that have been carrying out attacks against the people of Novosibirsk is called "Nardoniks". The group is composed of socialist agitators who are attempting to topple the Falcon's regime. They have perpetuated the violence within our borders for too long, they will have to be dealt with directly.\n\nFirst, we will have to investigate the movements of the group to begin to understand how it functions, as well as who is involved.\n\nBut shortly after that we will have to start clamping down on their atrocious crimes."

 NOV_meet_with_shukshin: "Meet with Shukshin"
 NOV_meet_with_shukshin_desc: "The President of the Federation, Alexander Pokryshkin, is to meet with the mayor of Barnaul, for there has become a need to discuss the issues that are key to the lives of the people of Barnaul and the future strength of the Federation as a whole.\n\nBarnaul is rich in agriculture, food that is desperately needed in the overpopulated cities throughout the Federation. An agreement must be made between the two parties, otherwise both their prospects will be bleaker.\n\nWe must hope that Pokryshkin finds a beneficial settlement with the mayor, for the betterment of both their people."

 NOV_a_bountiful_relationship: "A Renewed Contract"
 NOV_a_bountiful_relationship_desc: "A conclusion on the future relationship of Barnaul and Novosibirsk is about to be reached between President Pokryshkin and Mayor Vasily Shukshin. He will learn of the benefits of living under the authority of Pokryshkin, Shukshin will also be made aware of the need to pay for such a vital service.\n\nShukshin will have to listen to our demands, for the sake of Barnaul's security he will offer his farmlands. The fertile fields of Barnaul will be used to the betterment of the entire population of the Federation, not just the people who live under the mayor.\n\nHe will learn that he must cooperate with our interests."

 NOV_tighten_control: "A Firm Grip"
 NOV_tighten_control_desc: "Stability has to be increased within the Federation, we can not risk any form of dissent in case it evolves into a more violent form of resistance. We can not allow violence to occur, we owe the people peace within the borders that they live, they surely understand this. The government has to tighten its control over the state, after all they are aware of the dangerous alternatives to stronger authority.\n\nBecause of this reason, they must be allowed to strengthen their grip, they know what is and is not good for the Federation and they will make sure everyone is safer."

 NOV_the_soldiers_soviet: "The Silovik State"
 NOV_the_soldiers_soviet_desc: "In contrast to its neighbors in the region, the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay is a Silovik State: a polity where the political processes are under the guiding hand of the former and sometimes current military personnel. As a result, many civilian bureaucrats wishing to participate in traditional party politics find themselves barred from running for office, and the compliance demanded by the Siloviks of their non-military counterparts can often be too much.\n\nAnd all of this - they are by design. Russia has moved past the need for a Soviet Union, for a Central Siberian Republic, or for the monstrous and brutal ideologies that seek to dominate Russian political thought. The pedestrians may chant, "fucking Siloviki, man," at every injury, but they are not aware of the bastion that protects them from the harm of ideological thought."

 NOV_the_champions_of_industry: "The Champions of Industry"
 NOV_the_champions_of_industry_desc: "One hallmark that distinguishes the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay from the likes of the mystical king in Kemerovo, the Black Army in Kansk, and the Republic in Tomsk is the presence of corporations that dominate the daily life of its citizens. Three of the most dominant are the Feniks, Sibir, and Titan, each specializing in the different sectors of the economy. The Feniks, the most aggressively pro-Silovik of them all, are manufacturers of military equipment. The Sibir, who are vaguely aligned with Mayor Shukshin of Barnaul, is the primary source of our agricultural tools as well as financial experts. Lastly, there are the Titans, the leading pioneers and technocrats within Novosibirsk's society.\n\nWhen the time comes, President Pokryshkin will have to decide where his allegiances lie. Perhaps, down the road, he may even choose the people instead. All is possible, in the city where the sun sets."

 NOV_the_rising_phoenix: "The Rising Phoenix"
 NOV_the_rising_phoenix_desc: "There is a long history between President Pokryshkin and the Feniks Corporation. The state relies on the latter to provide military equipment for defense against its neighbors, and the former provides them with political clout to protect their labor practices... or lack thereof. Founded by prospective Siloviks after the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, it has enjoyed close relations with the Federation in general, and the office of the Presidency in particular. They are certainly a reliable partner, steadfast in their dedication towards defending the Federation from external, material threats.\n\nWho are we to say no? The Sibir may offer increased agricultural production and economic growth, but these factors will not defend Novosibirsk from all who choose to plunder its wealth. No - to match its defense in the political realm against extremism, the state needs armaments to fight it in the day-to-day life as well. When the Republic calls, the Feniks shall answer."

 NOV_the_siberian_bear: "The Siberian Bear"
 NOV_the_siberian_bear_desc: "The Sibir Corporation has a bit of an odd history regarding its founding. In the public's image, it is associated with the Mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, one of the rare civilian politicians that had found success within Novosibirsk's Silovik-dominated political system. Founded by the landowning bourgeoisie that had come into existence after the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, they produce agricultural equipment and produce, as well as financial institutions that have helped many in Novosibirsk escape the poverty of the working class.\n\nTheir question is both political and economic: the Feniks has been in a business relationship with the Federation since their founding, and signing contracts with Sibir is a risk. However, Russia will not be at war forever, and military equipment will not help us against the grip of poverty. If the President wishes to quell extremist thought within his Federation, then the best antidote may be economic prosperity."

 NOV_glory_to_the_pioneers: "Glory to the Pioneers"
 NOV_glory_to_the_pioneers_desc: "Progress is the sole keyword of the Titan Corporation. Specializing in delivering technological solutions to mundane problems, they have become the forefront in Central Siberian science, competing directly with the Modernists in Tomsk. Considering that they were cut from the same cloth, it is no wonder that they are so successful. However, unlike the idealist Modernists, the scientists, technocrats, and investors of the Titan Corporation do not care much about their contribution to universal science. They are a scientific organization within a free market: therefore they must compete. Sadly, this apathy extends to their labor practices, with long hours and hard work expected of the average employee.\n\nThe Federation will invite the wrath of the people should it choose to side with the Titan. However, we all are not so privileged to pay the price of progress."

 NOV_overtures_to_the_people: "Overtures to the People"
 NOV_overtures_to_the_people_desc: "The people of the Federation are restless. They look upon the power of the Junta and the corporations with worry and apprehension. In order to placate the people, we should loosen the reigns ever so slightly. This is not to say we will let them have free reign, but a lighter touch is perhaps the smarter way forward.\n\nFirst, we should lessen the restrictions on the press. Allowing a freer press will give the people a way to see the benefits of our rule. Of course, the proper content restrictions will still apply, after all, it would be foolish to allow the slander of the Federation.\n\nSecond, we will need to give the unions a slightly larger degree of autonomy. Giving the workers a (state-sponsored) union to air their grievances too will allow us to better keep them under wraps. These unions will, of course, have only so much power and will ultimately answer to the government.\n\nFinally, there must be a general de-escalation of repression against the middle-class in particular. While they will still need to be restricted, a lessening of restrictions will grant us better support amongst them, and will therefore allow us to better control the working class."

 NOV_always_an_even_trade: "Always an Even Trade"
 NOV_always_an_even_trade_desc: "The Federation is, like many other polities, a collectivity arranged upon the interests of many. Classes, corporations, unions, and the government - these all vie for supremacy within a system that allows their forces to coalesce and compromise. As such, the Federation's political system is always a zero-sum game. A move made somewhere can never be reverted. It is a harsh system, but politics have been pitiless and cruel since the beginning of time.\n\nAs such, the President's decisions will matter in a lot of ways - but we cannot foretell what the future holds for the Federation. All he must do is to live with the consequences of his actions, should they arise. Novosibirsk and Altay gaze at the future, and a cautious optimism rises in the heart of its citizens. Someday, what Bukharin had built as the center of Siberia shall be the beating heart of a new Russian political system."

 NOV_veterans_of_the_siberian_war: "Veterans of the Siberian War"
 NOV_veterans_of_the_siberian_war_desc: "One of the greatest advantages Novosibirsk has over its regional opponents is our comparatively large and experienced army. An army whose soldiers cut their teeth on the front lines of the Siberian War, before our eventual secession from the Republic that has since shrunk back into Tomsk. By studying our past battles and examining our successes and failures, we can improve the effectiveness of our forces.\n\nThe experience of our troops will likely give us a great advantage in future conflict, as the armies of our neighbors remain undisciplined and under equipped."

 NOV_our_own_shock_troops: "Our Own Shock Troops"
 NOV_our_own_shock_troops_desc: "Our generals have devised a plan to expand the scope of our armed force, by investing in special training designed to improve our unit's ability to strike fast and effectively through opposing armies. These soldiers will be skilled in breaking through enemy front lines, limiting the amount of damage future wars will have on our army and citizenry.\n\nFurthermore, deployment of these elite troops will certainly continue to heighten our military edge over the rest of the region and deter any warlord or state foolish enough to plan an invasion against us."

 NOV_the_skies_are_ours: "The Skies Are Ours"
 NOV_the_skies_are_ours_desc: "An air force is a rare asset to any force in Central Siberia, or indeed the rest of Russia, but Novosibirsk was fortunate enough to inherit the majority of the Central Siberian Republic's air force, along with many of its officers who now make up our government. Included among the officers who set up the new government is President Pokryshkin, the "Siberian Falcon" himself.\n\nImprovement of the existing infrastructure and air bases, as well as development of new technology for our air force has proven a popular idea amongst these ministers who plan to push forward these proposals. The skies of Central Siberia will remain ours to control."

 NOV_mechanized_infantry: "Mechanized Infantry"
 NOV_mechanized_infantry_desc: "As one of the few states of Russia that still maintains a capable and decently sized industry, we should use it to our advantage and expand our mechanized forces. Our Federation's armed forces will gain a great technological advantage, as other states remain comparatively unarmored.\n\nThe increased maneuverability will also help to capitalize on any breakthrough we make, which would make us become an unstoppable military force."

 NOV_the_fruits_of_the_siberian_plan: "The Fruits of the Siberian Plan"
 NOV_the_fruits_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "Novosibirsk was one of the places that benefitted the most from Bukharin's Siberian Plan. Since those times, our industry has seen a large step up in its output. The Federation's economy is still developing because of it, with new factories continuing to open, advancements being made in construction technology and the expansion of infrastructure across the state.\n\nAll of these factors have greatly improved our industrial efficiency, allowing us to produce a greater volume of equipment for our military, bringing us another step closer to national reunification."

 NOV_the_virgin_lands_campaign: "The Virgin Lands Campaign"
 NOV_the_virgin_lands_campaign_desc: "A new plan has emerged from our government to help alleviate the large amount of stress that has been put on our agricultural output. Put simply, as our population has inflated, our production of grain has not. This issue is rapidly becoming the greatest crisis in Novosibirsk, besides the enduring pandemic.\n\nFortunately, the plan our government has come up with deals with both the food shortage and the disproportionate population, by resettling refugees in farmsteads where the land is yet to be cultivated. Ultimately, this will start improving agricultural output and the lives of the refugees."

 NOV_crack_down_on_the_strikes: "Crack Down on the Strikes"
 NOV_crack_down_on_the_strikes_desc: "Workers have started to resort to direct action. Factories lay dormant and hollow throughout every city; production has slowed to a sluggish pace. We can only assume that the workers have become uppity because of their "unfair" conditions, but we cannot concede, or they will soon be asking for the earth. Our government has determined to crush these strikes and put the working classes back to work.\n\nThe crackdowns will escalate tension with our workers, but a few disgruntled factory labourers being put back to work would be a much more preferable outcome than constant deadlock and economic inefficiency."

 NOV_ramp_up_arms_production: "Ramp Up Arms Production"
 NOV_ramp_up_arms_production_desc: "The army will need more arms if it is to continue to expand large enough to absolutely dominate the region and bring the rest of the lands of Central Siberia into the Federation, through threats or force. An increase in production quotas for all armaments is to be ordered by the government to help with the expansion of the armed forces.\n\nMany of the recent actions of the government have upset the workers, this is unlikely to improve the situation. And if the tensions persist, grave consequences will face the Federation in the future."
 
 NOV_the_beating_heart_of_siberia: "The Beating Heart of Siberia"
 NOV_the_beating_heart_of_siberia_desc: "Novosibirsk thrives, the streets are brimming with people, factories are chocked full of workers and any crime that remains is practically unnoticeable. The city is so rich that even the few beggars that remain appear fed and decently clothed. Such spectacles are a stark contrast to the anarchy of the east and destruction to our west.\n\nIt appears that our decisions have turned out better than we could have ever expected, not that there was ever any doubt of their success. Developments in agriculture, industry and even our stability have made Novosibirsk the most desirable city throughout Siberia, despite the cost of some freedoms."

 NOV_our_destiny_made_manifest: "Our Destiny Made Manifest"
 NOV_our_destiny_made_manifest_desc: "Novosibirsk has spent the last arduous months fighting its internal issues: drugs, crime and socialist agitators, but these problems have been solved and our position has become strengthened. Instead of looking in, it is time to look out from our current borders. Generals have already been ordered to start drawing up their war plans, in preparation for the battles that they are to fight. With the fight of the Federation's army under their command, our conquest of Central Siberia is all but assured.\n\nFor the Falcon's wings are no longer clipped and it is time for the Federation to take flight."

Terrain deemed unusable in winter months, are now fully accessible in spring. Roads, once impervious to the flow of men or machines, are finding themselves clogged with the movement of soldiers and vehicles.\n\nAs tensions rise, and armies mobilize, it is clear that war is on the horizon, and if we are to emerge victorious in the struggles ahead, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels."
 
 NOV_encourage_forward_thinking: "Encourage Forward-Thinking"
 NOV_encourage_forward_thinking_desc: "Clouds gather on the horizon, and if the Federation is to emerge victorious from the wars sure to come, we must not only ensure that our people possess faith in and a desire for our eventual victory, but also that they work to advance it.\n\nTo that end, we will work to properly educate them about the future that could be, the Russia that could be, if they will only work for it. Expected increases in civil participation and work ethic cannot but support our goals, economic and otherwise, and should therefore be pursued."
 
 NOV_a_rural_urban_base: "A Rural-Urban Base"
 NOV_a_rural_urban_base_desc: "If we are to remain stable, strong, and united for the challenges we face, both now and in the future, we must ensure that our people feel a sense of true community. Currently, within the Federation there is an acknowledged split in experience and outlook between our rural communities and our industrialized urban centres. We must correct this.\n\nA campaign of education with a specific focus on appealing to the shared experiences of both communities will be commissioned. In doing so, we will ensure that we speak to members of both, show them the experiences of the other, and unite them all behind the state for the tribulations ahead."
 
 NOV_the_patriots_federation: "The Patriots' Federation"
 NOV_the_patriots_federation_desc: "Our efforts to convince the people of the need to support the state continue. It has been proposed that we communicate to the people the exceptional nature both of Russia and of the Federation, and in so doing encouraging newfound patriotism within them for the unifications ahead.\n\nIn addition, by focusing on those particular exceptional properties of our state, such as our independent and optimistic spirit, our provision of voting rights to those who give honorable service, and more, we can shape this patriotism into its most valuable form."
 
 NOV_hybridize_the_state_apparatus: "Hybridize the State Apparatus"
 NOV_hybridize_the_state_apparatus_desc: "A decision must be made on the construction of our organs of state, and it has been proposed that we act to integrate our military and civilian apparatus, consolidating functions, influence, staff, leadership, and more into new, hybridized forms. This is clearly the superior choice.\n\nBoth sectors are each inextricably linked into and directly impact our national security situation, and by remaining separate present many vulnerabilities for our enemies to exploit. Joining them together will reduce the number of these opportunities, and better secure the state."
 
 NOV_look_to_our_roots: "Look to Our Roots"
 NOV_look_to_our_roots_desc: "A decision must be made on the construction of our organs of state, and it has been proposed that we focus on strengthening our institutions along the lines of foundational practices through reinforcing federalist principles within them. This is clearly the optimal choice.\n\nThe Federation was established along strong roots of controlled democracy and federalist practices, and we cannot permit the compromise of these for any reason, as such threatens the overall identity of the state. Despite the concerns of some, our state will remain secure - by remaining true."
 
 NOV_entice_the_giants: "Entice the Giants"
 NOV_entice_the_giants_desc: "The captains of industry within the corporate giants are a critical part of our country's development and no effort can be spared in pleasing them. It was with their support that we have turned the Federation into a state truly worthy of existence, and it is with their support that we will unite all of Russia under that state.\n\nTo entice them into supporting us further, we will offer them some benefits to reward them for their aid up until now, such as appointment to economic positions in our government and making our taxes on them even more lenient than they already are. While this will blur the line between corporation and state further, that is a necessary sacrifice for leading Russia into greatness."

 NOV_sunrise_democracy_sunset_dictatorship: "Sunrise Democracy, Sunset Dictatorship"
 NOV_sunrise_democracy_sunset_dictatorship_desc: "When the dawn comes upon the soil of the Federation, the apparatus of state welcomes its light unto the foyers and antechambers of democracy. Here, at the start of each day, the magistrates and bureaucrats serve the people. Counting local votes, adjusting economic policies, and directing the flow of goods - all in the name of ensuring that the people are well-cared-for. At midday, when the civil servants go to lunch, the President and his Siloviks tour the country, seeking support. However, like the Tsars, Emperors, General Secretaries, and Premiers before him, his power was never in question. When night falls and the earth grows dark, the Security Service prowl the streets of the city, seeking to root out those who oppose the righteous dictatorship.\n\nThus is the unspoken motto of the Federation: democracy at sunrise, a monarchy at midday, and a dictatorship at the end of the day. Quiet falls over the fields of Siberia, and no whispers of deceit could be heard: not from communists or idealists. Only the beating heart of Russia sustains its pace in the silence."
 
 NOV_order_and_stability: "Order and Stability"
 NOV_order_and_stability_desc: "While expanding outwards and reclaiming those parts of Russia under opposing governments is well and good, if we do not work to maintain order within liberated areas and secure them under our control, the ensuing disorder and unrest may very well harm production, or worse, lead to an end of our grip in outlying regions.\n\nAn increased garrison and bolstered police presence would do wonders for the power we wield in the areas we take from other governments in Russia, as well as ensure that nobody dares to oppose our plans, regardless of ideology. The sooner order and stability are returned throughout land under our rule, whether recently acquired or a loyal part of our state, the sooner our good and steady governance can be used to make our principles a reality."
 
 NOV_temporary_military_governors: "Temporary Military Governors"
 NOV_temporary_military_governors_desc: "Unfortunately, we can't trust newly liberated territories to not fall right back into extremism if given the opportunity through a civilian government. As such, we will pass a new law to place any and all new lands under a temporary military administration to maintain order and eradicate extremist ideals before true integration into the Federation.\n\nThe military governors will be given absolute authority to deal with any suspected treasonous activities, barring direct orders from the government in Novosibirsk against specific actions. Although this will last only as long as absolutely necessary, this is unlikely to be popular among the people of such territories, so we must warn the military governors to avoid upsetting them further if possible."
 
 NOV_the_industrial_preservation_act: "The Industrial Preservation Act"
 NOV_the_industrial_preservation_act_desc: "Industry is a critical part of waging any war, for the factories keep the men armed and unarmed men don't wage war very well. However, at the current rate our industrial base will be unable to keep up with our expansion, and thinning supply lines might mean more death or even defeat for our armies.\n\nAs such, the Industrial Preservation Act has been proposed, to keep the maintenance of our current factories going and increase the speed with which new factories are constructed. This act will allow us to industrialize further and therefore maintain the current rate of reunification of Russia, and there is little doubt that the faster Russia is reunified, the better."

 NOV_maintain_the_trans_siberian_railway: "Maintain the Trans-Siberian Railway"
 NOV_maintain_the_trans_siberian_railway_desc: "The Trans-Siberian Railway serves as an artery of the region, a vital connection between the most critical cities and towns to the continued operation of our government. Letting it fall into disrepair would more than simply be a mistake, as it could be fatal to our plans, with the ease of transport for our soldiers and support for our supply lines vanishing if it falls too deeply into disrepair.\n\nWhat's more, much of the economy, both local and national, is dependent on the continued success of the railway. We must immediately set about repairing those parts of it in need of it and restoring it to peak condition, as well as maintaining it well in the future to ensure it does not fall into a similar situation."

 NOV_stamping_out_the_embers: "Stamping Out the Embers"
 NOV_stamping_out_the_embers_desc: "There exists, in the heart of every Siberian, the flame of rebellion and idealism. Bukharin, for all his failures as the leader of the Soviet Union, has become the Siberian Prometheus. Arising from the ashes of the communist state are thinkers versed in ideological debate and discipline, incitors of ideals and violence, carriers of fire and innovation. The Central Siberian Republic, the culmination of this blazing passion, shattered as soon as the wind blew against the course of their destination.\n\nFrom our sanctuary in the heart of Siberia, the Federation marched out, triumphing over the remnants of the Central Siberian Republic. For here, we shall say: no, to the brutality of idealism. No, to the senseless waste of ideology. No, to the unbridled rage of humane passion. No, we say, to the fire that has burnt around us, within us, as the soles of our boots fall upon the last streaks of ember. The days past and future are gone. There exists only the present."

 NOV_a_sovereign_heartland: "A Sovereign Heartland"
 NOV_a_sovereign_heartland_desc: "Silence reigns where the noise and din of the marketplace once ruled. Where merchants from faraway lands come to haggle their goods in the bazaars of thought that were once the Central Siberian Republic, now their stalls lay upturned on the gravel streets, their contents gathered at the pyre, waiting for the single match stroke. The Narodniks, Communists, Anarchists, Idealists, Rurikids - all are priests of false gods masquerading as an intent of human innovation and improvement. Nothing they offer could enlighten a person to his sovereignty. The noise and din offer nothing but flirtations with the meaningless.\n\nThe Federation has embraced the silence. Where ideals had once been worshipped, we have dragged the idols of these ersatz divinities and cast them out. There is nothing noble in idealism. The act of believing in a higher ideal does not render one a paragon. The brutality of ideologies is over, and sovereignty reigns alone, supreme."

 NOV_the_victorious_federation_desc: "At last, Central Siberia has been united under our authority, with our rivals in the region vanquished and their loyalists scattered, forced into hiding or exile. However, for the continued success of our Federation, much work remains to be done.\n\nFirst there is the matter of consolidating our gains, by integrating the new territories more closely and securing our boundaries. Then we must consider how to stabilize our rule and satisfying the people, in hopes of restoring the law, order, and stability that is so desperately needed. Many problems remain, but beyond them lies a bright future for the Federation."

 NOV_bread_and_games: "Bread and Games"
 NOV_bread_and_games_desc: "Above all else, everyday people desire just two things: bread to feed themselves with, and games with which to entertain them. So long as these are provided and made easily accessible, there will be little cause for unhappiness and unrest among the people, and therefore very little room for extremist organizations to grow and gain strength.\n\nWhile some sacrifices must be made to achieve this, they are more than worth the current and future stability of our state."

 NOV_appoint_new_governors: "Appoint New Governors"
 NOV_appoint_new_governors_desc: "Although the practice of appointing military governors of freshly conquered territories has served us very well, it was always intended to be a temporary measure due to the fragile nature of the situation we were in.\n\nNow that we are in a more secure position, it is finally time to make good on our promise to remove them, and appoint new ones in their place to aid the integration into the Federation of new lands, as well as the restoration of stability and reduction of popular unrest."

 NOV_enshrine_the_silovik_state: "Enshrine the Silovik State"
 NOV_enshrine_the_silovik_state_desc: "We must push forward with the idea of a state built on the principles of national stabilization and strength above all else, and managed by military officers who have proven their competence.\n\nEffective and capable men are necessary to unite all of Russia under the Federation, and the past failure of states such as the Central Siberian Republic, which thought of stability and security as secondary concerns, has only proven further the necessity of this structure for the sake of peace."
 
 NOV_reward_our_allies: "Reward Our Allies"
 NOV_reward_our_allies_desc: "Promises are promises, and we made quite a few of them to our corporate friends during our time of crisis. Now that we are in less immediate danger, they expect these promises to be kept, and our government has always at least met expectations.\n\nWe shall grant them new and more generous contracts with the Federation, to allow them to expand into and exploit the resources of the new territories under our control. This will make their past investments into our cause profitable and convince them that continued cooperation with us would be in their best interest."

 NOV_trust_in_the_party_of_power_desc: "What is needed above all else by the people is prosperity for them and stability of the state, and we cannot rely on popular will to bring this about. Democracy has failed us in the past, and giving it another chance would be a serious, and possibly fatal, mistake.\n\nInstead, our objective should be solidifying our control over the state apparatus and levers of power, in order to centralize the powers of the government and give the people what they should have, even if it is not what they want."
 
 NOV_a_nod_to_democracy: "A Nod to Democracy"
 NOV_a_nod_to_democracy_desc: "Though it might seem unwise to rely once more on a system that failed us all miserably, there is an argument to be made for allowing the masses a greater measure of democracy, mainly that it would serve to placate those hesitant to accept our government.\n\nThis would take the form of minor concessions and reforms within the state, as well as opening more leadership positions to civilians and supporters of democratic power. Of course, we would not go so far as to allow the people to have real power over us, but by appearing to scale back our control over them, they might be more eager to serve our purposes."
 
 NOV_a_controlled_political_spectrum: "A Controlled Political Spectrum"
 NOV_a_controlled_political_spectrum_desc: "Although they have little actual chance of taking power again, it's always wisest not to underestimate the ambitions of the extreme movements of the left and right.\n\nIn order to weaken them, and therefore strengthen our government, we will play them against each other, distracting them with their petty ideological struggle while convincing the people of their dangerous and violent nature, thereby slowly reducing them to irrelevancy without us having to act openly against them. By doing so, we will take control of all politics in the Federation, and keep the demagogues in check."
 
 NOV_consider_barnauls_position: "Consider Barnaul's Position"
 NOV_consider_barnauls_position_desc: "Novosibirsk may be the administrative center of the Federation, but the adjacent city of Barnaul is also an important lynchpin in our nation. Its mayor, Vasily Shukshin, has quickly grown to be the second most powerful politician within the halls of power, and his particular views on how the state should be run have become more prominent as well.\n\nUnfortunately, Shukshin's rise has caused some rather predictable tension with his main rival: President Pokryshkin. In order to put a stop to this bickering before it gets out of control, perhaps it would be prudent to reach out to Shukshin and see if he's willing to compromise in some way."
 
 NOV_the_vestiges_of_revolt: "The Vestiges of Revolt"
 NOV_the_vestiges_of_revolt_desc: "The scars of the Workers' Revolt still remain, and if nothing is done soon they will continue to fester unabated. We must remind the working class of Siberia that no matter what their grievances may be with our administration, rebellion will not be tolerated.\n\nIn addition to repairing the damage still left over from the fighting, we will restore order to the industrial sectors of the region and let any potential dissenters know that we are still in charge. Several methods have been proposed, and it will ultimately be up to our wise and noble President to decide which would be the best course of action."
 
 NOV_the_sovereign_security_act: "The Sovereign Security Act"
 NOV_the_sovereign_security_act_desc: "No preventative measures are too drastic when the safety of our people is on the line! Terrorists and would-be revolutionaries lurk behind every corner, and our current means of dealing with them simply is not sufficient any longer. A stronger, more iron-fisted approach is necessary.\n\nThe Sovereign Security Act will be our savior in these dark times. Our counter-insurgency forces will enjoy increased funding and supplies to perform their duties with enhanced efficiency, while certain political liberties abused by our hidden foes will be cracked down on. This is not likely to be a popular act with our people, but hopefully they will realize the necessity of such measures when our streets are safe again."
 
 NOV_sensible_concessions: "Sensible Concessions"
 NOV_sensible_concessions_desc: "Some would suggest that an iron-clad hand is necessary to prevent unrest amongst the labor, but they fail to realize that such methods would only inflame working man's anger even more. The last thing we need right now is to pour gasoline on the embers of the last disaster, so perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nWe shall reach out to prominent union leaders and labor activists to work out some sort of arrangement that would be best for both parties. If successful, we will kill two birds with one stone: our workers will have no reason to revolt against us, and our industry can finally achieve its past glories. All that remains now is to make the arrangements."
 
 NOV_maintaining_the_equilibrium: "Maintaining the Equilibrium"
 NOV_maintaining_the_equilibrium_desc: "For the first time in many months, our cities are finally returning to their pre-revolt orderliness, but there is still work to be done. Old ghosts from the unification wars still haunt our new territories to this very day, and they will need to be excorcized if our Federation wishes to move forward into a bold new future.\n\nA heightened police presence will dissuade our new subjects from any foolish action, but a strong show of force is only half the battle. Meetings will be held with the provincial governors and mayors across Siberia to discuss the best way to finish the integration of these troubled lands. With luck, we won't have to give too many concessions in the name of stability."
 
 NOV_active_measures: "Active Measures"
 NOV_active_measures_desc: "There are many ways one can influence the course of history to their liking. Some of these methods may appear small, but make big changes in the grand scheme of things. After all, if a ship changes its course only slightly, the destination shall be entirely different. In this instance, our destination is a strong and stable Russia.\n\nOur security forces are no stranger to manipulating the chain of events to suit our purposes. A few dishonest media campaigns here, a counterfeit document or two there... all our agents must do is pull a few hidden strings, and the minds of our people will be forever focused in a more suitable direction. After all, an ignorant citizen is a content citizen..."
 
 NOV_special_administrative_zones: "Special Administrative Zones"
 NOV_special_administrative_zones_desc: "Our foes during the unification wars were a diverse bunch, if nothing else. From the mad monarchists of Kemerovo to the armchair philosophers and artists of Tomsk; they all had vastly different approaches to governing their lands, and bafflingly enough? Most of them worked.\n\nWhy change what is already working? As long as these regions remain loyal to us, there is no need to crack down on them. "Special Administrative Zones" have been established in these formerly hostile territories to continue the administrative methods of their previous owners, while still bringing them in line with our own ideals of governance. Any regions whose administration cannot be adapted, however, can always be granted to our friends in the industrial sector..."

 NOV_all_things_in_union_desc: "The challenge may have seemed insurmountable at first, but at last we can say that our administrative troubles are over. The last wounds of the Workers' Revolt have finally healed, while our new lands continue to adapt well to the Federation's laws.\n\nMore importantly, however, it seems our political disagreements with Barnaul have also been mended, at least for the time being. At last, President Pokryshkin is finally free to shape Siberia however he sees fit. With all the moving parts of our nation working in harmonious unison once again, our Federation will be reforged into a nation of iron; worthy of claiming the mantle of the legitimate Russian government!"

Siberia contains the potential to become the foundation of a strong Russian state, one that will extend its might from the Pacific to Moscow.\n\nIn order to properly realise Siberia's potential we must leverage our already impressive industrial base to exploit the wealth of the region. With the help of the National Champions, our economic growth will be truly frightening to behold."
 
 NOV_establish_educational_standards: "Establish Educational Standards"
 NOV_establish_educational_standards_desc: "How can we hope to cultivate a world-class economy when our people continue to go about their lives without an education to speak of? To say that our education system is in shambles would allude to the existence of such a system to begin with. In reality, any semblance of a proper schooling body fell into the abyss along with the rest of the Soviet Union over two decades ago.\n\nLet us finally lay out the groundwork for a proper education system. We shall develop new curricula and guidelines for the classrooms, to make sure that the students of the Federation are being taught in the ways of the modern world."

 NOV_grants_for_research_and_development_desc: "We're never going to be able to stay ahead of our rivals when the entire Federation still uses technological methods that wouldn't look out of date thirty years ago. Unfortunately, having an advanced society is a bit more complicated than just waiting for skilled scientists and technicians to appear.\n\nTo speed the process along, we shall strategically designate certain sectors within the nation to receive specialized grants to aid research and development. Once we grease the wheels a little, the next generation of scientists will be within our reach."
 
 NOV_repurpose_the_siberian_plan: "Repurpose the Siberian Plan"
 NOV_repurpose_the_siberian_plan_desc: "Up until now, the Federation's industrial might has been built on the back of Bukharin's Siberian Plan. While the Siberian Plan was by far Bukharin's greatest achievement, it cannot be denied that the industrial base it was responsible for has been lagging behind in the march of progress.\n\nWe should use the plan as a template with which to create a modern and improved plan in order to meet the needs of a modern industrial state. It will be up to the industrial theorists and brilliant minds of the Federation to build this new plan, but when it is complete our industrial might will be unassailable within Russia."
 
 NOV_promote_the_national_champions: "Promote the National Champions"
 NOV_promote_the_national_champions_desc: "The corporations of Feniks, Sibir, and Titan are the engines that keep the Siberian Federation rolling. Without their considerable economic power at our side, it is likely that we wouldn't have been able to come as far as we have. They provide boundless employment opportunities, unmatched industrial expertise, and most importantly economic growth beyond our wildest dreams.\n\nOur national champions deserve a central role in the economy. This has been the case all along, of course, but it is time to make this arrangement official. The Federation shall march forward with its loyal corporations as its greatest weapon!"
 
 NOV_expand_the_factory_city: "Expand the Factory City"
 NOV_expand_the_factory_city_desc: "Novosibirsk is widely known as a "factory city"; an industrial lynchpin that is sometimes regarded as more of a giant factory than a place where people make their homes. Indeed, this city is the most industrialized in all of Siberia, and we see no reason why we shouldn't embrace this fact.\n\nWith the help of our loyal "national champions", Novosibirsk shall be expanded far beyond its current, already extensive capabilities. This city shall be one that never rests; where the factories stretch beyond that which the eye can see, and work day and night to build a stronger, safer future for all of us."

 NOV_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Under the soil of Siberia lie vast reserves of oil and natural gas, fuel hydrocarbons, the lifeblood of the modern age. Until now, those riches lay mostly unexplored, but that must end very soon. We must organize and consolidate the energy extraction industry.\n\nNo longer to be left in the hands of small companies and adventurers, the nature of this business demands intense capital, and our government will grant that. With the guarantee of profit to our private partners and investors by way of an established monopoly and government inputs, the Siberian energy sector will be genuinely efficient."

 NOV_the_riches_of_siberia2_desc: "As we continue to expand our industrial base it will be imperative to keep up a constant flow of resources to feed the engines of progress. Thankfully, the lands of Siberia are rich with the natural resources that will be essential to driving our ever growing economic needs.\n\nWith the aid of our good friends and allies in the National Champions it is only a matter of time before the vast wealth of Siberia will be available to us in quantities unheard of before.\n\nThe riches of Siberia must be exploited for the good of the Federation."

 NOV_supervise_the_agricultural_sector_desc: "The lands of the Altay near Novosibirsk are incredibly fertile, being almost without compare in the region and a potentially invaluable asset to our plans.\n\nHowever, attempts to make use of this natural bounty are impeded by the great disarray and inefficiency present in our agricultural sector, a problem that we are increasingly forced to give our attention to prevent it from worsening.\n\nFortunately for us, there is a simple solution to this, which is establishing firm and vigilant supervision of the whole sector, allowing us to streamline and organize it."
 
 NOV_subsidies_for_mechanization: "Subsidies for Mechanization"
 NOV_subsidies_for_mechanization_desc: "The Siberian peasantry has so long been utilizing awfully outdated methods and techniques, with some of them dating from the times of the Tsars. This backwardness produces two worrying consequences for our Federation: A low agricultural output and large swaths of our workforce being tied up in inefficient activities.\n\nWe will mechanize our countryside. With subsidies and loans, our farms will be able to afford the most modern machinery, rapidly increasing production and breaking our reliance on large numbers of manual laborers."

Our economy, our state, neither are exempt from these rules. As we continue our efforts to reunite Russia, and our economy expands with our borders, so too will our state have to make use of this expanded economy to improve the lives of its citizens.\n\nIf we do not, we run the risk of inspiring a level of popular unrest we can't afford to have at such a critical moment. As such, we will devote more of our industrial output to the creation of various products that make the lives of consumers easier and more convenient."

 NOV_the_siberian_air_fleet_desc: "The air forces of the Federation have always been one of its greatest advantages, soaring above to rain fiery death upon those of our enemies unlucky enough to be below them, and shooting down any foolish enough to try and oppose them in the air.\n\nHowever, it is becoming clear that it is growing severely outdated, the planes little more than toys in comparison to those fielded by many modern states. We must begin work immediately to modernize and improve our air fleet, and close the technological gap of our proudest military branch."

 NOV_inspect_japanese_jets_desc: "The Empire of Japan shares plenty of the blame with the Nazis for the fall of the old Union and the fracturing of Russia. They occupy rightful Russian lands and are unmatched in their arrogance, and yet it cannot be denied that they are a world leader in technology.\n\nThe Japanese are especially adept in the area of aviation. Though it would be easy to turn our noses up at the Japanese and their technology, for now we must swallow our pride and study the designs of their jet aircraft.\n\nFor the good of the Federation."

Now that our control of Siberia is secure, it's time to put those bold plans to fruition and start producing those flying machines.\n\nThe factories of Novosibirsk will start assembling Kamov's model of a coaxial rotor utility helicopter, unlike anything our enemies have. This fast mobile transport will give our troops a cutting edge on the battlefield."

 NOV_incorporate_new_territorial_armies_desc: "Many of the lands conquered by the Federation fielded impressive armies when they still had their independence, even if they weren't so impressive as to be able to prevent defeat and annexation by us.\n\nIt would be wise to incorporate the best of these forces into our own military, growing it significantly and allowing us to have them fight those we face next. Though we must be cautious, so that our armed forces do not become infested with extremists, we also cannot afford to be too picky in these chaotic times."

 NOV_siberian_war_doctrines_desc: "Fighting across nearly the entire breadth of Siberia taught us much in the ways of fighting Siberian warfare. We came up against many forces, unique in their doctrines and methods of warfare, and though we did eventually come out victorious, there were certainly instances in which forces even smaller than our own managed to inflict heavy losses on us, and even eke out a few small tactical victories.\n\nWe should seek to incorporate these practices and doctrines that our fallen foes utilized, so that we might further professionalize our fighting force. We can only become stronger for it."

Throughout the Siberian Unification Wars we learned a great deal about our armed forces' effectiveness, its strengths, its skills, and most importantly, its weaknesses.\n\nThese past few wars have exposed some glaring weaknesses in our army. They taught us what our soldiers were good at, and what they were very poor at. These were hard-won lessons, and must not be forgotten as we work to improve and modernize our military doctrine.

 NOV_a_central_design_bureau_desc: "Research of new and improved technologies and designs to implement them for practical use are critical to the advancement of our state, but both have a certain risk to them. Left uncontrolled and undirected, research and design can easily become useless, or even counterproductive.\n\nTo protect against this and ensure efficient and coordinated scientific work, we will establish a Central Design Bureau, responsible for oversight of all practical research, the design of new technologies, and the organization of all scientific efforts."
 
 NOV_infantry_support_vehicle_designs: "Infantry Support Vehicle Designs"
 NOV_infantry_support_vehicle_designs_desc: "Modern warfare requires vehicles that are both capable and reliable. Operating across the vast distances and in the harsh climate of Siberia, we have become well accustomed in what makes an effective vehicle.\n\nDespite that, we remain dependent on foreign or pre-war vehicles for almost all of our needs. Not only are these foreign goods of dubious quality when they arrive here, they are often not suited for the demands we place on them. We will, therefore, design new, domestic vehicles specifically for our needs in this demanding environment, and in so doing ensure our army's effectiveness and viability."
 
 NOV_a_siberian_mbt: "A Siberian MBT"
 NOV_a_siberian_mbt_desc: "In a similar vein to our motorized vehicles, our main battle tanks are also a weak point for our military. The vast majority of them are either over a decade old at this point, or just the scraps of the Japanese or American military handed out to some warlords we conquered. This is a state of affairs that can continue no longer.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, modern warfare is synonymous with armored warfare, and if we find ourselves unable to domestically produce armored fighting vehicles when the time comes to bear our arms against Germany, we will lose. Investing a small portion of our budget towards developing sufficient armor technology now is securing our future later."

 NOV_innovate_on_the_kalashnikov_desc: "The Kalashnikov assault rifle has become the gold standard for fighting in Russia, with each relevant contender for dominance fielding hundreds of Kalashnikov models for their armies, either Zlatoust originals or local made copies.\n\nDespite its effectiveness and popularity, it is not a machine without flaws. Our engineers are promoting a series of improvements to the assault rifle, planning to make it lighter and more reliable with aims to give our mobile troops the edge they need."

 NOV_our_geopolitical_future: "Our Geopolitical Future"
 NOV_our_geopolitical_future_desc: "With the Federation's position secure, and Russia quickly stabilizing under our rule, we can begin looking outwards towards the world. Given the relatively non-ideological nature of our government, we find ourselves with great diplomatic opportunities.\n\nJapan and its Sphere seem happy to deal with us and our corporations, as does the United States, which has even indicated it would support us in a conflict between us and Germany. The Federation's future is still uncertain, but if we can secure allies to help defend us, and trade agreements to reinforce our economy, there will be nothing we can't do."

 NOV_travel_to_the_east_desc: "Our position in Central Siberia is secure, and the time has come to turn our attention back to the world. To revive our dormant foreign service and once more make our presence known, however, reduced we may be.\n\nSo, we turn east to the lands of the Empire of the Rising Sun, across the Mongolian Steppe, and to the Land of the Free, our neighbors across the Arctic Circle. Russia is back!"
 
 NOV_establish_japanese_relations: "Establish Japanese Relations"
 NOV_establish_japanese_relations_desc: "Russia has, at this point, had a decently long history with Japan, and much of it isn't good. Despite that, Japan remains one of the globe's foremost superpowers, and its influence, much like Germany's or the United States', stretches far across the globe.\n\nIt would be foolish of us not open diplomatic ties with the Sphere and start working on improving our relations. Besides, history needn't dictate the future. It so happens that our governments and economic setups are rather alike, and cooperation between our two nations could bring about great prosperity. Let us see what we make happen."
 
 NOV_propose_the_mongolian_pipeline: "Propose the Mongolian Pipeline"
 NOV_propose_the_mongolian_pipeline_desc: "One of Japan's greatest weaknesses has always been natural resources. The ravenous Japanese economy simply never had enough on the home isles to sustain itself. It's a big part of why Japan went on to conquer so much of Asia. Their war machine simply could not function without the coal of Manchuria and oil of Indonesia.\n\nEven now, an inefficient Sphere still struggles to keep up with the material demands of Japan. Fortunately for us, resources have always been among Russia's greatest strengths. We produce almost everything, and in great amounts as well. We should see if Japan wouldn't be opposed to the construction of a pipeline through Mongolia to facilitate materials trade between our two nations."
 
 NOV_the_twin_eagles: "The Twin Eagles"
 NOV_the_twin_eagles_desc: "Across the Pacific, America enticingly beckons to us. Among the three great superpowers currently manipulating politics globally, the United States has shown itself to be the most stable of the three. Like ourselves, they recognize the benefits that business can bring, and utilize such industrial strengths to become one of the most powerful nations on Earth even before the Second World War.\n\nThough there are those who wouldn't consider us as democratic as, say, the old Central Siberian Republic once was, the United States has demonstrated a willingness in the past to support such governments regardless provided they are working against Germany or Japan. We should exploit this by reaching out, and seeing what deals can be made."
 
 NOV_discuss_arctic_partnerships: "Discuss Arctic Partnerships"
 NOV_discuss_arctic_partnerships_desc: "Though relatively underutilized from a trade perspective, the Arctic region offers unique benefits for those around it - including ourselves.\n\nFor Russia, not only is it a viable trade route through which we can ship goods to the Atlantic now that we've lost the former Leningrad, but it is also an avenue through which we can exert our own political power and potentially align some nations with our own.\n\nWe should reach out to other Arctic countries, and see what economic partnerships can be made between our industrialists and theirs."
 
 NOV_a_bipolar_partnership: "A Bipolar Partnership"
 NOV_a_bipolar_partnership_desc: "At last, we have taken the necessary steps towards decisively aligning ourselves with a powerful Pacific government and deepening the association between us, finally creating a partnership with them certain to stand the test of time.\n\nWhile this decision came with no shortage of controversy from those who had favored a deal with the other power, it is done and there is nothing they can do about it now. There is little reason for them to be bitter, either; we have reaped great rewards from our improved trade with our chosen partners, and the benefits have been seen by everyone that matters."
 
 NOV_missions_to_our_neighborhood: "Missions to Our Neighbors"
 NOV_missions_to_our_neighborhood_desc: "Though we might seek allies abroad, it would be unwise to neglect those states neighboring us, allowing our relationships with them to deteriorate. These include the Kazakhs, their future long since tied to that of Russia, the Chinese, once our rivals in the east and now a promising opportunity, and the Mongols, caught between us and the Sphere.\n\nUntil Russia is reunited, conflict with outside states is one of the last things we can afford. Additionally, much of our economy depends on trade with our neighbors, and we must avoid lost profit where we can."
 
 NOV_partnerships_in_china: "Partnerships in China"
 NOV_partnerships_in_china_desc: "In spite of domination and exploitation by the Japanese, China has become a truly large market, with easy and largely secure investments, and it only continues to grow as time passes.\n\nThough their ability to act on their own is limited, we will reach out to them within the boundaries they possess under the watchful eye of the Sphere, and forge economic and strategic partnerships to whatever extent we can to strengthen both parties and allow us greater access to and influence in the markets of East Asia."
 
 NOV_a_kazakh_consulate: "A Kazakh Consulate"
 NOV_a_kazakh_consulate_desc: "For centuries, the futures of Kazakhstan and Russia have been inextricably linked, and the present is no different. Much like us, the Kazakhs have suffered tremendously from war, banditry, and abject poverty.\n\nHowever, they have overcome these difficulties just as we did, and are beginning to recover their past greatness. We should immediately dispatch an emissary to reach out to them, in order to establish formal relations and celebrate the beginning of the end of our shared tribulations."
 
 NOV_connections_with_mongolia: "Connections with Mongolia"
 NOV_connections_with_mongolia_desc: "Caught between two worlds, one that of a rising sun beginning to set, and the other a Russian bear coming out of hibernation to avenge its humiliation, the Mongols must align with one or the other to protect themselves in an increasingly restless Asia.\n\nObviously, it would be in our best interest to make every effort to convince them of the benefits of aligning with us. We will initiate talks to improve our relationship with them, securing our trade in the region and ensuring a stable buffer state against the Sphere for the time being."

 ### Superregional tree ###
 NOV_the_siberian_mandate: "The Siberian Mandate"
 NOV_the_siberian_mandate_desc: "After years of struggle the unthinkable has been achieved. The vastness of Siberia has been reunified under one flag. Securing this much of Russia has been no easy feat. To secure our hold we have had to fight off every devil of Russia's past, from monarchists fanatics to fascist thugs to Soviet holdouts. We have vanquished them all and we now stand triumphant as the masters of the east and the rightful government of all of Russia.\n\nThe conquest of Siberia has taken its toll on us. Russia remains fractured but even now we are already one of the largest nations on earth, and administering a territory this massive requires a strong and stable government. We should take this opportunity to secure our hold and ensure that our administration is prepared for the tasks that lie ahead. The final reunification with the west is near, one way or another. We will not be caught unprepared."
 
 NOV_root_out_the_remnants: "Root Out the Remnants"
 NOV_root_out_the_remnants_desc: "The Russian people are grateful to have a strong, democratic government ruling over them at last, but there are still a few troublemakers who wish to overthrow us. These various extremists, whether they be fascists or communists or anarchists or monarchists, are all unified by their hatred for our government. These radicals held low enough profiles to be missed by the first round of crackdowns and arrests we made whenever we defeated their bosses, but now they have returned to make trouble and we must put a stop to it.\n\nThere is no reason to assume what worked before won't work again. A combination of surveillance, sabotage, arrests, and anti-radical propaganda will be enough to cripple the various terrorist societies that have cropped up across Siberia and turn the public firmly against their divisive messages."
 
 NOV_consolidate_the_new_territories: "Consolidate the New Territories"
 NOV_consolidate_the_new_territories_desc: "It is almost impossible to explain just how vast and sparsely populated Siberia is. Outside of a few urban centers like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, it is millions of square kilometers of wilderness and scattered villages. This is especially true of the newly integrated eastern regions. Even the Tsars and the Soviets never fully extended their administrations over this region, and the eastern warlords never came close to matching what they did accomplish. The task of integrating this territory has been left to us.\n\nThe urban centers of the east will form a nucleus of a new administrative web that will cover all of Eastern Siberia. Every town and village, every isolated hamlet, all of them will be assigned to districts and administrative regions, and each will have administrators and politicians appointed to oversee them and represent them within our government. No more will the Far East be an isolated backwater forgotten by the Russian government. It is an integral part of the Russian nation, and it will be treated as such."
 
 NOV_reaffirm_our_commitments: "Reaffirm Our Commitments"
 NOV_reaffirm_our_commitments_desc: "With the sudden expansion of our territory and our associated advance on the world stage, eyes across the world are studying us, watching for our next move to see what it signals. We must show them that we are still the same government they have learned to trust. Our impending reunification of Russia has not changed any of our agreements, and we are still happy to do business with the other nations of the world.\n\nThe acquisition of Russia's longest coastline and several developed ports has made the matter of trade much easier. The nations and companies who have already invested in Russia are excitedly offering to expand operations further. Meanwhile from Tokyo to Washington we have gained the attention of government and business alike. It is time to double down on our message while everyone is watching: Russia is open for business."
 
 NOV_election_season: "Election Season"
 NOV_election_season_desc: "It is no secret that the co-rulers of our nation do not get along. Publicly, Pokryshkin and Shukshin present a united front, but it is well known that they have agreed on little for years. The two men have been able to set aside their differences and cooperate up until now, but with the recent acquisition of Eastern Siberia and the prospect of national reunification growing greater every day, their disagreements have become too great to ignore. The co-rulers have agreed that the only way to settle this is to let the Russian people decide.\n\nShukshin is campaigning on a platform of reform and democracy, pledging to create a truly equal and free Russian Federation with a government elected by and subservient to the people before all else. Pokryshkin has opted for a more conservative approach, stating his commitment to democracy but reiterating that Russia is in need of a strong government capable of uniting and defending its people. Only time will tell which message is more popular."
 
 NOV_spreading_the_sibplan: "Spreading the SibPlan"
 NOV_spreading_the_sibplan_desc: "Before the war, Central Siberia was the site of one of the greatest planned industrial developments in history. The SibPlan transformed a backwards region into an industrial hub and a center of production. Our newly acquired eastern territories were mostly untouched by the SibPlan, and their miniscule industry pales in comparison to that of our heartland. The east must be brought up to standard.\n\nWe shall develop the Far East the same way the Soviets developed inland Siberia. A program of state-planned industrial projects will serve as the foundations for new production centers in the east. We will go further than the Soviets though. While their SibPlan was strictly managed by the state, ours will collaborate with our local corporations, helping establish strong private industry in the Far East."
 
 NOV_funding_the_central_design_bureau: "Funding the Central Design Bureau"
 NOV_funding_the_central_design_bureau_desc: "When Russia was fractured into dozens of warlords, the armies and pilots of Novosibirsk had only one advantage over their foes. While they could not match the numbers or fanaticism of their opponents, they knew they were always fighting with the best equipment Russia had to offer. This was solely because of the Central Design Bureau and the fantastic, innovative weaponry it produced.\n\nThe days of warlords are behind us but the bureau still proves its worth, its staff of designers, engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs all working around the clock to make the next breakthrough that will change how wars are fought forever. We must increase our investment in the bureau, now that we have access to more wealth and resources than ever before. If they could create groundbreaking new aircraft on a shoestring budget, imagine what they will be able to do with the resources of all of Russia at their disposal."
 
 NOV_national_priority_projects: "National Priority Projects"
 NOV_national_priority_projects_desc: "It is clear everywhere you look that Russia is rebuilding. Shops are opening, vacant buildings are being filled and new ones are being built. Shelves are fully stocked for the first time ever and the people are going back to work, but there is still much to do. We have come far, but there is still a long way to go before Russia is fully ready to retake its place on the modern global stage. It is our duty as the Motherland's government to help her get there.\n\nTo assist the recovery and rebuilding efforts, four programs have been selected for government funding and support. Dubbed the 'National Priority Projects' by the media, they focus on improving public health, access to education, housing availability and quality, and agricultural development. By supporting improvements in these four vital areas we are progressing towards a point where Russia is not just reunified, but rebuilt and prosperous at last."
 
 NOV_expand_the_voenkomats: "Expand the Volkomats"
 NOV_expand_the_voenkomats_desc: "Controlling Siberia and the people who live in it has always been a challenge for past Russian governments, and it will no doubt be a challenge for us as well. This is made no easier by the fact that Eastern Siberia is now crawling with ex-military men who fought for one leader or another that now find themselves with nothing to do but grow bitter and resentful of our new rule. These men could be dangerous, but they also present an opportunity.\n\nThe Volkomats, our system of military commissariats, have proven successful in maintaining our control of the nation and keeping extremist organizations on the run. Expanding this system to encompass our new territory would help lock down the east. Recruiting disaffected army officers, black shirts, and NKVD agents into the Volkomats would give us a way to put the skills of these unpleasant people to work for us while placing them firmly under our control."
 
 NOV_our_eastern_bastion: "Our Eastern Bastion"
 NOV_our_eastern_bastion_desc: "The port city of Magadan used to be so insignificant it didn't even appear on maps of eastern Russia. During the decades of anarchy, it became important because it was Russia's largest unoccupied port, but even then, after years of improvements made by the various warlords who have controlled it, it is still barely up to the task of serving as our primary port.\n\nRebuilding Russia will require doing significant amounts of trading and business with the nations of the world, and our ability to trade with them is limited by our port's capacity. Both business and government officials have been urging us to invest more into Magadan, and to complete its transformation into Russia's new doorstep to the world. Ask and they shall receive. Magadan will become worthy of the responsibility thrust upon it, and we shall finally have full, unfettered access to the global marketplace."
 
 NOV_a_disciplined_force: "A Disciplined Force"
 NOV_a_disciplined_force_desc: "Our military is one of the best in Russia. Our reunification of Siberia is proof enough of that for anyone. But being the best in Russia does not mean we are ready to take on the world. So far, our military has fought bandits and warlords, and semi-industrialized regional rivals, but we have yet to take on a full, modern, and war-ready military power, and considering the dangerous state of the world, we may have to sooner than we'd like.\n\nThe technological gap between our forces and those of the Germans and the Japanese is shrinking, due to the heroic efforts of our design bureaus, but technology alone does not make a modern army. It does not matter how good the gun is if the man is too afraid to fire it. Our army is not a disorganized rabble, but its discipline still leaves room for improvement. We will see that these improvements are made, and our men are refined into hardened warriors, ready for the conflicts ahead."
 
 NOV_winds_of_change: "Winds of Change"
 NOV_winds_of_change_desc: "The people have spoken and their will is clear. After years of rule, Alexander Pokryshkin has finally tasted defeat at the ballot box, and Vasily Shukshin has been elected to lead the Federation forwards to a new, brighter future! Shukshin and his supporters have announced plans for a bold new wave of liberalization and reforms that they say will finally bring freedom and democracy to all of Russia.\n\nWhile Shukshin's supporters are celebrating his victory, those who backed Pokryshkin's continued rule are already voicing their concerns. The leaders of the military have expressed reservations about a weakening of the central government, and the boards of Russia's new megacorporations expect it will be much more difficult to deal with a government that is truly beholden to the interests of the people. Let them complain all they like. They shall be the first tyrants to fall before the might of a free Russia, but not the last."
 
 NOV_demokratizatsiya: "Demokratizatsiya"
 NOV_demokratizatsiya_desc: "Shukshin's victory is a triumph for the cause of Russian freedom, but it is only the first step on the road towards democracy. Pokryshkin and his toadies spent years building up their powers and doing their damndest to turn Russia into a one-party state once more. Undoing their efforts will take time, and we must begin with small reforms to prepare the nation for the great changes it has in store.\n\nSoon, the government will launch a new initiative called "Demokratizatsiya" - Democratization. Starting at the local level, the people of Russia will now be able to elect their leaders and representatives. Once a sufficient permanent election structure is in place, we will be able to organize regularly scheduled elections at last. Other early reforms will include passing term limits and preparing to implement a separation of powers among the various departments of government."
 
 NOV_curb_the_corporations: "Curb the Corporations"
 NOV_curb_the_corporations_desc: "A new piece of legislation has been introduced recently that would put in place some token limitations on the activities of the corporations. The limits are trivial at best and mostly have to do with implementing the bare minimum of government oversight on stock trading, but the proposed law has still attracted significant attention from the people and the corporations for one reason. It used to be the case that legislation like this would be shot down immediately before even going to a vote, but this is no longer the case.\n\nPresident Shukshin will place his full support behind this law, and encourage his supporters to do the same. On paper, it really is little more than a token effort, but it will signal to the whole nation that Shukshin is no crony of the corporations. We may not be able to end their influence right away, but we can make it clear to the world that the days of Russian companies exploiting Russian people for foreign money will soon be over."
 
 NOV_dreams_of_federation: "Dreams of Federation"
 NOV_dreams_of_federation_desc: "When it was originally conceived, the Russian Federation was supposed to be Russia's best chance at democracy. The idealism of the Central Siberian Republic was always doomed to failure, but the Federation could provide a practical, reasonable alternative that would reunite the Russian lands and peoples and secure a future defined by freedom and stability. What it morphed into under Pokryshkin's rule was a bastardized, authoritarian imitation of the original goal, but the damage can still be undone.\n\nSlowly, surely, the people of Russia are starting to wake up. They are realizing that this new President's promises are not false, and his words are not empty. The Russian Federation really can be a nation of practical democracy rather than corrupt authoritarianism. After decades of bitter winters, spring is coming to the Motherland."
 
 NOV_business_as_usual: "Business as Usual"
 NOV_business_as_usual_desc: "In a result that surprised no one, the people of Russia have voted to continue Pokryshkin's reign as President of the Federation, picking his record of success and commitments to stability over Shukshin's radical promises of liberalization and weakened government. Acquisitions from the opposition of vote tampering and suppression have been widely dismissed by the media and the people, and the stage is set for the Siberian Falcon's rule to continue.\n\nThe President knows that this is no time for a weakened government and a divided people. Russia is still divided, and there are enemies within and without our borders who will work nonstop to tear down what we have built. The President will not let them. He has brought us this far, and the Russian people know that only he can lead them through what is to come. To change course now would only be to steer into a storm."
 
 NOV_entrench_our_position: "Entrench Our Position"
 NOV_entrench_our_position_desc: "In many ways the election was a gamble, a test to see if the President's popularity could overcome his reputation as an authoritarian leader, and to see if the party's position was strong enough to stand up to an election we (mostly) avoided tampering in. The institutions held, but in some places just barely. The vote was closer than we liked, and there is work to be done before the next round of elections eventually come around.\n\nDistricts and voting precincts must be redrawn to better represent the loyal citizens of the Federation and avoid empowering radical elements. Stricter voter ID laws must be put in place to clamp down on rampant voter fraud in certain regions. Even the process for filing as a candidate must be revisited to make sure only candidates registered with approved parties can run. The party will not be put in a situation where it could be overtaken by radicals again."
 
 NOV_lucrative_contracts: "Lucrative Contracts"
 NOV_lucrative_contracts_desc: "Eastern Siberia may be an underdeveloped region, but if you look below the surface it is teeming with wealth in the form of valuable resources and minerals. Even more important in the modern era is its stockpile of human resources. Millions of Russians live in our newly acquired eastern territories, each of them a potential consumer. The corporations are practically salivating to get permission from the government to expand their operations to the Far East, and we have a chance to profit off of their enthusiasm.\n\nA new round of government contracts in the Far East will expand the reach of our loyal and helpful corporations, firmly entrenching Russia's greatest companies on the global financial stage. Incentivized private investment will also help develop Russia's sparsest region. Last, but certainly not least, we will make an ungodly amount of money on the contract bidding."
 
 NOV_the_guiding_hand: "The Guiding Hand"
 NOV_the_guiding_hand_desc: "Only a few years ago Russia was a land of weakness, ruled by petty mewling warlords more concerned with pillaging their motherland than rebuilding it. It took men with vision, strength, and persistence to put a stop to this, but the time of weakness is done. Pokryshkin and his allies have vanquished the traitors, radicals, and anyone else who stood in the way of a united Russian Federation, and now they shall finish the job and reunite Russia once and for all.\n\nNo more will the peoples of the Motherland fight against one another, divided by harmful political ideologies and crippled by tyrannical invaders. Under the strong and unquestioned leadership of President Pokryshkin, the citizens of Russia stand as one against any who would try to stop their progress. Without his leadership, they know none of this would be possible. Without his guidance, they know no further success could be had. How lucky then, that when Russia needs him most, Pokryshkin is here to lead the way."
 
 NOV_towards_a_glorious_future: "Towards a Glorious Future"
 NOV_towards_a_glorious_future_desc: "To be Russian these days is to watch destiny unfold before your eyes. It is to see a nation rising from the ashes like a phoenix, born from the most unlikely of embers. No one could have guessed an ace pilot leading a ragtag band of military men and disaffected local politicians would establish the next government of Russia? Who would have guessed a warlord army operating out of Novosibirsk would reunite the entirety of eastern Russia? Against the odds, the Federation has persisted, and now it stands triumphant, its final victory drawing near.\n\nTo be Russian these days is to stand at the middle point of a long road. Behind you are the decades of suffering and violence that have been overcome. Ahead lies great uncertainty, and the potential for conflict to put all of the hardships of the past to shame. But there is also the potential for something brighter, something better. Russia has come so far so quickly. The only thing left to do is keep pushing forwards, to whatever lies at the end of the road."

 NOV.1.t: "Evening Tides"
 NOV.1.desc: "The evening passed Alexander Pokryshkin by like a warm, sunset-tinged blur. The President of the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay - to use his long-form title that even he found cumbersome - was hosting a dinner to honor the veterans of the Great Patriotic War. A few of them were his friends, but all were comrades. In the neatly ceramic-tiled dining chamber, the bawdy jokes of the aces echoed down the silent halls, booming through the rooms of the Presidential Palace.\n\nSome of them did not partake in the festive occasions, however. Standing on the edges of the crowds were silent onlookers whose faces were tinted with a colorless pallor: of joy long lost. The war might have left Novosibirsk and Altay, for now. For these, it never left them. Call it battle fatigue, shell-shock, Pokyrshkin sighed. There was no cure to the eternal affliction of soldiers.\n\nA hand tapped his shoulders. "Mr. President!" a powerful voice thundered behind him, catching Pokryshkin off-guard. "Long time no see." The man looked askance at him as if expecting a trigger to click in his head. "I-" the man started, his voice quieter than before. "We were in the academy before. You know, the flight school."\n\n"Oh, huh. Nice to meet you, Mr...? Apologies. It's been a bit. Surely, you can understand the occasional forgetfulness on my part."\n\n"No, no. That's not important." A hand waved his apology off. "Still got your head in the clouds?"\n\nPokryshkin arched a curious eyebrow. "I don't seem to recall. Can I entreat you to enlighten me?"\n\n"No need." Pokryshkin watched as he left, past the crowd, and into the night."
 NOV.1.a: ""Curious fellow.""
 
 NOV.2.t: "The Federation's Destiny"
 NOV.2.desc: "As Alexander Pokryshkin stepped up to the podium and began to speak, the audience listened in rapt attention. For he had been, and was now, speaking of great futures to come.\n\nIt was no secret, he began, that the Federation was beginning to look outward, across the borders of the limited territories that it now occupied, and towards those occupied by the other statelets. Vast expanses, laden with resources, people, and strategic positions. Expanses that would, in time, fall under the Federation's control.\n\nIt was only natural, he continued, that the Federation, with Novosibirsk at its heart, possessed a special destiny not seen elsewhere in Siberia. It was the largest city east of the Urals, formed a critical junction on the primary route of travel across Siberia, and lay in a major region of development of Bukharin's Siberian Plan.\n\nWas it not, he concluded, therefore logical that the Federation would leverage those advantages to reclaim lands rightfully belonging to it? Further, having accomplished that goal, was it not similarly logical that the Federation would continue expansion, over all of Siberia?\n\nOf course it was, Pokryshkin thundered. It was not only logical, it was inevitable. It was right. The Federation had a destiny, a right, to unite Siberia. It would do so. And on that great day, would it stop? No, he said decisively. It would continue pursuing its final destiny - dominion over all of Russia.\n\nWhen he was finished, all applauded. All agreed that it had been a fine speech. But many were doubtful that the dream presented could be delivered. Would they be proven wrong, in due time?\n\nThey hoped so."
 NOV.2.a: "An impossible goal?"
 
 NOV.3.t: "A Situation Report"
 NOV.3.desc: "The President placed another sheet of paperwork aside before the ink from his signature had even dried, trying to work through a week of red tape in an hour before he was set to meet with Glinka. Now, that hour was almost upon him as his eyes flicked between the clock just above the door and the paper before him. Finally, breaking the tension, the rapping of Glinka's knuckles at the door could be heard. "Come on in, Dmitry."\n\nThe door swung open and Dmitry shuffled in holding a stack of papers, dropping it on Alexander's desk and adding onto the mound already collected there.\n\n"What's all this?" asked Alexander, lifting up the first sheet of paper, but glancing to his old friend first.\n\n"Police reports. The workers and the socialists are getting much more agitated with the conditions; this is twice as many civil unrest related arrests as last month."\n\n"Concerning..." nodded Alexander, "But predictable. I figured there'd at least be more of a catalyst, though."\n\n"There is. The grain shortages are getting worse, which means less food for the workers, which means more are taking to the streets so they can earn more money to feed themselves with grain that we simply do not have."\n\n"Christ... I'll see what I can do, and I'll keep looking through these."\n\nDmitry nodded and headed back out the door. Stopping just short of the threshold, he turned to hear another word from his President, "And keep up the good work, Dmitry.""
 NOV.3.a: ""Thank you, Sir.""
 
 NOV.4.t: "Watchful Enforcers"
 NOV.4.desc: "It was far from a usual day for the everyday people of Novosibirsk. Confused glances and shocked stares were aimed at the new presence on the streets, gazes which were quickly turned away once they were returned. This was the police they thought, yet not the police they knew. They were better armed, there were a lot more of them, and they looked downright mean. It was clear they meant business, and in Novosibirsk, there was little more valuable than meaning business.\n\nA few people whispered, here and there; a friend of a friend had said this or that about the government wanting to eradicate terrorism, and that the police presence was to keep an eye on the ordinary people that the Narodniks blended into so easily. Soon, the whole street knew the news, then the streets nearby, and by the end of the day everyone in the city knew they might be unknowingly watched at any moment. For once, all the complaints of the citizenry was silenced, all their usual bravery frozen in place. Instead of the usual dissatisfaction of the age, they felt something they hadn't felt in a long time. Fear.\n\nEvery boot that hit the ground, every glare shot at a gathered crowd, every officer placed at a key position to keep watch as all manner of people passed by, served only to reinforce that fear, a sort of dread comparable to being caught in a spider's web with no escape. As the days passed and the people grew used to the officers, however, the sense of fear settled down into a feeling of security, of protection. The spider's web had begun to feel more like a safety net for the common person.\n\nAs for the uncommon person- the Narodnik, the spy, the common thief- the spider quickly began to feast. And when screams soon silenced were heard at night, nobody questioned why some officers needed their uniforms cleaned. It was better that way."

 NOV.5.t: "A Meeting in Barnaul"
 NOV.5.desc: ""Sorry, I don't have much time for pleasantries, but we really must get down to business."\n\nAlexander Pokryshkin was blunt as usual as he sauntered into Shukshin's mayoral office in Barnaul. The President was there, in person, to negotiate for further grain imports to the city in light of the growing threat of famine in the capital.\n\n"Of course, Mr. President." Shukshin nodded, gesturing towards a seat across from his desk, which Pokryshkin quickly filled.\n\n"People are dying, Mayor. This needs to stop, and soon."\n\n"Right - how much grain do you need?"\n\n"How much can you give me?"\n\n"Not enough to end any famines, but enough to last you until we have a more stable supply certainly. It's really not entirely my grain; several businesses have moved into the region and bought up the farms, which makes securing food for the state and moving it considerably harder."\n\n"It's important, Vasily."\n\n"...Christ, I'll see what I can do," replied Shukshin, picking up the phone and sliding open a drawer full of various scrap paper scribbled with phone numbers. "This may take a bit;""

From the walls sounded the clanging and chittering of daily vagaries, while the fireplace before them crackled, radiating heat and light. "You look like you could use one."\n\n"Indeed you may," Shukshin said, "my throat is parched." He laughed. "The farmers expect an orator, and I am afraid I don't have the voice for it. It's tough being a mayor," He met Pokryshkin eyes. "But I imagine it is harder to be a President."\n\nPokryshkin gave him a wry smile. "You don't even know the half of it." The President of the Federation unscrewed a bottle of vodka and poured its contents into two shot glasses. Handing the other to Shukshin, he raised his cup to eye-level. "To the Federation."\n\n"To the Federation." Shukshin returned his toast and downed the spirit in one gulp. Pokyrshkin did the same. "That is some good, strong vodka. It's hard finding a good distillery this far east. Is it grain?"\n\n"Yes. Fruits of cooperation between Barnaul and the rest of the Federation." Pokryshkin smiled. "Deeds, not words, Shukshin, is how we will hold this Federation together." They sat in silence, while the fireplace crackled. "One more drink?""

 NOV.7.t: "Spoils to the Deserving"
 NOV.7.desc: "Mikhail was a man who had long been active in the Federation's industrial landscape. He owned several, and had bought and sold many more, factories and plants of all kinds. For many years it had been a difficult existence. But no longer. Now the rewards long promised were finally being delivered.\n\nThe benefits pledged by the Siberian Plan had been realized, and economic activity within the Federation was rapidly increasing, both vertically and horizontally. That meant more factories, more jobs, and more production. It also, critically for Mikhail and his contemporaries, meant more money. Lots more.\n\nHe had been watching the stock market all morning, and the shares listed upon it had done nothing but rise. For his company. For the companies of his friends. And, most of all, for the companies that the government had chosen to favor. Even better, the rise showed no signs of stopping.\n\nIt was truly a great day. Of course, there were those who claimed the money was not going where it was needed, or that it should be redirected to those more in need of it, with the exact definition of that 'need' left purposefully nebulous.\n\nBut Mikhail paid them no mind. Wherever the money was going otherwise, enough was coming to him. And, truly, was anyone else more deserving?"

 NOV.8.desc: "As Amet-khan Sultan soared above the lands of the Federation in one of its newest aircraft, he couldn't help but think that, from such an elevated position, they looked little different from those of Crimea.\n\nBut though they may have not looked different, they very much were, and not a day went by when he did not think of the plight both of his homeland and of his people, the Crimean Tatars. The Nazi jackboot had fallen on them over twenty years ago, and showed no signs of being lifted anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, from what little news had reached Central Siberia from those lands, the entire peninsula had been treated as a colonial project by the German Kriegsmarine, and his people had, as would have been expected, suffered terribly. To those few countrymen he had spoken to over the years, there was little hope of ever changing this, and for a long time he had thought the same.\n\nBut the aircraft he now sat in had changed those thoughts. The Federation had many challenges, yes, but unlike many of the states around it, it was still innovating. It was still designing. While others looked to the past, it was looking forward - socially, technically, economically, and militarily. It was looking forward to unification, of Central Siberia and, eventually and with luck, beyond.\n\nPerhaps, in time, it could look once again upon the lands of the Crimean Tatars. And on that day, the lands below his aircraft would not just look like his homeland. They would be them."

 NOV.9.t: "And Quiet Flows the Ob"
 NOV.9.desc: "Vasily Shukshin used to love sitting by the River Ob, back when he had first accepted mayorship of Barnaul in the infancy of Pokryshkin's new state. It was a beautiful time of unfettered idealism and shaky hope in a murky future, and in between debates and briefings, Ob's glimmering waters were always waiting for him. He would find a perch on the rocks, gazing out at the gently rippling waters and listening to the distant cries of birds over the murmur of the river. Idle thoughts would drift lazily through his head or on some days, he would scribble away at some unborn writing project, or simply lay upon the shore in a half asleep stupor dreaming of things to come.\n\nNow, however, things were changing. The waters were getting filthier by the day as more businesses moved into town, raising factories and more along the Ob's bank. Although the Federation, and Shukshin's own values, lay based upon freedom, he could not help but feel perhaps it was leniency that had allowed these industrialists to lay claim to his home. In several meetings, Shukshin had brought up his misgivings with the direction of the town's development only to find many of his trusted aides in the pocket of the very same hounds preying upon Barnaul's newfound prosperity. Thus, he went out to the river once again to think. Shukshin felt conflicted with the idea of pushing the pocketed officials out, as each had gotten there through their own merit. Part of him felt it was vanity, the idea of holding something as trivial as the beauty of the nostalgic river over his own values. In the fields just beyond the river, however, he saw men breaking their backs for a day's wage dropped like crumbs by richer men. Was this corruption, in and of itself, a greater tyranny?\n\nStill, he would have to tackle this problem some other way. But how, when it felt only he could see Russia's pain?"

 NOV.10.desc: "Georgy Langemak stepped into the waiting room, as the soles of his shoes sank into the bright rugs that covered the linoleum and ceramic-tiled floor. Paintings of Suvorov, Peter the Great, and a few other Russian heroes adorned the walls, right beside taxidermied heads of Siberian animals. Moose, bear, deer, and even a few birds, whose eyes were frozen - fixated, but never focused. There were marble busts of Pokryshkin, commissioned from the rare marble blocks left in the city after the Union's fall. Heavens, Langemak thought, these people knew how to make an impression.\n\nSitting down on one of the gray couches, he stared at the polished guns that accompany the animals and paintings, while the air conditioner blew on his hands, making him freeze, just a little. There were no other people in the room with him. Just Langemak and the dead eyes of people as well as animals. He had always known that the Feniks were the showy type, but not like this. Where is the receptionist? Don't they know that this is an important government contract?\n\nThe doorknob turned. A young woman dressed in a suit regarded him with a smile. "I am sorry," she said, giving a slight bow, "but the CEO will see you now."\n\nLangemak stood up and walked across the depths of those bright-hued rugs. "Take me to him, please.""

A receptionist ushered him into a waiting room. "I apologize on behalf of the Sibir Corporation," she said. "However, our Executive Officer is tending to a vital guest. I hope you'll understand." The identity of the guest was apparent: it was none other than the notable - or notorious, if one had been in certain government circles - Mayor of Barnaul. Langemak had chosen today in hopes of slighting the Mayor, but alas.\n\nHowever, the contract the government shall sign with the Sibir Corporation would bring them closer together. Langemak smirked. Pokryshkin knew how these corporations worked. The bottom line was far more crucial to the livelihood of these companies than infrequent visits from an eccentric actor-politician. He took a seat and waited, checking his watch in-between reading magazines sponsored by the Sibir. Most of them were agriculture-related, and most of them depicted golden fields of wheat, their grains undulating under the gentle wind. He waited for close to an hour before the receptionist returned, wearing a sheepish smile on her face. "I am sorry for the delay, sir," she said. "Our guest just left. The Executive Officer will see you now."\n\n"About time," Langemak said. "Take me to him, if you please."\n\n"Certainly, sir.""

 NOV.12.desc: ""Have you heard of Lysenko," Langemak said to the scientist who sat together with him, "Mr. Fedor?" Whoever made the Titan building built it on ultra-modern sensibilities, it seemed. Eschewing the rotund shapes of traditional modernist architecture, the straight lines that made up the silhouette of this structure were grotesque, but, in a way, it was unique. No other building in miles could match its utter disregard for the traditional values; its facade showed an unrestrained disdain towards anything it deemed to be stuck in the past.\n\n"I have," the man who introduced himself as Fedor said, a tone of disapproval ringing clear. "Everyone has heard the rumors from the west at this point."\n\n"Do you figure that the Titan Corporation is in any way similar to that? We have reports, you see, of its... ah, excesses."\n\nFedor laughed with humorless eyes. "Mr. Langemak, sir. We hold Lysenko in contempt. You're talking about a man whose greatest contribution to science was to torture and butcher wheat and examine its grains for omens, like a Roman augur. His ideals are utterly heinous and barbaric - not to mention his brutal methods."\n\n"I see." Langemak said, putting a hand on his chin. "I apologize."\n\n"Progress does have its costs. However, the Titan Corporation knows exactly who to pay." A buzzer rang in the hall. "Seems like it's your turn, Mr. Langemak."\n\nHe gave Fedor a smart nod."

 NOV.13.t: "The Daily Broadsheet"
 NOV.13.desc: "Mikhail walked back to his home in Novosibirsk from the market. On his way out, he had stopped by the newsstand on the corner of the street and purchased the newest copy of the Novosibirsk Gazette. He had been pleasantly surprised to see a new, privately owned, broadsheet at the stall, he had grown used to the state-press and its patriotic drivel. Now though, he could properly enjoy an unbiased paper run by right-thinking Russians telling it like it is.\n\nSitting at the fireplace with a cup of tea and a newspaper felt quite nostalgic for him. On the front page was a picture of striking workers surrounded by corporate security forces. The headline read, "Sibir Workers' Strike! Blood on the Streets." Intrigued, he read through the report. Apparently, workers at a Sibir plant went on strike for higher wages and ended up rioting and killing several Sibir guards. A unit of the army had to be called in to quell the strike and it ended with several dead and wounded.\n\nMikhail couldn't help but be shocked. For the life of him, he could not understand what would compel those workers to strike, let alone so violently. Life was better than it had ever been in Novosibirsk. He had plenty of food on the table every month, his business was doing very well, his wife and her friends had all the time in the world to gossip to their heart's content. Life was good in the Federation, so why were the workers so insistent on complaining?"

 NOV.14.desc: "Aleksandr Mirokhin shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket as he walked down the streets of Novosibirsk. His hands shook as he approached the warehouse. He glanced back down the way he came, half expecting to see corporate goons following him. Up ahead he could see a red ribbon wrapped around the light pole, the agreed upon signal that the meeting was on. Aleksandr was taking the biggest risk of his life in going to this meeting, but he was desperate. The factory he worked at had been bought out by the Sibir Corporation and the new regulations they had imposed had left him practically penniless. He could only just afford his room at the flophouse and went without food on most nights.\n\nHe knocked at the door in the appropriate pattern and waited. The door opened and he was dragged inside. In the dim light of a candle he could see a group of five men and women gathered around what looked like the floor plan of a factory. The woman who dragged him through the door looked him up and down before gesturing him toward the table. "Welcome, comrade. Tell me, why are you here?" she demanded.\n\n"To fight for the people of Novosibirsk and to end the tyranny of the Silovik regime," he responded. He had read the pamphlets and attended a couple of secret meetings before this, though none as important as this one. The woman looked satisfied by his response, if not particularly enthused.\n\nThe woman looked back over the floor plan before she spoke again, "Welcome, Comrade Siniy. We must prepare for your first assignment. The pigs at the Sibir Corporation have opened a new manufacturing plant for the production of top of the line small arms. It will be our job to relieve the plant of its new manufacturing specs, and to cause as much damage to the plant as we can."\n\nAleksandr, or Comrade Siniy as he was now known, felt his throat tighten as a submachine gun was pressed into his hands. Any second thoughts were quickly silenced by the fire he saw in the woman's eyes. This was for the people. It would all be worth it in the end."

 NOV.15.t: "Communist Sympathies"
 NOV.15.desc: "Lev swallowed, throat constricting, a dry gulp that brought no comfort. The bespectacled officer sat in front of him, looming over the private in his great desk. The officer, likely a veteran of the Great Patriotic War, thumbed through Lev's service record and personal papers. He had not spoken since Lev had entered the room, leaving the private to sit in uncomfortable and terrible silence. Finally, as sweat was starting to bead on his forehead, the eyes behind the classes rolled up to meet his. "Mr. Goncharov," he began in a voice as dry as parchment, "I understand you come from a proletarian background. Your father, Andrey Viktorovich, was a labor agitator in Gorky, your mother a worker in the automotive factory. Both," he said, eyes narrowing, "active members of the Communist Party."\n\nSilence settled on the room, and it was clear that the officer expected Lev to say something, "Uh," he started, voice cracked from lack of moisture and fear, "yes, that's correct, sir. I was, um, raised to be communist, but," Lev hastened to add as the officer's steely gaze fixed him like a butterfly in a glass, "of course so was everyone else in those days. I'm a proud member of the All-Siberian Army and I, uh, myself have no socialist sympathies, sir."\n\nThe officer continued to stare for several agonizing seconds, as if picking apart Lev's words. "Very well, Private Goncharov, you may leave." Lev hastily saluted and left the room, restraining himself from bolting like a startled hare. Once he was out of the room, he let out a breath he did not know he had been holding. Things had been heating up in the army, and questionings like this were becoming more commonplace. What worried Lev most of all was the uncertainty of if he had passed the officer's test or not."

He sat at his table in the cafe, appearing as unassuming and natural as possible. Slava sipped nervously at his tea, not really tasting anything but the steam. Where was his contact?\n\nMinutes went by, and Slava was nervous to the point of nausea, but at last, a slender man sat at his table. Slava's heart sank, no, not him. Ludomir Taushev, lieutenant in the All-Siberian Army and one time friend of Slava, was seated in front of him. Taushev's eyes glittered at seeing his old friend across the table, but not saying a word of acknowledgement. Slava, too, kept his composure as best he could.\n\n"Andreevich?" began Slava, using the code name provided to him by his superiors. Taushev nodded, "So you must be Borya." More nods, more nervous and knowing glances. Papers were covertly slipped under the table, codewords exchanged, and the meeting concluded. The two friends parted ways, and with a heavy heart, once he was far away from the cafe and alone, Slava called his superiors in the Army to report Ludomir Taushev for treason."

His children cried, Marya lie huddled in fear, clinging to her husband, and Ludomir stared, stunned, down the barrel of the gun leveled at him. "Lieutenant Taushev," said the soldier behind the shotgun, "you are under arrest for treason against Novosibirsk and the Russian people."\n\nLudomir purpled, tongue working in confused terror and rage and he struggled to formulate his words. "Under whose orders," Ludomir looked at the patch on the soldier's uniform, "corporal?" he finally managed to spit out.\n\nThe corporal spoke matter-of-factly, clearly unaware of how deeply his words would wound the captain. "Captain Slava Khazkukhov ordered your arrest." Ludomir's face fell, defeat settling into his core. Good God, he had been set up.

The bitter Russian winds snaked through the mountain peaks, slicing little bits of flesh from the faces of the men huddled in the rocks. Jerky was passed out, a fire started.\n\n"72 hours, friends," said Lytkin, flicking open a lighter and pressing the resulting tongue of flame to his crudely rolled cigarette. "We've been out here cutting our feet bloody and shitting behind rocks for three fucking days. Hey, Boris," Lytkin tossed a pebble at the dozing soldier, the stone plinking off his old Soviet helmet.\n\nBoris grunted, suddenly straightening, "Fuck off, Lyktin, I was just dreaming about plowing your sister." The smoking soldier ignored him.\n\n"You see any Narodniks around here? How about you, Luka?" He pointed at the mustachioed sniper who looked warily over the rocks.\n\n"No," mumbled Luka, adjusting his ushanka.\n\n"No? Not a single one of us has seen hide nor hair of a Narodnik since we started patrolling the Altay. I'm starting to think those geniuses in intelligence fucked up."\n\nThe men joked and complained, dozed against the rocks, and packed up several hours later.

It was a decrepit structure, all rotten wood and broken glass, a door hanging loosely from its frame like a broken jaw. The patrol had followed the little game trail through the Altay forest for hours, assuming they were once again following a lead long cold. But there it was, squatting in the shadows of the trees like a withered hag\n\n"Well, boys," said Lytkin, his breath misting slightly in the cold mountain air, "shall we knock?" The patrol advanced, weapons held at the ready, bodies hunched low. Boris, rifle aloft, stepped carefully through the underbrush, eyes searching the treeline and ears pricked for any unusual sounds. He should have looked down.\n\nIt was an old weapon, buried in the fallen leaves and primed with a short length of wire. The Germans had called them S-Mines, the Russians, frog-mines. A short 'crumpf' sound issued from the ground as the mine launched itself to the height of Boris' belly.\n\nThe Russian's eyes bulged obscenely, pure terror contorting his face. A microsecond later, the mine exploded, throwing thousands of steel balls hurtling through the air and through Boris. The patrolman was gutted in an instant, the other soldiers flinging themselves to the ground. Lytkin screamed for everyone to stop moving, having to yell over Boris' gurgled howls as he died in pieces.\n\nFear, cold and icy, poured down their backs. They weren't alone up here."

Luka watched the building through his scope, a score of Narodniks in camo around the similarly painted building, eyes nervous and guns held close.\n\nA search of the cabin had revealed little, at first. After a lengthy search, the patrolmen had discovered the burned remnants of Narodnik documents in the fireplace indicating a new safehouse in the Altay. It had taken hours of painstakingly piecing the burned bits of paper back together, but now the patrolmen lay in wait for their enemy.\n\nLyktin, cigarette absent for once, raised his pistol, waving for his men to advance. They killed the first few terrorists with knives, spilling red onto the green. A firefight soon erupted, the crack and pop of rifles and pistols sending flocks of birds to take to the air. After a brief, but fierce, gun battle outside the building, the patrolmen assaulted the safehouse, breaching the metal door with grenades before rushing inside.\n\nThe actual battle took at most half an hour, but to Lyktin and his patrol, it had felt like an eternity. Luka was injured, a bloody shoulder, but nothing a few stitches and some vodka wouldn't fix.\n\nHands shaking, Lyktin reached down to grab a cigarette, but found that he couldn't feel his ever-present pack. He looked down, and was shocked to discover that the first two fingers of his left hand were gone. Lyktin stared at the bloody ruin of his hand, shock and adrenaline having shielded him from the pain. Numbly, he began to wrap it in a discarded shirt.

 NOV.21.desc: ""Don't let him get away!" the security man shouted on the top of his lungs as he hunted the assassin. "He's the one who tried to kill the President!" Despite all his efforts, there was little he could do to disperse the crowds that were fleeing in every direction after the sound of the two missed gunshots echoed in the Novosibirsk Square. He turned around once, to see Pokryshkin with his characteristic uniform being escorted by a squad of agents to safety, somewhere near his residence, but he could not lose track of the assassin as he headed into the narrow roads of the city. With all the energy he had left in him after this exhausting day of preparations, he ran as fast as he could, jumping over objects and pushing over civilians, but always keeping his eyes on the target. However, as he saw him reach the Oktyabrsky Bridge and jump over the railing, he shouted in vain one last time, as the killer fell into the freezing waters of the Ob River.\n\nTwo days later, Pokryshkin was in a highly classified meeting in the Presidential Residence, together with Security Minister Glinka. The proof had been laid in front of him, and it was as clear as day: the Narodniks were behind the recent attempt on his life. The trail of evidence had been followed by his trustworthy subordinates, and now it was time for justice to be served.\n\n"Sir, things are different now." Glinka's hesitation in his voice was obvious, but he continued nevertheless. "We thought the Narodniks were a simple nuisance to the Federation, a small group that could be rooted out. This assassination attempt proves the exact opposite - they are a credible threat with influence in the underworld, and one which will have to be dealt with. There are already security measures in place, but we must go further. We must launch a war against this terror."\n\nPokryshkin nodded in agreement."

Others, younger in age, were less decorated, but one could see their eagerness to work in their eyes.\n\n"My fellow SB members, a looming threat has appeared, one threatening to tear apart what we have worked so hard to build." Glinka knew he had to speak decisively to get the message across. "The Narodniks, unconvinced by our noble state and institutions, continue to wage a campaign of terror and have, in fact, ramped up their efforts as has recently been made clear. It is our duty to restore order to these lands, and eliminate the red menace before it eliminates us. President Pokryshkin has outlined specific measures through which we can fight these radicals, and as leading SB officials it is your duty to implement them. Thank you, and god bless Novosibirsk and Altay."\n\nThroughout the next weeks, the Security Service got to work. Hundreds - if not thousands - were arrested, sometimes due to blatantly clear socialist connections and others due to mere rumors. In the dark alleys of the biggest cities, as well as in the mountainous countryside fit for resistance cells, many were caught, occasionally even after being ratted from civilians. However, inside the government and the agencies, there was still the sense that this was the beginning of something bigger, a general campaign against this terror, to root out the Narodniks once and for all."

They engaged in simple small talk for a time until the topic changed to the current state of the Federation. "Alexander Ivanovich, my friend, I cannot help but worry. Every time I see you it seems as if decades have passed. You seem to have lost the old fire you once had," Amet's eyes radiated worry for his old friend. Alexander took a long moment to collect his thoughts before he spoke.\n\n"If I may be honest with you, Amet, I am tired. The realities of the Federation's position have drained me as sure as anything. Amet, I know you do not approve of all of my actions. Of the state we have built. But I know that you understand why it had to be done. The bickering and the backroom deals, this is not a world for foolish idealists Amet. The failures of the old Union are all around us, and the failures of the Republic were what forced our hand. The people of Russia need a strong nation, led by strong men, not pointless words. You have to understand that," Pokryshkin's voice rose as he spoke.\n\n"I am sorry, Alexander. But I cannot agree. The people are the most important part of this Federation. Not the soldiers and the oligarchs. They deserve better than to be tread upon by the boots of the army and corporate security," Amet could not help but feel that he had wasted his breath. That nothing he could say would ever change his course.\n\nAlexander looked prepared to continue the argument, and he likely would have escalated it as well, but before he could Amet out a hand on his shoulder.

Today, however, the focus was economic, and instead of politicians, it was corporate executives who sat across the ornate conference table from President Pokryshkin.\n\nRepresentatives from all of the major firms operating within Novosibirsk, they had come, following overtures from his government, to discuss a series of potential deals that could be made. Deals that could, Pokryshkin knew, not only have a tremendous impact on the Federation's economic future, but also on the lives of the hundreds of thousands of workers within it. He very much wanted to close these deals.\n\nBut he also knew, keenly, that they would not come without cost. The men across from him were, to a one, sharks beyond measure in their field. A field in which he held little experience. They would not agree to anything that would benefit him or the Federation without ensuring that it would, to a greater extent, benefit them.\n\nPokryshkin was prepared to accept that. The Federation needed these men, and the organizations that they represented. It needed their factories, it needed their capital, it needed their employment and, above all, it needed their support. They could cause no end of trouble for him and his government if they opposed it, in any form.\n\nAnd, so, he flashed them a wide smile, and began to speak."
 NOV.24.a: "A mutually beneficial partnership?"
 
 NOV.25.t: "A Hero of the People"
 NOV.25.desc: "Comrade Siniy walked through the brightly lit halls of the bunker. Here, in the headquarters of the Narodnik movement, he felt free in a way he had never felt before. Though his youthful face was now marred by shrapnel scars, the smile on his lips could not be denied. His comrades stopped and saluted as he passed, a fact which took him by surprise even now after months among their ranks.\n\nHe walked into the deepest layers of the bunker, towards the command center. As he walked, he could not help but reminisce. His first mission with the Narodniks had been a resounding success. The plant had been destroyed and the weapon schematics had been vital to the continued success of the movement. From there, Siniy had participated in countless operations against Federation forces and the corporations they served. Magnates and politicians had fallen by his hands, entire Federation supply convoys had been hijacked and diverted, and in one particularly memorable mission he had destroyed an entire Titan manufacturing plant with little more than a pipe bomb and a well placed bottle of American soda.\n\nFinally, he entered the command center. Every surface was covered in maps, mission briefings, and reports. At the center of this controlled chaos was the leader of the movement, Comrade Chernyy. Chernyy was an old, grizzled veteran of the Great Patriotic War.\n\n"Welcome back, Comrade Siniy. I hope you are well rested. It has come time to go forward with our decapitation strike. The bastard Pokryshkin will be attending the demonstration of some new kind of fighter plane. It will be your duty to kill the bastard." Siniy was in shock. The magnitude of this mission eclipsed any he had embarked in before. Pokryshkin's death would be the culmination of years of planning, and it all came down to him.\n\nHe was ready."
 NOV.25.a: "Pride goeth before a fall."
 
 NOV.26.t: "Margelov's Men"
 NOV.26.desc: "Looking on in disgust, General Vasily Margelov reviewed the airborne troops before him. While they were certainly finer men than most the Federation had to offer, that currently did not mean much. They were relatively out of shape, possessed outdated equipment, and most of all were simply outrageous to any general with good sense, which Margelov liked to consider himself to be. If he didn't know better he'd swear that some of these men were more rat-eaten than their parachutes, though that also wasn't saying much.\n\nThey needed modernization badly, especially in these times, with the Federation surrounded by enemies and potential enemies. There was no question about that. The only question was, how should he go about modernizing them? Their training was in the most obvious need of reform, so certainly he should start there. Even if he were to acquire the finest of materiel, they'd be no good in the hands of men unworthy of holding them. One of the airborne troops was startled awake by his passing, nearly falling over, and Margelov glared at the man in contempt.\n\nThis was certainly going to be a long and arduous journey."
 NOV.26.a: "At least it isn't too late."
 
 NOV.27.t: "Memories of the War"
 NOV.27.desc: ""Gentlemen, it is an honor to have Mr. Suvorov, a veteran of the legendary Siberian War, here with us today. Please welcome him!" The applause as the respected veteran rose from his seat was much louder than when the seemingly irrelevant commander had stood up to introduce him. After greeting his old friends, he sat down again to speak to the young recruits about his experience. Question after question, he answered them all directly and with honesty.\n\n"Mr. Suvorov, how did you come to be an instructor in the Federation's Army?" one of the soldiers asked.\n\nThe veteran was quick to reply. "You see, back when I was in the army, things were not so bright in these lands. The old republic was fighting a seemingly endless war against Yagoda's hawks, but it was failing and I felt like I had to do something about it. That was when I met President Pokryshkin, who was one of the few to look at the situation not through an overly idealistic lens." He was interrupted by someone asking if he had really met the President, but he shrugged it off as nothing too important. "He was planning to bring peace to Novosibirsk and Altay, and I decided to join him in the endeavour. As you know, he succeeded, and here we are."\n\n"Mr. Suvorov, is it true you fought off a communist tank on your own?"\n\n"That is a real story, yes..." he replied chuckling. "We had been in the forests up north when we were attacked by a tank unit. I was away from my platoon, but I was quick enough to grab an old anti-tank weapon and fire it. Unfortunately, others were not so lucky - one of my friends died trying to distract an invading unit." There was silence for a moment. "But the mission was still successful. It was sacrifices like these that got us where we are now, and it is sacrifices like these that will be necessary to restore order to the nation, once and for all. Any other questions?""
 NOV.27.a: "Old soldiers never die..."
 
 NOV.28.t: "Up in the Sky"
 NOV.28.desc: "As his old plane, a gift from the Free Aviators, weaved through the skies, Alexander Pokryshkin could not help but reminisce about the war. He remembered the sounds of explosions, the shrieking of rending metal and the screams of wounded men; he remembered the words of Horst-Wessel-Lied as the Germans blared it from every radio tower in Moscow, and last of all, he remembered the flight east, and the tens of hundreds of thousands of good people who had perished to the Jackboot's inexorable march.\n\nNot all was lost, he told himself as he watched the ground underfoot, the ant-sized soldiers that drilled on top of it. He had this. Pokryshkin didn't want to be a leader to a flight squadron, much less a state, and yet those under his care had not only survived, they had thrived. Things weren't perfect, of course, the terrorists plaguing his lands were proof of that, but nevertheless, life was tolerable.\n\nHe pushed the stick forward, a smile filling his weathered face as he dived down. He never really had time to fly these days, nor the opportunity. Always an AA gun from Tomsk or Kemerovo, always a Kazakh raiding party that had strayed too far, always a foe that needed combating - but today was not one of those days. Today he was free.\n\nAs he wheeled around to face home, Pokryshkin couldn't help but marvel at the city his forces controlled. The smoke of the factories of Novosibirsk was almost comforting, and the distant booming and lights of artillery that had once been terrifying felt in some strange way familial.\n\nHe hadn't wanted to be a leader, but he knew that if he did not fight for his people, then someone far worse than he would. As long as he still drew breath, the Siberian Falcon would defend the people of Novosibirsk, and perhaps one day, all of Russia."
 NOV.28.a: "Perhaps one day, a dove will fly again too."
 
 NOV.29.t: "Fertile Lands, New Beginnings"
 NOV.29.desc: "Konstantin had been rootless for many years. Originally from Tambov, he and his family had fled eastwards during the German invasions and subsequent state collapse and, like so many others, had found themselves with almost nothing, having to leave all land and possessions behind.\n\nArriving alongside thousands of others in the refugee communities outside Novosibirsk, he had scraped by as a laborer when able, while his wife worked in a laundry and his sons ran errands for merchants and artisans. But, no matter what they did, they could not get ahead. There were simply too many people, and not enough well-paying jobs.\n\nThe years of bitter disappointment were such that when his wife told him to sign up for the government's supposed new program, he almost had not done so, thinking it pointless. But now, standing along the road beside her and looking at the vast tracts of overgrown wildlands in front of them, he silently gave thanks once again. Because the land was now theirs.\n\nThe program intended to address the refugee 'problem' by settling them on vast tracts of untilled land, removing them from the overpopulated communities while, hopefully, acting to increase agricultural output. Konstantin didn't know how successful the former would be, but he knew very well that, at least in his case, the latter very much would be. He would make sure of it.\n\nThere was a lot of very hard work to do. The house had to be essentially rebuilt. The fields needed to be cleared and planted. Harvests needed to be planned. Konstantin had never been a farmer, but the future promised for his family could not be ignored.\n\nThey had a home again. Land to call their own. And he would ensure that the state was repaid for its generosity."
 NOV.29.a: "The state provides."
 
 NOV.30.t: "Managerial Response"
 NOV.30.desc: "Thousands of workers were on strike outside of a steel mill in the industrial sector of Novosibirsk. All across the city, similar strikes were being carried out in outrage at the appalling conditions present in the factories. Corporate security guards made a loose and patchy ring around the striking workers, waiting for orders from their superiors on just what to do.\n\nVasily Minkovsky stood in front of the crowd and gave a fiery speech about the injustices of the corporations. He harkened back to the times under Bukharin, where the workers were given generous rights and conditions in the factories were as safe as they could be made. Behind him was hung a tattered flag of the Soviet Union. The workers of Novosibirsk had decided they would not stand for their continued abuse.\n\nAs he came to a lull in his oratory there was a change in the air. The corporate goons had retreated to the offices across the street, and it soon became obvious why. Two corporate IFVs rolled down the street towards the crowd, a man with a megaphone calling for the strikers to return to work. When his demands were unanswered the IFVs unleashed canisters of teargas into the crowd. Cries went up as those nearest the gas panicked and fled, eyes and lungs burning. Corporate goons advanced on the crowd, beating those they caught with batons.\n\nThen a shot rang out.\n\nPanicking workers trampled each other to get out of the line of fire while corporate security fired wantonly into the crowd. Vasily tried to regain some semblance of calm, but it was in vain as he was hit in the gut by a burst of fire from a panicking guard. He fell, reaching for the flag of the Union. As he bled out watching his friends be gunned down by trigger happy guards, he wept."
 NOV.30.a: "All for the pursuit of profit."
 
 NOV.31.t: "Within the Narodniks"
 NOV.31.desc: "It was a stormy night in Novosibirsk as Anton took his seat. The other Narodniks were talking to each other, but he wanted to lay low. Barely any background checks, did the Narodniks suspect him, or were they just that incompetent? As an undercover agent of the SB, Anton hoped he wasn't being fed false information. Immediately after sitting down, a man wearing an old army uniform entered into the room, differing in age compared to the mostly young students who made up the Narodnik cell. "Good evening, comrades," said the older man. "I am pleased to welcome our newest recruit, Anton Levitsky, to the revolution. As you know, our fight against the tyrannical Alexander Pokryshkin is only just beginning. The Narodniks as a whole have seen much success, yet our cell has done little to assist the rest of our comradery. If the revolution is to succeed, we must aim for larger targets."\n\n"Like what?" Said Anton, turning on his audio recorder. "The army has stepped up their game, and we have become a massive priority for the Novosibirsk government."\n\n"I'm sure you know of the many rail lines that cross the Ob River," said the commander. "Taking down an entire bridge will have Novosibirsk cut in half for months!.\n\nAnton grimaced while the other Narodniks cheered. "If I may ask, commander, but where are we going to get enough explosives to destroy the bridge, and who's going to do it? Looking around, we don't seem very qualified," Anton said.\n\n"The commander smiled. "We have an excellent amount coming in from our supplier, and Anton, you applied saying you were a demolitions expert in the Red Army, did you not? I think you'll be perfect for the job. Supervised, of course.""
 NOV.31.a: ""Looks like I'm blowing up a bridge for the Narodniks, then.""
 
 NOV.32.t: "Sabotaging the Saboteurs"
 NOV.32.desc: "Anton stood on the riverside near the bridge as he toyed with the fuse. He was the Narodnik's new detonation man, and while the commander was supposed to supervise him, that didn't stop Anton from sneaking into the bomb's storage room last night to defuse the bombs. The Narodniks would soon be sorely disappointed. "Well Anton, looks like everything is ready," said Pavel, his cell commander, still wearing that old uniform.\n\nTaking out a lighter, Anton took a breath and lit the fuse. "We should probably run farther back, there's a clearing a ways away that should lead to a good escape." And the group of officers waiting to arrest them, Anton thought to himself. He couldn't risk these terrorists getting another chance, even though it was so soon since he joined.\n\n"Are you kidding, and missing this beautiful explosion? We can head to that ridge instead," replied Pavel, and the others agreed.\n\n"Wait-" but it was too late, the others were already following their commander. Anton cursed under his breath and ran after them.\n\nReaching the ridge, Pavel frowned. "Anton, why hasn't the bridge exploded yet? Did the fuse break?"\n\nAnother Narodnik pointed to the bridge. "Commander, the SB! We've got to get out of here!" Looking at the bridge, it appeared the officers had realized the Narodniks were not falling for Anton's trap, instead heading over to cut the fuse.\n\n"Shit! We've got to go before they see us." Anton froze, if he shouted the other SB agents might be able to end it all right there, but some of the Narodniks were armed. Anton looked back to see some of the Narodniks running, and the rifle in the man's arms next to him."
 NOV.32.a: "I'll have another chance."
 
 NOV.33.t: "End of the Line"
 NOV.33.desc: "Commander Pavel paced between each and every Narodnik member, his head down. "It appears we have a spy in our midst. I'm sure we all have our suspicions. Pavel stopped in front of Anton, looking him in the eye. Anton, how do you think the SB knew we were targeting that bridge?"\n\n"I don't know sir, perhaps-"\n\nThe commander interrupted, "Anton, the SB came out of a clearing, the same clearing you wanted us to escape into. Is that just a coincidence?"\n\nAnton gulped, pressing down the button to signal the ambush. It was time. He just hoped the Narodniks didn't shoot him on sight.\n\nA crash came from upstairs, the beginning of the raid. SB agents flooded into the room, down the stairs. Before Pavel knew what was happening, Anton had already grabbed the pistol out of Pavel's belt, holding it to his head. "Pavel Orlov, you are under arrest for treason against the Federation."\n\nThe commander laughed, "Looks like my suspicions were correct, then. You answered more... directly than I would have thought. Comrades, the time has come, let's show we don't go down without a fight!"\n\nThe other Narodniks looked at him, then to Anton, then to the SB agents. Slowly dropping their weapons with their hands raised, the students having no wish to actually die for the revolution. "It looks like you're coming with us, Pavel. Please face towards the wall.""
 NOV.33.a: "One by one, they will all fall."
 
 NOV.34.t: "Reports of Worker Agitation"
 NOV.34.desc: "CLASSIFIED\n\nMultiple suspects are currently under investigation for disturbing the peace, inciting violence, and for multiple charges of conspiracy. Threat posed by these terrorists is unknown at this time. However, suspects appear to be involved with the Narodniks, and appear to have capacity to successfully perform industrial sabotage across numerous locations.\n\nSuspects discovered putting up posters inciting anti-government propaganda, and several suspects discovered distributing weapons to various workers amongst the population. After interrogation, several of these workers informed our agents that the suspects wished for the workers to "overthrow the bourgeoisie" and "bring about the workers' revolution." Several workers were given components capable of constructing an explosive device roughly equivalent to C4. No suspects were captured, and escaped to unknown locations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is clear that terrorists amongst our population are targeting working class demographics, and these terrorists appear to be aligned with Bolshevik organizations. Further investigation is required, but it is recommended that the suspects described on the following page be located and arrested immediately. Industrial sabotage could prove fatal while our government is so reliant on a handful of industrial centers."
 NOV.34.a: "We can't let this get out of hand."
 
 NOV.35.t: "Incident Report - Narodnik Sabotage"
 NOV.35.desc: "CLASSIFIED\n\nREFERENCE: Documents 7A-7F, which detail in-depth profiling of top suspects and photos of the crime scene.\n\nAt 1100 hours, a worker employed in a Feniks arms manufacturing plant detonated an IED while on break. The worker in question, named Ivan Yahontov, was seriously injured in the blast, but was located and detained by civilian authorities. Yahontov had been associating with suspected Narodniks for several weeks prior to the bombing, and appears to have collaborated with two other individuals: Sergei Preobrazhensky (died in the explosion), and Alexei Turgenev (Reported sick day of the incident, was not found at his residence when investigated). The manager of the manufacturing plant was not harmed, and is quite incensed by what he sees as the government's failure to contain the Narodnik threat.\n\nCurrent estimates place damages at a cost equivalent to 2,000,000USD. There are 17 reported deaths and over 30 wounded, of which 17 are in critical condition. Currently, 5 employees of the plant are not accounted for, with the site too damaged and obstructed to allow further searches until a later point in time.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Narodnik threat was greater than previous predictions. Multiple requests for greater resources and for more extensive training have been filed at this time. Feniks has also requested compensation for damages sustained by the blast."
 NOV.35.a: "They may have won the battle, but we will win the war."
 
 NOV.36.t: "Securing the Factories"
 NOV.36.desc: "CLASSIFIED\n\nREFERENCE: Documents 2C and Documents 3A-3K. Documents 3A-3K display in-depth files and descriptions of detained Narodniks and several workers allied with them. Document 2C displays a map of known terrorist hideouts cleared by government authorities, along with locations under immediate investigation.\n\n48 hours ago, several Narodnik agitators were identified and tracked down by our agents in the field. Alongside information extracted from I. Yahontov, a series of raids were conducted. Over 17 arrests have been made against the Narodniks and their allies. Among these arrests are also severely agitated workers distributed weapons by the Narodniks. While not all of the currently arrested terrorists have been interrogated, it was clear that the Narodniks were targeting working class demographics with propaganda, and had already succeeded in converting workers to their cause. Currently, known Narodnik-sympathizers are still being brought in and investigated. Arrests and interrogations are predicted to continue for the next several weeks, until the safety of our industry can be guaranteed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is believed that the Narodniks' capacity to perform industrial sabotage and weaken our government have been substantially impacted by the series of arrests and raids conducted by our forces. The Narodniks will likely not target factories for some time, until they believe government surveillance of factory workers has diminished. It has been requested that this investigation be made a low-priority operation, due to the decreased threat to our industry."

 NOV.37.t: "Hostile Whirlwinds"
 NOV.37.desc: "The clink, roar and ruin of the mine bit deeply into the brain of Foreman Kostin, who breathed to the deep, heavy rhythm of the coal thumper. It didn't bother him so much as it was a part of him, like a familiar ache or phantom pain. His workers, no, his comrades in labor, toiled away beneath the earth at the behest of the capitalist Siloviks, ruining their bodies in the pursuit of coal.\n\nKostin was not a man known for pessimism, and in his heart burned a great and powerful certainty. The slavery of wage labor and the rotten pustule of capital would eventually come to an end. With the crushing success of the Narodniks and the humiliation of the Novosibirsk government, Kostin's hope had been blown from a flame into a roaring inferno.\n\nLater that day, still beneath the earth, in a forgotten shaft, Kostin and his comrades gathered around pictures of Lenin and Bukharin. Oaths were sworn, toasts drunk, and a promise made."

 NOV.38.t: "If Not Us, Then Who?"
 NOV.38.desc: "Foreman Kostin had heard it first from Yegor, the miner with the bright blue eyes who had been a worker in mines for over ten years. Kostin had not wanted to believe it, but after the third retelling it had begun to sink in that the news was not mere rumor or Silovik propaganda.\n\nThe Narodniks have been defeated, their leadership gunned down or rounded up in a recent raid, the coda of a long and brutal struggle between the state and the socialists. Kostin angrily hacked away at the stone with his pick, wishing desperately that the reverse had been true. Capitalist oppression continued, and the dawn seemed very far away indeed. As he used his soot-blackened hands to load chunks of stone into the nearby cart, another thought occurred.\n\nWas the dawn so far away? Indeed, the Narodniks had failed in their mission, but so too had the state expended a great deal of time and resources putting them down. The Siloviks were raw, vulnerable. Suddenly, Kostin grinned, white teeth flashing brightly in the darkness. The iron was hot, the workers furious. Perhaps a second revolt would be what was needed to bring the whole structure crashing down."

 NOV.39.desc: "Seva scanned the plaza. Marketplace, in a rural community not too far from Novosibirsk. Only a few peasants set up their stalls this early in the morning. Terrible security hazard for the President of the Federation to be in public, for something as mundane as a meeting. Yet Seva also knew that in Novosibirsk, a little display of trust often went a long way. The soldier looked toward the reinforced limousine behind him. His boss was no doubt thinking about the meeting ahead. Or thinking about the other meetings of the day. Or not thinking at all, daydreaming about whatever it was that the Siberian Falcon occupied his mind with. Seva knew he couldn't keep up with his boss. That was why the boss was, well, the boss.\n\nAnother dark limousine. A lone man came out around the car, hands empty. Seva stepped forward, his hands away from his own weapon. "Mr. Chernyshevsky?" he asked.\n\nThe man shook his head. Opened the door to reveal his own boss, a short stocky type. Seva recognized the man, a former military intelligence analyst. Behind Seva, the door opened. President Pokryshkin emerged from his vehicle. Any tension from the meeting evaporated as the bodyguard stepped aside and the two powerful men shook hands and exchanged formalities. Seva soon found himself holding a crate of documents. Chernyshevsky's bodyguard held a manilla folder. What was in it? Pokryshkin often gave money or financial insider news in such courtesy calls. Chernyshevsky was an up and coming silovik, a man with a growing network of his own. It was good business to pay respect to men of his caliber.\n\nThe conversation over, Chernyshevsky disappeared into his car and drove away at high speed. Seva took note of the riflemen on the roof relaxing their stance. It paid to be prepared for anything, when one worked in the business of presidential security. The bodyguard sat in the back of Pokryshkin's car, finally allowing himself a moment of rest. His boss looked in a particularly jovial mood. Leafing through the intelligence report, the President smiled contentedly. "It seems that old man Pasternak is on the move again."\n\n"War, boss?" Seva asked. Pokryshkin shook his head. Smiled.\n\n"No, not war. But perhaps the end of peace. Russia is waking up.""

The smoky room was full of serious-faced SB agents, little fireflies of burning cigarettes adding an eerie atmosphere to the dark room. The safehouse was large and well-fortified, constructed in a hidden bunker constructed in Bukharin's time. The Narodniks had chosen well: this would be one hell of a tough nut to crack. "I'll be frank with you," said Glinka, his voice flat and grim, "more than a few of us are going to die breaking into this fortress. From our experience in the Altay, we know that the terrorists have access to S-Mines, so expect the way in to be heavily mined. The door is reinforced steel and it'll take some serious firepower to break it open. Luckily, the Army will be providing what excess explosives they can." The crowd was silent, their eyes on Glinka or scouring the battle map on the projector screen. It would be one hell of a fight.\n\n"This is going to be your hardest test yet, but rely on your training and the man in front of and behind you, and we'll see this terrorist nest blown off the map. God bless you, gentlemen, and goodnight." Glinka dismissed the strike force, hearts heavy with anticipation and inflamed with courage."

 NOV.41.t: "The Final Raid"
 NOV.41.desc: "Luka winced, ears ringing, his helmet suddenly extremely tight around his head. Rubble flaked off his shoulders like dandruff, dust clogging his mask. He shook his head, attempting to clear his senses. Everything stood still for a moment, a perfect crystal eternity that was shattered by the slap on his back plate. Luka suddenly surged forwards, Kalashnikov held at the ready. The concrete tunnels were tight and difficult to fight in, but the breaching blast the SB men had discharged had stunned the Narodniks for the crucial moment needed to take them by surprise.\n\nLuka's gun chattered in the distinctive Kalashnikov language, spitting death at shaken communists. Bullets flew back at Luka and his team, and a round grazed his shoulder, already wounded once by the Narodniks in Altay. Luka ignored the pain, and he and the SB assault team began to clear the bunker, room by room, tunnel by tunnel. It was hard, grueling work, and by the time they had reached the final stretch of corridor, ten of the assault force were dead.\n\nFinally, Luka and the assault troopers stood before the command center door. It was, predictably, reinforced steel, and the demolitions team had already begun to set up a charge. Luka took the opportunity to catch his breath. Around him, the other SB men did the same, sucking in the stale, dusty air of the bunker. After a moment, the rest was over, and the charges detonated. This time, Luka ignored his frazzled senses and rushed inside, shouting for the occupants to surrender.\n\n"Fuck! Fuck!" shouted a man covered in pasty white dust, blood trickling from his nose. "We're done! We give up! Just... just stop killing us. Please." The ringleaders, six in total, of the Narodniks were brought into SB custody, the Red Menace of Novosibirsk finally brought to heel."

 NOV.42.t: "Narodnik Bombings!"
 NOV.42.desc: "It appears we failed to contain the Narodnik threat in time. Multiple bombings of factories and infrastructure have occurred over the past few weeks, all well connected to the Narodnik. Our operatives are rushing to contain the situation, but things seem to be entirely out of hand for the time being. A large amount of damage has been caused, definitely hampering our industrial capabilities.\n\nWhat is most worrying is that the Narodnik has targetted both civilian and military infrastructure and industries. They seem to have no fear of causing harm to civilians, displaying their brutality. Everything will take time to rebuild, sparking worry in our already struggling economy. We must double down on these terrorists, lest they cause even more damage - or worse."
 NOV.42.a: "How could we let this happen?"

 NOV.43.t: "Mikhail Evseev Assassinated!"
 NOV.43.desc: "It appears the Narodniks have struck again, this time against our high command. Mikhail Evseev, one of our most prominent generals and a career officer was found shot dead in his apartment last night, and there is no doubt it was the Narodniks. While a specific suspect remains unknown, our command staff is in a state of panic, as all believe they are the next target. How the assassin even managed to get to Evseev is another mystery.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a major tragedy, as every general we have is one of the best in Central Siberia. Evseev's tactics were most useful in the battlefield as a veteran of the Great Patriotic War and the Siberian War. He will be remembered as a hero of the Federation and a victim to the terrorist group that is the Narodniks.\n\nThis is only another example that we must crackdown on the Narodniks in greater force. They are becoming even stronger than our government has thought possible."
 NOV.43.a: "We will feel his loss."

 NOV.44.desc: "Thankfully, due to our efforts of doubling down the Narodniks have been mostly mopped up, either captured or dead. While some remnants continue to cause trouble, they are no longer as strong as they used to be, and our operatives continue to track them down. Unfortunately, the damage they caused will take some time to repair, and mistrust within Novosibirsk is at an all-time high. People no longer feel safe in the cities, knowing their neighbor could very well be a Narodnik agent.\n\nIt's time we start repairing now. Roads will need to be rebuilt, rail lines reincorporated, and industrial machinery repaired. While we probably could have done more looking back, at least the crisis is over."
 NOV.44.a: "It's time to rebuild."

 NOV.45.t: "Narodnik Threat Ended!"
 NOV.45.desc: "Due to our efforts and the efforts of the SB, it seems we have successfully contained the Narodnik threat! The investigations by our agents and those undercover provided enough evidence for the arrests and the raid could not have gone better, despite a heavy firefight. Many of the Narodniks have been put behind bars, and it seems the rest have gone into hiding or fled Novosibirsk. We won't have to worry about any more major damage in the future, and our government has begun to congratulate the efforts of those involved on the ground in bringing the terrorists down.\n\nWith the Narodnik threat gone, we will no longer have to worry about our factories being sabotaged or rail lines being destroyed. Our Federation is stronger than any who may want to topple it!"

 NOV.46.desc: "There was a knock on the door.\n\nDmitry leapt from his desk and rushed to the door. He knew his visitor was not the sort of man who could stand waiting for too long. "Good day gentlemen! Do come in."\n\nThe "gentlemen" walking into Dmitry's laboratory did not return their host's obsquiesent smile. They were professional errand boys, and they were here to run an errand. "Is the cargo ready?" asked the one on the right.\n\n"Right this way." Dmitry led his guests towards the kennels at the back of the lab. As the men approached, a woman stopped petting one of the foxes inside, and, in a cold, correct manner, stepped to the side, allowing Dmitry to display the merchandise. The kits, seeing new playmates, congregated at the front of the kennel, tails wagging. The two visitors set straight to their work, removing the food and water dishes before carrying the kennels to a waiting truck outside.\n\n"For all that this is necessary to keep our research funded, I worry about where these foxes will end up," said Lyudmila, Dmitry's assistant as she and he hurried to clean and refill the dishes the couriers left.\n\n"They'll likely get sold off to markets in Asia, and from there, if my theories prove correct, they'll become the latest trend in exotic pets."\n\n"The sort of people who buy pets off the black market generally aren't the most humane sort."\n\nThe two continued working in silence between the courier's return trips until the truck was fully loaded."
 NOV.46.a: "How much for that fox in the window?"

 NOV.47.t: "Silent Warfare"
 NOV.47.desc: "The Silovik State has a unique resource when compared to the other Warlords of Russia. While others may have to rely on ideological similarities, violence, or tense negotiation to work with other warlords, the Silovik State can dig their claws into a nation without them even realizing it. They can tip their rivals for unification in the direction of their own interests. This resource allows the State to snake its way into the government of their rival, slowly aligning the opponent's interest with their own through a gradual takeover of several or all sectors of government and even daily life.\n\nThis resource, of course, is the vast and powerful businesses at the Silovik State's disposal, in addition to the political, economic, and military pressure they can put on their neighbors. See, corporations have a funny way of getting what they want from a country, its people and its government if they're more powerful than their targets- er, clients are stubborn. Economic pressure and integration is a mighty thing, and the first step to that oh so gradual takeover that the Silovik State relies on to move forward."
 NOV.47.a: "A bloodless, if a bit dirty, alternative."
 
 ### Expansion events ###
 NOV_expansion.1.t: "A Change in Management"
 NOV_expansion.1.desc: "Pushkin watched the tanks roll down the streets of Tomsk with bitterness in his mind and hate in his heart. No, hate wasn't the word. It was some new feeling, some feeling that combined hate, disappointment, fear and regret, all into one single emotion that went beyond a simple noun. Perhaps depression was the better word, from all the changes that surrounded Pushkin's world.\n\nThe first was seeing his second home, the Humanist headquarters, tapped off by soldiers, denying him and his comrades entrance into the building. "Your organization," said the officer in charge, "has been outlawed. Disperse, before you are dealt with." They did, and the sudden horror dawned on him there of how bad things were going to get.\n\nThe second was much less concrete, but just as real. The morale of the people of Tomsk had been destroyed, sucked up and spat out. Friends, who weeks prior had waved and shared wonderful memories together, barely looked at each other, let alone spoke. The park, once so filled with wandering, smiling faces, had been replaced by soldiers armed to the teeth.\n\nIt was as if all hope, all idealism, had been bleed from them, just as their men had been bleed on the battlefield.\n\nPushkin sighed. Perhaps the grand experiment was never realistic. Perhaps it was better to get your head out of the clouds, and focus on the real world. Maybe these new men, with their hard faces and cold hearts, had the right idea after all."
 NOV_expansion.1.a: "What use is survival without hope?"

 NOV_expansion.2.t: "Adjusting"
 NOV_expansion.2.desc: "Nikolay Kamov sat at his desk, looking over the designs of his latest helicopter design. It was coming along well, if he said so himself, but to say that it was up to the same level of quality similar designs had had under the Siberian Republic would be a lie. He sighed, rubbing at his tired eyes.\n\nWhen the Federation troops came pouring in, few could believe it, and, before anyone could even react, the Republic's flag, waving above Tomsk, came tumbling down. It seemed, to Kamov's horrified eyes, that the whole experiment had failed.\n\nAnd the experiment's subjects, the people of Central Siberia, had undergone a change that Kamov, as a scientist, found shocking. Almost over night, the people and their optimism, once so filled with hope and joy, had shriveled up into a rotting husk. And that new atmosphere, the atmosphere of some corporate overlord, had expanded to the research division that Kamov worked in.\n\nAlthough the designs remained the same, the people changed. No longer was radical experimentation allowed. Now, it was all about 'efficiency' and 'results'. No longer would the halls of science be filled with creativity, intrigue, learning, and breakthroughs. Now it was going to be about how to make something easier to manufacture, easier to transport, and easier to make in bulk.\n\nKamov's helicopter was just one victim. He had no motivation to make the best possible, no reason to push the boundaries. Now, he felt like just one more researcher in a sea of thousands, all vying for some nebulous benefit.\n\nAnd it ate Kamov up inside."
 NOV_expansion.2.a: "Does optimism have a home in Russia still?"

 NOV_expansion.3.t: "The End of the Sobor?"
 NOV_expansion.3.desc: ""For the last time, Shukshin, the sooner we get rid of that madman's deranged administration the easier our lives will be. Why on earth should we humor those lunatics when they wouldn't have given us the same courtesy?" Alexander Pokryshkin paced up and down his office, talking with his hands as he went. For the past twenty minutes, he had been arguing with the mayor of Barnaul over the fate of the so-called Zemsky Sobor, and once again the two men found themselves at an impasse.\n\nMayor Shukshin rubbed his temples, his eyes weary and distant. "If we keep ripping up local administrations and replacing them, it's only going to mean more work for us. Time we could've spent on more important matters will instead be wasted on sorting out bureaucracy." He sighed. "I'm not suggesting we keep the Sobor, rather, update it to fit our needs."\n\nPokryshkin turned to Shukshin. Perhaps his colleague had a point. After all, what's the purpose of demolishing a perfectly functional administration just to replace it with something that serves the same purpose? On the other hand, the President knew that keeping the Sobor in any form would encourage a certain degree of autonomy..."
 NOV_expansion.3.a: "We'll do this Pokryshkin's way."
 NOV_expansion.3.b: "Shukshin does a compelling case..."

 NOV_expansion.4.t: "Church and State"
 NOV_expansion.4.desc: "Sokolov stepped out of the car, making sure to avoid stepping in anything that may be liable to make his day unpleasant while reaching his home. Well, he thought with some bitterness, more unpleasant.\n\nHe had gotten here at least a week ago, and already he had been on the losing end of an argument between varying factions in Oyrotia, the once theocratic government led by the Old Believer Ivan Zavoloko. At first Sokolov had expected the new job to be easy. How hard could dealing with a couple of backwards peasants really be?\n\nVery, very difficult. Already, he had to deal with the reality that he had no legitimacy. These people did not choose him, an outsider. Sokolov, no matter his personal beliefs, was a member of the Federation government, a distant, unknowable collection of bureaucrats and politicians who knew nothing about them. This Sokolov resented, if only because he had been briefed a significant amount by Zavoloko, who, in his wisdom, thought it would be important for Sokolov to understand the needs of the people. Apparently, Sokolov thought with bitterness, some didn't think that was enough.\n\nHe sighed. Perhaps he was being too negative. He had, over the course of the last couple weeks, been successful in removing most of the incompotent administrators under Zavoloko, who, by and large, were preachers, and not bureaucrats. At the very least it would show that Sokolov was trying to make an effort. Besides, the cash would begin to flow Oyrotia soon, to show how valuable a unified, centralized Russia could be.\n\nPerhaps, Sokolov thought, for the first time in days, these people can learn to trust again."
 NOV_expansion.4.a: "Hopefully, Sokolov thought, I didn't get that much hateful mail today."

 NOV_expansion.5.t: "Facing Forward"
 NOV_expansion.5.desc: "Alexey Pesterev didn't often feel fear, but when he came face to face with Pokryshkin, the man who led the newly formed Federation, he felt his internal temperature drop a couple degrees. It wasn't the physique or mannerism of the man that disturbed him, but it was the simple reality of the situation. Coming face to face with the man who overthrew his government, and on the other side of a jail cell, conjured up images that Pesterev would rather not have.\n\nAnd so they sat there, waiting for the other to make a move, up until Pokryshkin spoke up.\n\n"Mr. Pesterev," said Pokryshkin, "I understand that you and Andreev are on less than stellar terms."\n\n"Considering that I'm in a jail cell, yes, me and him are not exactly the best of friends at the moment."\n\nPokryshkin laughed. "That is understandable. You know, I hate to see such potential wasted, rotting in a cell. I've always preferred to think of human life as having a little bit more value alive than dead, or in prison."\n\nPesterev felt his eyebrows raise a little, wondering where this was going.\n\n"I have a proposition for you, if you would like to hear it."\n\n"A proposition...?"\n\nPokryshkin pulled out a piece of paper, and slid it in between the metal bars. "I am not an expert in the affairs of Krasnoyarsk, or its people. Nor do I think I could learn it in the time necessary to make a difference. That is why I am offering you an opportunity to work for me, for your freedom, and for a better future for Russia. You don't have to decide now, b-"\n\n"I'll do it."\n\nPokryshkin stopped, a little shocked at being interrupted. That look, however, disappeared, and was replaced with a smile. "I didn't expect that, especially after how long you worked for Andreev."\n\nPesterev smiled in spite of his best attempts at suppressing it. "Well, it's not like I haven't done it before.""
 NOV_expansion.5.a: ""Excellent. Welcome back, General Pesterev.""

 NOV_expansion.6.t: "Breaking the Anarchists"
 NOV_expansion.6.desc: "For the past couple months, the All-Siberian Army has been dealing with the remnant forces of the Black Army. Almost all are holdout generals, militias and other organizations that refused to submit to the will of the Federation, and instead placed their rebellion at the barrel of a gun.\n\nWhat began as outright treasonous acts, openly committed by militiamen, gradually transformed into terrorism against the state and its property. Army compounds were bombed, killing dozens and injuring more. Police headquarters, set up in high population areas, were routinely attacked and looted for firearms, and, as quickly as they were attacked, the HQs were empty of all Red perpetrators.\n\nBut the former Free Territory could only hold out for so long. Soon, as weeks turned to months, some of the diehards began to question whether their acts were in any way helpful to their cause. Soon, as the troops began pouring in, and the compounds and safe houses were raided, the members of the underground Black Army began to dissipate. Some chose to leave the Free Territory, others the whole of Central Siberia. A couple even decided to leave Russia, hoping for a better chance at the revolution abroad.\n\nSome, however, decided to stay, and while they continue their revolutionary activities, the All-Siberian Army has been ever present to combat them. While the remnants may never fully go away, the Siberian Army stands tall and ready to crack whatever resistance remains."
 NOV_expansion.6.a: "The All-Siberian Army fears no Reds of any shade!"

 NOV_expansion.7.t: "Cracking the Councils"
 NOV_expansion.7.desc: "It was a shock to the many denizens of the former Free Territory to hear about Proclamation 1821 of the Federation's government, officially abolishing the Workers' Councils. To many others, the outcome was expected, and the shock came from how long it took.\n\nDespite the Federation's best efforts, the imprints of Anarchism could not be fully removed. It had been too embedded into society for that to happen, especially among the working class, who, unsurprisingly, made up most of the Workers' Councils. Kansk was the biggest of them, and threatened outright rebellion against the Federation if such an action was ever taken.\n\nThat, of course, was only rhetoric. Everyone knew that, one way or another, the Workers' Councils would be destroyed. Many even within the Councils debated what course of action to take, but, despite the radicalism of some members, the majority accepted defeat. The Proclamation was expected, and they tried, with the best of their abilities, to make the transition as best as possible.\n\nBut the next day, it was reported in the papers of Kansk that three different megacorporations had begun to carve up the formerly worker run factories, shops, and other facilities controlled by the Councils. Within the course of several weeks, the unions, once so powerful, started to accept their old places in the hierarchy of capitalism. Neighborhoods once more became divided between workers, with the corporations battling out in the remains of who would get what."
 NOV_expansion.7.a: "The workers shall be free, some day."

 NOV_expansion.8.t: "A Solemn Oath"
 NOV_expansion.8.desc: ""-to my last breath to be faithful to the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government."\n\nIt felt like only yesterday that he was swearing his oath, graduating as one of many in some nameless training facility in Ukraine. He had been young then, naive and impressionable, doing his patriotic duty to the state. Before the Winter War and Barbarossa, before the fall of Moscow and the long march across the Urals.\n\nWhat a fucking joke!\n\nThe Army had been betrayed, self-sabotaged at every turn by politicians and secret police who had no idea what they were doing. Officers arrested for disobeying suicidal orders, NKVD flunkies second-guessing every move, men wasted in futile counter-attacks and reckless offensives. All headed by a man who seemed more interested in moving cities in Siberia then leading a nation at war.\n\nNow here he was, a remnant of another remnant of the Red Army. Rumors were going around that the Federation's armed forces were offering to take in anyone willing. Ultimately the decision of becoming a civilian in a foreign land or enlisting in an army not in service of a failed ideology was an easy choice to make."
 NOV_expansion.8.a: ""I solemnly swear...""

 NOV_expansion.9.t: "The Tuva Proposal"
 NOV_expansion.9.desc: "The Red Army remnants of the so-called People's Revolutionary Council have been defeated, and their vast territories in Tannu Tuva and Mongolia are now under the protection of the Federation. Administering these new conquests have already become the subject of furious debate within the government, however.\n\nPresident Pokryshkin, unsurprisingly, advocates for a simple process of annexation into the Federation as a regular territory. This would further encourage the centralization of our authority, but some argue that the federally-administered territories are stretched thin enough as it is, and adding new lands on top of that would only compound our problems.\n\nThe influential mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, has put forward a different proposal altogether. He believes it would be necessary to form a new republic within the Federation's borders: the Federal Republic of Tuva. Not only would this make integration a more painless affair, but would also go great lengths towards discouraging separatism.\n\nThe final say, of course, lies with the President..."
 NOV_expansion.9.a: "Let us create a new republic for Tuva."
 NOV_expansion.9.b: "They shall be annexed like all the rest."

 NOV_expansion.10.t: "A New Republic"
 NOV_expansion.10.desc: "Vasily Shukshin rubbed his temples as he stared down a blank piece of paper on his desk. He had found little time to indulge in his artistic side since becoming mayor of Barnaul, and usually spent the quieter moments trying to catch up to the flurry of novel ideas his mind would manifest during work hours. Sometimes, however, even his passions would prove frustrating, as Shukshin had spent the past hour and a half debating how to actually start this particular piece.\n\nLaying his pen aside, Shukshin sighed as he reached for his drink. Before his hands could even touch the glass, the phone rang and shattered the melancholy silence of his office. So much for that drink, he thought. "Shukshin here. I hope you've got good news for me."\n\n"It's Kerchenko. Your proposal about the Tuvan Republic? It went through."\n\nShukshin's eyes went wide. This was not the outcome he was expecting. "Really? I'm surprised Pokryshkin let it happen. This is good news!"\n\n"Indeed. You should probably come down here and make an announcement before he takes all the credit."\n\n"Very well, I'll see you soon, Kerchenko." Shukshin signed off as he placed the phone back. After a brief moment to regain his thoughts, he glanced once again at the empty paper on his desk. Shukshin's writings would have to wait once again; he had a flight to catch."
 NOV_expansion.10.a: "The priorities of the real world."

 NOV_expansion.11.t: "Just Another Puzzle Piece"
 NOV_expansion.11.desc: "It came as little surprise to Vasily Shukshin and the rest of the Federalists when Pokryshkin's administration chose to reject his proposal of an autonomous Tuvan republic. The President had been seemingly looking to consolidate state power for a long time now, and the Tuvan issue was only another small step towards that lofty goal.\n\nWhile the Federalists were mildly annoyed but not entirely unprepared, none were more disappointed than the Tuvan people themselves. The peoples of the Altay had come to appreciate what little autonomy they had been granted under the Soviet Union, and hoped that the democratic Novosibirsk government would continue this old policy.\n\nInstead, this minority group finds itself on the rocky road to full integration within the resurgent Russian behemoth. Sporadic protests and dissent have been reported throughout the People's Revolutionary Council's former territories, but so far it is nothing that local security forces cannot handle."
 NOV_expansion.11.a: "They'll get used to it, one way or another."

 NOV_expansion.12.t: "Spring Training"
 NOV_expansion.12.desc: "It was their third straight day of combat exercises and Private Ivanov was already sick of them. Crawling along the forest floor, the private slowly inched himself forward. The pre-attack plan had been clear. There was an enemy forward position that needed to be taken and taken quickly. In the left-hand squad of a flying wedge, he was but one of half dozen soldiers crawling amidst the Siberian Taiga. Cradling his rifle, he waited with nervous energy.\n\nAs the lieutenant blew his whistle, the young private launched himself forward with the rest of his platoon as machine guns sprayed death a foot off the ground in controlled bursts.\n\nTwenty minutes later, part of the platoon sat on the far side of the enemy position, much of it, Ivanov included, deemed casualties. Turning his attention away from the exercise and back towards his fellow squadmates, the private turned back into the conversation.\n\n"-all these exercises? What do you think Ivanov?"\n\nIvanov fixed the speaker with a dirty look, "What the fuck do I think? Use your brain man, the Falcon clearly thinks we're going to be fighting a war soon enough.""
 NOV_expansion.12.a: ""...and you better not get me fucking killed.""

 NOV_expansion.13.t: "The Federation's Heart"
 NOV_expansion.13.desc: "It was a triumphant occasion. Crowds of cheering citizens greeting the conquerors of Central Siberia. The men of the All-Siberian Army marched with military precision, exuding pride and confidence, the Airforce flying overhead. Shukshin was supposed to be celebrating, mingling with the Siloviki and the corporate suits. Yet, as he watched soldiers march through Novosibirsk's streets, all he could feel was apprehension.\n\nPokryshkin meant well, that much was obvious, but he could see the divide between the two of them was growing with every passing day. Barnaul and his native Altay seemed ever more alien compared to the corruption and apathy in the Federation's capital. As the Mayor watched the acrobatics display of the Siberian Air Fleet, he couldn't help but think."
 NOV_expansion.13.a: "Something had to give."

 NOV_expansion.14.t: "Looking on the Bright Side"
 NOV_expansion.14.desc: "Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and today you're listening to Radio Free Siberia, the best news for the people of Siberia. I'm your host, Koryavov Nikitovich, but you can call me Nicholas for short. They say it's because I look like Tsar Nicholas, but it's not true, I swear!\n\nToday, I am here to discuss certain criticisms of the current rule of our country. Now now, I believe in free speech, but I believe that certain intellectuals are slandering our government, and by God I am going to come to its defense!\n\nThe first biggest slanderous lie is that our government is cynical. That is just a boldfaced lie. Our government is not cynical, it is pragmatic. You see, these famous philosophers, they make these funny little words up like 'cynical' and 'corporatization' in order to slander the Federation, but, let's be real here, when has a philosopher ever done something for you? Say what you want about the Federation, but it has brought numerous people out of poverty, brought economic development, and brought order. Sure, maybe they've been a little too heavy handed, but, hey, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my freedom for the sake of a better future.\n\nThe second, and the one I find the most offensive, is that our Federation is destined for failure, that we're too weak to get anything done. That is not only wrong, it is offensive, to the leaders and generals of this country, who have sacrificed countless man hours just to keep you and I safe from the hoards that lay behind our borders. We have a strong economy, strong leaders, and strong soldiers, who are going to be made even stronger by the first two.\n\nAnd the Federation will be made even stronger as the years go by, as economic development increases continually. According to some analysts, we may even become stronger than Germany when taking into account reunification and economic development.\n\nNow, to my fellow patriots, I leave you with a good little song that some of you may remember. It's a little different from how you remember it, but, hey, it may be better for you that way!"
 NOV_expansion.14.a: "Wide is my motherland..."

 NOV_expansion.15.t: "Costs"
 NOV_expansion.15.desc: "Pokryshkin sat at his desk, looking out onto the streets. It was bright, but not bright enough to block out the shining of the stars overhead. Looking towards them made him remember his childhood, and the horrible poverty he had experienced. Of course, that seemed so much more quaint than the poverty of some after the collapse, but it was still painful.\n\nHe had crawled to the top of the air force, crawled from that slum and from those criminals and hoodlums to become one of the most famous airmen in Russia. And yet, it did nothing. The Germans came marching still, like the Huns of the West, crushing and butchering everything in their paths. He could still remember flying above a town, burnt to the ground, smoke filling the sky. All he could imagine then were the screams, and the flaying bodies.\n\nAnd now, he was the leader of a nation, a nation whose principles seemed so in line with his own. Liberation, freedom, decentralization. Far from the centralized nightmare that was the Soviet Union. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to work. The pieces wouldn't fit. He couldn't fit the square peg into the round hole.\n\nAnd so he compromised. A stronger office here, a stronger government there, until he realized that the ball of centralization kept going further and further. And now those principles, those principles he sacrificed so much for, had been ripped up.\n\nAnd, the worst part about it, was that he felt nothing. Pokryshkin felt like he should feel something, some sadness at the death of utopianism he had. But he didn't. The compromises, in his eyes, worked. Without them, he wouldn't be where he was. Without them, his people wouldn't be anywhere near as good as they are now.\n\nPerhaps, Pokryshkin thought, the principles of the Federation would be revived. Perhaps the government would give their constituent parts more say in their affairs, more trust in the people. But he doubted that. And so, he looked out the window, just as he did as a young man."
 NOV_expansion.15.a: "Reality over dreams."

 NOV_expansion.16.t: "A Temporary Respite"
 NOV_expansion.16.desc: "Vasily Shukshin sat at his mayoral desk in Barnaul, once again looked at the group of reports arranged in front of him, and despaired.\n\nHe had long been unhappy with the news out of Novosibirsk itself, regarding the increasing centralization of the Silovik government, and about what that meant not only for him, but for the people of the Federation. Barnaul was not nearly as important as the great city itself, of course, but it was important enough, and he was important enough within it, to be able to take some form of action.\n\nAnd that action had worked. He had been able, if only for a short while, to delay several measures focused on further increasing that degree of centralization. He knew he should have felt joy, or at least satisfaction, at such success. And yet, he did not, for he knew that though he had slowed the process, he had not, and would not be able to, halt it for very long.\n\nHis influence and popularity would allow him to do so for a while longer, but as he regarded the reports, all he could think about was how much time he had won.\n\nAnd how he knew it would not be much."
 NOV_expansion.16.a: "Can it be stopped?"

 NOV_expansion.17.t: "The Three Giants"
 NOV_expansion.17.desc: "With our decision to offer the corporate giants residing in our realm support and official government benefits, we'll be able to get these corporations over to our side and be able to benefit from their vast resource pool, just as they'll benefit from our official support. After all, lucrative government contracts in newly-conquered territory are the favourite of any successful megacorporation.\n\nHowever, based off of what few resources we have at the moment, we'll only be able to throw our support behind only one of the megacorporations. Each megacorporation contract - Feniks, Sibir, and Titan - will grant us a different boon, so we must choose wisely."
 NOV_expansion.17.a: "Feniks, our military's perpetuator."

 NOV_expansion.18.t: "For the Nation"
 NOV_expansion.18.desc: "It had become the habit of Vasily Shukshin to spend the hours of the night cooped up in his office, working until the wee hours of the morning. It hadn't been like that when he had simply been the mayor or Barnaul, but with his elevated position, so many things had changed. He had tired, of course, and it wasn't like he enjoyed working until the AM, but it was something that the man felt as if he had to do.\n\nShukshin's place in the administration of the Federation had placed him front and center in what passed for political machinations of the polity, resulting in his less-than-cynical ideas being the natural foil for his political counterpart, Pokryshkin. But as the documents bled together, the words and letters became increasingly incomprehensible in Shukshin's brain, out of the fog that permeated his mind came the deep worries that only ever emerged on the latest of nights.\n\nHis mind went to the origins of the Federation, and how it was originally based on freedom and liberty, but how the necessity of the Federation's system had resulted in an erosion of the Federation's basic principles, revealing corruption, apathy, and cynicism - unfortunately embodied by many of his political peers. He felt conflicted about his role in the state, and how it would, or wouldn't play out. He had once been a genuine democrat, convinced of the Federation's noble methods. But as the situation degraded, Shukshin could do nothing but wonder if his support of Pokryshkin and the Federation in general had been worth it. After no small deliberation, Shukshin spoke to himself, quietly, as if he wanted no one to hear despite the utter absence of company in his lonely office.\n\n"I remember the struggle against tyranny. I'll hold on to that memory, and do my best to do it justice.""

The few workers still on top running in all directions as the vehicle charged down the city's street. Dozens of well-placed shots from those behind the machine preventing any sort of reaction.\n\nWith a loud crash and a hailstorm of scattered debris, the armored vehicle smashed through the barricade, soon followed by the men of the All-Siberian Army. Rifles and machine guns spat fire in all directions, scattering those who remained. A ballad of chaos and death, a routine that Corporal Ivanov was all too familiar with. Several dozen bodies already marked the dust and rubble, almost certain to be joined by more as the rebels fled in disarray.\n\nFor all their talk, factory workers and technicians were no match for professional soldiers, and this fragment of Kostin's naive rebellion was no different."

He was, furthermore, growing, both in popularity and in activity, and this prompted a similarly growing concern against the silovik elite.\n\nAlthough he was always considered a dissident, railing against the increasing centralization of the government from his maddeningly secure office within Barnaul, he had always been personally manageable. He had always been of little relevance. His message had always been able to be contained. That was no longer the case.\n\nUnder the Silovik-dominated central government, there were always going to be many people who lost out. Who did not reap the massive rewards that their betters did. And, while they may not have individual power, there were a lot of them. They were now, along with others, were now turning out to Shukshin's public rallies. In slowly, but ever-increasing, numbers.\n\nConflict seems inevitable. The only question, that none can as of yet answer, is who will, at the end, emerge victorious."
 NOV_regional.2.a: "There are always malcontents, under any system."
 
 NOV_regional.3.t: "A Siberian Plan of Our Own"
 NOV_regional.3.desc: "Pokryshkin and Langemak, as well as numerous faceless accountants, corporate leaders, and other bean-counters, had gathered together around a great table of polished wood long ago liberated from the Soviet high command. "Gentlemen," began Langemak, reading from a set of hastily scrawled notes that he clutched in his hands, "we stand at a rare and opportune moment in history. Central Siberia now rightly belongs to us, and with Siberia comes her vast resources. Until now, we have lacked the infrastructure and heavy machinery to exploit them, but this has changed." Langemak paused for a moment, allowing himself a breath and for the information to sink into the brains of those assembled.\n\n"With our hold over Central Siberia secured, we can now begin to collect what Mother Russia has seen fit to bless us with. Myself and President Pokryshkin have discussed at length a plan to see us all enriched, both the state and the corporations." swallowing, Langemak added, "Mr. President, I yield the floor to you."\n\n"Thank you, minister of economics," began Pokryshkin, "Siberia is laden with petrol, natural gas, gold, diamonds, iron and coal. Billions, if not trillions, of rubles worth of resources lie beneath the earth. I do not wish to mince words, so here is my proposal: We, the government, will subsidize all mining and extraction operations in exchange for a percentage of the materials to be negotiated on an individual basis. Together, we will transform the Federation from just another warlord state into an economic juggernaut and profit in the process. All I ask from you is your help."\n\nIt was not long before voices were raised in a rousing affirmative."
 NOV_regional.3.a: "Let us put Bukharin to shame."
 
 NOV_regional.4.t: "In the Army... Again"
 NOV_regional.4.desc: "Fyodor hastened to strap on his boots as the call was sounded. He was still exhausted from the drills of the previous day. His bones ached, his mind still fogged with sleep. The sergeant clanged a bell so loud it hurt Fyodor's ears. "Move it, worms! You worthless sacks of shit aren't worthy of being in my beloved army! To the field! Now!" Fyodor's old sergeant in Tomsk wasn't nearly as boisterous, preferring rousing speeches about the defense of democracy against the hordes of the wasteland. This army was different. This army knew it was the big dog in Siberia, and woe betide any who claimed otherwise. Offensive war versus defensive war, supposed Fyodor.\n\nThe men ran, performed live-fire drills, and sparred, all the while enduring the relentless abuse of the sergeant. Despite his former service in the army of Tomsk, Fyodor could have sworn the boot camp he was put through in that former nation was far less strenuous. In this new army, his body was hardened just as his mind was broken and reshaped into a soldier of the Federation.\n\nAs he lay exhausted in his cot that night, brain barely able to form coherent thoughts from the constant fatigue, he briefly pondered the irony that had led him here. Once a defender of democracy, Fyodor was now in service to... well, a slightly different form of democracy. He supposed he could live with that."
 NOV_regional.4.a: "Think of it as just a change in uniform."
 
 NOV_regional.5.t: "Water Under the Bridge?"
 NOV_regional.5.desc: "Mr. President,\n\nAs we have begun the integration of the armed forces of former warlord states, a pressing matter has arisen. Prisoners of war that held officer rank within their now defunct militaries are requesting that we release them from prison and grant them commissions. Ordinarily, I wouldn't hesitate to refuse such a request, but I have seen it fit to pass their desires up to your office. The return of prisoners of war becomes a difficult proposition when the country they were captured form no longer exists. Additionally, these officers, including some of senior rank, could provide invaluable military expertise to our own armed forces.\n\nI have my own personal concerns with this request, as the pardoning of those responsible for waging war against our nation sets a dangerous standard. What we don't need is Narodniks claiming legal precedent for their own pardons. Naturally, the choice is yours, and I will be awaiting your reply.\n\nSigned,\n\nDmitry Glinka, Minister of Defense."
 NOV_regional.5.a: "Pardon them all, but no commissions."
 NOV_regional.5.b: "Pardon those of senior rank and grant them commissions."
 NOV_regional.5.c: "No pardons and no commissions."
 
 NOV_regional.6.t: "Clashing of Titans"
 NOV_regional.6.desc: ""Sir, there's some concern about the steady escalation of the debate surrounding our state's foreign policy," the President looked up from the papers the aide had just handed him.\n\n"What could possibly be so dangerous about foreign policy?"\n\n"Specifically, the concerns are pointed at Feniks and Sibir. As you know-"\n\n"Yes yes, the backbones of our weapons and agricultural industries. I'm fully aware of what these corporations do around here."\n\n"Al-Alright... Well then. The two corporations both desire different trading partners. Feniks supports diplomacy with the OFN and America. The United States has cutting edge technology and has no reason to fear that their supplies might be used against them They don't believe the Japanese would be nearly as willing to negotiate arms deals. Meanwhile, Sibir wants to trade primarily with the Sphere. They believe the Sphere can provide unique opportunities that America can simply never provide. This wouldn't be such a problem for our economy, if the two corporations weren't trying so hard to sway us to their side. They're bribing every politician they can get their hands on, and there are even some allegations that the two corporations are trying to sabotage each other. If this matter isn't resolved-"\n\n"Their stocks could fall, and bring our economy down with them," Pokryshkin could do nothing more than sigh. He looked back up at the aide, "I'll look into this, just get some people on damage control.""
 NOV_regional.6.a: ""Why can't they just play nice?""
 
 NOV_regional.7.t: "A Most Unusual Meeting"
 NOV_regional.7.desc: "It was unusual, to say the least, for a sitting Prime Minister to meet, directly, with the leadership of one of the many self-declared 'countries' that claimed to represent 'Russia.' And, yet, that was exactly what was happening.\n\nPresident Pokryshkin had arrived earlier in the day, and as he and his entourage approached the Prime Minister, their thoughts returned to the many explanations their advisors had given them for this extraordinary meeting. Pokryshkin's state was growing rapidly - in economic power, physical size, and military capability - and could, in short order, pose a threat to the interests of the Sphere.\n\nThat is, if it were allowed to forge close relationships with other states without also doing so with Japan itself. In addition, a number of Japanese industrial concerns had voiced the potential benefits of future business relationships with the growing state, and such could not be ignored. Thus, relations had been steadily increasing, and were to be cemented here today.\n\nArriving in front of the Prime Minister, Pokryshkin offered a slight bow, which was immediately returned, and both smiled for the many cameras watching. There would be much more negotiation to come, but the door had been decisively opened."
 NOV_regional.7.a: "Our interests demand at least a cordial relationship."
 
 NOV_regional.8.t: "A Proposal from Novosibirsk"
 NOV_regional.8.desc: "We have received an interesting communication from the government in Novosibirsk today, proposing we build a large pipeline through Mongolia. Some specifics still need to be ironed out, but the Federation's government has ensured us that the pipeline will be beneficial for both of us. It will be used to transport natural gas between both of our countries, and access to Russian resources will be very helpful. Saying yes will surely help keep our influence alive in Russia, and American influence out, but the project may be costly, and we may have other ventures we are interested in.\n\nThe Russians want an answer right away, so what should we tell them?"
 NOV_regional.8.a: "What a great idea!"
 NOV_regional.8.b: "Thanks, but we have other ventures."
 
 NOV_regional.9.t: "Improvement, Regardless of Purpose"
 NOV_regional.9.desc: "Grigory had worked in the factories of Novosibirsk for many years. He had seen many regimes offer many promises. And he had seen many of those promises broken.\n\nBut he had, very recently, noticed that some promises had been kept. At first, he had hardly believed it, but it was true all the same. Operating conditions within his factory, in terms of both safety and workload, had improved, and he found himself, at the end of the day, still possessing considerable energy. With the chance to relax. This was most unusual.\n\nIt also led to Grigory asking many questions. Why was this the case? Was the Federation's government truly committed to the reform that he had heard promised, and originally dismissed as yet another empty pledge? Were they temporary measures, intended only to placate the thousands upon thousands of workers who had risen in the Great Revolt? And, if so, how long would they last?\n\nFor a long while Grigory debated these questions within himself, until he realized, at long last, that the answer did not matter. Or that, if it did, it certainly didn't matter to him. No matter what it truly was, his workday had, quite simply, gotten both easier and safer.\n\nAnd that was good enough for him."
 NOV_regional.9.a: "Things are better. Who cares why?"
 
 NOV_regional.10.t: "Japan Declines to Build Pipeline"
 NOV_regional.10.desc: "Unfortunately, Japan has declined our request to build the pipeline through Mongolia. Citing costs, the Japanese do not believe the pipeline will be as profitable as it sounds. It appears we won't be working with Japan as much as we would have liked to in the near future. Perhaps they will be in more interest later down the road, but for now, we can't do exactly anything without Japan's permission."
 NOV_regional.10.a: "Perhaps the Americans will be more interested in making a deal."
 
 NOV_regional.11.t: "A Presidential Meeting"
 NOV_regional.11.desc: "It was a clear, bright day when President Pokryshkin met with his American counterpart. The day had been long in planning, from both logistical and security perspectives, but it had finally arrived, and State Department officials awaited the meeting eagerly.\n\nSo too did the President themselves. They had great hopes for the meeting, for no matter the political agenda they hoped to pursue, economic ties with an emerging power could not but be beneficial. Relations between Pokryshkin's state and America had been growing steadily for some time, and they would be cemented here today.\n\nThey had been told by their many advisors - from State, Treasury, and the Department of Defense - that the lands controlled from Novosibirsk offered almost limitless opportunity. For business. For travel. And, if they continued to grow in power and influence within the increasingly consolidated patchwork that was modern Russia, as a counterweight to the German and Japanese spheres of interest.\n\nThus, as Pokryshkin approached, surrounded by his entourage, the President strode forward, clapped his hand in theirs, and flashed a winning smile for the countless cameras that were closely watching. Discussions would be forthcoming, of course, but for today at least, the first step had been taken."
 NOV_regional.11.a: "America and Siberia - a natural partnership."
 
 NOV_regional.12.t: "Arctic Partnership?"
 NOV_regional.12.desc: "Word has reached the State Department about the resolution of a power struggle in Central Siberia. Ordinarily, such a struggle would be of little interest to us but, in this case, there is something of note.\n\nApparently, the power struggle in question occurred between a number of industrial conglomerates headquartered in Novosibirsk, and which themselves exercise considerable power over the central government. With the victory of one over the others, a decision has been reached regarding external overtures. And one of those overtures is towards ourselves.\n\nIt has been proposed that our governments collaborate on a series of ventures, primarily related to military industries. Exchanges of materiel, the construction of munitions plants both in America and Siberia, and various other joint efforts have been proposed.\n\nWhile, of course, no concrete agreements have been reached at this time, several of our officials have encouraged further talks. After all, America is a country that is open for business, regardless as to whether that business is halfway around the world."
 NOV_regional.12.a: "We'll hear them out."
 NOV_regional.12.b: "None of our business."
 
 NOV_regional.13.t: "Contract Talks Continue with America!"
 NOV_regional.13.desc: "We have today been informed that the Americans are ready and willing to continue discussion on the contracts for military supplies and services previously raised.\n\nThis is, we are told, excellent news. Many industries in and around both Novosibirsk as well as other cities with significant manufacturing capacities stand to gain tremendously from any such contracts that are eventually signed. Those same industries have been quick to communicate the benefits for the state as well, beyond simple economic growth.\n\nSuch benefits could extend, but not be limited to, increased employment, expansion of national productive capacity, infusions of hard currency, additional foreign investment and construction, and much more besides. There is much excitement within the state, within business and government alike, for what may be to come.\n\nAlthough any potential contract is not yet finalized, many within our government consider it only a matter of time until an agreement is reached, and the benefits realized."
 NOV_regional.13.a: "Is a deal on the horizon?"
 
 NOV_regional.14.t: "Washington's Reply"
 NOV_regional.14.desc: "Unfortunate news has arrived from our envoy in Washington. It seems that despite fruitful negotiations and positive attitudes on the Americans part, our generous offer was, inexplicably, turned down. When pressed, the American representative cited "key technical issues" with our proposal, and refused to name said technical issues when questioned.\n\nIt seems that for some unknown reason, the Yankee's simply don't want to work with us, and it appears like we'll have to look elsewhere."
 NOV_regional.14.a: "Goddamn Americans."
 
 NOV_regional.15.t: "The Federation, a Paradise"
 NOV_regional.15.desc: "It was early in the morning when Radio Free Siberia's programming changed in the newly integrated territories. Many would not fully realize the change itself, but it had happened nonetheless, and it was permanent all the same.\n\nAt first the changes were subtle, announcements focusing on the improvements of civilian supply, including foodstuffs, consumer goods, and the like - but they soon increased. Both in frequency and intensity. The advantages of the new administration over the former, in terms of goods delivery, became an objective fact.\n\nThis then progressed to clear statements of the superiority of the Federation itself. Of course life was better now. Of course employment options were superior, in number and in opportunity. Of course the lands were safer and more secure for the average citizen. How could any aspect of existence not be more optimal?\n\nMost people claimed to their friends and neighbors that they ignored the obvious propaganda and, to some extent, they did. But the concepts constantly spouted were never further than earshot away and, over time, they were internalized.\n\nJust as the propagandists intended."
 NOV_regional.15.a: "A variant of the truth at least, surely?"
 
 NOV_regional.16.t: "All the News that's Fit to Shred"
 NOV_regional.16.desc: "The article was fairly damning to the establishment, Ludmila could see that. That's why no one else ever would. It was a shame, really. The article was, truly, an exceptional piece of journalism, written with integrity and genuine passion. Of course, no one would ever read it, and tragically, the journalist in question would have to be dealt with.\n\nLudmila had been undercover with the paper for months now, being as unassuming and by the books as possible. She had interacted with her co-workers just enough to avoid suspicion, just enough for them to open up to her. This was how the article detailing the Pokryshkin-backed corporate corruption and not so legal union-busting methods had come across her desk. Artyom was a good man, young and idealistic, ready to crusade against injustice with his typewriter and pen.\n\nPerhaps the greatest shame was dealing with the young crusader. Once the article had been destroyed, and Artyom had made a tragic point of telling Ludmila to be careful with it, as he had no copies, Ludmila would destroy him. The police were already in her pocket, had already agreed to arrest Artyom on the charges she had fabricated involving the indecent images of questionable age another SB agent had left in his home."

 NOV_regional.17.t: "Nostalgia"
 NOV_regional.17.desc: "Roza looked forlornly at the Feniks building squatting in her beloved Kansk. The stinking hulk dominated the street, all brand new concrete and steel, a line of little ants stood in front, each clutching a job application. She wanted to hate them for forsaking anarchy, for selling their labor for a pittance to the invader. These same men and women who, only a short time ago, sang the old songs and praised Makhno and Kropotkin, now silently awaited entry into the capitalist machine.\n\nRoza felt tears well up in her eyes, remembering the way things used to be. She missed her red and black cap, her companions and the joy they shared together in building a future for all Russians. It wasn't supposed to be like this.\n\nWas the past so easily forgotten? Could she wake up day after day and pretend she wasn't an outspoken anarchist? That's when she locked eyes with him. Vavilov, once an organizer for the collective factories, stood in line, shame and a deadness permeating his gaze. The two anarchists had once been exceptional friends and companions in labor, but now here they were, staring at once another on the Kansk street. They would never speak again.\n\nRoza realized she had the same look in her eyes, the same agony and sense of betrayal of the self. She clutched her Feniks job application and shuffled forwards in line with the rest of them."

 NOV_regional.18.t: "The Calm"
 NOV_regional.18.desc: "The economy boomed, the earth divested of her resources. Profits soured, unemployment remained low, the people were happy. The military was strong, staffed by fit young men eager for battle. The Central Siberian Federation stood as a beacon of civilization in the Russian wastes, a true city on the hill to the savages crowded around it.\n\nThe air was calm, peace had descended over the land. It was a lie, the peace nothing but a symptom of what was to come. The air was calm, but it was charged, rippling with static. A storm loomed, and both Pokryshkin and Shushkin knew it even if the people did not. They secreted themselves away in their fortresses with their servants, plotting the downfall of the other. This new struggle would not be over land and resources, not some battle for dead Russia. Armies would not clash in the streets. It would be a war of intrigue, of back-alley deals and political machinations. The Federation held its breath."
 NOV_regional.18.a: "The war for the heart of Siberia begins."
 
 NOV_regional.19.t: "The Samizdat Underground"
 NOV_regional.19.desc: "Where there is censorship of ideas it is inevitable that an underground press will rise up in protest. This is no less true in Novosibirsk, the heart of the Central Siberian Federation. They call it samizdat, and its faces are many. From anti-government screeds to suppressed poetry, all find themselves at home in the samizdat.\n\nYevgeny Kharitonov was just one such face of samizdat, laboring away at his typewriter, his fingers striking the keys with mechanical precision. It was the start of something new, something not quite ready yet, but shining with brilliant potential. "The Enchanted Island", he called it, a play he knew would not ever see mainstream publication. After all, no conservative regime would allow a homosexual to publish, regardless of the content.\n\nSo, here in the samizdat, Kharitonov wrote, hoping that the underground theater scene would find it pleasing. Perhaps in another decade, Kharitonov could walk as he was and publish what he pleased, but not today. He slid the platen back into place as it rang and continued to type."

Now the same troops he had seen at first were in shape, had the latest equipment, and obeyed every command without question.\n\nFor his skilled instruction, some of them had even taken to calling him 'Uncle Vasya', and just thinking about that almost brought tears to his eyes. They had formed into fine soldiers for whom producing criticism was difficult, but more importantly, a strong sense of camaraderie had formed among them, and where once they seemed close to apathetic about their roles within the military of the Federation, now they helped each other fulfill their respective eagerness with a sort of eagerness that Margelov hadn't seen in a long, long time. Given time, they stood a real chance of becoming the best soldiers Margelov had ever had the pleasure of working with.\n\nFor now, however, there was still work to be done, and so he returned to instruct them, trying to wipe the proud smile off his face and only partially succeeding. If any of his men noticed the admiring look in his eyes, they didn't say a word."

It had been held in private, not bothering to do it before the public because there was no reason they needed to witness it. Everything must have a purpose, a use to society, and pointless ceremonies like that did not.\n\nIt was ironic, Kabiskoy thought, that someone like him now governed what was once the last bastion of the old Central Siberian Republic, a realist in a city of idealists. Not that they would remain idealistic for long if he had any say in it, which he most certainly did. The clashing ideologies, the salons, the precious 'liberty' of the old Republic had been its greatest weaknesses, with the collapse being the inevitable result. The Federation had been founded on not repeating that mistake, and with his election as mayor, Kabiskoy would do everything in his power to make sure that it never would. Turning away from the window, he pulled out his seat from his desk and sat down in it, taking up a pen and beginning the work needed to give new structure to the people of Tomsk, whether they liked it or not."

After all, Voznesensky had once been a high ranking Bastillard, directing their economic policy and thus helping to ensure the financial security of the Republic in its later days.\n\nThe Republic was dead and gone now, though, and the Federation stood in its place. Deciding to make the best of it, Voznesensky had joined forces with Shukshin, and stood as the candidate of liberty in the latest Tomsk mayoral elections, ultimately proving triumphant through his ideals. Now, he would govern one of the most important cities of the Federation and aid Shukshin's cause further, in order to return to this great city a semblance of the freedom it had once enjoyed.\n\nEven as he waved to the crowd as he walked up the steps of the stage from which he would be inaugurated and then give his victory speech, he knew that this would be no easy task to accomplish. Fierce opposition awaited the lovers of democracy, at the highest levels of the current government. Then again, good men never did the right thing because it was easy."

They included provincial officials, workers' representatives, disaffected bureaucrats, activists of all types and, in several cases, old proponents of the fallen neo-Rurikids.\n\nThis gave them great numbers, yes, but as became increasingly evident, also made any form of unified action near impossible. Those protestors on the rightward edges of the spectrum argued and clashed with those on the left. Both despised the 'weakness' of those in the center. And those in the center reciprocated, refusing to pander to 'extremists' of any fashion.\n\nThe police had naturally been called out, and it had been the original intention of the government to disperse the protest. Violently if need be. But as the hours continued it became clear that such would not be needed. Arguments among the protestors turned into fistfights, and before long the protest collapsed entirely, dispersing soon after. Some of the most hardened protestors had to be arrested, of course, but it had overall been a victory won without much engagement.\n\nAnd many in the government hoped it was a sign of the increasing irrelevance of opposition in general."

Now that we know Japan is interested, it's time to work on the details on how the pipeline should be built. Splitting the cost may be the best idea, but another option is to involve more Russians in the project to ensure the pipeline stays in our influence.\n\nThe first decision to be made is who should build the pipeline. Our first option is a mix of Japanese contract workers and Sibir employees. While balancing a fine line between Japanese and Russian, knowing the Japanese, they may hamper the project more than help it. We could instead invite Sibir to take all the work, and while it may be more expensive for us, the output may be far greater. However, the Japanese may not like this decision, seeing us as taking too much control. Which option should we choose?"

While it will satisfy the Japanese government and ensure we are the ones working hardest, it will be more expensive. Another solution is to try and strike a balance between both Japan and Central Siberia. This means we will both supply the materials. The last option is to make Japan fully supply the operation.

 NOV_regional.32.desc: "We have received news from Mongolia that the pipeline we helped construct with Japan has finally been built. With this new pipeline completed, it will be much easier for natural gas to travel between us and the Japanese sphere. This will be a great boon for Central Siberia and Japan economically and is a sign of our two nations growing closer. Hopefully, the profits made from the pipeline will pay off all costs it took to build."

 NOV_regional.33.t: "Nothing to Hide, Nothing to Fear"
 NOV_regional.33.desc: "As they did every night following supper, the family living in a recently-constructed house in the suburbs of Novosibirsk gathered together to watch the evening programs on the television.\n\nTonight, an important announcement had moved the national news to the front of the lineup, and the family, with the parents in particular, paid close attention. The government had, the television proclaimed while accompanied by patriotic pipes, just passed the Sovereign Security Act, in clear response to the many threats facing the state.\n\nThe vastly expanded powers granted to the authorities by the Act promised to decisively fight terrorist activity, and protect the integrity of the Federation and its citizens. They promised peace and security for all, and that, should a good citizen have nothing to hide, they had nothing to fear.\n\nThe family watched this with great interest. The parents remembered well the chaos that had engulfed Central Siberia years hence, the visceral fear that 'others,' political, cultural, or otherwise, would engulf them, overrun them, and take from them the life they had worked so hard for. And, so, they were content. The Act promised security, and security was desired.\n\nThey knew they had nothing to fear. They were good citizens and they, of course, had nothing to hide."
 NOV_regional.33.a: "Security. For the Federation, and for our children."

 NOV_regional.34.t: "Barnaul Resists"
 NOV_regional.34.desc: ""What are you saying to me, Ivan? Yes... yes..." as Pokryshkin swallowed, a harsh silence fell over the receiver. "I see what you are saying. Goodbye."\n\nAlexander Pokryshkin's anger betrayed his normally-cynical exterior, but the ex-aviator did not lash out - he rarely ever did. One of his many confidants sat across from Pokryshkin's desk, his hands tented. "I can assume that Ivan was the bearer of bad news?" The only response - a simple grimace - was enough to bring the confidant up to speed.\n\n"I thought we had the numbers. I thought we had the names," Pokryshkin muttered as he stared out his window onto the bustling streets of Novosibirsk. His mind calculated his options busily. A distant memory from long ago - a piece of off-hand advice from a friend - floated into his consciousness. "Never make a decision angry." Words Pokryshkin tried hard to live by. "Barnaul's won this round of the game," Pokryshkin stated matter-of-factly, any trace of anger long gone. "But their victory's still a fantasy. He might be getting more popular in the opposition circles, but that means nothing. There will be another battle, another war. And that time, we'll make sure that there's no winning for the bastard of Barnaul."\n\nHis confidant, with little to say, nodded succinctly. It was true - Shukshin's name was whispered from the peripheries of the Duma, it seemed more and more every day - but Pokryshkin was in control."
 NOV_regional.34.a: "Lick 'em tomorrow."

 NOV_regional.35.t: "Barnaul Buckles"
 NOV_regional.35.desc: ""Very good, thank you for the prompt call, Ivan. And remember - say hi to that wife of yours for me. I miss her pelmeni!" Alexander Pokryshkin put down the phone, its receiver clicking soundly as it was cradled. A slight smile betrayed the good news to his company - a good friend and political associate sat opposite him. Not a member of the Federation's Duma, per se, but a corporate liaison between Feniks and the government. A very good person to keep close, for both Pokryshkin and Feniks.\n\n"I take it Ivan brings us good news?" he asked, nearly rhetorically. Pokryshkin nodded.\n\n"The motion passed. Not without a surprising amount of opposition, however. I'll have to have Ivan look into that. Apparently the name 'Vasily Shukshin' has become basically synonymous with some sort of misplaced democratic idealism."\n\nPokryshkin and his associate both chuckled. The former flying ace wore the small smile that Ivan helped paint for the rest of the day. As he got into bed, he couldn't help but feel gratified in his successful curtaining of Barnaul's influence in the Federation."
 NOV_regional.35.a: "The Federation shaped further."

 NOV_regional.36.t: "Well-Tilled Fields, Happy Endings"
 NOV_regional.36.desc: "Konstantin stared out into the fields of his farm, a gently rocking sea of amber lit up by the cold morning sun. The boards of his porch creaked under his feet as he stepped up to the railing, taking in a breath of the crisp air. Harvest season was almost upon him and he could just about taste it in the wind as he watched his children running, care free, through acres of wheat, playing some game that only existed in their precious little minds. Konstantin let a smile creep across his face, remembering when he and his family were nothing but another group of battered refugees. But things are different now. Better. His children now smiled and laughed and will not have to worry about where their next meal would come from. That last fact was very apparent as Konstantin felt the tell tale scent of a cooking breakfast waft past his nose.\n\nThey'd come so far, and they'd done it all themselves. The blisters and cuts in their hands after clearing acres of brambles, the racket of hammers striking nails and saws biting through wood when they rebuilt the house where breakfast now sizzled in a pan, the soreness in his arms after working for hours sowing the fields... It was all worth it. For once, he felt like he belonged somewhere. This was where he was meant to be, not by grace of God but his own will. Konstantin had a home for his family, beautiful fields with their own bounty to harvest soon, and most of all he was able to watch his children play without a care in the world for the first time in ages."

 NOV_regional.37.t: "Tomorrow, Forever"
 NOV_regional.37.desc: ""Are you sure about this, Luka?" his former colleague asked.\n\n"Yes, Mikhail. Do you have a better suggestion?"\n\n"No, I just...I never thought I'd be working for Titan."\n\n"Neither did I, but don't give up hope! Just because the Republic fell doesn't mean we can't still look to the future, eh?"\n\nMikhail seemed to consider it silently, finding some solace from the anxiety the whole team felt since Federation troops marched through Tomsk. Luka wished he believed his own words, but he couldn't. After the surrender, he found himself alone with Mikhail, Artyom, and three other scientists looking to him for guidance. He was prepared to work within a command structure and lead a small team on a single project, not make decisions for people that would shape the rest of their lives without any guidance. It wasn't what he wanted, it wasn't fair, and yet, here he was.\n\nThe worst part was the simplicity of the choice offered to them. They would work for Titan, or they would not work at all. The sheer injustice of it drove Luka to tears sometimes, but there was simply nothing else. Titan bought out everything. There was no other way. Something died in him every time he told himself that, but perhaps it was for the best. It made it easier to look at his team members in the eye when he spoke to them.\n\nLuka looked to the rest of his team while Mikhail stared out the window in contemplation. They sat quietly, the usual lively discourse dead and gone. No more theories, no more arguments, no more idealism. Instead, their eyes revealed the same image as in Luka's heart: a lonely flame in the dark, finally sputtering out.\n\n"But... Without the Republic, what are we even working for anymore?" Mikhail asked, desperation once again in his voice.\n\n"The same thing we've always been working towards," Luka said, his lip twisting into a lifeless smile as he repeated the motto of his soon-to-be employer:"

 NOV_regional.40.desc: "Our overtures to the Americans are on the verge of complete success, and negotiations have reached a point where all that remains is to propose, and hopefully receive, final acceptance.\n\nDiplomatic missives are currently being prepared, by a joint group of state officials and industry representatives, aimed at extending an offer to America to construct a sizable industrial complex focused on the production of military goods and materiel within our territory. If successful, the benefits to us will be considerable.\n\nWhile we cannot be absolutely sure of American agreement to said missives, our experts have informed us that such acceptance is highly likely in the long term, though they do caution that it is highly likely that the Americans will request additional stipulations. It is as yet unknown what those stipulations could entail.\n\nBut an opportunity must be explored to be realized, and we will do so. Very soon the message will be sent, and we must only await a reply."
 NOV_regional.40.a: "Surely they will accept?"

 NOV_regional.41.t: "Building Factories in Novosibirsk"
 NOV_regional.41.desc: "Now that extensive trade deals are beginning to open up with us and the Central Siberian Federation, the government in Novosibirsk is asking us if we can construct military factories for them. This would be expensive, however, and constructing heavy industry on the other side of the world means less focused on our own economy.\n\nWe also have little to gain besides helping out a potential future ally and perhaps aligning the Federation closer to us, but still, giving Siberia free industry is not a good deal. In exchange for military factories, we could ask for some Siberian troops to go into our own overseas military posts and garrisons. This will be a relief for those on duty, if just for a couple of months.\n\nLocations such as Iceland and Australia will be great locations to send these Siberian troops and allow some of our own boys to come home and see their families, if just for a little while."
 NOV_regional.41.a: "Sounds like a deal."
 NOV_regional.41.b: "There's just not enough in it for us."
 
 NOV_regional.42.t: "An Unusual Condition"
 NOV_regional.42.desc: "We have received a response from America, and they have agreed to build factories for us but on one condition, we send our own troops to American military posts. The Americans argue that their troops need a break, and we could easily provide that. More factories are always a good thing, but sending our men to a distant continent may not be worth it. Having our men go to locations such as Australia, Iceland, and others will place them far from home if war were to arise. The loss of manpower may be too great, even if it is just for a few months, so we must judge what is worth more.\n\nInstead, it may be better to just trade weapons instead. While factories would be better in the long run, trading weapons may be a more agreeable deal. What should be our response?"

The others stuck with him on the godforsaken continent hardly seemed much better.\n\n"Vasily, is this what you expected when you volunteered for a tropical paradise?"\n\nTurning his head back, Ivanov glared at the offending soldier. Corporal Federov was taking this all in good stride; the sole man to not be completely miserable, and he even had the nerve to joke! Suppressing a rebuke, Vasily's eyes flickered to a group of Australians approaching them, shouting at them with their strange accents.\n\n"Federov, what are they saying."\n\nThe Corporal took a moment to listen and suppressed a grin before replying, "He said to watch out for the drop bears Sergeant.""

 NOV_regional.44.desc: "Despite our best efforts, the Central Siberian Federation has refused to accept the terms of our offer. However, they have provided a new offer that many think worth consideration: that we simply sell them weapons, making us money immediately and generally improving Siberian trade, while still allowing them to arm themselves. While this has the advantage of us seeing an immediate benefit to the deal, there are some who are not fond of the idea of, in their eyes, allowing a Russian warlord to dictate terms to us, saying that it sets a bad precedent.

It is expected that responses to these overtures will, in the immediate future, necessitate the establishment of foreign bureaus for the purposes of direct relations as well as the facilitation of trade.\n\nThe Corps expects that any personnel so assigned to such foreign bureaus keep in mind the geopolitical position of the nations in which they operate, both in relation to the Federation and in relation to other international alliances. Until such time as instruction is received as to the direction of the Federation's international political associations, no favoritism of any kind is to be displayed.\n\nIf you, or your colleagues, have any concerns, do not hesitate to direct them to your immediate superior.

Established due to the inefficiencies present in past research efforts, the Central Design Bureau is meant to give scientific study greater organization and coordination under Federal oversight, allowing it to truly prosper without unnecessary overlap or competition between scientists, problems present in the past under the previous decentralized nature of research in Novosibirsk.\n\nNow that it has been opened, research and design within the Federation will progress at a much more rapid rate, allowing us to close the technological gap with the rest of the world, and even innovate, creating new technologies in various fields ourselves. This is a great victory not only for the Federation, but for all of Russian science."

 NOV_regional.51.t: "A Civil Discussion"
 NOV_regional.51.desc: "Within a smoke filled boardroom in Novosibirsk executives from Sibir and Feniks sat and talked about the direction of the Federation's foreign policy. The men were dressed in the finest suits and smoked the finest imported cigars. A man from Sibir spoke up, "It seems clear to me that we should open up closer ties to the Japanese. We can leverage the influence of the Zaibatsu and increase our own influence in the Japanese markets."\n\n"Are you serious? The Japanese markets are dominated by the Zaibatsu, we would be operating at a loss for years. It's too risky. We would be much better off breaking into the American markets," an executive from Feniks insisted.\n\n"Perhaps we might look to the former Triumvirate? The economic chaos they have recently experienced could be the perfect time for us to strike. These are truly untapped markets that are hungry for new investments," yet another Feniks' man put forward.\n\n"All of you seem to be ignoring a large source of potential profit. The Reich may have been ravaged by its civil war, but it is still a very rich market," as the man from Sibir stopped speaking, the boardroom fell completely silent. All around the table the other executives looked at him with aghast expressions.\n\n"Are you insane!? The Germans? Those bastards would sooner kill us all than do business with us. What kind of bullshit have you Sibir boys been drinking? The Reich is off the table. Period." After that the boardroom descended into raised voices just short of shouting. Board members wagged their cigars at each other and hurled insults.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, tensions had reached their highest point and only the break for lunch had prevented the room from descending into complete chaos."

 ### Superregional events ###
 
 NOV_superregional.1.t: "A Den of Radicals"
 NOV_superregional.1.desc: "Pokryshkin tossed the report onto his desk in disgust. It was a general overview on the situation in far eastern Siberia, and reading through it had dashed all traces of optimism he had felt about the region. It wasn't all bad, to be fair. Controlling the port town of Magadan finally gave them access to the sea, and with a little investment Irkutsk could become a major economic and industrial hub. But aside from a few scattered bright spots like those the report was nothing but bad news. The Far East had always been difficult to administer, even for a united Russian nation. Now he had to attempt the same task with far less resources than the Empire or the Union had been able to field. And on top of everything else, there was the main topic of the report: Partisans.\n\nBased on early reports alone Pokryshkin's security experts were telling him there were no less than eight organized radical terrorist organizations operating in the Far East, and possibly as many as a dozen. They came in all stripes. Fascists, communists, monarchists, anarchists, zealots, Cossacks, separatists, and more besides. The only reason they hadn't already collapsed the entire east into partisan warfare was because they spent as much time fighting each other as the central government. The report warned that might not be the case forever. The longer they are allowed to exist, the more likely it is that like-minded groups will form a common front against the newly formed Russian Federation. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nPokryshkin picked up the phone and started dialing the number. If consolidating Central Siberia had taught him anything, it was that there was only one way to deal with radicals. They were so wrapped up in their own meaningless theories and ideologies they barely even lived in the real world, and that made them too dangerous to tolerate. They would be dragged out of their holes and brought into the light where the people of Russia could see them for what they were: not brave partisans, but desperate terrorists with no place in the new Russia."
 NOV_superregional.1.a: "There is no room for mercy here."
 
 NOV_superregional.2.t: "Hunters of Men"
 NOV_superregional.2.desc: "The truck rolled down the dirt road through the forest, jostling the men inside. A few smoked in silence, filling the back of the truck with the smell of cigarettes. Some slept, their snores inaudible over the rumbling engine. Feodor was seated at the rear of the truck, staring out of the window, while next to him Lev continued to jabber incessantly.\n\n"Hey Feodor, how do you know when you've killed a communist?"\n\n"I don't know Lev, how?" Feodor said.\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls his own blood reactionary and tells it to read more theory!" Lev laughed at his own joke, though Feodor was unamused. Seeing this, Lev tried again.\n\n"How do you know when you've killed a fascist?"\n\nFeodor glared at him.\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls you a Jew bastard and says his blood is too strong to leave his body!"\n\nOnce more Lev cackled at his own lack of wit, and once more Feodor remained silent. When Lev finished laughing Feodor spoke.\n\n"Have you ever killed anyone Lev?"\n\nLev looked at him, confused. "Maybe, I've fired my gun in combat a lot but I'm not sure."\n\n"Well, have you ever watched anyone bleed out?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well I have. I've watched five men die. A communist, two anarchists, a fascist, and a Cossack. None of them talked about race or theory while they were dying.""

 NOV_superregional.3.t: "Shoot and Smash"
 NOV_superregional.3.desc: "They struck at midnight. The raid preceded by the blinding light of flares scattered around the building as the soldiers sprang the trap. Machine guns sprayed death barely feet off the ground as the infantry sprang into action, pushing towards the structure in a text-book assault. Ducking into cover just before a dozen slugs which tore through the space that he had formerly occupied, the air went out of his chest. He took a few deep breaths and blinked his eyes once, twice, three times. Good enough. Firing a few bullets at the general direction of the structure, the Sergeant rolled left to join the rest of his unit, already going through the motions of the battle drill.\n\nThe screaming, shooting, and dying lasted all of five minutes before the white handkerchiefs went up, and the black-shirted figures stepped out in surrender, bodies surrounding the once picturesque cabin. As he counted losses, and took in sight, Ivanov gave the sorry looking Blackshirts a glare of contempt, for all their enthusiasm for violence, he had seen anarchists handle themselves better than these jackbooted thugs."
 NOV_superregional.3.a: "Looters and criminals do not make an army."
 
 NOV_superregional.4.t: "The Last Gasp"
 NOV_superregional.4.desc: "Captain Ivan Brantov led his men through the streets of Irkutsk in the dead of night. His men moved as a well-oiled machine through the darkness. They were deep in the industrial district of Irkutsk, closing in on the workers' housing that dotted the outskirts of the factories. Their mission was a simple one, to root out elements of Yagoda's NKVD that had survived the strife in the Far East.\n\nAs they approached their target, he motioned for his men to split into two teams. His team would breach the front of the enemy structure, an abandoned apartment complex. The second team, under the command of Lieutenant Ugolev, would be tasked with breaching the rear entry and preventing the enemy from making a retreat. Ivan approached the doorway into the building unmolested and had his men stack up on the doors. His men entered the building and were met with an eerie silence. The men went about securing the first floor and found nothing, there was no sign this floor had been inhabited in years.\n\nIvan left three men behind in the lobby to act as a rearguard and pressed forward towards the stairwell. This would be the most dangerous part of the operation, traversing the stairwell into the second and third floors. He crept up the stairs slowly, keeping watch for any sort of traps. It was as he ascended the last step that he heard the gunfire from the base of the stairs. They had used the elevator shaft to get behind them.\n\nIvan began to shout out orders but was cut off as he had to dive for cover as soldiers on the second floor opened fire. He was only able to take rare potshots at his assailants. He was able to drop one before being hit in the shoulder. His rifle clattered from his grasp and fell down the stairwell. He cursed and drew his sidearm, only to be perforated by fire from a man on the stairs above him.\n\nIvan's body tumbled onto his men below. Before the NKVD could celebrate, the rear team made their appearance. The communists were defeated, but it was a pyrrhic victory at best."

 NOV_superregional.5.t: "Partisan Activity Decreases"
 NOV_superregional.5.desc: "It has been reported, to the central government, that the efforts of the national anti-partisan task force have continued to show considerable effect.\n\nAcross the territories in which they have been deployed, executed operations, against remnants of both the RFP as well as various communist organs, have proven highly successful, with only several reported failures. Large numbers of insurgents and dissidents have been captured or killed, enormous quantities of material have been captured, and insurgent leadership has been greatly compromised.\n\nConcurrently, elements of state government have returned to, or been established in, areas declared secured from partisan influence. This has not only returned life to normal for millions of our citizens, but greatly strengthened our control of, and extraction from, the regions in question.\n\nHowever, we must take care to not grow complacent. Though activity has, through vigorous and sometimes bloody action, decreased, fanatical elements do remain, and they are still to be considered extremely dangerous.\n\nWe must stay the course. Until our lands are secured - and purged of partisan elements - for good."

 NOV_superregional.6.t: "A Future in the Commissariat"
 NOV_superregional.6.desc: "Life had never been easy for Ruslan or his family. Not under the communists, not under the fascists and not, so far at least, under the new regime of the Federation.\n\nThey had always been poor in the extreme, and Ruslan had watched as his father, his uncle, and his older brother worked themselves into the ground trying to keep their farm working. He had thought that to be his eventual fate as well, but then, accompanying his father into the village to sell their produce, he had seen the poster.\n\nMen were needed, it said, to fill out the many new commissariats the Federation had established throughout the Far East. To help distribute supplies, provide order and, of course, secure the land for the state. It also offered pay. Pay far in excess of what Ruslan could earn selling vegetables. And, so, after seeing his father to market he had walked towards the enlistment booth set up in the square.\n\nHis father had not been happy, but he had, in the end, understood. Ruslan was trying to secure a better future for himself, and the man could not begrudge his son that, allowing him to depart with his blessing.\n\nRuslan could only hope that he was successful."
 NOV_superregional.6.a: "A boy departs. Will a man return?"
 
 NOV_superregional.7.t: "Port of Profit"
 NOV_superregional.7.desc: "Having received significant investment into its development under the rule of the Federation, the seaside city of Magadan has transformed from a backwater second-rate harbor braved only by the most daring of sailors, into a truly international port welcoming to all, but especially those with money in their pockets. Every day, ships from all around the Pacific carrying sailors and traders from all around the world stop at the docks, loading or unloading cargo into or out of their storages, with hired help always available from the people of Magadan if they need it.\n\nThis success in its function as a port has made Magadan a key part of the Federal economy, bringing great wealth into Siberia and enriching all involved in the industry. At the same time, the promise of riches and greatness has attracted many from across the Federation to the city, making Magadan grow and even blossom. The addition of a new significant port to those already existing along the Pacific has also caused an increase of trade in the region, benefiting the partners of the Federation as well."

 NOV_superregional.8.t: "Commissarial Training"
 NOV_superregional.8.desc: "A long, hard life of farming would certainly have prepared Ruslan for the hardships of military training. Or so he had thought. The reality was very different indeed.\n\nThe man at the enlistment station had been all smiles. His boot camp instructor was all frowns. Along with shouting and anger besides. He woke every morning in the pitch dark, marched until he was exhausted, instructed and then tested on the lessons afterwards, shoveled as much food down as possible, and then fell into an exhausted sleep. Only to repeat the process the next day.\n\nDespite the hardship, however, Ruslan could not say that he hated the experience. He was learning skills, both military and organizational, and was making many friends besides. Friends from all over the region, from areas he had only ever heard of in passing, and they were fascinating.\n\nHe could not wait until he completed training, and got a chance to see the lands of whatever region he was assigned to. He knew, now, that this was to be his destiny. His career.\n\nThe better future he had hoped for."

 NOV_superregional.9.t: "The Almighty Airborne"
 NOV_superregional.9.desc: "Observing as his men went about their interminable duties, General Vasily Margelov knew that, if nothing else, he had at least made his soldiers ready for what was to come. The Federation was strong, but these men were stronger. The Federation stood ready to at last reunite the Motherland by any means necessary, and these men would lead the charge in any further conflict towards that goal. They had truly become a unit he could be proud of, as a father is of his children.\n\nOne of them walked up to him, delivering a perfectly crisp salute before beginning to deliver a scheduled report. Margelov could barely make out the words, however, too lost in his own thoughts. As confident as he was in their ability, only more hardship awaited them now as they began to move west. He was confident that they were ready, of course. The question was, would being ready be enough? There was no way of knowing if even the best of Russia's soldiers could win the wars to come, and more importantly, which of them would make it back alive.\n\nAs the man before him finished his report, Margelov nodded and sent him off, to be alone with his thoughts and anxieties."

 NOV_superregional.10.desc: "The 2nd President of the Siberian Federation turned towards his rapt audience, the thousands eagerly awaiting the first words of his Inaugural Address. He didn't have a prepared speech per-se; he couldn't fix the country's many problems with a professional speechwriter. No, this was to the start of a new kind of administration.\n\nThe people had suffered enough, first from Bukharin's authoritarianism and mismanagement, and then from the CSR and their misguided idealism who had gotten so many killed in their failed wars. Finally, Pokryshkin and his corporate backers, who in their endless pursuit of stability and wealth, had forgotten the average Russian.\n\nThere would be no more of that, not on his watch. Some may have sympathized with his cause - Sibir, and their backers - but Feniks, Titan, and the rest of them were venal, corrupt, heartless, ruled by a hundred would-be dictators. To hell with them. The supremacy of the corporations, the rise of the Siloviki, the bastardization of the Federation's ideals, those had been the final straws, the acts which made good people stand up and retake their destiny.\n\nAnd so he spoke. "Fellow citizens, I have not come to begin a revolution. I have come to fulfill the ideals of which we have not forgotten!"\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly.\n\nHe smiled, basking in the love of his fellow citizens. It would be a long, hard road, but President Shukshin knew he could make things right again."
 NOV_superregional.10.a: "The winds have changed."
 
 NOV_superregional.11.t: "In the Office"
 NOV_superregional.11.desc: "For what seemed like the hundredth time that day, Vasily Shukshin looked over the legislation crowding the President's- no, his desk. It was still hard to believe that the Presidency, for so long the preview of Pokryshkin and his ilk, was now in the hands of a peasant from Atlay, but he was here, and it was his.\n\nPicking up one of the many pages on his desk Shukshin looked over it once more, slowly flipping through its contents. Workers' protections, new regulations encompassing lobbying, and other vectors of corporate influence, stringent antitrust laws. It wouldn't be enough to defang the corporations, not by a long shot. Their influence reached far too deep for a mere piece of legislation to reverse the impact of a decade of unfettered exploitation, but it was a start.\n\nThe corporate giants, and Pokryhkin's clique, would fight them every step of the way. Their lackeys in the Duma, and the Siloviki who had long been paid off with corporate gold. Shukshin, however, had the will of the people - and the power of the Presidency - on his side."
 NOV_superregional.11.a: "It's good to be President."
 
 NOV_superregional.12.t: "A Writer and a Falcon"
 NOV_superregional.12.desc: "It was early in the morning when the two men met in one of the many rooms of the Presidential palace, flames flickering in the fireplace, snowmelt falling from the frost-covered roof. The new and former President of the Siberian Federation glancing at each other uneasily. They had been friends once, comrades in arms during the final days of the Republic. Those days were gone, a friendship strained and broken amidst the rise of the Federation.\n\n"Where did it all go wrong Vasily? Where did we lose our way." Shukshin glanced up at Pokryshkin's voice, the Falcon of Siberia staring down into his drink. There was no malice in eyes, no resentment, just a colorless pallor, and a resigned expression.\n\nShukshin stared at his own drink, for he had no response. No answer to the question that he himself had pondered on many a sleepless night. He could still faintly remember the optimism in the Federation's early days, the final break from the decaying Republic amidst the chaos of the Siberian War and Anarchist Revolt. A time where the Federation seemed to have a place for everybody, regardless of ideology or wealth. Before the corruption and cynicism set in, before the rise of the Siloviki and the Corporations.\n\nHe could point to many a time where he or Pokryshkin should've stepped in, should've moved to reign in the excesses of the system. But, the Federation itself was a reaction, a result of the failed idealism of the poets and artists in Tomsk. Perhaps the cynicism which arose in idealism's place was simple yet another inevitable, another result of the Republic's failure.\n\nShukshin looked back up at his compatriot, the Falcon was waiting for an answer, and so he spoke the honest truth."
 NOV_superregional.12.a: ""I don't know Pokryshkin, I don't know.""
 
 NOV_superregional.13.t: "A Victory for the Silovik State"
 NOV_superregional.13.desc: "President Pokryshkin sat behind his desk with a sense of satisfaction. Shukshin and his colleagues had failed. He had been confirmed as the President of the Federation against all of his detractors. The President smiled as he sipped on an aged brandy from his private stock.\n\nThe election had been the death knell of the Federalist cause. Shukshin had been ousted from his position, with his good friend Mikhail Devyatayev taking up the position once occupied by the bleeding heart mayor. With another drink he thought of his next moves. He would have to ensure that the Federalists were completely shut out of power. They would need to be replaced by men loyal to the cause of the Federation, strong men who would provide stability for the state. A return to business as usual was essential, as now that he had been confirmed he would need to consolidate the power of the executive.\n\nLooking out over the city, Alexander took another sip and leaned back in his chair. The election had ensured that the legitimacy of the silovik system had been cemented in the public consciousness. Indeed, the failure of the federalists was the best thing that could have happened for his regime.\n\nAlexander raised his glass to the window and gave a small toast to himself and the Federation."
 NOV_superregional.13.a: "A toast to the strong."
 
 NOV_superregional.14.t: "New Opportunities"
 NOV_superregional.14.desc: "President Alexander Pokryshkin strode into the conference room exuding nothing but the utmost confidence in his position. Already seated were representatives of the big three corporations in the Federation. As he took his seat, he helped himself to the offered drink and practically ignored the other men at the table. When he was ready, he motioned for the men to begin the meeting. "Thank you for joining us, Mr. President. We understand how busy your schedule is and appreciate this meeting," a well groomed man from Sibir began. After the usual pleasantries were observed, business began in earnest.\n\n"Gentlemen, the Federation's recent acquisition of the Russian Far East has opened up to us a whole new area for profit. What the region lacks in population it more than makes up for in the sheer bounty of natural resources," Pokryshkin began.\n\n"Indeed, the region has a vast potential for the expansion of our operations, and the profits therein. The question, I suppose, must be on the distribution of this vast material wealth. All of our companies have interest in the lands of the Far East, after all." The Sibir man glared at the representative from Titan as he spoke. In order to head off any argument, the President spoke.\n\n"Gentlemen, as with all of our acquisitions, you shall have a say in the distribution of the land. So long as your financial departments can afford. I believe we shall first speak of the lands around the city of Irkutsk, as they are ripe for exploitation."\n\nThe meeting progressed as smoothly as previous meetings had, and by the end of it the President had made many profitable deals with the men, enough to ensure the economy of the Federation continued to flourish, at least."
 NOV_superregional.14.a: "The bounty of the Far East, open at last."
 
 NOV_superregional.15.t: "Faded Ideals"
 NOV_superregional.15.desc: "President Alexander Pokryshkin sat at his desk late in the night. Frost creeped on the edges of his windows and a great fire roared in the fireplace. He leaned back in his chair after a long day, having only just finished the day's paperwork, and sipped a glass of wine. As he sat there, stewing in his own thoughts, his mind drifted back to better days. He remembered his days flying high in the air over the battle lines, fighting for the glory of Bukharin's Union. He remembered the pride he took in the ideals of the Union, the brotherhood of all its people, and the optimism that had consumed them all in those days.\n\nBefore he could get too invested in the nostalgia, however, he remembered the worst parts of those days. He could remember the despair of the Great Patriotic War, the fear and terror he felt as the Germans just kept pushing no matter what he did. The feelings of despair as he fought a desperate war in the air as his friends and countrymen died on the ground, knowing there was nothing he could that could turn the tide. Most of all he remembered the death of the Union's ideals when the Germans pushed to the AA Line and the union fell.\n\nThe ideals of those days could not last before the onslaught of the fascists. Even in the aftermath, when the Central Siberian Republic was whole and strong, it could not be said that the grand ideals of the past had succeeded. Yet, his ideals had not truly faded until the Federation began its march for a strong Russia.\n\nAlexander shook his head, dismissing the musings of the past. The old days were behind him and thoughts of a free Russia had been dismissed for good reason. What Russia needed was strength and stability at any cost. At his core he knew this to be true."
 NOV_superregional.15.a: "To a strong and stable Russia."

 NOV_superregional.16.t: "The Music of Machinery"
 NOV_superregional.16.desc: "President Alexander Pokryshkin looked upon Novosibirsk from his office and smiled. Before him was a city fit to be the capital of his new Russian Federation. Skyscrapers towered over the city, filled with the new ruling class of Russia: the Oligarchs, the overseers of his new Russia. This truly was the paradise for the Siloviks.\n\nHowever, as Alexander continued to stare from his office down below, he also saw those who benefited the least from his system. Ragged workers walked to and fro towards the factories on the outskirts of the city. Those unemployed could be seen laying about in the streets, begging for money only to be cleared out by the police and forced to go somewhere else other than the upper districts. Memories of Shukshin's cries for a fair and just Russia filled Alexander's mind, which only made him chuckle. That man was a shell, a broken man forced back to the bottle he hated so much, for Shukshin and his posse had failed to realize one, singular truth about Russia.\n\nRussia was a harsh nation, and it needed to a strongman to bring it to progress and modernity.\n\nAnd Russia needed to be strong and stable for what was to come. The Germans still had their steely grip on Moscow and Russians suffered under them. They deserved to be a part of Russia, for they are true born Russians, not colonial subjects of a regime of a foreign nation. He would receive what belonged to the Federation back no matter what, no matter the cost.\n\nThe machine of Russia had been broken time and time again, but he had fixed the machine. Now, he orchestrated a symphony of machines, working together for his grand designs for his nation. He couldn't help but smile as he sat down once again in his chair, and toasted the victory to come."
 NOV_superregional.16.a: "And so, the music of machinery continues unhindered."

 NOV_superregional.17.t: "A Visit to the Ob"
 NOV_superregional.17.desc: "The rising sun illuminated the waters of the Ob with a brilliant glow, orange splotches dancing amidst its glimmering waters. They were cleaner now, thanks to new regulations, and he could see several families picnicking along the river's banks.\n\nShukshin allowed himself a small drink as he took in the sight, remembering his excursion to the waterfront nearly a decade ago. Unchecked corporate excess and institutional corruption, a government-run by and for local strongmen. He had changed all that; no longer did corporate greed dictate policy and law, no longer were the working class squeezed for every penny. There was still much to be done, of course, fairer regulations, the issue of Pokryshkin's clique, increased federalization, and the ever-pressing matter of the hated Germans.\n\nYet, as he saw workers joking around in the fields just beyond the river and families enjoying a vacation for the first time in years, Shukshin felt something stir inside of him. The idealism which was once so infectious in the early days of the Central Siberian Republic. He was doing this for them, for the people, for Russia, all of Russia, not just those born into power, those blessed by circumstance. He remembered those days, the headiness and optimism, and how everything fell apart under the strain of the Siberian War, and the fighting against the anarchists, the food riots, the shootings.\n\nHe poured himself another drink as the morning sun rose high in the sky. The CSR may have fallen under the strain of war, but the Federation-his Federation-was different, stronger, and more robust, yet no less concerned for the welfare of its citizens.\n\nIt was different than the CSR. It had to be."
 NOV_superregional.17.a: "Or everything would have been for nothing."

 NOV_superregional.18.t: "Broken Idols, Solemn Dreams"
 NOV_superregional.18.desc: "Vasily Shukshin sat in his kitchen and nursed a glass of some local ale or another. Already he had drained seven glasses just like it and there was little indication that he would sober up anytime soon. His sobriety had been a personal point of pride for him once, when the drink had nearly consumed him. Now though, with his pride tarnished and hopes crushed before him, he relished the old feeling of drunkenness.\n\nHe had been so close. The elections were his chance to bring some semblance of justice and freedom to a system so abused by the Siloviks. And in the end it had all been for nothing. The deals and promises made to rally support, the hopes and dreams inspired in the people of the Federation were turned to ash with the solidification of Pokryshkin's victory.\n\nThe bastard had been quick to remove him from his position, to neuter any hope that he might use his power for the benefit of the people. Instead, one of the President's lackeys held his position to be a yes man for the Silovik regime. It sickened him, the whole rotten situation made him want to puke. The idea that everything he had done throughout his career, for the good of his people, would be wiped away by that smug bastard in Novosibirsk. Vasily clenched his eyes shut as tears threatened to break free.\n\nHis resistance was futile in the end as Vasily Shukshin, last hope for the freedom of the people of the Federation sobbed drunkenly in his kitchen. The tears only stopped long enough for him to pour another glass of alcohol before they started again."
 NOV_superregional.18.a: "Another victim of the Silovik state."

 ### Research and Development events ###
 NOV_rnd.7.t: "Project BICHEVATEL - Success"
 NOV_rnd.7.d: "The final round of test flights for the MiG-23 concluded yesterday and the results could not be clearer. Project BICHEVATEL has produced the most advanced fighter design to ever come out of Russia, and one of the most advanced fighters in the world, ready to duel any of its counterparts from America, Germany, and Japan, and more than up to the task of finishing off the paltry air forces of our domestic rivals.\n\nWe will not truly know how well the MiG-23 performs in live combat until it is tested in the field, but every simulated combat has shown it is capable of running circles around its opponents. The variable geometry of its wings allows the pilot to adjust between speed and maneuverability as needed, and the advanced radar system and air-to-air missiles have given the fighter a truly unprecedented striking range, capable of hitting enemies over the horizon and beyond the pilot's line of sight. With a fleet of these planes, we will soon be fielding one of the most advanced air forces in the world."
 NOV_rnd.7.a: "Excellent!"
 
 NOV_rnd.8.t: "Project BICHEVATEL - Partial Success"
 NOV_rnd.8.d: "The final round of test flights for the MiG-23 concluded yesterday and the results are mostly positive. The MiG-23 is unquestionably an advanced fighter, on par with those fielded by America, Germany, and Japan, but the new technologies it sports are less desirable than we would prefer, and it will take further tests and development to fully work them out.\n\nWe will not truly know how well the MiG-23 performs in live combat until it is tested in the field, but the simulated combats it has been through reveal a plane with a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. The variable geometry of its wings allows the pilot to adjust between speed and maneuverability as needed, but on several occasions the wings locked up mid-flight, forcing the pilot to fly in sub-optimal conditions until they could land for repairs. The advanced radar system has given the fighter an excellent striking range, capable of hitting enemies over the horizon, but the onboard tracking in the missiles malfunctioned frequently, making their extended range often useless. The MiG-23 is unquestionably a great step forward for Russian air power, but it has many kinks that must be worked out before it can go toe-to-toe with its global counterparts."
 NOV_rnd.8.a: "Progress, nonetheless."
 
 NOV_rnd.9.t: "Project BERKUT - Success"
 NOV_rnd.9.d: "Following a series of successful field tests, it has been determined that the S-25 missile system is ready for deployment, and the first anti-air installation is nearing completion on the outskirts of Novosibirsk. Testing showed the new missile to be far better at locking onto and tracking targets, and an improved ability to adjust course mid-flight, resulting in a greater number of simulated hits. Additionally, improvements to missile speed have greatly expanded the response time of anti-air emplacements while the extended range has allowed them to project a much wider zone of control in the skies over our cities.\n\nThough Novosibirsk was never reached by the terror bombing that plagued the lands to our west, our people still lived in constant fear of the day dark planes filled our skies and bombs blotted out the sun. We shall fear no longer, for if any enemy plane tries to approach our people, they shall be answered with swift and deadly vengeance. Russia's sky belongs to no one but us."
 NOV_rnd.9.a: "Let them come."
 
 NOV_rnd.10.t: "Project PROYDOKHA - Success"
 NOV_rnd.10.d: "As Western Russia can attest to, there is nothing more effective at destroying a nation's industry and demoralizing its people than systemic strategic bombing. For years our air force and those of the other warlords have been almost totally defensive in nature, more focused on beating back air raids than launching our own. This is finally beginning to change.\n\nEarly tests have shown that the M-50 is an extremely promising candidate as a next generation strategic bomber. Its four engines allow it to move at high speeds for an aircraft of its size and it is able to achieve extremely high altitudes, making it a difficult target for all but the heaviest anti-aircraft systems to hit. Even at high altitudes it is able to deliver its bomb load with extreme precision, comparable to the accuracy of the best bombers in the German air fleet. With the proper training and escorts, a squadron of these planes could rain hell on our enemies and escape without a scratch. When the time comes to reclaim the west from Germany, the M-50 will have what it takes to make the Germans regret thinking they could bomb us with impunity all those years ago."
 NOV_rnd.10.a: "They will learn to fear the skies."
 
 NOV_rnd.11.t: "Project PROYDOKHA - Inconclusive"
 NOV_rnd.11.d: "It is impossible to learn without making mistakes. That is what our engineers have told us after the first series of test runs for the M-50 prototype have exposed several major design flaws. Due to the bulk of the plane, additional engines had to be incorporated into the design to allow it to reach its target speed. The additional bulk of the engine reduced the plane's aerodynamic profile, making it less maneuverable and more vulnerable to interceptor aircraft. Additional issues with the bomb deployment mechanism made accurate targeting highly difficult.\n\nDespite the multitude of problems that have rendered the M-50 an unusable design, our engineers have managed to salvage some of the more innovative ideas incorporated into the prototype. The tests proved that the concept of high-altitude strategic bombing is both possible and achievable with an improved design, and with better engines it should be possible to produce a strategic bomber that is capable of achieving high speeds without issue. That bomber just won't be the M-50."
 NOV_rnd.11.a: "It's better than nothing."
 
 NOV_rnd.12.t: "Project PROYDOKHA - Failure"
 NOV_rnd.12.d: "Hopes were high when the prototype of the M-50 strategic bomber took to the air on its first test run. The development had been a long, difficult process from the very beginning. Issues in the first design were spotted and had to be corrected, then extra weight had to be accounted for. Several air frames had been built and disposed of after more issues were spotted. In the end, after months of stress and work by dozens of engineers and designers, the project had spent almost twice its original budget before a prototype was completed and ready to fly. It would all be worth it as long as the test was successful.\n\nAs the bomber climbed into the sky the men collected in the control tower watched nervously. The pilot read off readings at predetermined intervals, rattling off his air speed, temperature inside the cabin, fuel burn rate, and more. Everything seemed to be going well. One engineer breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe left wing started to visibly wobble. The pilot reported the plane was beginning to turn and shake outside of his control. The captain in the control tower grabbed the microphone and began to rattle off instructions when they all watched the wing tear off completely. The pilot ejected; a black speck held aloft by a white piece of canvas. Below him the prototype spiralled down to the earth, colliding in a fiery explosion.\n\nThe captain slumped back into his chair and muttered two words."
 NOV_rnd.12.a: "Well shit."
 
 NOV_rnd.13.t: "Project LETUCHAYA LISITSA - Success"
 NOV_rnd.13.d: "Through a combination of ingenuity, determination, and genius, our designers have managed to produce a truly revolutionary combat aircraft. The MiG-25 prototype has recently completed its final round of testing and to say the results are remarkable would be an understatement. The MiG-25 has demonstrated an operational speed of Mach 2.83 and a maximum speed of Mach 3.6, making it one of the fastest combat aircraft ever designed.\n\nWith our pilots able to achieve such high speeds, any attempt to penetrate our airspace will be quickly answered by a flurry of interceptor aircraft able to outpace anything the enemy could throw at us. For the first time in decades, Russian aircraft designers have not only managed to equal the works of their foreign counterparts, they have surpassed them entirely."
 NOV_rnd.13.a: "The first time of many."
 
 NOV_rnd.14.t: "Project LETUCHAYA LISITSA - Partial Success"
 NOV_rnd.14.d: "Through a combination of ingenuity and determination our designers have managed to produce a modern, capable combat aircraft. The MiG-25 prototype has recently completed its final round of testing and the results have been good, but the prototype has fallen short in several areas. The MiG-25 has demonstrated an operational speed of Mach 2.83 and a maximum speed of Mach 3.6, making it one of the fastest combat aircraft ever designed. However, it is unusually heavy for an interceptor aircraft, and its weight has necessitated unusually large wings for a plane of its class.\n\nOur pilots have shown an ability to fight effectively at the MiG-25's high speeds, but they have noted that the plane is less maneuverable than they would prefer. The design still has several issues to be resolved but the MiG-25 will soon be fully ready for production and deployment, and once it takes to the skies it will be able to stand against any air force in the world."
 NOV_rnd.14.a: "Better late than never."
 
 NOV_rnd.15.t: "Project KROKODIL - Success"
 NOV_rnd.15.d: "It is an exciting day for everyone in the Russian armed forces. Yesterday it was announced that a new prototype design for a modern attack helicopter, codenamed KROKODIL, was nearing the end of testing and would soon begin mass production and deployment. The army was especially excited, as it is usually the air force and not them who receives the fancy new toys. The new gunship, officially designated as the Mi-24, will be used in close conjunction with our land forces though, and the generals are practically salivating at the thought of a new mobile fire platform.\n\nSporting multiple machine gun turrets, an arsenal of air-to-surface missiles, and even a limited troop transport compartment, the Mi-24 is considered one of the most advanced dedicated attack helicopters in the world and it is already attracting foreign attention, with reports of interest from the American and Japanese militaries reaching our desks recently. Once the Mi-24 is deployed in large numbers our troops will never have to worry about going without air support again."
 NOV_rnd.15.a: "Give the designers a raise."
 
 NOV_rnd.16.t: "Project KROKODIL - Partial Success"
 NOV_rnd.16.d: "Project KROKODIL has finally produced a working prototype of the Mi-24 and despite several unexpected setbacks, it seems that the design is a very promising one. The design process took longer than expected and ran over budget due to last minute changes to the cockpit to increase damage resistance, but early testing shows that the Mi-24 is capable of providing an impressive amount of supporting fire on demand.\n\nThe prototype is slower than most modern attack helicopters, sacrificing speed and maneuverability to carry more weapons. To offset this disadvantage, it is heavily armored, leading some of the test pilots to dub it "the flying tank". As opposed to the rapid strike tactics of most attack helicopters, the Mi-24's pilots have been encouraged to adopt a new strategy of aggressive, prolonged engagements with ground forces, relying on their heavy weaponry to mow down enemy soldiers and vehicles alike while their armor soaks up any incoming fire."
 NOV_rnd.16.a: "Time for an aerial blitz."
 
 NOV_rnd.17.t: "Project ABAKAN - Success"
 NOV_rnd.17.d: "The TKB-011 assault rifle has passed its field tests and is now officially ready to begin mass production. Initial concerns about the rifle's lightweight construction being too fragile for combat have been dispelled after the prototype was adjusted to increase durability while keeping the weight low. Riflemen testing the accuracy have found the TKB-011 to be good for engagements at close and medium ranges, though accuracy does become a concern at long ranges. This is not an issue, as the rifle is intended for deployment with our airmobile infantry, who are trained for close quarters firefights rather than long range battles.\n\nThe commanders of our airmobile divisions are already clamoring to receive the first shipments of the new guns. With a dedicated AR designed specifically for helicopter-borne infantry finally available, we are anticipating a significant increase in the combat ability of some of our most elite and specialized troops."
 NOV_rnd.17.a: "A soldier is only as good as his gun."
 
 NOV_rnd.18.t: "Project ABAKAN - Failure"
 NOV_rnd.18.d: "The rifleman marched in to the corporal's office, a look of disappointment on his face.\n\n"The gun's no good."\n\nThe corporal stared at him, confused. "How do you know? You've only been testing it for five minutes."\n\nThe rifleman tossed the gun on the desk between them and pointed at it. "That's how."\n\nThe stock was shattered, the inner mechanisms of the gun clearly visible through the hole. "What the hell did you do to it?" demanded the corporal "run it over with a truck?"\n\n"I dropped it."\n\n"On what?"\n\n"The ground."\n\nThe corporal's look of frustration was replaced with one of fear. "Oh no." he managed to get out. "What about the other one?"\n\n"Skorpovsky's got it on the firing range but it's not looking great. He can shoot a fly off a donkey's ass from a kilometer out but he didn't hit a bullseye with it the whole time I was out there. Like I said, the gun's no good."\n\n"God fucking dammit.""

 ### Election events ###
 NOV_elections.0.t: "The Federal Election"
 NOV_elections.0.desc: "As the elections for the Federation ramp up, it's become clear that despite Alexander Pokryshkin's prior political ascendancy, that he's been challenged to that very ascendancy by none other than Vasily Shukshin, the mayor of Barnaul.\n\nBoth men occupy highly prestigious and very important positions within the Federation, but over the years have come to represent two very different currents of thought in regards to the Federation itself. Alexander Pokryshkin, the man that "saved the Federation from itself" and engineered its highly successful ascent, has campaigned on a platform of economic expansion, national stability, and measured patriotism.\n\nVasily Shukshin, on the other hand, represents the opposition to Pokryshkin's monopoly on power. Comprised of locals from Barnaul, supporters of a liberal democratic federation, and dissenters-turned-traitors from Pokryshkin's camp, Shukshin's platform is focused around political reform and an emphasis of a return to the roots - culturally and politically - especially in regards to remembering the origin of the Federation and a distaste for tyranny.\n\nAs each respective political player begins their campaign, only time will tell which of the two will come out on top."
 NOV_elections.0.a: "Campaign as Pokryshkin."
 NOV_elections.0.b: "Campaign as Shukshin."

 NOV_elections.1.t: "A Writer's Musings"
 NOV_elections.1.desc: "Vasily Shukshin was many things, a writer, actor, and poet, a Mayor, and politician. He had climbed his way from the son of peasants in Altay to become the second most powerful man in the Federation, the champion of democracy.\n\nHowever, as he sat at home, waiting for the results to come in, all he could feel was trepidation. Months worth of campaigning, dozens of speeches, rallies, and meetings; weeks of courting corporate representatives and sympathetic siloviki had led to this. He had crisscrossed Siberia, from Magadan to Kolpashevo, and now the only thing he could do was wait.\n\nShukshin stared at the bottle of vodka on his desk, resisting the temptation to pour himself a drink. Pokyrshkin and his allies would use every trick in the book to keep themselves in power, and all he could do was hope that the will of the people would be enough.\n\n--------------\n\nThe tallys came in agonizingly slowly, Shukshin's heart soaring at every positive result and sinking with every poor showing, but they were clear. Putting the bottle aside, Shukshin made preparations to move to Novosibirsk.\n\nThe people had spoken, and they wanted Pokryshkin out."
 NOV_elections.1.a: "Democracy breathes."

 NOV_elections.2.t: "The Outcome"
 NOV_elections.2.desc: "The dawn rose over Siberia as its people awoke from their slumber. The farmer, the worker, the housewife, they all knew what this morning meant. For months, the fate of the Siberian Federation had hung in the balance as the federation's current leader, the corporate status quo President Alexander Pokryshkin, has faced off against a challenge by the former mayor of Barnaul, the democratic Vasily Shukshin. They had dueled in the streets, in the farms, in the barracks, in the very hearts and minds of the people. Everyone knew that whoever won this election, it would determine if the Federation remained in its corporate state status quo or if the Federation would turn a new corner into democracy, a concept the Federation lay unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd so, as they gathered around their radios, bought the morning newspapers and even gathered around the few TVs dotted about the country, they waited with bated breath to hear what would happen to their homeland. Every man, woman, and child sat with baited breath as the newscaster began to speak.\n\n"Hello citizens of the Siberian Federation, this is Nikolai Potemkin of Siberian News Now! Today, I am proud to announce that the winner of yesterday's election and the leader of our glorious Federation is...,"\n\n"President Alexander Pokryshkin!"\n\nSilence filled the homes and crowds of the Federation. Only a scant few in the government and the higher echelons of the companies partied at the news. The people knew what this meant: same old same old, and so, the Siberian Federation would remain the brutal, cynical, corporate state that it always had been, for on this day..."
 NOV_elections.2.a: "The people of Siberia had shrugged in indifference to their world."

 NOV_elections.3.t: "A Meeting with the Military."
 NOV_elections.3.desc: "Amet-khan Sultan was surprised by the size of Vasily Shukshin's office. He had imagined the man challenging Pokryshkin for the presidency of the Federation would have a corner office with large windows framing an impressive desk, and rows of file cabinets and bookshelves along the walls. Shukshin's workplace was not that. It was not quite a walk-in closet, but it wasn't far off. Shukshin noticed the military man looking around with a puzzled expression and chuckled.\n\n"I know it isn't much, but when you're challenging the incumbent President from within his own government, it isn't a surprise when your accommodations get suddenly downgraded."\n\nSultan nodded. "My current office has a nice view of the river. I suppose I shouldn't get too attached to it in case this meeting becomes public knowledge."\n\nShukshin grinned and nodded. "Speaking of, I have another meeting in a few minutes so let's get down to business. I don't want you to risk that view for nothing."\n\n"Very well," Sultan said, holding out a file he'd held under his arm. "This is a list of officers in the military that I believe might be sympathetic to our cause. Take a look and let me know who you want me to contact."\n\nShukshin opened the file and glanced over the list of names. "Do you trust these men?" he asked.\n\nSultan hesitated before he spoke. "They are all talented and loyal to the Federation. Some I trust more than others, which I mention in the file, but I think all of them are at least potentially persuadable."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Very good. That's all for now, I'll get back to you tomorrow with a list of who I want to contact first."\n\nSultan turned to walk out of the tiny office. There was work to be done."
 NOV_elections.3.a: "Time to find out where the military stands."

 NOV_elections.31.t: "Expanding the Coalition"
 NOV_elections.31.desc: "When Shukshin opened the door to Amet-Khan Sultan's office he found the former ace staring out the window that overlooked the river. Wordlessly, Shukshin walked over to stand beside him. Both men stared out over the winding waterway for a few seconds before Sultan spoke.\n\n"I really will miss this view. I've spent many hours taking it in, thinking about anything or nothing. At least the sacrifice shall not have been in vain."\n\nShukshin glanced over at him, curiously.\n\nSultan continued. "I've found fifteen other officers who are willing to endorse you publicly. Most are from the army but a few are from the air force and we even got one promising candidate from the naval academy. Now eight of them, including the ones from the air force, are only willing to endorse as a group. Strength in numbers I suppose, but an endorsement is an endorsement. This should be enough to show the people that the military isn't one hundred percent behind Pokryshkin, and it'll help with you being criticized for being too weak on foreign policy."\n\nShukshin grinned. "Fifteen," he murmured. "I thought we'd be lucky to get ten."\n\n"The army is tired of playing second fiddle to the air force," Sultan replied "And the air force wants to hedge its bets in case you win."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Thank you, Amet-Khan. You've done better than I ever could have hoped. If I win you can have whatever office you'd like."\n\nSultan turned his eyes back to the river, a small smile on his face."
 NOV_elections.31.a: ""This one will do just fine, sir.""

 NOV_elections.32.t: "Progress Rebuked"
 NOV_elections.32.desc: "Shukshin waited for the phone on his desk to ring. He had been waiting for half an hour, performing meaningless tasks to keep himself occupied while his eyes continued to drift over to the phone. It had been a long day, and a long night too, but the phone call he was waiting for would determine whether he went to bed pleased or disappointed. He had ruled out going to sleep before the call. Even if it wasn't unprofessional, his nerves would not have let him.\n\nSuddenly the phone clattered to life, and despite the long wait it still caught Shukshin by surprise. He hurriedly picked it up and said one word. "Sultan."\n\n"Mr Shukshin," Amet-khan Sultan replied from the other end. "I apologize for the delay. I was trying to work something out at the last minute before I called." His tone was professional, but there was a hint of disappointment in his voice it couldn't fully cover.\n\n"I take it you didn't get anyone then," Shukshin sighed.\n\n"Worse, I got an influential army captain by the name of Pokroskov. He and several of his comrades were ready to endorse you, but he made too much noise and was found out. He was discharged and replaced within the hour and now no one will even speak to me, not if it puts their careers on the line."\n\nShukshin couldn't hold back the long sigh that followed. "That's... disappointing. Thank you for your efforts Sultan, I know you did your best and things got out of hand."\n\n"I appreciate that, sir," Sultan replied, "I will keep trying and I am still willing to endorse you, but I'd advise your future campaign strategies not rely on any support from the military. Good night."\n\nThe line went dead. Shukshin put the phone back where it sat and rubbed his temples."
 NOV_elections.32.a: "He did not sleep well that night."

 NOV_elections.4.t: "The Barnaul Rally"
 NOV_elections.4.desc: "On a normal night, the Barnaul Theater would be hosting a local musician or an amateur dramatic company debuting a new production, and it would draw a decent audience of the residents of the city whose name the theater bore. But this was no normal night. The main event was not scheduled to start for two more hours and there were already lines around the block. As soon as the doors opened people excitedly filed in, taking any seat they could find. Within half an hour of opening its doors, the Barnaul had to close them again. For the first time in decades, every seat in the house was full. Even the standing room in the back was packed solid.\n\nThe excited chattering of the audience suddenly quieted as the lights winked, then dimmed, a sign that things were about to begin. From backstage Vasily Shukshin took one last deep breath, patted the speech in his pocket, and walked out into the light. The silent theater immediately roared back to life, all 2,500 people there clapping and cheering for him before he'd even said a word. As he took the podium, he couldn't help but grin like an idiot. "Thank you, Barnaul!" he said, the speakers allowing him to make himself heard over the clamor.\n\nThe speech was supposed to last thirty minutes but with the audience cheering and chanting it stretched to almost an hour. Additional speakers outside the theater delivered Shukshin's words to the even larger crowd outside on the streets. The next morning the headline in every major newspaper in the Federation was about Shukshin's rally. Most touted it as a huge victory, a massive sign of enthusiasm for the opposition candidate. Even papers loyal to Pokryshkin couldn't help but acknowledge that the rally had been a success for his opponent."
 NOV_elections.4.a: "We will need a bigger venue next time!"

 NOV_elections.5.t: "Dirty Work"
 NOV_elections.5.desc: "Dmitry Glinka read over the memo he'd just received. It came straight from Pokryshkin, and stamped across the top in bold red letters were the words TOP SECRET. Very subtle, Glinka thought to himself. He'd been expecting this memo, or one like it, for quite a while. Pokryshkin was in a reelection campaign and according to the polls it was closer than anyone suspected it could have been at the start of the race. If the boss wanted to be certain of victory, he would have to stop playing nice and get down in the mud, or at least send someone in for him. It seemed that responsibility had fallen on the SB. It made sense that it would. After all, dirty work was what they did best.\n\nGlinka was surprised by the plain wording of the letter. He was used to politicians beating around the bush and trying to maintain a degree of plausible deniability when asking for his help. Pokryshkin had made no such effort here, meaning he was either braver, dumber, or more desperate that Glika had assumed. The order said plainly that the SB was to investigate the leading figures of the opposition and find any secrets from their past they might be trying to conceal from voters. Even more plainly, it said that if the SB could not find sufficient evidence of any scandals, it was authorized to fabricate some in order to "preserve the stability of the Federation."\n\nGlinka chuckled. He'd already dug into Shukshin and most of his cronies, and they were all as clean as a whistle. If only he'd been working for them, he would have had no trouble at all bringing Pokryshkin's corruption to light, but that was not the way things had worked out, was it? The President was the one who paid him, and it was time to earn his keep. Shukshin was running to the left of Pokryshkin on several major issues. That was as good a place to start as any."
 NOV_elections.5.a: "Perhaps his campaign has been infiltrated by communist agitators?"

 NOV_elections.51.t: "Truth is Relative"
 NOV_elections.51.desc: "SHUKSHIN ACCUSED OF WORKING WITH COMMUNIST AGENTS!\n\nA NEW RED MENACE FOR RUSSIA?\n\nOPPOSITION CAMPAIGN MANAGER ARRESTED!\n\nIgor looked over the newspapers, trying to decide which one he wanted. He usually preferred the Morning Post, but recently it had appointed a new editor and had been slowly becoming a mouthpiece for Pokryshkin's government. Not that that mattered today. Every paper, even the ones that were usually anti-government, was carrying a story about Shukshin speaking to some socialist labor leaders last week or about his campaign manager benign arrested yesterday. Igor was already caught up on the communist story so he grabbed the paper with the article on the campaign manager, paid the vendor, and took a seat at a bench.\n\nThe article detailed the arrest and charging of the campaign manager. Apparently, he'd been caught involved in some corrupt dealings trying to rig vote collection in a precinct near Tomsk. He'd already been released on bail but his trial was scheduled for only a week before an election and the newspaper speculated that he would probably be replaced in the coming days. Shukshin, for his part, denied all of the charges and accused the government of fabricating the evidence to disrupt his election bid. Igor was surprised by that. Sure, everyone knew the government was corrupt, but it wouldn't go as far as to just make up evidence would it?\n\nIgor put the paper away and sighed. He didn't normally follow politics, but he had recently. He used to think every politician was just a corrupt, dishonest man looking to make his money off the work of the common people, but Shukshin had made him reconsider that belief. He'd sounded like he genuinely wanted to help in his speeches and writings, but it seemed that he and his allies were just as deceitful as the people in charge right now. If that was the case, Igor thought, he would probably just not bother voting this time either. If nothing would change, what was the point?"
 NOV_elections.51.a: "Nihilism is the death of democracy."

 NOV_elections.52.t: "Caught Red Handed"
 NOV_elections.52.desc: "PRESIDENT ORDERED FRAMING OF SHUKSHIN!\n\nSB CAUGHT STIRRING UP RED SCARE!\n\nPOKRYSHKIN DENIES ALL INVOLVEMENT!\n\nIgor looked over the headlines, considering which paper he wanted. Not that it mattered, they were all telling the same story, the only story anyone was talking about today. A memo supposedly written by President Pokryshkin to the head of the SB had been leaked. No one but the leaker knew how it got out, but now the front page of every newspaper bore the same picture of a note with the words TOP SECRET printed atop it in bright red and bearing the President's signature at the bottom. The contents of the letter were brief but clear. The SB was ordered to go digging into the past of Shukshin and his associates looking for scandals, and to make some up if they couldn't find any real ones.\n\nIgor picked a paper he knew had a cartoonist he liked and settled in to read further. Shukshin was accusing the President of corrupt and tyrannical behavior, and was calling on the people of the Federation to turn out and vote to reject this sort of treatment. Pokryshkin, for his part, was denying everything and dismissed the story as a hoax by the opposition to portray him as a dictator. He had refused to comment on the fact that the signature on the letter matched his perfectly, and it appeared to have been printed on notarized paper from his office.\n\nIgor felt himself getting angrier and angrier as he read the story. He'd known Pokryshkin was corrupt, but he never thought he'd stoop as low as trying to frame his opponent. Igor was not normally a political man. He considered most politicians to be liars and thieves regardless of party or position, but the President had gone too far this time. Igor had heard some of Shukshin's speeches, and he'd been interested but he hadn't made up his mind until now. The election was coming soon, and when it arrived, he'd be sure to cast his ballot for the man that deserved to lead Russia, not the one leading it now"

Who do you have to thank for this double blessing of profit and protection? Look no further than your sitting President! Pokryshkin bravely took control of Novosibirsk during the Great Siberian War, safeguarding the future of Russia while ideological fanatics tore it apart.\n\nWho has stood alongside the Russian people against the horrors of mad kings, communist monsters and lunatic Nazis? Who has sought a better future for Russia in spite of the undermining of the criminal Narodnik terrorists? Pokryshkin, that's who! This coming election, which our President has so graciously allowed, vote for the future of Russia! Vote for Pokryshkin!""
