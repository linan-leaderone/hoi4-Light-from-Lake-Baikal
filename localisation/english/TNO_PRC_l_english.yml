 ### Leader Desc ###
 PRC_Aleksandr_Vasilevsky: "Aleksandr Vasilevsky" 
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_VASILEVSKY_DESC: "Aleksandr Mikhailovich Vasilevsky was the son of a Russian Orthodox priest and was expected to follow in his father's footsteps, but he was drawn to a military life and traded his seminarian's robes for a soldier's uniform. He fought in the Imperial Russian Army and rose through the ranks, but resigned his post during the October Revolution and spent much of the Russian Civil War commanding soldiers well behind the front lines. In the interwar years, he distinguished himself as a skilled organizer, and befriended other notable officers such as Alexander Yegorov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, and Georgy Zhukov. When the Germans invaded, Vasilevsky was serving in Bukharin's general staff, and his ability to work well under pressure helped him rise through the ranks. But not even his skills could stop the evacuation of Moscow from degenerating into a mad stampede as soldiers, bureaucrats, and millions of civilians desperately fighting each other for a coveted safe passage out of the city.\n\nDetermined to help as much of the Red Army to survive as possible, Vasilevsky organized a semi-orderly retreat of the forces that escaped the Mozhaisk defense line and marched east, over the Urals. Their goal: the Mongolian People's Republic, where they could regroup and resume the offensive. But the opportunity never came, for the Japanese and their puppet state of Mengjiang had already invaded Ulaanbaatar and forced the remnants of the Mongolian Army into the steppes. Vasilevsky formed a tenuous alliance with the Mongolians, and the two armies set up a domain in the former Tuvan People's Republic. They were isolated from the West Russian War, the Siberian War and the fall of the People's Republic of Western Siberia. They gladly avoided Yagoda's government in Irkutsk, fearful that he would label their retreat as cowardice and have them shot for treason. But despite having no allies, Vasilevsky is still determined to rally his men, draft the battle plans, and fight their way back home."

PRC_red_army_dynamic_modifier: "Red Army in Exile"
PRC_red_army_dynamic_modifier_desc: "The People's Revolutionary Council was formed out of the scattered remnants of the Far Eastern Military District. The Mongolian People's Republic, which had been reduced to a Soviet puppet before the Great Patriotic War, suddenly found itself as the host of Red Army units stranded, and having lost their chain of command. Through a slow and complex process, the Mongolian government would slowly merge with the Russian military, and despite the invasion from Mengjiang, survive on the edge of the country. After years of hardships, the Red Army has survived Japan's facade of pan-Asianism, Yagoda's totalitarianism, and internal strife between its leaders. Now, the troops wonder if their eternal exile in Mongolia will ever end."

PRC_factionalism: "Directional Disputes"
PRC_factionalism_desc: "There are many arguments between the leading figures of the People's Revolutionary Council on policies of governance and what its ultimate goal is. That is to be expected, though, when the nation is controlled by a loose coalition of Russians and Mongols, that only have their wish for survival and adherence to socialist doctrine in common. These disagreements have often led to infighting within the ranks of the regime, and taking decisive action can be difficult without upsetting one faction or the other. However, if the People's Revolutionary Council wants to survive into the future, or even restore the Union, the disputes will have to be solved."

PRC_democratic_military: "Democratic Military"
PRC_democratic_military_desc: "Soldiers in the Red Army elect their own officers, in order to move beyond the reactionary hierarchies that dominate militaries of old. However, this decision has had consequences. Soldiers won't elect officers for their qualifications and skill, and they won't elect officers who'll make the hard decisions when needed. They'll elect officers who are popular, who go easy on their men. This means that men often get promoted to positions that they are most certainly not qualified to hold."

PRC_preparation_for_war: "Prepared for War"
PRC_preparation_for_war_desc: "The state's preparations have been completed, and all aspects of its economy have been tuned for wartime supply and production. Though its economic base is likely much smaller than those of its future enemies, this singular focus, and the very many optimizations made in its execution, should enable it to remain competitive, and engage on more equal ground."
