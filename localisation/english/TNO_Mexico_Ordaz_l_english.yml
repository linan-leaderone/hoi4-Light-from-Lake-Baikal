MEX_Doctors_Strike_3:0 "The Strikes, Eliminated"
MEX_Doctors_Strike_3_desc:0 "The doctors' strikes have finally been dealt with. Their treachery to the institutions that the Revolution has provided for them is unforgivable. Their illegal unionizing and unwillingness to provide vital healthcare has led to the inevitable crackdowns by the proper authorities. Even with the doctors' strikes thwarted, the consequences have severely damaged the Mexican healthcare system which will take a long time to repair. This victory has cost its weight in blood to thousands of sick and dying Mexicans." 
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Ordaz_Harsh_Victory:0 "The Strikes, Ended"
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Ordaz_Harsh_Victory_desc:0 "Following an effective crackdown, the unionizing doctors have finally been dealt with. The wretched AMM and AMMRI were slowly deprived of their resources until they were vulnerable enough to strike. The crackdown has become a means for President Ordaz to cement his power. He has called the crackdown a return of order to the healthcare system, and therefore the return of order to the citizens. Never again will reckless doctors and interns risk the health of the general public over frivolous demands."
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Ordaz_Irrelevance_Victory:0 "The Strikes, Ended"
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Ordaz_Irrelevance_Victory_desc:0 "The Mexican Revolution isn't just a popular revolution, it is an institution that the state needs to survive. For the unionizing doctors, this institution was the final blow to their schemes, not with guns and tanks, but through the media. The unions were swiftly deprived of their resources, and battered by negative press at every turn. Slowly but surely, the strikes disappeared without a trace, as if they never even existed..."

## Ordaz Intro Tree

MEX_prodigy_president: "The Prodigy's Presidency"
MEX_prodigy_president_desc: "It has played out all according to plan — the plan of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz Bolaños. Having been expected to win by the Party and the people alike, Ordaz comes to power with the support of the majority of the Institutional Revolutionary party apparatus.\n\nThe golden age of the PRI and the United Mexican States will continue. Economic rejuvenation shall be pursued in order to build off of the legacy left behind by President López Mateos and his predecessors. Close cooperation with our ally, the United States of America, will also be pursued — the better to keep Japanese and German fascism at bay. And most crucially, a steady hand will remain in charge of the Revolution, to defend it from enemies inside and outside.\n\n¡Viva Ordaz! ¡Viva México!"
MEX_allies_on_the_left: "Allies on the Left"
MEX_allies_on_the_left_desc: "Carlos Madrazo is one of the most influential internal critics of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Moreover, he has over the past years of struggle become a close ally and personal friend of the new President; this relationship was crucial when there was a threat of the subversive Salinas and his "technocratic" perversion of the Institutional Revolution attaining primacy.\n\nNow it is time to further leverage that relationship for the benefit of the Mexican government. Using his significant power and influence, Ordaz will appoint Madrazo president of the CEN, the National Executive Committee of the PRI — effectively president of the party. Since we expect that Madrazo will act as a lame duck, this appointment will give Ordaz a close ally within the party, build connections with the intelligentsia, and silence dissent arising from students and the middle class."
MEX_mateos_guidance: "Mateos' Guidance"
MEX_mateos_guidance_desc: "Without the support of President Ordaz's most excellent and respected predecessor, his mentor and friend Adolfo López Mateos, there would have been no hope of Díaz Ordaz getting as far as he did. The President regards it prudent to be conscious of the debt he owes his mentor.\n\nAccordingly, López Mateos will retain the absolute right to contact the President whenever he requires, and Ordaz will continue to seek his advice whenever it is needed. Moreover, the former President will by decree of Díaz Ordaz be given carte blanche to proceed with his dreams for the Olympics in '68."
MEX_the_right_hand_man: "The Right Hand Man"
MEX_the_right_hand_man_desc: "No leader is guaranteed to succeed if he lacks trustworthy deputies to stabilize the ship and assist him in his labors. For Ordaz, this deputy is none other than Luis Echeverría Álvarez, the Secretary of the Interior, in short SEGOB. Echeverría is well known for his successes in law and order matters in the Republic, a fact Ordaz knows and respects. Over five years as colleagues, with Echeverría previously serving as Ordaz's under-secretary at the SEGOB, they have developed a close and respectful relationship.\n\nToday, the SEGOB and the President must meet, to cement unity and cooperate on projects which shall ensure the stability of the Revolution. Echeverría will no doubt be even more willing to cooperate than he already would be given that Ordaz has already guaranteed his continuance as SEGOB, making him Ordaz's second-in-command."
MEX_the_carrot: "The Carrot"
MEX_the_carrot_desc: "The plague let loose by the folly of the Japanese, the so-called "Kabuki effect", continues to roil the United Mexican States. One of the most infuriating developments that arose during this crisis is the doctors' strike, which paralyses the health system of our country and thereby threatens public order.\n\nAfter months of having dismissed them as subversives (which they are) and telling them to seek alternative avenues of complaint (which they should), he will invite the leaders of these self-proclaimed unions to implement reforms to the problem and finally put an end to the strikes."
MEX_the_stick: "The Stick"
MEX_the_stick_desc: "It was exactly as President Ordaz feared. Rather than adhering to the agreement given to them by the Executive Power, the doctors have committed a monstrous betrayal. Launching a new wave of strikes, and duping the nurses of the Republic into joining them, they have further destabilized the Mexican medical system.\n\nWe cannot reflect on how our first instincts were right all along; we must prioritize solutions. These treasonous medics mistook our generosity for weakness, and are now attempting to bleed us dry. They will submit or be destroyed — dissent cannot and will not be tolerated."
MEX_mendoza_a_day: "A Mendoza A Day"
MEX_mendoza_a_day_desc: "If medics think to engage in subversion, we will send in the eternal enemy of all subversion and subversives: the ground troops. Soldiers will be sent to occupy hospitals to keep order and ensure that hospitals remain properly functional.\n\nArmed with Mendoza machineguns, and given authorization from the SEGOB and SEDENA to take any and all necessary actions to ensure that nothing else goes wrong in the hospitals, the soldiers will scare these assorted riff-raff and traitors into submission."
MEX_contract_terminated: "Contract Terminated"
MEX_contract_terminated_desc: "Niccolò Machiavelli once said that when gratitude dissolves during threats to survival, it is better to be feared than to be loved, if one wishes to inspire discipline. What better time to implement that wise advice than the present day?\n\nIn addition to sending armed troops to maintain law and order within the hospitals, there is something else that President Ordaz can do to end this ongoing murder-suicide: give a warning. Any who continue striking will be sacked, and the safety of those who carry on thereafter cannot and will not be guaranteed."
MEX_bright_future: "A Bright Future"
MEX_bright_future_desc: "At last, the subversion set off by these uppity doctors has been done away with: the Doctors' Strike is finally nearing its end. All the better; Ordaz was getting rather impatient, wanting to focus instead on proper governance and bringing the United Mexican States to the bright future they deserve.\n\nSummon the cabinet. A set of meetings will now be held to define the future plans of the Ordaz administration. In this manner, Mexican prosperity shall be built ever-higher, and the steady hand will prove itself as the best possible guide for the Mexican Revolution and the Institutional Revolutionary Party."
MEX_establish_IMP: "Establish the IMP"
MEX_establish_IMP_desc: "Only a fool would suggest that the Mexican economy functions on anything other than oil. However, a major unforced error has occurred in that the oil resources present within Mexican borders have not been properly harnessed and are thus insufficiently exploited. This is a mistake that cannot be permitted to persist.\n\nOrdaz shall form the Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo, the Mexican Petroleum Institute or IMP, as a central state research body with respect to petroleum. Working with the state oil corporation PEMEX, it will improve the technology of extraction and refinement of Mexican oil producers."
MEX_sea_of_tehuantepec: "The Sea of Tehuantepec"
MEX_sea_of_tehuantepec_desc: "In the city of Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca, there has recently been a very fortunate discovery. A new major reserve of petroleum has been found, which could raise our oil production to 177 million barrels by the start of the next decade.\n\nThere can be no doubt about it: this is a great opportunity. Effective immediately, the IMP and PEMEX must expend all needed resources to begin drilling and properly exploit this resource — we cannot waste any time!"
MEX_sea_of_tehuantepec_tt: "The §YTehuantepec Oil Wells§! project will be unlocked."
MEX_modernize_pemex: "Modernize Pemex"
MEX_modernize_pemex_desc: "PEMEX, Petróleos Mexicanos, is one of the greatest successes of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Its founding was one of the most masterful decisions made by the exalted President Lázaro Cárdenas. But just like with the successes of López Mateos, more can be done to build upon this great legacy.\n\nPEMEX must be modernized, and its focus widened so it can exploit natural gas and create petrochemicals. By decree of President Ordaz, PEMEX will be massively expanded to exploit discovered reserves and continue with the great work of the industrialisation of the United Mexican States."
MEX_caracas_connection: "The Caracas Connection"
MEX_caracas_connection_desc: "The ongoing rise in demand for Mexican oil could mean that in the future our own production may be incapable of meeting it. This potential supply strangulation must be nipped in the bud before it becomes a genuine problem. Fortunately, we have a potential resource available to us: our fellow petroleum producers in Venezuela.\n\nMeeting with President [VEN.Getleader] of Venezuela, we will create a strong trade deal to resolve this conundrum. There is no candidate superior to Venezuela, which is a fellow OFN-friendly, stable Latin American state. We certainly wouldn't want to risk wildcards like the Argentines and their inferior YPF, now, would we?"
MEX_stabilize_development: "Stabilize Development"
MEX_stabilize_development_desc: "The past decade has seen major fluctuations arising from economic growth and inflation. If things carry on like this, the average Mexican civilian will be unable to purchase the basic necessities of life; if that carries on long enough, the integrity of the Institutional Revolution itself falls into question.\n\nPresident Ordaz will ensure inflation is controlled by governmental policy. Done correctly, this will ensure that economic development remains smooth and that the flourishing middle class's wages are not devoured by inflation. In effect, it will be a continuation of stabilizer development and the major economic growth of recent years."
MEX_alliance_for_freedom: "Alliance for Freedom"
MEX_alliance_for_freedom_desc: "The Alliance for Freedom is a major supporter of liberty in America, which is all the more important given the ongoing conflict with subversives in the pay of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Fascist proxies wreak havoc throughout the free West in the form of scum such as Trujillo.\n\nSupport from this institution is something that the United Mexican States stand to benefit strongly from. Accordingly, President Díaz Ordaz will address an event of the AFF and along the way build connections within the United States."
MEX_restrict_strikes: "Restrict Strikes"
MEX_restrict_strikes_desc: "Strikes have held back economic growth and discouraged foreign allies from investing in us. The doctors have, despite all the forbearance we have shown, begun to strike yet again. Obviously, this defiance cannot be borne for much longer.\n\nDecisive action must be taken now. Before the strikes encourage others into getting odd notions of strikes being within their rights as Mexicans, we must restrict further labor organization outside of the authorizations provided by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. In addition to preventing any repeats of the AMMRI subversion, it will also strengthen the legitimacy of the Revolution in the eyes of the Mexican worker."
MEX_freedom_tractors: "Freedom Tractors"
MEX_freedom_tractors_desc: "The Alliance for Freedom, in addition to supporting the free West politically against the threats posed by international Fascism, also provides economic support to friendly states. One of the most notable examples of this is agricultural mechanization efforts in neighboring Central American states.\n\nMexico stands to benefit from this program, and President Díaz Ordaz understands this very well. He will leverage AFF funding and expertise in order to support mechanization projects throughout the United Mexican States."
MEX_northern_harmony: "Northern Harmony"
MEX_northern_harmony_desc: "America has been our closest partner in the world ever since relations were normalized after the end of the Maximato. Many countries are closer to us culturally, but none have such strong ties of prosperity and mutual interest with us as the Americans do. The President of Mexico, however, has observed that we could do more to strengthen those bonds.\n\nWorking with the United States government and leveraging his own prior work with the American intelligence community, President Díaz Ordaz will push to ease restrictions on the border. A freer border will mean freer trade, and freer trade will mean greater economic growth. Thus the fraternal relations between the United States and Mexico will become stronger."
MEX_legislative_approach: "The Legislative Approach"
MEX_legislative_approach_desc: "The legislature operates entirely according to the directives of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Outside critics whine and call this a "puppet" legislature. Whether they're on to something or just on something, the legislature is certainly useful for the purpose of defeating strikes and strikers.\n\nLeveraging the legislature to pass law-projects enables us to strangle strikes via legalism, which is more effective in the long term than simply giving them the stick as they deserve. However, if this measure is to work out as we envision, we need to have enough control over the PRI to avoid the worst of the bureaucratic stagnation that even President Ordaz has complained about before. Moreover, we must accept that it will be a slower route in general than simply applying force."
MEX_military_option: "The Military Option"
MEX_military_option_desc: "We do not have the time for legalism. There is no use running around in the legislature, dealing with the assorted queries and demands of political pencil-pushers. The great questions of the age are not solved by agreements but by military force — by iron and blood, in this case literally.\n\nBy decree of the President of Mexico the police and army will be ordered to harass and disrupt unlicensed and illegal strikes, with permission to use any force they deem appropriate. Moreover, loyal agitators will be permitted to assist the armed forces and law enforcement in their efforts. "
MEX_establish_the_asa: "Establish the ASA"
MEX_establish_the_asa_desc: "The airport crisis has been bedeviling us for some time now; we need to take some form of decisive action in order to ensure that Mexicans can travel in peace. Fortunately, a very interesting proposal has been placed in front of us — that of the establishment of the Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Airport and Auxiliary Services), ASA for short.\n\nTo resolve the ongoing airport crisis we will have the ASA assume responsibility for the majority of Mexican airports. This will enable it to better regulate the industry, invest in it, and expand it as appropriate."
MEX_money_trees: "Money Trees"
MEX_money_trees_desc: "Cash crops (such as pineapples, bananas, cacao, mangos, and vanilla) are the future of agriculture. They are as close as reality can get to pesos growing on plants and trees. Their profitability, arising from how in-demand they are in foreign markets, helps them bring in large amounts of money to the economy and therefore massively increases tax revenue if they are permitted to proliferate.\n\nThough the CNC and the farmers are likely to complain, we do this for the good of all Mexico. We will promote cash crops."
MEX_loyal_bulwark: "Our Loyal Bulwark"
MEX_loyal_bulwark_desc: "So what if cash crops are as profitable as they are? Let us be honest with ourselves. Ask the question: will our peasantry, the backbone of the Institutional Revolution, really see any of the so-called money that grows on these trees? We know the truth: cash crops do not help the people that grow them.\n\nRather than crack the loyal bulwark of the peasantry by forcing peasants to grow crops they do not want and cannot feed themselves with, we should work with the CNC to promote subsistence agriculture."
MEX_restrict_the_reformists: "Restrict the Reformists"
MEX_restrict_the_reformists_desc: "Though it galls the government to admit it, and it hurts Ordaz to think of it, we must face facts. The CEN presidency of Carlos Madrazo has developed in a manner not necessarily to our advantage. That man goes further than we wanted him to go, and does not pay heed to our requests. We have to thwart his quixotic projects lest the continued survival of the Institutional Revolutionary Party be called into question.\n\nThese anti-corruption efforts of Madrazo's, they have to be contained. Nothing is wrong with them in principle; the issue is that they are collapsing the PRI. What sort of successful anti-corruption measure involves picking fights with governors and anything that moves, has a pulse, and wears a PRI pin? Who holds primaries so chaotic as to make a flower war look peaceful? Madrazo needs to move on from the CEN, before he goes so far even he'll regret it."
MEX_assigned_to_antartica: "Assigned to Antarctica"
MEX_assigned_to_antartica_desc: "Somehow, despite repeated defeats, humiliations, and corrections, that clique of Japanophile technocrats under Salinas still haunts the government under the Ordaz administration. This should not be permitted to continue; it is best to find a way to simultaneously elevate and castrate this threat.\n\nLet us assign Salinas and his allies to political dead-end postings in the deep south of the country, far away from their usual base of power. Though their skills will be of great economic utility, they will never be able to profit from them politically. They will learn firsthand the meaning of the dictum "Responsibility without power — the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.""
MEX_the_olympian_spirit: "The Olympian Spirit"
MEX_the_olympian_spirit_desc: "The Olympics, that marvelous global event which President López Mateos engaged in back-breaking labor to secure, are coming to Mexico in 1968. Sure, it might only be the mid-1960s, but now is the perfect time to begin laying out plans and preparing the venues.\n\nWe cannot waste any time. This is a perfect opportunity for two things: to prove the glory of Mexico to the wider world, and to show our respect for the hard work left behind by President Mateos."
MEX_the_olympian_spirit_tt: "López Mateos will put §Geverything§! he has into making the §mOlympics§! a success."
MEX_Ordaz_japanese_technicans: "Japanese Technicians"
MEX_Ordaz_japanese_technicans_desc: "We do not trust the imperialist Japanese regime as far as we can throw it, but we would be foolish to attempt to sever ties with them. It is crucial, accordingly, that relations do not collapse through any fault of our own; let us throw them a bone.\n\nThe Japanese are known for engineering know-how and diligence on a level even the Americans and Germans struggle to rival. Inviting their engineers to work here will improve the construction of the venues, and ensure they survive beyond their intended purpose."
MEX_american_contracts: "American Contracts"
MEX_american_contracts_desc: "We do not trust the imperialist Japanese regime as far as we can throw it. This is known. Accordingly, would it not therefore be unwise to risk a project of this scale by putting it in the hands of untrustworthy countries? Let us not try to risk anything by engaging in the sort of adventurism that Salinas' foolish technocrats would partake in.\n\nIt is the Americans we shall rely on: phrases such as "good old American know-how and ingenuity" are not and never have been hollow. Their expertise and diligence will be more than sufficient for our needs."
MEX_mateos_dream: "Mateos' Dream"
MEX_mateos_dream_desc: "President López Mateos poured blood, sweat, and tears into securing the Mexican bid for the Olympics. Aside from strengthening the prosperity of the Mexican people and preserving the welfare of the Institutional Revolution, the Olympic bid was his greatest work and the one in which he took most pride.\n\nIt was López Mateos' dream to accomplish a successful Olympics in this country. We will uphold that dream. For all that he has done for Mexico, for the party, and for President Ordaz personally, we owe him this much."
MEX_practical_realities: "Practical Realities"
MEX_practical_realities_desc: "Yes, we see the benefits in bringing about a truly great Olympiad in 1968. Yes, we understand that this is Adolfo López Mateos' greatest project and fondest dream. But the terrible spectre of "cost" hangs over all our plans and ambitions, and threatens us with ruin if we pay it no heed. The fact of the matter is that we cannot go bankrupt for the dreams of one man, no matter how meritorious he is.\n\nOur progress towards a successful Olympics must be steady and measured. Obviously, we will work with Mateos to bring things to completion. But we will not give him carte blanche."
MEX_envy_of_the_world: "Envy of the World"
MEX_envy_of_the_world_desc: "The Games of the Nineteenth Olympiad will be the symbol of the United Mexican States, showing Mexican culture, industry, and innovation to the broader world. Only a fool would deny the existence of the untold profits available to us with this opportunity; money and prestige can grow out of the Five Rings in a way we wish it would on trees.\n\nExploiting the image conveyed by the Olympics, we will endeavor to attract as much investment as possible."
MEX_a_matter_of_honour: "A Matter of Honor"
MEX_a_matter_of_honour_desc: "Are we meant to sit around and tolerate this? The raid on the Sierra barracks is nothing less than a humiliation. The first attack on a federal army base since the end of the Cristero War — this cannot be permitted to continue. It is nothing less than an insult against the honor of the President of the Republic himself. This raid is a gauntlet thrown in Ordaz's face!\n\nThis cannot be borne. This will not be borne. Let the Mexican people be our witness: treason and rebellion will be crushed. The law must be enforced at all costs. Anarchy cannot and will not be permitted."
MEX_a_matter_of_honour_tt: "§RThe Dirty War has begun.§!"
MEX_an_orderly_start: "An Orderly Start"
MEX_an_orderly_start_desc: "There is a good mood in the Government these days. This year has been good so far. The Informe de Gobierno went well; the Institutional Revolutionary Party has united behind us. Stocks are sold, the press is squared, and the middle class is prepared to accept the next period of our rightful rule.\n\nYes, there need be no doubt at this juncture. We are on our way — stability and prosperity await the United Mexican States under the guidance of President Díaz Ordaz."
MEX_disciplines_virtue: "Discipline's Virtue"
MEX_disciplines_virtue_desc: ""Now it is human nature to be born with a fondness for profit. Indulging this leads to contention and strife, and the sense of modesty and yielding with which one was born disappears. One is born with feelings of envy and hate, and, by indulging these, one is led into banditry and theft, so that the sense of loyalty and good faith with which he was born disappears."\n\nPublic protests in today's Mexico are done by the disloyal, those who indulge in contention and envy for their own pleasure. Rather than working for the benefit of Mexico, these fools and traitors are content to attack it. Worse yet, they draw inspiration from the so-called martyrs of the GPG. We will afford them no further tolerance; legal punishments for these traitors will be increased. Immediately."
MEX_its_bedtime: "It's Bedtime"
MEX_its_bedtime_desc: "Our work was clearly insufficient. The doctors were sent back to their hospitals, but their treason emboldened other groups of protestors. Now the universities are empty as their students go out and engage in the exact same sorts of protests the medics did before them. They are attempting to form student unions and negotiate with universities and the government — how preposterous it is.\n\nBy decree of the government, and by directive to the Ministry of Education, the attempts by subversives to destabilize Mexican educational institutions by engaging in anti-government activities must be strangled. Curfews and protest bans will be mandated. To enforce those protections, police and grenadiers will be deployed, as was done in the hospitals."
MEX_hands_dirtier: "Getting Our Hands Dirtier"
MEX_hands_dirtier_desc: "Treason proliferates, so that we are confronted with what the old sage called "terror on every side". Resistance to our rightful rule and to the governance of the Institutional Revolutionary Party is rising; our initial efforts have clearly been insufficient. The political situation is changing too fast for our liking, and may yet spiral out of our control.\n\nWe must now get our hands dirtier, cake them in mud and blood to secure the futures of Mexico and its President. We must grind our enemies into nothingness to secure a better tomorrow, lest we face untold horrors at their victorious hands."
MEX_hands_dirtier_tt: "§RWe will embrace new methods to achieve victory in the Dirty War.§!"

#Start of Madrazo PRI chain, gonna be wholesome
MEX_Ordaz.2.t:0 "Madrazo Addresses the PRI"
MEX_Ordaz.2.desc:0 "Only one week had passed since the inauguration of President Ordaz, but Madrazo approached the party conference podium with decades of restless energy. The President gave a slight nod from the front row. This youth and passion would invigorate the PRI, this was why he had selected Madrazo to helm the CEN.\n\nMadrazo yanked the microphone free and strode out to the edge of the stage. He said nothing, just stared out at the crowd. At last, he began, "When I look at you, I see the party. I see the institution."\n\n"But I do not see the Revolution!" roared the Southern Cyclone. "I see lined faces and tired eyes, a room stuffed with those that think our work ended thirty years ago! I see fine clothes and flashy watches. Stolen from the Mexican peasant, from the Mexican worker through shameless corruption! I see gofers and toadies, who know only how to please their boss, not to serve the Mexican people. I. See. You."\n\nIf Madrazo could see Ordaz, he would have seen a face blanche with shock. This was not the script they had agreed upon. This was entirely too far. This had to stop before-\n\n"And therefore I see what must be done. As leader of our party, my first and foremost objective is to restore within it the spirit of the Revolution. I am not under any illusions as to the steps that will require. Corruption audits, frequent and unannounced, will be put in place immediately. To enforce the accountability you have so sorely lacked, our party will hold elections within itself to determine candidacy for positions..."\n\nOn and on Madrazo went, ignoring the horrified expressions of the party members. Some filed out in disgust. Ordaz's discomfort and rage had spread throughout his body, leaving his shirt soaked with sweat and his hands balled in fists. This could not continue."
MEX_Ordaz.2.a:0 "Read the room, Madrazo."

MEX_Ordaz.3.t:0 "The Seat of Power"
MEX_Ordaz.3.desc:0 "Los Pinos: a mansion, built in the style of a French palace, right in the heart of Mexico City. It had been the official residence of every PRI president except for López Mateos, who had never left his home in San Jerónimo. Now it was time for Gustavo Díaz Ordaz and his family to move in. After receiving a tour of the grounds, he took a moment to examine his new office.\n\nLooking through the drawers of his new desk, he realized this was his first moment alone since the inauguration. It wouldn't last, of course. Before long he would again face the questions of reporters and the applause of party sycophants. Men would smile to his face while sharpening knives behind their backs, factions would try to pull him every which way, and the people would make endless demands of him. He felt a crushing weight on his shoulders.\n\nYet just as doubts began to flood his mind, Ordaz pushed them away. From his earliest days in Puebla to his tenure as Secretary of the Interior he had faced challenges, and he had overcome them all in turn. Now, after a lifetime of struggle, he had finally earned the highest office in the land. He would do whatever this job asked of him and then some.\n\nOrdaz poured himself a glass of water, wiped the sweat off his brow and slicked his hair back. After taking a moment to compose himself he went out to face the world."
MEX_Ordaz.3.a:0 "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."
MEX_Ordaz.3.tt:0 "The §QTitan§! of the state reveals itself.\n§YA new GUI is active in the decision menu.§!"

MEX_Ordaz.5.t:0 "Eyes on the Storm"
MEX_Ordaz.5.desc:0 ""You've made a right mess of things, haven't you, Carlos?"\n\nMadrazo prudently held his tongue, gambling on Ordaz remaining calm.\n\nHe was right: Ordaz simply shrugged and continued on. "Yes, there's a mess. But really, Carlos, I've seen worse in my time. We would've expected a damn sight worse from Salinas if we had failed to contain the Nava incident, wouldn't we?" Ordaz smiled, and Madrazo began to chuckle.\n\n"Well, that's right, Gustavo. Damn right he would've done far worse than either of us. Knowing him for the technocratic borderline fascist that he is, that man would've found a way to deny anything was wrong with Japan, insult General Cárdenas, and try to discredit the Party itself in one sentence."\n\nOrdaz laughed at that. "Quite so. Considering that reality, my friend, so long as you keep things reasonable, you can carry on with things. Rock the boat, but don't make it keel over."\n\nMadrazo nodded, his mind working furiously. A tableau of the things he could do for the Mexican nation with this permission from the President unveiled itself in his mind's eye."
MEX_Ordaz.5.a:0 ""Sure thing, Gustavo. I'll see about doing so then.""
MEX_Ordaz.5.tt:0 "Your Excellency. You work well enough with the Southern Cyclone for now, but all things must pass."

MEX_Ordaz.6.t:0 "A Midnight Call"
MEX_Ordaz.6.desc:0 "President Ordaz sat in his office, frantically reading through reports. The sun had set hours ago. Guadalupe would be wondering about him by now, but he couldn't bring himself to leave. How could he rest while seditious strikes grew ever larger?\n\nWhen he could bear the stress no longer, Ordaz picked up the phone and dialed a familiar number. A moment later someone answered.\n\n"Good evening Mr. President," said the voice of López Mateos, "How may I be of service?"\n\n"I'm sorry to bother you so late, Adolfo, but I can't sleep. We still don't have this doctors' strike under control and I'm worried. I was hoping you had some advice you could share."\n\nLópez Mateos just laughed. "Gustavo, do you remember the railway strikes back in '58? How about Nava's campaign in '61, or when he resurfaced during Kabuki? I was terrified of every single one, but you always came through for me."\n\n"A president has to rely on those around him, Gustavo. I had you, and now you've got your own men. Trust in them, and in yourself, and I know you'll do well."\n\nOrdaz let out a deep breath. "Thank you, Adolfo, I needed to hear that. I'll let you get back to bed now.""
MEX_Ordaz.6.a:0 ""Goodnight Mr. President, rest well.""

Now, what can you tell me about this doctors' strike?"\n\n"My people are compiling a report as we speak. By this time tomorrow I'll have a list of all striking doctors in every affected hospital, as well as their demands-"\n\n"Forget about their demands."

"We are still gathering evidence at this stage, but support from subversive groups hasn't been ruled out."\n\nOrdaz stood up, clenching his fists. "I suspected as much.

Ordaz had almost forgotten he was there.\n\n"Your Excellency, this proves the unions cannot be trusted.

MEX_Ordaz.11.desc:0 ""Things are stable, gentlemen, but we've only just begun." President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz stood at the end of a long conference table. Arrayed before him was his cabinet — the herd of men who would enact his vision and govern by his command. Many were friends, some rivals, and others just plain useful.\n\n"Ours is a great nation, built by its people and institutions," Ordaz continued to his captive audience. "However, if we wish to maintain order and ensure Mexico's prosperity, each and every one of us must work hard. We all have our jobs to do, and I expect the best. I expect initiative and perseverance. You know, it was my own work as cabinet secretary that earned Mateos' respect and friendship."\n\nOrdaz let the weight of his statement settle. Ordaz became President not just through hard work but because he was the smartest and most ruthless man in the PRI. He only had one term as President of Mexico, and he wouldn't let other men be his downfall. He would use their ambitions to his benefit. Ordaz keenly observed as Secretaries Del Rosal, Campos Salas, and Manautou each perked up at his not-so-subtle hint. He knew they wanted what he had. They wanted to be the next El Tapado. Each man before Ordaz was there for a reason. They were all running to the same goal, the same finish line but it was not lost on any of them that it was a competition. Politicians and bureaucrats are all jockeys of their own talent. Carried here by horses of different shapes. Whether intelligence, charisma, or strength, each man would have to utilize their advantages. Though a long one, the race has begun.\n\n"Now, gentleman. We have a lot of work to do, so let's get started." Ordaz finished his impromptu lecture with a well-practiced, lopsided smile. Each man applauded and began preparing their reports. One by one, they would stumble over themselves to prove their virtues. All the while, Secretary of the Interior Luis Echeverría Álvarez maintained a polite smile, keeping his cards close to his chest."

"You guys have outdone yourself here, thanks for having us. The trade deal was a pleasure to sign."\n\n"Of course, sir. We figured this wasn't only about the trade deal, but a celebration of all our mutual achievements in the recent past." They sat down, with the ambassador digging into his meal and reminiscing.\n\n"How about that Trujillo, huh?" Laughter spread across the table. "Thank god we got the bastard.

One of the other interns found him, and said he should attend the next meeting.\n\nAnd now he was late. Great first impression. Álvaro hurried across the bustling city street. His destination loomed: a modern apartment block with a small restaurant on the first floor. He rehearsed his apology in his head. The evening crowd on the streets thinned for a moment.

Mateos chuckled at their shared joke. Few people on earth understood the stress of the job, so comradery was appreciated. The two men had had plenty of ups and downs, but now that the baton had been passed, any lingering animosity had dissipated. Mateos got up from his desk, arrayed with documents and plans for future Olympic endeavors.\n\n"It's been invigorating to dig into one project so thoroughly. The presidency never allowed me to focus on the minutia." He led Ordaz to a set of comfortable chairs. He pushed open a double-paned window, and the room filled with the sounds and smells of the city. The sun was bright, and a light shower had passed just hours before, evaporating on the hot streets below. "The 1968 Olympics will show the world the greatness of this city and our people." Mateos started excitedly. "The plans that the committee has drafted are all already astounding. It will be the culmination of all of our hard work. The problem as it stands is that our currently allocated budget might not be enough to follow through with our plans truly."\n\n"I'm thrilled to have you lead this project." In an uncharacteristically relaxed manner, Ordaz sank into the plush lounging chair. He was relieved to see his friend doing so well. "You will have everything you need.

Fascism is not violence for its own sake. It is an ideology that feeds off of deprivation and destitution. More funding to direct towards developmental programs would discourage people from turning to dangerous radicalism in the first place." The American diplomat nodded politely. He wasn't convinced.\n\nUltimately, it was Ordaz's choice to make. If he pressed the Americans, he could secure funding for Flores's development program. It would, however, come at the expense of increased security cooperation. It would do them no good to plan for the coming decades if the DFS was unable to combat fascism today.

As the new party leader, Madrazo had taken plenty of time to both discuss and reflect on the advancement of the Revolution. Ortega had supported his cause since his entry into national politics.

The municipal committees would each conduct a primary to determine who will represent them in the larger states, making the party more accountable and bringing it much closer to the people.\n\n"Before we send the document, want to open a bottle of tequila?"

MEX_Ordaz.35.desc:0 ""...In total, following the recent purges 1,125 elections will need to be arranged!?" Ordaz read aloud, incredulous. The number on the document was inconceivable. The consequences of these purges would be unfathomable. Madrazo was betraying the President's trust, after all they had been through.\n\nCarlos Madrazo was definitely someone you shouldn't take lightly. To some he was a petty idealist with irrational goals, while others viewed him as the spearhead of the reformist movement and the person that could bring the PRI into the future.\n\nFor President Ordaz, however, he was neither. For him, Madrazo was his gateway to the reformists in the party, and through that alliance a friendship had been created. Through everything from the Nava debacle to the Doctors' Strike, he had been able to rely on Madrazo when he needed public support. He was a great man, but this breaking of mutual confidence was a step in the wrong direction.\n\nReally, what was he thinking? His companion Lauro Ortega seemed smart enough, but when the two worked together on reforms, the old guard establishment could rarely stomach the consequences. 1,125 primary elections was just not something the party had the capacity to handle. They would lurch from a stable system with experienced officials to an unstable one full of inexperienced idealists.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Ordaz calmed his nerves. Even if Madrazo sometimes got a bit out of control, he was still both his friend and his way to reach reformists. He shouldn't start questioning his judgment now. Ordaz valued stability and national unity more than anything. So long as Madrazo and Ortega didn't threaten those things, he wouldn't let their work trouble him too much."

Others who couldn't make it had sent representatives in their place.\n\nLeopoldo Sánchez Celis, Governor of Sinaloa was the first to speak. "Carlos Madrazo is becoming a real problem. His so-called reforms are just a naked power grab at our expense."\n\n"For once, I agree with Leopoldo." said Chihuahua Governor Práxedes Giner Durán, "His 'anti-corruption' purges have targeted some of my best subordinates. Most didn't even do anything out of the ordinary."\n\n"If you think that's bad," added Alfonso Martínez Domínguez, President of the Chamber of Deputies, "You should see what he's done here in the Federal District-"\n\n"Gentlemen, we already understand the problem." said an unassuming man, "We should be discussing solutions." The room fell silent. On the surface this man was just a minor CTM official, but everyone knew he represented Fidel Velázquez Sánchez, the CTM's infamous General Secretary.\n\n"Well, that's easy enough." replied Sánchez Celis, "We Governors should be resisting Madrazo's plans tooth and nail. Let's fight him on everything, until he gives up or Ordaz is forced to replace him."\n\nMartínez Domínguez sat up straight. "Here in the capital we can try another angle of attack.

PAN, the only real opposition party, was powerless to do anything but complain from the sidelines.\n\nPresident of the Chamber Alfonso Martínez Domínguez took the floor unexpectedly. After steadying his nerves, he began to speak.\n\n"The Mexican Revolution is not over. It is constantly evolving, adapting to a changing society. Some of the rules we once thought essential may no longer be necessary. I would like to formally introduce a constitutional amendment abolishing the one-term limit for members of this body!"\n\nThe PRI congressmen stared at Martínez Domínguez in stunned silence. This was not a part of the party's planned reforms. Meanwhile in the PAN section a cautious optimism was spreading. They stood to benefit from the reelection of congressmen, and they had long been demanding it. Had their prayers finally been answered?\n\nWhen Carlos Madrazo heard about the amendment he was furious. He paid a visit to several congressmen and had the proposal killed off before the end of the day. The crisis was short lived, but the backlash was intense.\n\nThe PAN was outraged, and denounced Madrazo as a hypocrite. Many scandalized PRI congressmen considered Madrazo the leader of the reformists and blamed him for the incident. The Southern Cyclone's already bruised reputation had taken yet another hit."

Madrazo met Lauro Ortega in his office for another celebration.\n\n"I'm glad we managed to pull it off," said Ortega, "but the response from within the party has me a bit worried. Opposition to our reforms is growing."\n\nMadrazo took a sip of water. "So what? We knew from the start that our plans would be unpopular with the parasites. If corrupt careerists oppose us then we must be doing something right!"\n\n"In that case, what do you think our next move should be?"\n\n"We go bigger." Madrazo replied with a smile, "Our first reforms have been successful, it's time to expand them. All local government officials should be selected by primaries, along with governors, senators and congressmen. We're making gains, we shouldn't take our foot off the gas."\n\nThe two men spent the rest of the afternoon refining the idea.

Ordaz began coldly, "Apparently the party saw fit to remove the head of Chihuahua's state committee?"\n\n"Yes." Madrazo replied, "The man publicly criticized our reforms, and we have evidence that he rigged his primary election to stay in office."\n\n"Do you two have any idea what you've done!? Giner Durán is furious, and the other governors are taking his side! Your meddling in the affairs of a loyal state government is tearing the party apart!"\n\nBefore Madrazo or Ortega could respond, Ordaz let out a sigh. "Please, spare me your speeches. I understand that your work is important, and I still sympathize with your cause. But you need to be more cautious. Something like this cannot happen again, understood?"\n\nAs the two men exited the President's office Madrazo felt ill at ease. "Our plans are causing quite a bit of chaos. Perhaps for Gustavo's sake we should slow down."\n\n"I don't think that's wise." Ortega replied, "You said it yourself: facing opposition means we must be doing something right.

It was obvious that Governor Leopoldo Sánchez Celis had tampered with the primaries, but he categorically denied these accusations and refused any request for new elections.\n\n"The Governor has us in a tough spot." Lauro Ortega complained to Madrazo, "His meddling has made a mockery of our primary system, but without the cooperation of any state officials we're powerless in Sinaloa."\n\nMadrazo frowned. "We're not 'powerless', we have options. If he refuses to work with the National Executive Committee we can pay him back in kind. I'm just worried about the party's stability. The President told us to be cautious, remember? If we choose to fight back it'll be a massive escalation."\n\n"Well, Carlos," Ortega replied, "consider the alternative. If Sánchez Celis gets away with blatant rigging then our primary elections are fatally compromised, and before long every governor will be doing the same. What is the point of our reforms if we're not willing to fight for them?"\n\nFor a moment Madrazo's frown deepened, then his face became stern. "You're right.

If it ever was a revolutionary party, then that time has come and gone!"\n\nGasps of shock echoed through the audience. Madrazo continued, becoming more animated by the second.\n\n"The PRI has lost touch with the political realities of modern Mexico. On the local and state level corruption runs rampant, turning swaths of the country into petty fiefdoms. Social causes, like the plight of the peasantry, are being neglected."\n\nThe crowd was electrified, feeling the truth of every word. The reporters in attendance could hardly believe their luck. Here was the President of the PRI, openly denouncing his own party! This would certainly be front page news.\n\n"This refusal to accept political reality is no accident. The PRI is full of careerists, from the rank and file to the very top. My fight to rid the party of these corrosive forces hasn't been easy. I have been slandered, insulted, and opposed at every turn. But I will not stop fighting! No matter how much they try to get rid of me, I will continue to build a better PRI.

Men who once begged to meet with him were now refusing his calls, and his enemies smelled blood in the water. It slowly dawned on him that there was no coming back from this.\n\nMeanwhile at Los Pinos, President Ordaz barely noticed the rain. His eyes were glued to the transcript of Madrazo's recent speech. As he read further his grip on the paper tightened, his eyes bulged and sweat rolled down his face. Madrazo had always been a hothead, but this... this was completely unacceptable.\n\nOrdaz thought back to the Aleutian Crisis, and how he derailed negotiations by playing into the United States' hands. That one mistake, one momentary lapse in judgment, had nearly destroyed his relationship with López Mateos. Now here he was, faced with a subordinate who constantly exercised poor judgment, defied the President's orders and threatened the stability of the nation. How could he place his trust in a man like that?\n\nHe couldn't, and with that realization came clarity. His anxiety faded, along with any remaining faith in Madrazo. Setting down the transcript, Ordaz picked up his phone.\n\n"Licenciado Lauro Ortega? This is the President. Please meet me in my office, immediately.""

Ordaz said, "Come in."\n\nThe President's tone was cold and dispassionate. Madrazo thought back to their partnership during the sexenio of López Mateos, when he had considered Ordaz a friend. Clearly that time had come to an end.\n\n"Your Excellency, as President of the National Executive Committee I have always done what I thought was best for the PRI. I realize now that I no longer hold the confidence of the party, or your confidence. In the interest of stability, I would like to offer my resignation."\n\nOrdaz's stern expression didn't change.

The President was certain to pick a man who would undo all of his reforms. Well, not just his. Lauro Ortega had fought for reform just as fiercely.

He couldn't believe his eyes as Ortega emerged from a crowd of smug party members, took Ordaz's place at the podium and announced the complete repeal of all their reforms. As he recovered from his shock he finally started putting the pieces together.\n\nHow long had his old friend been scheming to replace him? How many of Ortega's suggestions had been traps, designed to blow up in his face? Had Ordaz been in on it? He looked at the President's cold, uncaring eyes and figured he must have been.\n\nMadrazo furiously shut off the TV. After 30 years of loyal service to the PRI, he'd been stabbed in the back and tossed aside. If those bastards thought they could get rid of him so easily they had another thing coming.

Running this essential program is a great responsibility, and one that I do not accept lightly."\n\nOrdaz raised an eyebrow. He doubted that this ambitious young man had only noble reasons for wanting such a high office. Still, he had the support of the party.

MEX_Ordaz.57.t: "The Lost Cities of Mexico"
MEX_Ordaz.57.desc: "Smoke filled the room as party members moved about, taking whatever food and refreshments were available on the side table arrayed for their pleasure as the last speaker moved from the podium. His speech had been welcomed by polite applause, but nothing more as he spoke on some vapid ideal or another which he had hoped would get him one step further along in the party. Del Rosal had given applause all the same, albeit with a face as cold as stone, just as it was for most of the speakers.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he could see Ernesto Uruchurtu Peralta making his way to the podium. The "Iron Regent", or in more proper terms, the former Chief of the Federal District. Most of del Rosal's gaze was directed at the clock hanging on the wall, which showed how much time was left in this party meeting. He had far more important things to worry about than what some bureaucrats thought ought to be done about this country. But he still had an hour left, and so he returned his attention to Uruchurtu.\n\n"-is an unprecedented and uncontrolled migration from the rural areas of our country into our capital city, at a rate which is wholly unsustainable for both the city and its government," Uruchurtu spoke with vigor. "There are vast swathes of lost cities and invasions into the Federal District that have begun to serve as crime dens for our most disreputable and degenerate, labeled as so-called slums. Yet most of all, it has dirtied the streets of our once-grand capital as squatters fill public parks and streets throughout the city. These vagrants are a risk to the safety of our citizens and must be dealt with swiftly before the world descends for our Olympic games."\n\nDel Rosal could not have been more shocked. How did Uruchurtu have the audacity to complain with such fervor when he had played a part in causing the very problem? And what precisely was he suggesting by talking of this here? His shock turned to anger. Now this had to be dealt with, and swiftly."
MEX_Ordaz.57.a: "Time to call the President."

MEX_Ordaz.58.t: "Solving the Slums"
MEX_Ordaz.58.desc: "Ordaz watched from the foyer as the three men's cars pulled up into the driveway of the Los Pinos presidential residence, greeted one another, before making for the entrance. Good, he thought. As soon as they had a solution to this problem his administration could move on to more important matters.\n\nOrdaz began to speak as he ushered them in, "Welcome, Secretaries. You all know why I called you here; we must deal with Uruchurtu and the points that he has raised at the party meeting. It is a known issue now, and if we don't solve it then we will look weak. So, gentlemen, what are your solutions?"\n\nDel Rosal wasted no time answering. "Secretary Echeverría must reprimand Uruchurtu for this speech. He has overstepped his authority."\n\n"General, while I respect your opinion," Echeverría quickly interjected, "I must point out that Uruchurtu does have a point. CDMX security is in desperate need of funding and manpower. I believe that we can solve some of the issues he has raised in such a way that aids, not hurts, our public image."\n\nOrdaz's attention turned towards Manautou. "And you, Secretary? What are your thoughts?"\n\nManautou took a moment to ponder, before he finally replied, "I believe subtler methods are required, rather than filling the streets with more police which may only further inflame the problem. Security may help stem some problems, but it cannot be the only solution. A softer touch is required."\n\nOrdaz glanced from one man to the next, considering each of their proposals. This problem could not be made to grow into a roadblock for his administrations' goals, he knew that for sure. Which made the answer all the more obvious to him."
MEX_Ordaz.58.a: ""Reprimand Uruchurtu and ensure nobody speaks of this again.""

MEX_Ordaz.59.desc: ""Did you hear what happened to Uruchurtu?" Elias asked as he and Ramón were sorting through some files in one of the Federal District's offices.\n\n"Quiet down, will you?" Ramón hissed through his teeth, before glancing around to be sure that nobody was listening. Nobody was, of course. It was late and most of the other employees had gone home for the night, leaving just a few to clean up the last of the day's work before heading home.\n\n"But you did hear about it, right?" Elias asked in a much softer tone. After seeing Ramón's nod, he continued, "It was quite stern too, from what I heard. A lot of threats were thrown around if you believe some of the gossip." The two of them, having finished with one of the boxes, hoisted it up onto a shelf before pulling out another box to begin sorting once more.\n\n"It doesn't matter if we believe the gossip or not, Elias," Ramón said just as he glanced over his shoulder to check one more time. "Talking about this sort of thing will only get us into trouble too."\n\n"But he was complaining about things that are true! Haven't you seen the growing slums in this city? The migration from the-"\n\n"And what do you want to hear from me, Elias? That it's all true? We all know it is! We all know why the streets are beginning to fill with beggars and vagrants. We see the reports day after day of muggings, of assaults, of criminals scurrying away to their hovels in the slums to hide from the authorities. But it doesn't matter. We have to just keep our heads down, stay quiet, and not flag these problems in our reports or else you and I will be in for a much stronger reaction than Uruchurtu ever got. He got a reprimand; what do you think we'll get? Now shut up and sort these files.""

MEX_Ordaz.60.t: "Cleaning Up the Capital"
MEX_Ordaz.60.desc: "Ordaz seemed deeply troubled by rising crime in the Federal District. Turning to Luis Echeverría, he said, "The security of the capital is of paramount importance. What would you suggest we do?"\n\nWith an ominous grin, Echeverría launched into his proposal. "The slums springing up around the city are a major blindspot for existing law enforcement. Establishing a police presence in these areas, with assistance from the DFS, will close that gap."\n\nAs Ordaz nodded his head, Manautou realized the President was not in the mood for non-security based solutions and held his tongue. Del Rosal, meanwhile, quickly found fault with the Secretary of the Interior's plan.\n\n"Policing the slums will spread our forces very thin, and would be counterproductive. Remember that these are illegal land invasions, not official delegations of the District. We should increase policing in the city center and other important areas."\n\nEcheverría gave del Rosal a side-eye. "General, are you really content to leave these lost cities unpoliced?"\n\n"I think we should be protecting the places where crime does the most damage. If that means the slums are neglected, so be it."\n\n"Alright," Ordaz said, cutting the discussion short. "You've both made your points, but we can only commit to one course of action. I think we should focus our efforts...""

MEX_Ordaz.61.t: "The Root of the Problem"
MEX_Ordaz.61.desc: "To Echeverría and del Rosal's surprise, Ordaz turned his attention to Emilio Martínez Manautou. "I agree that a softer touch would be wise in this situation. What do you suggest?"\n\nManautou smiled brightly. "There are things we can do to mitigate the effects of rural migration here, but we'd only be treating a symptom. Peasants are leaving the countryside in record numbers, and there's no way Mexico City can absorb them all. We need to redirect migrants towards other cities that are better equipped to handle the influx."\n\nAs Ordaz listened intently, Echeverría realized his ideas were not favored and quietly bowed out of the conversation. Del Rosal, on the other hand, felt the President's attention slipping away and tried to wrest it back.\n\n"Diverting migrants to other cities isn't going to work," he said hastily, "Mexico City is the heart of the nation and the best place to find work, that's why so many peasants have come here already. We should use our resources to expand public housing developments, so that new arrivals won't be forced into land invasions."\n\n"I understand your point, General," Manautou said with a raised eyebrow, "but are you sure the Federal District has enough resources to expand public housing on this scale?"\n\n"Yes," he replied, "I'll see to it personally."\n\nBoth men looked towards the President, who had remained silent. Ordaz weighed the pros and cons of both suggestions before finally saying..."

MEX_Ordaz.62.desc: "As Alberto made his way down Avenida Chapultepec, he closely observed the scenery around him. It was a beautiful street, with a wide sidewalk and flower beds along the way. Yet there was no surface to lay on except concrete and dirt, so he kept walking.\n\nLess than a week had passed since Alberto arrived on a bus from Guerrero. He'd hoped to find a job and an apartment quickly, but had not been quite so lucky. Ignoring the pangs of hunger in his stomach, he trudged along down a side street. At last he came across a small park with firm wooden benches. Curling up in an attempt to stay warm, he laid his head down and drifted off.\n\nA couple of hours later Alberto awoke suddenly. He realized his head was covered by some kind of cloth or sack. When he moved to pull it off he was struck hard in the chest, knocking the wind out of him. He was then grabbed and thrown onto a hard metal floor.\n\nHe felt hard, jerking motion and realized he must be in a vehicle. He tried to get up but was struck again, this time in the head. It felt like the tip of a hard boot. He was hit over and over again by multiple assailants, until the pain blotted out his hunger and fatigue.\n\nAt last the vehicle stopped, his head covering was removed and he was pushed out onto the street. As his eyes adjusted he surveyed the dingy, ramshackle buildings around him. Was this still Mexico City? If so it was a part he'd never seen before.\n\nHe turned around and was momentarily blinded by a flashlight. He couldn't see his assailants' faces through the glare, but they were wearing police uniforms.\n\n"If you know what's good for you," yelled one of them, "You won't come back!" With that, they closed the van door and sped off into the night."

MEX_Ordaz.63.desc: "The streets of the lost city outside the Iztapalapa Delegation were filled with debris and leftover construction materials.

Belén and Martha walked past it all, unconcerned, having never known anything else.\n\n"I haven't seen Diego in over a week," Martha said, "I hope he's ok."\n\n"Oh? Is someone worried about her boyfriend?" Belén replied in a taunting voice.\n\n"He's not my boyfriend! I'm just worried, that's all. Anyone would be."\n\n"It is strange though," Belén offered, "Seems like a lot of our local criminals and delinquent youths have gone missing. I wonder if it has anything to do with those new guys?"\n\nShe pointed to a house down the block, separated from the rest by a fence. It had been abandoned until recently, when a group of men arrived in a black van. They'd come and gone frequently since.\n\nPassing by a street vendor who often sold them snacks, Belén said, "Pardon me sir, do you happen to know anything about that house?"\n\nThe vendor's expression darkened. "You shouldn't go near that house. If a friend of yours was taken there, it's already too late."\n\nMartha grew very pale. "Why?" Belén asked, "What happens there?"\n\n"I don't know for sure.

Clutched tightly in his hand was exactly enough money for a ticket to Mexico City.\n\nHe didn't remember when it started, but he'd been dreaming of making this journey for a long time. Finally escaping endless hours of work in the fields of Guanajuato, trading it all for an exciting life in the capital. Eventually he just couldn't take waiting any longer and decided to set off, with no plan and no savings.\n\nAs Marco got into line at the ticket booth, he busied himself looking at the posters adorning the dusty walls. Most of them were old and faded, but a newer one printed in bright colors stood out.\n\nBIENVENIDOS A GUADALAJARA — Now offering reduced fares for all travelers!\n\nMarco read the listed price and gasped. It was less than half the cost of a ticket to the Federal District. If he decided to go there instead...\n\nNo, he thought, he couldn't. It had always been Mexico City in his dreams, not some lesser metropolis. Certainly it would be worth the extra cost.\n\nThen he felt his stomach growl. He imagined himself arriving in CDMX flat broke, going to bed on a street corner cold and hungry. If he went to Guadalajara his savings could pay for dinner, and maybe even a bed for the night.\n\nAs he reached the front of the line Marco made up his mind."

MEX_Ordaz.65.t: "Streets with Cut Corners"
MEX_Ordaz.65.desc: ""While they are similar in aesthetics and layout, the two buildings are designed for different shaped plots of land since we still have to make room for walkways, parking, and various entrances." Alfonso Corona del Rosal listened as he was being guided through an array of concept drawings and blueprints. His office's conference room had been taken over by the Department of the Federal District's public housing planning staff. Each building concept shown was in the modernist style that was so popular nowadays. Del Rosal had used the public housing programs' impressive budget to hire the best architects that money could buy. The ones his staff had found were all idealists. They wanted to create housing which embodied the Revolution itself. Apparently, modernism did this by moving away from old-fashioned bourgeois styles and instead focused on function over form. Del Rosal watched silently as the excited architects unfurled a large sheet of paper. "While sufficient individually. Together, they can form a complex that supports itself. A city within the city."\n\n"What about this area here?" Del Rosal placed a single sturdy finger on a large empty plot in the middle of the layout.\n\n"We believe that could be used as a communal green space for the residents to enjoy." One of the staffers replied with a self-satisfying grin.\n\n"Remove it. The people need housing, not a park." Del Rosal eyed the architects and his staffers. All excitement had left the room, but no one objected. They could be as disappointed as they liked, but Del Rosal had a job to do. Unlike them, he was the head of the nation's capital. They did not understand the burden. Every day, thousands of new migrants come into the city looking for jobs and housing. If he was to provide, he needed to transform the city itself. There was only so much money you could throw at a problem like this."

He had just gotten out of talks with the Olympic Committee, and now he had only 30 minutes to prepare for a meeting with the chief of police.\n\nFinally reaching his office, he was met with a familiar face outside the door. A very unwelcome familiar face.\n\n"General del Rosal," said Ernesto Uruchurtu, "It's a pleasure to see you again."\n\n"What are you doing here?" del Rosal growled, "How did you get in?"\n\n"Come now, this was my office for over a decade, do you really think I wouldn't be allowed inside? But don't worry, I won't be long. And I come bearing good news."\n\n"What is it?" del Rosal huffed, hoping to get this over with.\n\n"I wanted to report that the problems of unchecked migration and crime I spoke about at the last party meeting have largely been resolved, thanks to your efforts. Congratulations."\n\n"Really, you came just to congratulate me? To say I did a good job?"\n\n"Yes." he replied, "I'll admit, in the beginning I wasn't sure you'd be an effective Regent. But when push came to shove, you did what was necessary to preserve safety in this city's beautiful public spaces. My legacy is still standing because of you."\n\nUruchurtu extended his hand, and del Rosal reluctantly shook it.

Odd, del Rosal thought, looking it over.\n\nHe spotted the headline on the second page: AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ERNESTO URUCHURTU. Scowling and gripping the paper tighter, he read on.\n\n'"...migration into the District is out of control." said Licenciado Uruchurtu, "Homelessness and crime are on the rise, and not just in the city's outskirts. Unlicensed ramshackle houses are now springing up outside the Estadio de la Ciudad Universitaria, where the Olympics are set to be held. What an utterly shameful display!"'\n\nDel Rosal's grip tightened until it tore the edges of the page. Crumpling the paper into a ball, he threw it to the ground harshly.\n\nErnesto Uruchurtu was becoming a real nuisance. Clearly he hadn't learned his lesson when Ordaz threw him out. Someone needed to remind him of the price of defiance.\n\nYet that couldn't be del Rosal's first priority. The accusation of uncontrolled housing construction near the Olympic stadium would infuriate the President if it was even remotely true.

It was the perfect crowd - they would love this. These kids had gotten sick of the same old bull that their dads played to death. They were listening to the Beach Boys and some of those other American musicians who were a little more...sensual. These connoisseurs of fine tunes demanded something like that. Ibarra nodded, and the band began.\n\n"Teresa, when you put that rose in your mouth..."\n\nA hundred couples rose from the booths and barstools and took to the dance floor. Ibarra knew it was a little safe, but it was, at the very least, a decent starting point. His affected sultry, seductive voice crooned into the microphone, selling the whole thing. Dancing to the tune and showing off their most risque moves, staring lustily at their partners, Ibarra's song made it all-electric. Whatever they did seemed like just the right thing to do, or maybe that was the 'juice.'\n\n"Teresa, when I kissed those lips for the first time..."\n\nThe bar was so packed that the tender could never possibly check whether his patrons were adults or she didn't care. One young man grinned as she slid down a shot of rum. He shot a hungry, predatory look at a girl, downed the rum in one gulp, and headed her way. Just beside him, a boy who had ordered the drink and told him that girls liked confident men took a girl by the hand into one of the corner bathrooms, latching the door shut. A few teens hopped on the stage and began dancing beside Ibarra.\n\n"Love... like no one has ever loved you...""

It was late afternoon, so only the most dedicated drunks, the management, and perhaps a few band members who were to play that night hung around. No discerning policemen could fully explain why the hour was chosen. Rumors flew that it was because the chief's son was a patron. Some officers grumbled about wasting their time arresting children: either way, the whole operation went through seamlessly.\n\nThe bartender, a grizzled, gray-haired woman in her fifties, was picked up after she tried throwing a few tequila bottles at a captain's head. The establishment's manager was found behind a broom in a maintenance closet. A few kids playing hookey slurred out a nonsensical story about a school chemistry project regarding 'the effects of alcohol on the metabolism and social relationships of teens.'\n\nAll ten people in the cantina sat outside with their faces to the wall. A few wept, and they all winced as bottles of home-brewed alcohol, little packets of Marijuana, or any other highly illegal substance were thrown in an idling car.\n\n"You got everything?"\n\nA bass, hoarse voice echoed through the radio. The police captain nodded.\n\n"Yes sir, it was a good haul in this sector. No one was able to warn other establishments."\n\nHead of the Federal District Corona del Rosal smirked. His raids had caught these druggies and contraband peddlers completely with their pants down. The whole immoral heap was collapsing in on itself. The press would love him for it."

It may very well have resulted in a frustrated Echeverría, something Ordaz had very little patience to deal with. As he hoped for a more amenable subordinate, the clock struck the half-hour and a knock rattled the wooden door to the office.\n\n"You may come in, Secretary," Ordaz replied to the knock as he turned his head down to some papers he had arranged. It was good to look busy, Ordaz thought to himself as he heard the door open and Echeverría step his way into the office. "Come, Secretary, please sit."As Ordaz slowly pushed his papers to the side, he looked up to see a frowning Echeverría sitting across from him. "Your Excellency," he quickly began, "I have come with a report regarding General del Rosal's recent raids. Not a single one has been coordinated with my office, and it is hampering my ability to carry out your agenda as you have generously asked me to do. Severely hampering."\n\nFor a brief moment, Ordaz was overcome with an overwhelming desire to slam his fist against his desk. It passed, even as his anger roiled beneath the surface. "Secretary, I know that things are not always easy when working with the police of the Federal District, but unless you have some solid proof of his actions actively harming your work..."\n\nAs Ordaz's voice trailed, Echeverría leapt in to reply, "I do, Your Excellency."

Opposite to the ordinary trend, the man visibly relaxed at the sight of him.\n\n"What's all of this then, officer? Why are there so many Federal District Police reports here?"\n\nThe officer sighed. Echeverría could tell he was repressing some form of strong emotion. "It's the result of the latest Federal District Police mandate. Del Rosal sent out an order to all points, that they should show 'unprecedented coordination in their dealings with the DFS to safeguard law and order in the Capital'."\n\nEcheverría wanted to throw something. Squelching the rage for a moment, he picked up one of the reports. "'Report on petty burglary in—total value not exceeding one thousand pesos—potentially a false report'? That level of 'coordination'? Who put del Rosal up to this?" The officer, either suspecting correctly that the question was rhetorical or not having any more idea than Echeverría did as to its answer, remained silent.\n\n"Well, I'll do what I can to solve this, officer.

He reported on his pet project, 'Plan Guanajuato,' to develop infrastructure and build an industrial corridor. I'll admit, I was impressed."\n\nGuadalupe smiled, not at all surprised that her husband was still talking about his work. "You shouldn't let a governor outshine you, dear. There are plenty of major infrastructure projects left undone. For example, this city still lacks a metro system."\n\n"A metro system in Mexico City?" Ordaz asked, scratching his chin, "It's certainly grandiose, yet I'm not sure that it's feasible."\n\n"But it is feasible. The civil engineering firm Empresas ICA — my brothers work there, remember? — has a proposal for just such a system. They say it will dramatically reduce traffic, and construction could be completed before the Olympic Games."\n\nThe President was intrigued. Giving the capital a metro system would be a major victory for his administration, especially if it was finished before the Olympics. He vaguely recalled the idea being raised during López Mateos' term, but opposition from the Federal District's Regent had defeated it. Ordaz resolved to look into the matter himself."

I believe it is time to build a metro system."\n\nUruchurtu scowled, his default reaction whenever a metro was mentioned. "Your Excellency, I must caution against this idea. The Federal District cannot afford a metro, and it is not the most effective way to reduce traffic."\n\n"I think you're mistaken. I've read the ICA report myself, and their models for traffic reduction seem reliable. As for the cost," Ordaz smiled, "you don't need to worry. I will support the construction with as much federal funding as necessary."\n\nThe President thought this offer was generous, but Uruchurtu remained unconvinced. After years of opposing the metro, his reputation was on the line, and he had a duty to protect his allies in the transport unions. "I'm sorry Your Excellency, I cannot support any proposal that includes a metro system."\n\nOrdaz's smile vanished. Giving his defiant subordinate a stern look, he replied, "If that's all you have to say, you may leave.""

I am going to get rid of him, I just need to know how."\n\n"Your Excellency, if I may," said Emilio Martínez Manautou, Secretary of the Presidency, "For all his faults, Uruchurtu has served the party loyally for many years. We could offer him a promotion to some other office, where he cannot interfere."\n\n"A reward hardly seems appropriate for someone so insubordinate," Luis Echeverría, Secretary of the Interior interjected, "What we should do is have the DFS dig up some dirt on Uruchurtu. Then we confront him with his dirty laundry and force him to resign quietly."\n\nManautou turned pale at this suggestion. "With all due respect, Secretary Echeverría, can you think of something less... immoral?"\n\nEcheverría thought for a moment. "There's an even simpler solution: the Regent needs support from the city's transport unions to keep things running smoothly. If we pull a few strings and get them to strike, we can tarnish his image. That would justify a dismissal."\n\n"Enough." Ordaz said suddenly, "All of your ideas have merit, but we only need one plan. I will make the final decision.""

Now I need some ideas on where to send him."\n\nLuis Echeverría scratched his chin. "How about making him Ambassador to Canada? It's a sufficiently prestigious post that will keep him far away from domestic politics."\n\n"It is prestigious," countered Emilio Martínez Manautou, "but I don't think the inflexible Iron Regent will make a good diplomat."\n\nEcheverría wanted to say, "That's never stopped us before," but held his tongue. Instead, he replied with, "What do you have in mind?"\n\n"Something that will make use of his obvious talent for construction and planning. Perhaps a post at the agency for Federal Roads and Bridges? CAPUFE could use a man with his experience."\n\nOrdaz was silent, his face scrunched in thought. At length, he relaxed and said, "You've both given me good options, but I've decided to...""

His opinion of the President had reached a new low. "Your Excellency," he replied through gritted teeth, "I see what this is."\n\nOrdaz raised an eyebrow. "Whatever do you mean?"\n\n"This 'promotion' is little more than an insult. You're trying to force me out!" Uruchurtu said, almost yelling, "You want me gone so you can destroy everything I've built here in the Federal District. Sorry, but it's not going to work. Mexico City is where I belong."\n\n"You dare defy me again!?" Ordaz growled. His face contorted into a frightening visage. For a moment he seemed ready to explode right back at Uruchurtu.\n\nBut the moment passed. Ordaz's rage cooled into a harder, more dispassionate contempt.\n\n"You're dismissed from office, effective immediately. There will be no promotion. So long as I'm president you'll never receive another government job. Not even post office clerk.""

These people, and this city, were no longer his.\n\n"I've finished sorting through your files," said a secretary from the doorway, "Do you need help packing up the things in here?"\n\n"No thank you, I will handle it."\n\nIn truth, Uruchurtu had barely started packing, his mind was elsewhere. He didn't regret blowing up at the President; Ordaz was a fool and his so-called 'promotion' didn't interest Uruchurtu in the slightest. Yet after nearly 13 years in charge of the Federal District, he wasn't prepared to say goodbye.\n\nHis desk was strewn with documents: plans for beautiful new parks, for boulevards lined with flower beds, and for countless other public works. There was a whole file on infrastructure that could reduce traffic without the need for that infernal metro. With his departure none of it would ever see the light of day.\n\nAs he reflected on his long tenure, he realized the title "Iron Regent" had been misleading. He had wielded immense power only when the President supported him. Now the President wanted him gone, and all his ambitions had shattered like glass."

"Your Excellency, if you must do this, I would advise investigating Uruchurtu for corruption. After over a decade in office something improper is bound to crop up, and that would be enough to justify dismissal."\n\n"Sure, we'll probably find something," Luis Echeverría countered, "but it might not be damning enough."\n\n"Well then, Secretary Echeverría," Manautou huffed, "what would you suggest?"\n\nEcheverría grinned. "We should investigate his private life. The Iron Regent's public image is that of a staunch social conservative. If we uncover just one trip to a brothel, his coalition could come undone."\n\nManautou found this idea disgusting, but did not voice a response. The choice was in the President's hands, and he trusted Ordaz to make the right decision.\n\n"Thank you for your counsel, gentlemen."

Numerous irregularities were discovered, spanning the entirety of his twelve-year tenure.\n\nThe strongest evidence of corruption came from the bidding process for Uruchurtu's public works projects. A select group of construction firms were given the majority of contracts for roads, parks, beautification schemes and public housing units, despite strong competing bids for other firms.\n\nIn some cases, contracts were awarded before other firms had an opportunity to submit competing bids. The select firms repaid this preferential treatment with financial kickbacks and personal favors for Uruchurtu and his associates.\n\nAdmittedly this form of corruption is not exceptional or even uncommon.

The site should be just up ahead."\n\nThe first thing that hit Jorge was the smell. It was awful, and intense. Cresting the hill he saw that it was coming from the remains of a small village. Several houses had been reduced to rubble, the others were empty husks. Dark red stains covered the ground.\n\n"Wha... what happened here?"\n\nThe cacique grinned sheepishly. "These people were squatting on my land. After my associates and I explained the situation, they agreed to resettle elsewhere. They left in quite a hurry, you see, and that's why there's such a mess."\n\nJorge felt nauseous, but managed to keep his composure. He didn't want to know any more about this.

MEX_Ordaz.97.desc: "Flight is one of the great inventions of mankind. Before limited to just a scrambling horde stuck to the ground; now, humanity has unlimited access to the skies. It is a beautiful endeavor that is conveniently much faster than any other mode of transportation. Emilio believed that every part of a mechanism should suit the grandest of its purposes, and airports were grand temples to a modern technological wonder. As a member of the Guadalajara International Airport help desk, Emilio played a small but important role in this mechanism. His duty was to guide customers through the flying experience as best as possible.\n\nEmilio had watched as, over the years, the airport had been transformed from the inside out. Under the new Airport and Auxiliary Services administration there had been a flurry of new rules and regulations not only for the passengers but for employees like him. In addition to expanding the runways and constructing new terminals, they've implemented strict boarding procedures In anticipation and facilitation of an increased volume of flights.\n\nFrom his desk, Emilio watched as the previously unorganized trickle of customers transformed each day into long straight lines. While the new process of paperwork and documentation checks was tedious, it was superior to the wild days of old.\n\n"Excuse me!" One such customer split off from the back of the line and angrily approached him. "If you don't mind me saying this, this is ridiculous! I paid a lot of money for this flight, and now I have to submit all this paperwork. I had no idea. Where do you guys get off?"\n\nEmilio manufactured a well-rehearsed polite smile and replied, "I assure you, sir, once you learn all the new requirements, boarding will be as easy as the breeze.""

MEX_Ordaz.98.desc: ""Just because the oil is there doesn't automatically mean it will benefit us. Obviously, first, you must get it out of the ground." PEMEX Director and PRI insider Jesús Reyes Heroles carefully lifted a cup of coffee from a silver platter that President Ordaz's assistant had provided for the two men's meeting. "Then you must account for the quality and type of oil. You must choose how and what you will transform the petroleum into." Heroles scooped two spoonfuls of sugar into his drink, stirring the mixture with an ornate spoon. "Finally, you must get the final product where you need it and customers want it. Gasoline is only useful when you put it into a car after all." Heroles took a satisfying sip of his drink, enjoying the rich flavors. "It's all worth it, but the whole process is complicated and gets more complicated every year. That's why we need the Mexican Petroleum Institute to perform. So that we can stay on top of the market."\n\n"I understand that well enough. Do you already have somebody in mind to head the institute, Jesús?" Ordaz slowly stirred his coffee before drinking it. Straight black, no need for frivolities; let the coffee serve him, not the other way around. "He must be someone who knows his role. He must understand this is not a charity nor some purely academic affair. The IMP is to be an organ of the PRI and exists to improve the Mexican economy, no more, no less."\n\n"I have just the man." Heroles placed down his cup and slid over an enclosed dossier to the president. He tapped his saucer nervously. Usually one for calm civility, Heroles was excited. This organization was his brainchild, and he believed its research would greatly improve PEMEX operations. "Javier Barros Sierra, a very talented engineer and administrator."\n\n"An academic too." Ordaz kept a firm grasp of his coffee as he studied the dossier. "I just hope he's up for the job. I don't need a flake in my administration. You will need to ensure his commitment.""

He was to meet his escort at the town hall, from there, he would be driven to the newly established drilling sites for inspection. He rounded a corner and found the street choked by a sea of bright awnings.\n\nDel Rosal walked into the damp shade. All sorts of goods were piled on the stalls, from fresh produce to hand built pottery. Every few steps, one of the traders, all women, would accost him and insist he buy something from their stall. Every time he would scowl and refuse.\n\nHe had almost cleared the market when he spotted someone pointing at him. Her eyes flickered with recognition, and she spoke to a friend in Zapotec before stepping into the aisle, blocking del Rosal's exit. The woman standing before him was young. She bore a deep frown on her round face, and wore her black hair in a braid.\n\n"You're General del Rosal." She announced, as much to the rest of the market as to him. "You've come here to take our oil and you can't even spare a few pesos at our stalls." People began to stare. Del Rosal's suit clung to his skin. He glared at her, then fished a few coins out of his pocket.\n\nA few minutes later, he arrived in front of the town hall with a rug rolled under his arm. An idling truck waited to ferry him away. Del Rosal's driver spotted the woven mat and raised an eyebrow."

The half hour break for lunch was a godsend. Benito found his bunkhouse. One of about 20 low rectangular buildings on the edge of the worksite.\n\nIn the cramped common area, his coworkers crowded around an aluminum folding table. They were grumbling about Ordaz's moves to expand and modernize Pemex.\n\n"I don't see the problem." Benito cut in, running a filthy hand through his wavy hair as he removed his hard hat. "Getting in new equipment will save lives, and make our work a hell of a lot easier. And even if half the planned expansions go through, we'll never be out of a job again." Benito was met with stony glares.\n\n"Oh, give the kid a break." Enrique said. He was the oldest man there, in his late 40s, still strong, but age was gaining on him. "He wasn't there in '58."\n\n"What happened in '58?"\n\n"We went on strike with the railway workers. Ordaz didn't even try to negotiate. That son of a bitch marched soldiers into the oil fields and train depots. Dragged our leaders off to Lecumberri. God knows what happened to them after that." Silence gripped the bunkhouse.

MEX_Ordaz.101.desc: "It was well past 1:00, but Secretary of Hacienda and Public Credit Antonio Ortiz Mena had already decided to take a late lunch. From his office he continued the project he'd been working on for the past six years: managing deficits, controlling inflation, maintaining yearly growth. Stabilizing Development, as it was known.\n\n"Secretary Mena?" called one of his aides, "Secretary Campos Salas would like to speak with you."\n\n"Tell him I'm busy." he huffed. For all that had stayed the same under Ordaz, there were a few changes that irked him. He would've been happy to chat with Salinas Lozano, but the new Secretary of Industry and Commerce was far too smug and combative for Mena's taste.\n\n"Secretary Mena," said another aide, approaching the desk, "I have that report on the national debt you requested."\n\nMena stopped what he was doing. "Leave it here," he said grimly.\n\nThere were no surprises in the report, and that was a problem. Another thing that had stayed consistent throughout López Mateos' sexenio was ballooning deficits. So far Ordaz hadn't seen fit to cut spending at all. On the contrary, he would soon be spending more to prepare for the Olympic Games.\n\nIt couldn't last. As an economist Mena knew this 'Mexican Miracle' was coming to an end. Yet so long as he held this office, he'd spend every day trying to keep it going."

I won't allow things to spiral out of control like they did during Kabuki."\n\nFidel Velázquez remained silent. The CTM General Secretary had worked with every past PRI President, and now he seemed to be sizing up the next. "What would you have me do?" he said at last.\n\n"I am going to deal with these doctors, once and for all. That will require harsh new anti-strike measures. While this is happening I want the CTM and all its workers in lockstep with the government and our narrative. No joining their protests, no sympathy strikes, no talk of solidarity."\n\nVelázquez chuckled. "Your Excellency, you don't need to worry. My workers know better than to support a bunch of rich doctors and their spoiled brat interns. But just to put your mind at ease, I'll see to it personally that everyone is on their best behavior."\n\nOrdaz got up to leave, but Velázquez stopped him. "I've known this for quite some time, but you're a man of sound judgment. I'm looking forward to a productive six years."\n\nCompletely disarmed by the compliment, Ordaz gave a slight smile.

MEX_Ordaz.103.desc: "Derek was all smiles as he led the fleet of John Deere tractors towards Jujutla. As a boy he'd always dreamed of helping in the fight against fascism, but being a Mennonite pacifist meant the army wasn't an option. He'd been overjoyed to find a job with one of the State Department's aid programs, especially when he learned he'd be in the field rather than behind a desk. Now he was out here making a difference, delivering top of the line farm equipment to the peasants of central Mexico.\n\nAs he watched the American aid worker dismount the tractor and approach, Héctor's face was a mix of confusion and dismay. What was Ordaz thinking, letting Yanquis into the heartland of the Revolution? Did he not remember the war of 1846? The Punitive Expedition? President Dewey's fury during the oil nationalization?\n\nSeeing his boss's obvious distress, Benito decided to take the initiative. "Thank you for the tractors," he said respectfully. "We're very grateful for your assistance."\n\nDerek's smile widened as he reached out for a handshake. "It's no trouble at all, we're always happy to help out a neighbor in need. My coworkers and I will be staying in Mexico for a few more weeks, if you'd like we can help with the distribution-"\n\n"That will not be necessary!" Héctor suddenly snapped. "Foreigners like you could not possibly assist with such a delicate task. You have no knowledge of this land and its people. The distribution will be handled by qualified CNC officials, such as myself and my colleague."\n\nDerek was taken aback by the refusal, but recovered quickly.

Three-year-old Rosita was already asleep on the bed that took up most of their tiny room. Despite its size he'd been lucky to find this place after his father threw them out.\n\nSlowly making his way over to the radio, Miguel turned it on at a low volume. "...major news out of the United States today, where lawmakers are considering terminating the Bracero Program..."\n\nThe word "Bracero" instantly brought back a flood of memories. Hitchhiking across a scorching desert to reach the border, days spent sleeping outside, waiting, hoping...\n\n"...which has come under fire from American labor unions. In the end, the Senate narrowly approved a one-year extension of the program. Ambassador Hugo B. Margáin praised the move, calling it proof of the brotherly solidarity between our two nations."\n\nMiguel began to laugh. The memories continued: being crammed into ramshackle lodgings with sixteen other men, with no protection from the flies and mosquitoes. Spending all day beneath the blazing sun, his hands cut to ribbons by the plants, watching men collapse from exhaustion. Eating spoiled food that sometimes made men sick. Every complaint met with the same retort, "If you don't like it, go back."\n\nHis laugh grew stronger, more cynical. Lena looked concerned. Truthfully he had enjoyed his time in the States, and some of the people he'd met there had been very friendly. But of all the crappy bosses he'd had, that Yanqui overseer was the worst by far. How could anyone call such mistreatment "brotherly solidarity"?"

Using logs and crates as tables and chairs, they share bits of food to make a meal. The tree canopy above protects them from the beating sun but provides little reprieve from the sweltering heat. The humidity which cultivates the greenery around them is also the source of their sweat. The men and women ate without conversation, the sound of chewing and swaying leaves accompanied by a battered radio singing garbled ballads. Their meal is interrupted by the arrival of a sputtering truck up the steep road.\n\n"Good afternoon." A man steps out of the passenger side of the now-parked truck. He wore a long-sleeved white shirt unfitting for the humid weather and the body it tightly clung to. The farmers recognized the man as their local CNC representative. A bureaucrat for the National Peasant Confederation, one of the many cells of the PRI. "I come bearing gifts for the planting season." He gesticulated as the truck's driver placed wooden crates on the roadside. Their weight caused them to sink into the ground below, they read 'pineapple seeds.'\n\n"You can't leave this here. There's a warehouse up the road you can deliver it to." One of the peasants stood up and inspected the first crate of the growing stack of identical boxes. "Pineapples? We have no idea how to grow pineapples."\n\n"You can learn." The bureaucrat motioned for the unloading to continue. "We will provide info on how to grow them properly shortly. But I recommend planting them as soon as possible. I hear that pineapples have a long gestation period."\n\n"How about you get in your truck and leave before I give you something to gestate, you veiled hog!"

At the end of his presentation, CNC official Javier looked over at the assembled crowd. The crowd was a loose collection of peasants who politely clapped once he stopped speaking. Between each clump of people were plenty of empty chairs at empty tables.\n\nAs a bureaucrat of the National Peasant Confederation, Javier was responsible for collecting and solving problems for local farmers and liaising with the PRI. That job became more difficult each year as the communities he served shrunk. That evening, he spoke at a community center in rural Veracruz. He had done this event at this location dozens of times over the years, but this was the lowest turnout he had ever seen. Worse still is that he witnessed this decline firsthand all across the state. Rural life in Mexico was slowly disappearing before his eyes. At first, it was the young people looking for good jobs in the big cities, but eventually, everybody else was leaving until it became a feedback loop he feared couldn't stop. The peasant lifestyle he loved and protected was slowly dying out.\n\n"Does anybody have any questions for me?" Javier asked the seated crowd. There was no response besides a couple of coughs. "Alright, everybody. If you need me, you know where to find me." Javier left the stage, and the peasant left for better things. There was free food at the back of the chamber."

Flores sighed, putting the note down, placing his head in his hands for a moment. They had given the Americans so much, and now one little thing sets them off like this. Paranoid, he summed up before removing his hands and writing a response letter.\n\nHe tried not to let his mood slip into the words along the letter, telling them in the kindest way he can that Mexico is simply being fair among competitors.

Over the course of the past year, he had seen it go from a barren field of churned earth to something halfway recognizable as a stadium.\n\nToday was an especially busy day. A fleet of long-nosed semi-trucks idled on the street. Their flatbed trailers carried huge tracked cranes. An American foreman barked orders to the operators as they were unloaded one by one.\n\nFukuda furrowed his brow. Friends in the construction sector said that it was a real struggle to get contracts renewed. When it came to the Olympics, the situation was even worse. Every new venue would be built by American engineers, with American equipment. No matter how low the Japanese firms went, all they would get in response were blunt rejection letters.\n\nJust two years ago, Japan's place as a backer of the Mexican miracle seemed unimpeachable.

"The committee has been crafting some really fantastic ideas. You should see them." Under his pained eyes, Mateos managed to flash his well-practiced smile.

We are behind schedule already. There is just so much to do." Mateos rubbed his brow. "It has to be perfect. For the people."\n\n"Of course. We still have time." Ordaz opened the shaded blinds, letting some brightness into the dark office. Outside the window, misty rain, born from the humid heat, clung to the city. Ordaz was saddened to see his mentor, his friend, in this light. Mateos had spent his best years fighting for the Mexican people. Fighting for a romantic dream that only he saw. Ultimately, he fought too hard and was now paying the price. Ordaz wondered if the price was worth it. Was this to be his fate if he pushed as hard as Mateos?

MEX_Ordaz.117.desc: ""Preciado, you had a proposal for us?" President Ordaz said, tapping the thick manila folder in front of him.\n\n"Yes, sir." Secretary of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Juan Gil Preciado stood to speak to the president and the rest of the assembled secretaries. It had been a lengthy cabinet meeting where each man had fought for the president's attention and, hopefully, his support. Now, it was Preciado's turn. "Located within the folders in front of you is a comprehensive plan to address the difficulties currently facing our rural population." He quickly glanced as the men lazily opened their identical folders. "So far, this administration has made many great strides in industrialization, but I fear that our progress in that regard has blinded us to the people of the countryside. With some key investments and a renewed focus on agriculture, I believe we can reverse many of the persistent troubles our large rural population faces."\n\n"Very good Preciado." Ordaz said before the secretary could continue. He opened the first page of the pile and skimmed it. Of course, Ordaz had already read the proposal's key points; he wouldn't allow such an extensive government program to be presented to his cabinet without at least some prior approval, whether Preciado knew it or not. "I appreciate the hard work you and your team have put in on this matter." Ordaz closed the folder, ending his consideration. The rest of the men followed suit with a wave of folding paper. "I will leave this with my team, and we will decide whether or not to implement it as written," Ordaz concluded the topic by handing the papers off to a nearby assistant.\n\nPreciado remained standing. All eyes were on him. Despite all the notes and data he had labored to prepare for this meeting, the discussion was now closed. All he could muster was a "Thank you, sir" before sitting again."

MEX_Ordaz.118.desc: "DIRECCIÓN FEDERAL DE SEGURIDAD\nFEDERAL DISTRICT\nISSUE: Peasant violence in Chiapas\n\nRecent reports have been brought to us that anti-cacique protests by peasants in the State of Chiapas have gone violent. The most recent manifestation of this form of dissension took the form of an attack on a particularly hated cacique's plantation. After repeated apparent conflicts between the cacique and his tenants, his property was looted and then torched.\n\nThe majority of our information on this situation is not up to DFS standards. We can only certifiably confirm that the cacique's property was attacked and burned down, and that his workers suffered numerous injuries. The cacique is now obsessively insisting that there is a threat of a socialist revolt in the area, but we are still unclear on what precisely motivated the peasants to act.\n\nWe have already arrested some of the ringleaders of the specific incident that has been described above, and are keeping a close eye on the broader situation in order to ensure the preservation of order. However, since we have only the unreliable words of the cacique as proof of any incipient socialist insurgency in the state, a state of siege may be questionable at this stage.\n\nDespite this assessment, the suppression of insurrectionism in all its forms remains our highest priority. We await instructions on the next course of action.\n\nVery respectfully,\nDirector of the DFS Office of Chiapas\nColonel Estanislao Martínez Martínez"

They needed to discuss something, the only thing worth discussing at the moment, but none could bring themselves to speak after seeing Ordaz's face.\n\n"Your Excellency..." Manautou began, summoning his courage. He slowly produced a copy of The New York Times, its cover showing police officers beating a doctor to a bloody pulp. "Pictures like these are doing real damage to our reputation abroad. With the Olympics coming up, perhaps more discretion would be wise."\n\nOrdaz fixed his death glare on Manautou. "These subversives are being influenced by foreign backers, they should see how we deal with traitors in Mexico."\n\nManautou immediately clammed up. The rest of the cabinet remained frozen, unsure of how to respond. After another long silence del Rosal rose to confront Ordaz.\n\n"Your Excellency, I believe this crackdown has been a misstep. I understand the reasoning behind it, and if it were carried out in the earliest stages of the strikes it probably would have succeeded. But the doctors have garnered national attention and significant public support. It will take some time to undo the damage."\n\nIf the General hoped his diplomatic tone would soften the blow, he was mistaken. Ordaz seethed, his rage intensifying the sharp pain in his stomach. Anger and shame contorted his ugly face into a truly horrifying visage. Now glowering at del Rosal, Ordaz opened his mouth and spoke two words."

Another report, this time from Secretary Echeverría. Over a hundred medical interns arrested, dozens more injured when police broke up their illegal demonstration. Another, from General Barragán. An entire hospital staff in federal custody or seriously injured after soldiers occupied the building.\n\nThis was going better than Ordaz had expected. All across the nation people saw these strikers for what they really were: entitled fools and dangerous radicals. With public opinion firmly on the government's side the doctors had practically no leverage. His underlings had been ordered to end this affair by any means necessary, so it was only a matter of time before they surrendered.\n\nOrdaz leaned back in his chair with a satisfied smile. Maybe he'd pick up a bottle of champagne on the way home, since a day like this called for celebration. He had saved the republic from chaos and disorder once again.

The venue was filled with officials from the IMSS and renowned medical professionals. President Ordaz himself sat in the place of honor, flanked by Antonio Martínez Manautou, head of the IMSS, and his brother Emilio, Secretary of the Presidency.\n\n"Today we celebrate the talented personnel of our medical community," Ordaz said during his speech, "whom I hold in the highest esteem. I am grateful for their many humanitarian efforts, and I remain committed to resolving our disputes through dialogue. But I must caution them against adventurism. Given how essential they are to the health of the nation, further work stoppages would be ill-advised. Furthermore, the creation of any union independent of established labor organizations is impossible.

Most, including Lupita, were on their feet, commiserating about their slim chances of catching the president's ear. Lupita was happy to be here, though she couldn't help but wish her first visit to the Federal District had come under better circumstances. She had been elected by the Saltillo chapter to represent them at a national meeting of the AMMRI, and didn't have the time or money for sightseeing.\n\nLupita was feeling horribly overwhelmed by all the commotion when she was waved into a circle of interns on the edge of the crowd. There, a handsome young man was ranting about their parent organization, the AMM. He was almost shouting just to be heard over the din.\n\n"All I'm saying is that if the doctors really cared about us, they wouldn't have waited two months to go on strike. Ordaz will listen to whatever it is they want to say and he'll shut them down just like he did last time." Lupita nodded along with the rest of the group.\n\n"Then why the hell should we follow their orders?" She was surprised to hear herself speak, but continued when she saw the other interns were listening intently. "Just because they'll back down to save their careers doesn't mean we have to stop too.

The howling continued as a legion of cops wielding batons filed out of the vehicles and formed into a line, blocking any avenue of escape. Somewhere, a whistle shrieked. The police began to march in lockstep towards the demonstrators.\n\nAlready, some of the crowd began to turn and flee. A wave of blue uniforms broke against the mass of protestors. Lupita tried to run, but couldn't squeeze through the densely packed crowd behind her. All she could do was watch as the police thrashed her fellow interns with their truncheons. Another wave of people began to flee as it became clear the police were not interested in making arrests.\n\nLupita darted for an opening in the thinning crowd behind her when a calloused hand closed around her wrist. Before she could turn to face her captor, a baton slammed into her shoulder. She felt her collarbone break with a dull snap. Lupita screamed. Searing pain radiated from her shattered clavicle. Then the baton struck her in the head. Her legs gave way. All around her were barked orders and screams and the smack of batons against muscle and bone.

Almost immediately they began to heckle the interns.\n\n"Don't want to be stuck in the union with the idiot garbage collectors? You think you're too good for us? Like you give a fuck about anything but your own pay!" Hydraulics whined as the sloping tailgates on the backs of the vehicles opened. The workers reached into the containers and pulled out the city's refuse. Decaying food, glass bottles, and scrap wood became ammunition for their skirmish.\n\nLupita found herself face to face with one of the sanitation workers, a wiry man with a shaved head. He pulled a bloated, moldy orange from the truck and hurled it at Lupita. It burst open on her face with a smack.\n\nThe smell was unbearable. Liquid ran down her face into her eyes and mouth.

One of the other demonstrators is going into cardiac arrest." He gave the bereaved parents an apologetic look and followed the nurse out. The sounds of the hospital filtered through the open door.

She would not be joining them.\n\nLupita glanced at the train schedule on her nightstand one last time. If there were no delays, she would make it to Eagle Pass before sundown. She hefted the suitcase off the bed and made for the front door. Standing at the entrance, she rifled through her purse to make sure everything was there. Oh no. Her passport was gone.

She started pulling drawers on her dresser at random. All empty. She wiped the tears from her eyes, and started checking under furniture. The dresser? Nothing. Nightstand? No. Under the bed? Something glimmered under a discarded blouse. She snatched it up. It was a blue book with an eagle devouring a snake stamped on the cover in gold foil. She hugged the passport to her chest and put it in her bag.\n\nLupita grabbed her suitcase from its place by the door and stepped outside. It was a beautiful day. Clear blue sky. Quiet and warm. A slight breeze tousled her hair. She had only gone half a block when a blue and white Dodge came roaring down the street. It stopped in front of her with a horrible screech. Her body went numb.

It wasn't much to speak of, but it was his, and it was centrally located on the checkerboard block of Mexico City, so he could get around quickly. As soon as he entered, he placed his bag, coat, and shoes in their designated spot. Ferdinand was only ever a couple of steps from anywhere in his home, so everything had to be in its place for any sense of organization. The divide between the kitchen and living room was more loose suggestion than distinct rooms.\n\nOnce he had shed the burdens of the outside world, Ferdinand made a beeline for his functional kitchen. A headache pounded dully against his skull, like being tapped by a rubber mallet. The grueling hours spent on the 20 de November Hospital picket line had taken a toll on his body. He gulped down a glass of water, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat, raw from hours of non-stop talking. Still focused on hydration, Ferdinand reached for his nearby standing lamp, his only light source in the dimly lit room.\n\nThe hair on the back of Ferdinand's neck stood up. His lamp wasn't there. With fresh eyes, he looked around his room. The lamp was in another corner. Something was off. He would have remembered moving his lamp. Ferdinand's throat tightened once again, and a flash of heat washed over him as his heart dropped. But that wasn't all. Turning on the light, he scoured his apartment. Furniture has been moved around, the bathroom light is on, and all his family pictures had been set up in a line on his small desk.\n\nFerdinand's hands shake as he closes his window, which, usually closed to keep in the heat, is wide open and facing a rooftop in the distance. With the initial panic fading, Ferdinand is forced by exhaustion to reach the obvious conclusion: Someone had been in his home.

He dared not share his concerns with his comrades, unsure of who he could trust and fearful of being dismissed as delusional. In his other hand, he tightly clutched a switchblade borrowed from a friend, symbolizing his growing unease.\n\nWith as much strength as he could muster, Ferdinand swung open the door and saw nothing. He arrived ready for a fight and everything to be rearranged again, but nothing was out of order. He let out a sigh of relief as he searched his small home once again to make sure. He must have been seeing things after all, or perhaps the neighborhood kids were playing a prank on him.\n\nAlmost drowned out by the ambient sounds of his apartment, Ferdinand's keen ears picked up a faint, droning whisper. His heart raced, and a shiver ran down his spine as he feared the worst. The rhythmic beat of his ceiling fan guided him to his bedroom, where he found everything in its place. Yet on his bedside desk, his radio was playing music with sounds as small as its 'made in Guangdong' inscription.\n\nFerdinand turned the dial to his radio slightly until he felt the satisfying click of the off position. He must have left it on when he departed that morning. However, he saw his desk drawer slightly cracked open just below the radio. Ferdinand opened the drawer to discover a manila envelope inside, and within that, a pre-written resignation letter for the 20 de November Hospital. He hadn't been imagining things after all.

Scheduling the meeting itself was an arduous task as the delegates had to explore the Byzantine maze which was the modern-day union system. They originally were inspired by the president's willingness to accede to some of the demands made by PRI-sponsored unions.\n\n"Do you think we did a good job? Do you think we should stick to this path?" one delegate asked another while taking a long drag on his cigarette. They were standing under a colorful awning to hide from the sun. The hot smoke did not help cool his warm body, but he needed a restorative after the long meeting.\n\nThe man they had spoken to seemed receptive, though it was uncertain what he could accomplish. After all he was merely their representative in the National Union of Social Security Workers, which is in turn part of the Federation of State Workers Unions (FSTSE), which in turn is part of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP).\n\n"It's not a performance; we expressed the truth in moral and legal arguments, and the rest will work itself out. Hopefully." His partner responded with his cigarette hanging limply from his hand. As medically trained professionals, they knew that they probably shouldn't be smoking so much.

Before that could happen, a distressed man burst into the room with a large stack of newspapers.\n\n"The paper's just come in! You guys are going to want to read this." The pile of newspapers was split and disseminated around the association. An angry face appears with each pair of eyes that read that day's headline.\n\n'Doctors' Union demands small raise; emphasizes PRI cooperation.'\n\nAngry voices bounce around the room and push toward the previous speaker, who musters the courage to stand and join in the anger so that he might redirect it. "This is a complete miscarriage of the truth! The PRI and their so-called 'journals' wish to co-opt our movement for their gain. We cannot let them. They will get what they deserve and we shall take what is rightfully ours!""
MEX_Ordaz_DS.17.a: "The appearance of victory is all that matters."

MEX_Ordaz_DS.18.t: "Deadlock"
MEX_Ordaz_DS.18.desc: ""...Furthermore, the salaries of doctors and resident interns shall be raised by seven percent." The room exploded into chaos. The chairman of the AMM folded the letter and placed it back into its envelope. He would give them time to weigh their options before a decision was made.\n\nSomewhere in the turmoil, Dr. Soliño beamed. Her family in Leon would never know want or hunger. She turned to Emilio, a young intern from the Federal District she had met during the previous work stoppage.\n\n"Isn't this wonderful? I can't believe it! We won!" She pulled him into a tight hug before realizing he did not share her joy.\n\n"This is about more than just pay now, Dr. Soliño," Emilio retorted. "We need to keep the strike going until they recognize our union if we want to keep any of the gains we've made." Dr. Soliño's smile faded.\n\n"We need to be willing to negotiate, Emilio."\n\n"So we just roll over and take their offer? We need to guarantee fair representation in the future."\n\n"We won't have any representation if Ordaz thinks we'll never be satisfied!" Dr. Soliño snapped."
MEX_Ordaz_DS.18.a: "The meeting is adjourned. No decision has been made."

MEX_Ordaz_DS.19.t: "Scabs"
MEX_Ordaz_DS.19.desc: "The heads of the ISSTE and the IMSS reclined on plush leather chairs in the president's office. Both men had approved of the president's plan to deploy military doctors to fill the gaps left by the strikers. They differed on the specifics. The unfortunate truth was that they did not have enough men to be everywhere at once. A single strategy would have to be chosen.\n\n"Deploying the bulk of the doctors to the 20 de November Hospital will be the most effective strategy." The gaunt ISSTE director explained to the president. "The Hospital is a symbol of the movement and it has served as an incubator of unrest ever since. Forcibly restoring services there during the strike will be a major blow to the dissidents."\n\n"On the other hand," began the steely-haired IMSS man, "Focusing too much on one hospital means leaving the rest out to dry. Spreading the military doctors more evenly throughout the nation would bleed support for the AMM outside of the Federal District, and give us an opportunity to contain the movement in the capital.""
MEX_Ordaz_DS.19.a: ""Deploy the doctors to the 20 de November Hospital.""
MEX_Ordaz_DS.19.b: ""Send doctors to every hospital participating in the strike.""

MEX_Ordaz_DS.20.t: "Local Therapy"
MEX_Ordaz_DS.20.desc: "Dr. Jareño's heart pounded as the soldiers marched on the picket line outside the 20 de November Hospital. His hands clutched the pole of the banner tighter as he came face to face with one of the uniformed goons. The soldier tore the banner from his hands before delivering a brutal left hook, sending the doctor stumbling to the ground.\n\nAfter a time, he stood and massaged his head. The soldiers had already battered their way through the crowd, and had entered the building. It didn't take long for them to start dragging out the skeleton crew of doctors maintaining basic services. All the while, a growing crowd of reporters watched them like vultures circling a corpse.\n\nDr. Jareño did not attend the picket line the next day. He had no desire to risk his health and freedom marching brazenly in front of the army. On his way to the grocery store, he stopped to pick up today's paper from a stand. The front page of El Universal caught his eye immediately.\n\nTHE ARMY RESTORES MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE. Below the headline, a smiling soldier administered a syringe full of medication to a patient. The article went on and on, describing the heroic deeds of the soldiers, treating patients when doctors refused to. "Hey!" The woman running the stand knocked on the counter in front of the doctor. "Buy it or put it back.""
MEX_Ordaz_DS.20.a: "Dr. Jareño gave the woman a few pesos and disappeared down the street."

MEX_Ordaz_DS.21.t: "Convalescence"
MEX_Ordaz_DS.21.desc: "In Cuernavaca, a group of doctors huddled closer together as a small column of soldiers marched towards their demonstration. The military men were well armed, and wore deep scowls under their helmets. None of the doctors were keen to force a confrontation with them. When the order to disperse was given, the medical workers exchanged glances and complied.\n\nIn Puebla, an army medic ordered a young boy to roll up his sleeve. He examines the rash on his arm, circular and scaly. The boy tries to scratch at it, and the medic slaps his hand away. "Looks like ringworm to me, it's a pain in the-" The boy's mother glared at him. "It's not easy to get rid of."\n\nIn Leon, a lieutenant flipped through a filing cabinet of patient records. He was looking for the folder for one Mrs. Galvan. The looping scrawl of the doctor's handwriting was proving to be quite impenetrable.\n\nIn Oaxaca, a construction worker sits in a hospital lobby, trying to keep his arm still. The limb is swollen and tender, almost certainly broken. The minutes tick by. When Julio sprained his ankle on the job during the last work stoppage, he had to wait well over an hour to be seen. It only took twenty minutes until a man in an army uniform appeared from behind a door to invite him in for treatment."
MEX_Ordaz_DS.21.a: "Across the nation, the hospitals return to working order."
