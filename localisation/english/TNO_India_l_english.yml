 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC: "Born to a privileged family already involved in the independence struggle, Jawaharlal Nehru experienced India and its traditions almost as an outsider - after completing an English education at the heart of the British Empire and only then returning home. Nevertheless, participating in the Congress' independence struggle at the right-hand side of the Mahatma himself brought him popular support and leadership positions - so that when the British Raj finally collapsed ignominiously in 1943 he was right there to take up the reins.\n\nBut this leadership was not only his own. Caught between an expansionist Afghanistan in the west, the Japanese threat encroaching in from the east, and the princes at home jockeying for separate independence, Nehru chose instead to compromise his own power for the sake of the nation, inviting Subhas Bose and the INA to form a joint government for the sake of maintaining India's territorial sanctity. An alliance that would not last, and with the failures of the war against Afghanistan the only other option was to cut off his erstwhile friend and ally and watch as he escaped to the East, forming a bitter rival government in Calcutta.\n\nNow only governing half a country, Nehru nevertheless sought to build the India of his and the rest of Congress' vision - a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic free from the authoritarianism that plagued other postcolonial states. For two decades he laboured as Prime Minister in this endeavour - but now it seems his time is coming to a close. Perhaps he will not be able to settle things and see a united India in his own lifetime. But his legacy - for India's sake - must persevere."
 POLITICS_MORARJI_DESAI_DESC: "Morarji Desai's political life began with activism. Together with Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and countless others, Desai joined the Swaraj movement against the British, landing him in jail for several years. His spirit and leadership during this time earned him much acclaim, which would only grow further during the Second War of Independence. Desai was responsible for the ceasefire agreement that ended the fighting and established lasting peace. In the old days of the united Indian National Congress, Morarji Desai stood as one of its most prominent and formidable members. Although often at odds with Prime Minister Nehru due to their differing views, many considered Desai to his natural successor. Had the party stayed together after Nehru's death, he might indeed have taken over leadership. That day never came though, and so Desai founded his own, conservative party in the wake of Congress' collapse. Already popular, Desai attracted most of the conservatives of the old INC to his Janata Party, forging it into the definitive organization of the Indian center-right.\n\nDesai himself is regarded as somewhat of a moral crusader, as well as somewhat religious and somewhat nationalistic man which has certainly flavoured his political career. It is however his moderate, anti-Hindutva, and secular nature that has won him his popularity and success as a politician and party leader. Desai is also openly opposed to independence for Indian Muslims, instead believing that the issues in the region can be better solved if they were to stay part of India. Like all those involved in politics, Morarji Desai is a complex figure. He is both a strict religious moralist and a secular, moderate conservative. It is perhaps because of this blend that he was able to lead a party and now an entire nation. Desai has served India in many ways prior, but now he will guide it by his own hand."
 POLITICS_CHAKRAVARTI_RAJAGOPALACHARI_DESC: "From a western outlook, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's policy and beliefs are nearly as complex as his name. He is simultaneously socially liberal and conservative, both supporting free trade and the status quo, and at the same time saying that India must change and that India is perfect. However, Rajagopalachari follows an ideology which has died out in the aftermath of the Second World War; classical liberalism. Considered relevant in only a few countries, Rajagopalachari's belief in this system is enough to show that he is an elder statesman.\n\nRajagopalachari fought peacefully alongside many others for India's independence from Britain. However, while many others supported and even endorsed socialism, he saw that the restriction of the market was nearly, if not equally as terrible as the fascist restriction of rights. Nonetheless, as the fight for Indian independence devolved into a war for it, and, from there, a brother war. Rajagopalachari knew that Nehru's propaganda about Bose's desire to exterminate all followers of peace was a total fabrication. Nonetheless, he saw Nehru as far more approachable from an economic standpoint than Bose, and sided with him over a dyed-in-the-wool socialist.\n\nAfter the war, Rajagopalachari found himself on the conservative wing of Congress, alongside such minds as Morarji Desai. While the two were on the same side, they could hardly be considered allies, and their distrust was mutual; Rajagopalachari saw Desai as too extreme, and Desai saw Rajagopalachari as too moderate. Despite this, the two fought together as a bulwark against socialism. Now, however, Rajagopalachari has won, with his newfound Swatantra Party. In a nation filled with socialists, though, it will be difficult for him to hold the line."
 POLITICS_JB_KRIPALANI_DESC: "Jivatram Bhagwandas Kripalani has seen much in his great, long life. For five decades, he has been deeply involved with Indian politics, from colonial rule to independence and the years after. In his early years, Kripalani joined up with the growing independence movement following the return of the Mahatma from South Africa. During the early 1920s, Kriplani worked as a lecturer of history and English while serving as part of the non-cooperation movement. He would become a close adherent of the Mahatma, and was given the task of spreading his teachings to other parts of India. Later on, he would be on several occasions arrested for more direct actions against colonial rule, including organising protests and for distributing anti-British material. Kripalani would be invloved in the top affairs of Congress througout the late 1920s and into the next decade. By this point, Kripalani had also turned to be a firm adherent of Gandhian ideals, particularly those relating to socialism.\n\nWhile independence did finally come to India, the nation was quickly split in two by war between the Nehru's Republic and Bose's Free India.\n\nKriplani, saw the way to victory in the elections through cooperation with other prominent socialists, which would indeed prove to be successful in the elections. Kripalani is now leader of the Republic of India, committed to the principles of Gandhian Socialism, light agrarianism and resistance against Japan. Yet there is much work for him to do to secure his position - winning an election means when there is always someone to take your place by any means necessary."

 ### Ideas ###
 IND_Looming_Communal_Problem: "Looming Communal Problem"
 IND_Looming_Communal_Problem_desc: "The incomplete Afghan War and failure of the government to address the Pakistan Movement have left millions of people across regions of both Muslim majority and minority uncertain about their security and livelihood. With the death of Gandhi the last resort has been lost - should communal violence break out again it will be bloodier and more uncontrollable than ever before."
 IND_Neverending_Security_Budget: "Neverending Security Budget"
 IND_Neverending_Security_Budget_desc: "The possibility of war with the East has forced the government to divert a considerable amount of the budget for military purposes, hamstringing vital and dearly needed social programs and subsidies. Until a permanent solution for this can be found we will not be able to significantly improve material conditions among the people."
 IND_Third_Five_Year_Plan: "Third Five Year Plan"
 IND_Third_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The Third Five-Year Plan continues the focus on electrification, rapid industrialization and agricultural investments from the previous Plan, but with a much greater emphasis on the development of a domestic military-industrial base."
