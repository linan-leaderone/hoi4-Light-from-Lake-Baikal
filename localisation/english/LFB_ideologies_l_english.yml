socialist_anti_japanese_united_front_subtype_noun:0 "Anti-Japanese National United Front"
socialist_anti_japanese_united_front_subtype_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, rather than viewing the United Front as an ideology, it should be seen as a broad alliance encompassing various social classes. The Anti-Japanese United Front was a strategy adopted by the Chinese Communist Party during the Second United Front with the Kuomintang. Similar to the Popular Fronts in Spain and France at the time, the Anti-Japanese United Front aimed to unite the majority of 'progressive' forces against the far-right. Under the banner of the United Front, the Communist Party temporarily set aside radical slogans and programs, instead defending 'democracy and freedom' and 'national independence'—slogans that were quite progressive in China at the time. The United Front did not imply unconditional compromise and concession; the Communist Party prioritized uniting the centrists and 'progressives' while isolating the hardliners and capitulationists. In the short term, this strategy undoubtedly ensured that all of China's anti-Japanese forces could unite to resist the greater threat.\nHowever, contradictions always lurk and grow within this cross-class alliance. Landlords continue to demand higher rents, and capitalists will not tolerate the escalating labor movements indefinitely. For the Communist Party, 'class harmony' is merely a temporary expedient; they ultimately aim to further their goal of transforming society on behalf of the workers. The atrocities of Japanese imperialism brought this alliance together, but once the enemy disappears, or the ideal of national independence fades, this alliance will inevitably teeter and collapse..."

communist_liuism_subtype_desc:0 "£gezifu £gezifu New Democracy is often considered a part of Mao Zedong Thought—in backward countries, the national bourgeoisie is often weak, constrained by imperialist competition and deeply entrenched feudal forces, and unable to bear the historical burden. Therefore, the organized proletariat must take up the banner of achieving independence and democracy, and only by replacing the bourgeoisie in transforming the country can the historical conditions for socialism be created.\n\n£gezifu £gezifu After its creator Mao Zedong's unexpected death, 'New Democracy' was gradually assigned meanings beyond what its originator envisioned, inevitably causing confusion and division—some believe that 'New Democracy' shares a similar core with Bukharinism, encouraging the development of the commodity economy within the political framework of the proletarian dictatorship; others argue that 'New Democracy' is somewhat inferior to Bukharinism, as its essence remains that of a 'bourgeois revolution,' thus advocating for a thorough alliance with the national bourgeoisie, with some even going so far as to proclaim 'exploitation is meritorious.'\n\n£gezifu £gezifu However, regardless of the severity of the internal party disagreements, all CCP members are reminded—'achieving New Democracy is the Party's primary mission at this stage.' And 'fighting for national liberation under the banner of New Democracy' has long become the CCP's most prominent post-war slogan."
