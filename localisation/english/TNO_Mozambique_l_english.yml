 GAZ.2.t: "Report on Recent Violence in Mozambique"
 GAZ.2.desc: "Situation report: Armed conflict in Mozambique.\n\nIt would seem as though not all of Africa has had its fill of violence. In the Mozambique region, the recently established state has collapsed into a state of civil war, with two broad factions known to us at this time. The first is led by Samora Machel, a local socialist leader who supposedly won the Mozambican elections over his non-socialist rivals. This claim has been disputed by his opposition, and the resulting destabilization of the region has transformed into an armed conflict. The Japanese, naturally, threw their weight behind Machel, as have several other nearby governments, no doubt expecting his administration to favor them in return for their support.\n\nThe future of American interests in Mozambique, and Africa as a whole, depends on our ability to knock down Machel's regime. The opposition in this case however, is not necessarily ideal. Eduardo Mondlane is an extreme figure, to say the least, with ideas that are not exactly conducive to the future of democracy in Mozambique. What's more is that Mondlane is a firm isolationist, opposed to the idea of any more interference in Mozambique by foreign powers. Even if we can topple Machel's regime, the United States will not benefit directly from Mondlane's victory in terms of trade or diplomacy.\n\nThere is, of course, a second option to consider. Within Mondlane's camp there is another figure who may be more amenable to future cooperation with the United States. Uria Simango is the resident moderate in Mondlane's party, someone who the idealists in government and our population will be more comfortable with supporting. More critically, a Simango regime would be more open to the idea of economic and diplomatic ties going forward. However, Simango has discounted the idea of making a move without our support, and if we were to aid him, Mondlane wouldn't just stand aside and allow Simango to take the lead. Mondlane and Simango would be stronger as a united front, and we need to consider our priorities before making a decision."
 GAZ.2.a: "Whatever keeps Japan out of Africa is a victory for America."
 GAZ.2.b: "We can't invest in this without an eventual return."

 GAZ.3.t: "Smoke Above the Shore"
 GAZ.3.desc: "Samora Machel sat atop a short hill above the ocean harbor, smoking a cigar. It was a welcome reprieve from countless hours spent shooting the colonists, scheming with rivals, and corralling teenage recruits. As his men prepared the welcome party behind them, Machel looked out at the sea. Its sky was filled with birds, not with smoke, its water filled with fish, not with blood, and it was lit only by the tropical sun, not the glow of burning villages. This was the Mozambique of the future, clean, beautiful, and above all peaceful.\n\nBut the Mozambique of the present was still broken, hollowed by starvation and still stinking with the rotting bodies the Germans left behind. Neither Simango's naive enthusiasm nor Mondlane's cynical insularity could be the country's salvation, for no man lives alone. No country, least of all Mozambique, could ever be fully independent from its neighbors. Lofty ideals mean little when democracy shatters in the slightest crisis or when the mere threat of embargo would wrap puppet strings around Mozambique's neck. Cynical hermeticism has no purpose if it crushes hope for development or leaves Mozambique defenseless against outsiders. No, the current struggle was no longer working to liberate Mozambique, it had morphed into a holy war of ideology, serving the egos of zealous strongmen rather than the construction of a proud country.\n\nMachel had no love for colonists, the very fact that he would fight alongside them filled him with disgust. But only with the aid of colonists could Mozambique ever become strong enough to survive. His soldiers were quick to notice the grey silhouette cresting over the horizon, and hurried to complete their preparations. The Japanese barge billowed smoke into the sky, bringing with it both the instruments of unification and the agents who sought to exploit it. Machel dropped his cigar on the ground, adjusted his hat, and approached the harbor."
 GAZ.3.a: "For Mozambique to be free, it must first be whole."

 GAZ.4.t: "In and Out"
 GAZ.4.desc: "The dark of the night was turning grey as dawn approached. In the plains outside of Quelimane, the last unit of American combat advisors awaited their departure from the country. It was a sudden thing, for this particular unit who had the pleasure of being the last ones to depart the country in the wake of their victory over the socialists and Japanese. Wine and joy flowed through the streets of the Mozambican capital for an entire night. And then the orders came through, loud and clear. Mondlane was in control of the country, the American soldiers were to be thanked for their service and ushered out of the country within the next five days. That would be the end of that.\n\n"Guarding" the Americans were a detachment of the Mozambican Armed Forces whom they had been fighting alongside in recent memory. How had this country gone from grateful to cold and suspicious practically overnight? The streets that once shouted and cheered in celebration were dead silent at their departure, and soldiers they had exchanged stories and cigarettes with while routing the reds and their friends were stony silent the whole way here.\n\nHeads turned at the first noise the Mozambican troops made. It was a song, thickly accented and impressive, given how only a fraction of the troop actually even spoke English.\n\n"Over there!" The Mozambican soldiers didn't break formation, their shoulders didn't even slump as they broke into an imitation of that old familiar song. "Over there! Send the word, send the word, over there!"\n\nThe noise drowned out the fits of laughter that the Americans broke into when hearing the song sang back at them from their friends and former allies. The laughter rose to challenge the song itself as the altered lyrics became apparent. "That the Yanks are going! The Yanks are going! Their drums drum-drumming nowhere!"\n\nThe sound of helicopter blades were heard in the distance, so the Mozambican men just had to up their own volume as they "So prepare, say a prayer! Send the word, send the word, to well their fare! They'll be over, they're going over, and now that it's done, they'll go over there!"\n\nEven as those last fateful boots clambered into the helicopter, the laughter did not stop, only spreading to the Mozambican soldiers as they waved goodbye to their comrades-in-arms for the last time."
 GAZ.4.a: "Thus ends our story in Mozambique."

 GAZ.5.t: "To Home in Defeat"
 GAZ.5.desc: ""We've got three hours! Everyone load up!"\n\nThe ports were swarming with people as the Japanese military wrapped up their final departure from Mozambique. Rikiya couldn't help but feel bitter as he worked alongside his comrades in loading the last of the crates, weapons, and equipment on the ships to return to the homeland in defeat.\n\nMondlane was going to win. Everyone knew this now, and the decision had been made to pull out as a result. There wasn't a point in sacrificing more lives for a lost cause, but making the decision to end this liberation campaign didn't sit right with him, nor his friends. Yet they had their orders.\n\nAll because of the Americans. The fucking Americans.\n\nEvery time, they couldn't help but stick their fingers in every minor conflict they could exploit. If there was the slightest chance they could interfere with Japan they would do it, no matter if it was in Africa, or Japan's backyard. Rikiya was certain that if Mondlane hadn't been propped up by his American masters, they would have easily won.\n\nUnfortunately, they could do nothing now.\n\n"Chin up," his friend Senzo said, carrying a box onto the ship. "We gave them a good beating. We'll get them next time. Besides, I think Mondlane is going to regret making his deal with the devil soon."\n\nRikiya grunted, but he joined his friend as the last of the Japanese forces boarded the ships. As he watched the Mozambican coast fade from sight, he shook his head and turned away. If Mozambique wanted to be an American puppet, then so be it. They'd regret it sooner or later."
 GAZ.5.a: "They always did."

 GAZ.6.t: "Clarity of Hindsight"
 GAZ.6.desc: "War was a funny thing, which was a mixture of revelation, hindsight, and regret which fed into the next iteration of strategies and decisions.\n\nNo plan survived contact with the enemy, and that applied as much to strategy, as it did to the battlefield. The web of factors influencing the decision of who to support in certain conflicts, including morale, economy, leadership, and policy, could be deceptive.\n\nSometimes, those who were assumed to be the strongest crumbled when put to the test, and those believed to have little to no chance succeeded against all odds. Captain Matthew felt this was especially prudent today. He hadn't been responsible for deciding who the United States would back in this conflict - but based on the initial assessments, Simango had been the right choice at the time.\n\nHow could they have known that Mondlane would prove more resilient and effective than anyone could have guessed?\n\nSure, there'd been a potential path to victory, but he didn't really blame the decision to pass on Mondlane. The United States couldn't take chances on a whim, although in this case, it was clear they should have.\n\nObviously, with the benefit of hindsight, Matthew felt they should have been a bit more bullish on supporting Mondlane, but it was rather pointless to think so now. They'd lost here, but at least the Japanese had lost as well. A draw was something he could live with, and as for the future of Mozambique...\n\nHe didn't know, that was for the State Department to work out. As he watched the last of the American soldiers load up, preparing to depart this country for good, he did hope that Mondlane would do well by his people. He'd won, now he would have to lead."
 GAZ.6.a: "And they'd soon see how well he'd succeed."

 GAZ.7.t: "Acceptable Defeats"
 GAZ.7.desc: "Officer Sakiyama placed defeats into several categories: acceptable, damaging, and catastrophic.\n\nThankfully, he had yet to take part in any catastrophic operations - though he certainly had his share of defeats. What mattered in a defeat was to mitigate losses, extract a heavy toll from the enemy, and limit the geopolitical impact to Japan.\n\nWhen it came to the Mozambique campaign, he felt comfortable putting it in the 'acceptable' category. It certainly wasn't ideal, and it was unquestionably a defeat - but all things considered, it could have been worse. Few, if any, had believed that Mondlane would have been able to succeed in the manner that he did.\n\nWhen the United States had declined to back him, it was expected he would have lost early on. Yet he hadn't only surpassed Japanese expectations, but almost certainly American ones. Sakiyama wondered if the Americans regretted 'backing the wrong horse' as they'd say, but he was glad they had.\n\nWhile Mozambique would not be an ally, the Americans were similarly denied a prize from this outcome. Thus, Japan's geopolitical position was largely unchanged, which was the best that could be hoped for in this situation. The few remaining Japanese soldiers in Mozambique were now finally loading up, and they'd leave within hours.\n\nPerhaps Japan would find a way to work with Mondlane, but that was a job for someone else to figure out. He had a withdrawal to complete, and when they returned to the Home Isles, they would wait to be deployed to the next front.\n\nThe work was never done, and he looked forward to their next campaigns being victories."
 GAZ.7.a: "For defeat could not become systemic."

 GAZ.8.t: "We're Here Now"
 GAZ.8.desc: "It was dawn in Quelimane, and it was all over the papers. Machel and Mondlane were gone, the last opposition holdouts in Mozambique had been secured by American and Simango-loyal forces. It was over, it was done. Mozambique was free and united again. Rebuilding could begin soon, but first, celebrations had to be completed, and completed they would be. Throughout the streets of Quelimane, Matola, and Maputo American GIs and Mozambican soldiers engaged in every kind of revelry. Liquor, dancing and other sorts of joy flowed through the streets as the news made its way north, south, east and west.\n\nFor Max and his unit, the revelry would have to wait though. He'd heard of the half-maddened celebrations from second and third hand sources, but for himself and his men, it was time to maintain the borders. They were embedded with a unit of Mozambican soldiers, who no doubt were hearing the same tales of liquor and love from the city-bound soldiers. Instead, they found themselves staring across the border at neighboring Tanganyika, a nearby socialist nation who had supported Machel's regime during the war.\n\n"Do you think they care so much?" Hamza asked, cradling his ancient rifle against his shoulder as he stared out over the border. Over where the border was theoretically, anyways. These things were still not entirely solidified since the krauts' collapse, after all.\n\n"I wouldn't." Max muttered between pulls of his cigarette, a light smirk on his face. "No offense, but as far as countries go, it isn't much to lose sleep over." He nudged his friend with an elbow, eliciting a chuckle out of both men.\n\n"Ah you say that..." Hamza fumbled as he went to light his own cigarette. "But it is home all the same. And besides..." He offered a knowing, smart-ass glance towards Max. "How far did you come to fight for it?"\n\n"Ah..." Max groaned as he leaned back on a hand, his own gun nested on his lap. "Too far. And too long. And it ain't going to be a while before we leave, according to sarge."\n\n"All for the better, I suppose. Simango must know what he's doing, at any rate." Hamza gave a shrug, looking over towards the sun with a wide grin. "Besides. That means we'll have much more time to mess with you Yanks.""
 GAZ.8.a: "We're here, and we're not leaving."

 GAZ.9.t: "Mozambique CW results"
 GAZ.9.desc: "Simango & US win, Japan lost"
 GAZ.9.a: "Ok"

 GAZ.10.t: "The Doorway to Africa"
 GAZ.10.desc: "The Japanese delegation arrived in Quelimane - formerly known as Bouhlerstadt - late at night, and quite frankly, they had no idea what to expect from the war-torn nation's capital at this time. News had broken not even twenty-four hours before, and clearly, the celebrations were still young as they stepped out onto the city streets. Drink and drunkard flowed in the streets freely, and the national flag of Mozambique and various red flags flew side by side from the windows of the houses on either side of the street. It was obvious they had heard of the rebels' final defeat not long after the Japanese themselves had, maybe even before.\n\nThe delegation was due to meet the leader- now the sole one- of Mozambique, Samora Machel, within the hour. They had tried to arrive at the meeting spot before he could, but as their vehicle pulled up to the small, clearly under-repaired building that acted as the government's administrative offices, they spotted the unmistakable image of bodyguards flanking the doorway. It seemed as though they'd be getting underway sooner than later.\n\nDespite the exterior damage, the interior of the building was rather sound. The walls were lined with the flag of Mozambique and of Japan as well- a nice touch, if an obvious bit of flattery. With both their own as well as the Gaza bodyguards flanking them, the delegation- a total of three men strong- were moved down the hallway with a measured kind of speed, towards the largest office in the back. Spartan compared to the hallway they had come in from, the delegation offered respectful bows to the man behind his desk, who stood up to reciprocate in kind. The unquestioned ruler of Mozambique, Samora Machel.\n\nWith hands spread outwards, his smile was wide and genuine as he bid the men to sit across from him. "Gentlemen." He began, eyes glancing towards his Japanese counterparts. "We have history to make.""
 GAZ.10.a: "We look forward to working with you."

 GAZ.11.t: "The Sting of Defeat"
 GAZ.11.desc: "Jack had been in the Army for almost a decade, but he never expected to find himself fighting in Mozambique. He had signed up to serve his country, but he never thought that would mean he would be sent to a foreign land to fight a war that wasn't his own. Being in Mozambique for three months, seeing things that he never thought he would see, and now he had to leave the country. It was really sudden for Jack who had to leave the country just a few months after he came. Apparently the leader backed by the Americans lost and now the country is ruled by some general called Samora Machel, not that Jack cared for the names of the leaders involved in this war. During his short deployment he barely even saw a Mozambican soldier and all he did was shoot at Japanese soldiers. He knew nothing of the country and he would leave it having learned nothing.\n\nEven then, Jack couldn't help but feel the sting of defeat as he worked alongside his friends in loading the last of the crates, weapons, and equipment on the planes. Yes, maybe Mozambique was already a lost cause before the moment he landed, but at least we could have tried to win. The top brass could have pulled their weight around and sent more equipment or more boots on the ground. Instead, Jack lost friends and comrades in arms who gave their lives for a cause they believed in.\n\nThe final cargo to be loaded on the plane were several coffins covered with the Stars and Stripes. Inside were Jack's friends that would never see the end of the war. The generals and the politicians, all made promises of victory and success to them, and that was the result. All that was waiting for Jack back in the States were broken families and the realization that America failed its people once again."
 GAZ.11.a: "Another African military adventure turned sour."

 GAZ.13.t: "The Hero of Mozambique"
 GAZ.13.desc: "The captain had nearly missed the 'airstrip' ahead of him. It was but an unpaved path, surrounded by little but sand and dust. The plane shuddered as it landed on the uneven ground, coming to a halt beside the bombed out husk of a German hotel. Ambassador Willard De Pree shielded his eyes as he stepped into the blazing sun, and watched a rust-coated truck draw closer and closer, until it stopped not ten feet behind him. Out stepped the president of the Mozambique Liberation Front, a man whose name was synonymous with freedom in every Mozambican city-Eduardo Mondlane. His almost paternal appearance, a large balding middle-aged man wearing a tailored suit, was not reflected in his demeanor. De Pree met a dull stare practically devoid of emotion. Mondlane's greeting was curt and detached. "Welcome to Xai-Xai, ambassador."\n\n"Glad to be here Mr. President."\n\n"How much fuel did you bring?"\n\n"800 gallons diesel and an additional 100 gallons of kerosene, as requested."\n\n"The munitions?"\n\n"5,000 rifles, 120 rounds each. As many steel helmets and pairs of boots."\n\n"Medical supplies?"\n\nThe meeting lasted for only a few minutes, concerned only with verifying the delivery and exchanging classified documents. There would be no negotiations today. De Pree could only hope that today's collaboration would help develop a rapprochement between or at the very least keep the Tokumusoukan out of Africa. On that, he and Mondlane could both agree."
 GAZ.13.a: "The Hero of Mozambique has little patience for imperialist scheming."

 GAZ.14.t: "Dreams of an Idealist"
 GAZ.14.desc: "Uria Simango sat at his desk, looking over a security report. Six additional rifles had gone missing, presumed to have been smuggled out for sale on the black market. Luckily, Mondlane's men still hadn't caught on. Just beneath his floorboards lay a growing stash of weapons, ammunition, drugs, and assorted equipment, with any luck the beginning of an armory for the free and democratic Mozambique.\n\nHis phone rang, and he all but leapt to pick it up. "Uria Simango speaking!"\n\n"Mr. Simango, this is Douglas Fisher with Cape Mining. Did you receive our advance confirmation letter?"\n\n"Y-yes sir, I did!" Simango tried to remain calm. Excitement would sound suspicious. "Um, regarding the shipment..."\n\n"The package you ordered will arrive tomorrow morning between 4:am and 6:am local time. Thank you for your business..."\n\n"Excuse me, I-"\n\n"if you have any additional inquiries, please contact our office." *click*\n\nSimango couldn't help but wonder if all of this secrecy was necessary. Did Mondlane even have the means to monitor his conversations? But...by God, what would happen if he could? Who was to say the Americans weren't going to bug his office themselves? Simango's head was starting to feel light, and he realized just how much his hands were trembling."
 GAZ.14.a: "A patriot or a turncoat?"

 GAZ.20.t: "Kyōfu"
 GAZ.20.desc: "After another triumphant day in battle fighting to assist Samora Machel's gallant fighters in the Mozambican Civil War, a Japanese battalion accompanied by a guide native to the area went out on a routine patrol after some hours socializing, learning the local language from the guide and teaching him useful Japanese words such as "dōzo", "arigatō", and "konbanwa". None of them could have expected to see what they were to see that day.\n\nAll of a sudden they happened upon a ruined structure in a field. The guide went forward with a sergeant to scout it out; within twenty minutes they came back half-running, pale and shaking with fear. When asked what was up, the two of them shook their heads violently, refusing to say anything. At last the commanding officer ordered his troops to enter the structure, and was horrified by what he and his men saw. Broken implements of torture littered the ground. Bloody stains painted the walls a filthy brown.\n\nThe guide at last spoke, stammering out that the group had happened upon the ruins of one of Hüttig's extermination camps. As the guide made the horrible revelation, the soldiers went from muttering "chikushō" and "kuso" under their breath to openly crying out to the Amida Buddha and the kami of the region for mercy. It was in this state of abject fear and misery that the commander, his soldiers, and the guide ran fleeing back to their barracks.\n\nThe incident was reported through the usual channels, and a large X was drawn over the area in a map, with a note: "Avoid if you value your sanity." Some time later, a stray bomb blew the ruins up."
 GAZ.20.a: "But it was not enough to remove the trauma that the men felt."
