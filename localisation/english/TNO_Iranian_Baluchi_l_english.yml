 ## Leader Descs  ##
 POLITICS_SHER_MOHAMMED_MARRI_DESC: "Sher Mohammed is a Marri chief of Baluchistan. As leader of the Baluchi Liberation Front, he has pioneered guerrilla warfare against all those who would encroach on the independence of the Baluch. A proud Sunni people in a nation of Shia, with their own language, culture and tradition, the millions of Baluchi have long been ruled by people who do not understand them. To this nationalist motivation Sher Mohammed adds a Marxist interpretation, seeing his people's struggle as yet another in the eternal fight against the oppressor.\n\nPerhaps their fight is doomed to failure from the beginning. The enemy has overwhelming superiority in both men and arms. It matters not. They will pay with blood for every inch of these mountains."
