 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_NORODOM_SIHANOUK_DESC: "Norodom Sihanouk, the old king of Cambodia, has ruled as king since 1941 while Cambodia remained under French colonial rule. He would declare Cambodia's independence under pressure from the Japanese, assuming the position of prime minister while also ruling as king. In 1955, Sihanouk would surprise everyone with his sudden abdication of the throne, ostensibly to avoid the "intrigues" of palace life. As an "ordinary citizen," he would retain the deference he had as king while also being free to enter civilian politics.\n\nA ruthless man, since his abdication Sihanouk has single-handedly dominated Cambodia's fledgling democracy. He achieves this through the Sangkum, his massive organization which is effectively destined to control the entirety of the National Assembly.\n\nRuthless in his civilian politics, he likewise chokes out dissent, persisting in the form of the rebellious Khmer Serei and the ICP. While both groups actively threaten Sihanouk's nation-building project, demonstrations against his governance likewise grow increasingly common. It's becoming clear that Sihanouk alone can't solve the woes of Cambodia, squished between Vietnam, Japan, and Thailand."
 POLITICS_NORODOM_SIHANOUK_PERSONALIST_DESC: "Norodom Sihanouk is a ruthless man, and since his abdication in 1955 the old king has single-handedly dominated Cambodia's fledgling democracy. He achieves this through the Sangkum, his massive organization which is effectively destined to control the entirety of the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, while before he was content to merely dominate the system and slowly choke dissent against his rule, it is clear to Sihanouk that enough is enough. After the failed Tokyo Plot against him, led by some of his closest allies in the Sangkum such as In Tam and Lon Nol, the old king has chosen a new path.\n\nHe has chosen to consolidate much of the power of the organization within himself, seeing as he is the sole individual able to keep Cambodia stable and safe in the face of the ever-growing threat of rebellion within Cambodia. Whether insurrection springs from the republicans within the Khmer Serei, or from the communist radicals of the ICP, Norodom Sihanouk shall prevail."
 POLITICS_LON_NOL_DESC: "Born the son of a renowned and affluent "peacekeeper," Lon Nol spent much of his youth in comfort despite the instability of his nation. As a young man, the general would eagerly join the military and proved himself competent in the family tradition by faithfully protecting French hegemony over the nation against revolt.\n\nAfter the Japanese "liberation," Lon Nol took the position of Supreme Commander of the army in support of the monarch, initially confident that Sihanouk had the foresight and competence to maintain the traditional values of the nation. He continued his survival by crushing growing protests from the left, while the monarch's inaction wore down confidence. Sihanouk's mission to Japan was the final straw to convince the general that Sihanouk had failed and his own influence would be needed.\n\nStanding as Supreme Commander of both the armed forces and the nation, Lon Nol relies on the Japanese military, and his own massive army, to maintain order in the nation. But as the general's iron grip over the nation grows tighter every day, previously peaceful groups turn to increasingly radical methods of resistance, and former enemies scheme together in the shadows. To survive the chaos, Lon Nol must choke the fledgling sparks of resistance while still young, lest Khmer be consumed by the flames of revolution."
 POLITICS_SON_NGOC_THANH_DESC: "The Two-Decade Revolutionary marched into Phnom Penh with the largest smile he's ever had on his face. Once, he was the Kingdom of Kampuchea's most hated man, the nationalist and anti-monarchist leader of the fledgling Khmer Serei militia. For years he dodged royal bullets and artillery shells in the forests along the Cambodian border provinces. Now he marches into Phnom Penh, taking Sihanouk's throne and smashing it into a thousand pieces.\n\nSon Ngoc Thanh, Pan-Asian Hero of Liberation, has achieved his greatest dream: the Khmer Republic, on his own terms. Neither Sihanouk's monarchy or Lon Nol's petty authoritarianism can interfere with his vision. Yet liberating the Republic was only part of the struggle. Now Son fights to maintain the Republic against its greatest threat. Communists still lurk in the shadows of Cambodia, their foreign masters pulling their strings and urging them towards destructive dissent. For the continued independence of the Khmer Republic, Son must be strong and unwavering. He must defend the republic against the communization of Cambodia, by any means necessary."
 POLITICS_TOU_SAMOUTH_DESC: "Before he was a revolutionary, Tou Samouth was a teacher of Pali at a monastery near the Royal Palace. This quiet life as a monk and teacher was thrown into disarray by Operation Issara, when Thai soldiers marched into Cambodia and drove Samouth into the countryside. In his flight from Phnom Penh he found shelter with the Viet Minh, and he repaid their kindness by teaching Khmer recruits Marxist economics and political thought.\n\nAs Issara raged, Samouth deepened his commitment to the Indochinese Communist Party, forging links with a fellow Buddhist and socialist: Son Ngoc Minh. The two would later go on to establish a small communist force in Issara's closing years, though even at its strongest it held less relevance than the Khmer Serei. That force would later become known as the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Vietnam, formed by Tou's old comrades in the Viet Minh, opened the door for Kampuchea's salvation. With popular discontent for Lon Nol's junta soaring, Samouth led a popular front against the regime, which captured Phnom Penh and sent the Marshal running. Samouth now stands not only as the leader of the KPRP's moderates, but as helmsman of the new Kampuchean state, and he will follow the red star into a brighter future for all Indochina."
 POLITICS_IN_TAM_DESC: "It helps that, in addition to his other merits, In Tam - now President of the fledgling, democratic, Khmer Republic - is a dogged, determined survivor. But In Tam knows better than to rest on his laurels or even congratulate himself. Every trial that has confronted him on the journey to where he is now could have destroyed him; he knows better than to say that he survived it just because he was In Tam.\n\nBut the wars, for instance, could have left him a corpse like so many other Khmer. After that, In Tam could have been corrupted; that betrayer Lon Nol could well have destroyed or suborned him before he threw his lot in with Sisowath Sirik Matak and Son Ngoc Thanh. But somehow that was not how that played out. Instead, he was freed to become what others call a 'cornerstone' of the Khmer Serei resistance against the new dictatorship - though In Tam would never dare suggest such a thing.\n\nBut now the Krom Pracheathibateyy, Democratic Party - a revival of the old name and tradition dating back to before the Sangkum - has arrived in power, under his leadership. Democratic ideals will be restored and enshrined in the newly-born Republic of Cambodia. In Tam is not enough of a braggart to tell anyone this (though Son Ngoc Thanh and In Tam's other party cadres might say it for him), but his modesty, incorruptibility, and the love the agrarian populace of Cambodia hold him in will all combine to make that much easier."
 POLITICS_SISOWATH_SIRIK_MATAK_DESC: "Who would have expected that amid the figureheads of the host of people opposed to the now-toppled Cambodian despotism, one would find a prince of the blood, a great-grandson of King Sisowath? Even President - Prince, too, though he would rather you not call him that - Sisowath Sirik Matak is surprised at the way things have played out sometimes.\n\nAfter Lon Nol, betraying the Republican movement, declared a coup and proclaimed himself for the monarchy, Sirik Matak declared himself an opponent of his government. Yet even before then Sirik Matak had not tolerated the autocratic, brutish tendencies of his kinsman the King Sihanouk.\n\nAs the madness worsened, the Khmer Serei gained allies. Son Ngoc Thanh and In Tam joined efforts with Sirik Matak and the three men planned for a Republic free from the communist threat and with a free market in place of the inefficient corporatist structure set up by Sihanouk and Lon Nol.\n\nWhen Son Ngoc Thanh resigned, Sirik Matak had not expected to win; however, that is exactly how it played out. The man who had held out under Lon Nol and Norodom Sihanouk when it seemed pointless got his chance after the Konabaksa Satharonarod - the Republican Party - defeated its opponent in an upset victory.\n\nBut by all that is sacred, the prince-turned-President swears that he will take this miraculous opportunity and use it well."
