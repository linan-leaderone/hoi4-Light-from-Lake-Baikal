### Leader Descriptions ###
TOM_Boris_Pasternak: "Boris Pasternak"
POLITICS_BORIS_PASTERNAK_DESC: "Boris Leonidovich Pasternak is not a politician by trade, but rather a poet and a scholar. A Muscovite of Jewish ancestry, he quickly became renowned in the early days of the Soviet Union for his collections of poetry and translations of English and German classics. However, his early admiration for Lenin soon wore out, and he found himself scrambling to try and get friends and colleagues off of blacklists and out of prisons. Pasternak, despite his reputation suffering, never saw official censure or persecution himself, as many within the Politburo and NKVD viewed him as too passive and detached from reality to pose a political threat. As the Germans marched closer to Moscow, Pasternak and the remnants of the Soviet intelligentsia fled to the east, with many taking refuge in the city of Tomsk. There, they decided to draft a liberal constitution inspired by the undying Russian democratic thought and pledged to restore the freedom of expression that they craved under Soviet rule. Their cause gave a birth to the Central Siberian Republic, which proved itself to be a worthy foe to the declining dictatorship of the Far Eastern Soviet state, but soon collapsed under its own weight, unable to cope with ambitions of their own generals.\n\nPasternak now rules a state dominated by intellectuals and artists, full of thinkers and poets. Although he and his colleagues give wonderful speeches, draft laws that are fascinating to read, and compose beautiful anthems, their only previous experience in holding office has been on university faculties. Whether Pasternak and his nation of dreamers will achieve anything or be content to sit in their ivory towers is a question that has yet to be fully determined."

TOM_Dmitry_Shostakovich: "Dmitry Shostakovich"
POLITICS_DMITRY_SHOSTAKOVICH_DESC: "As with all symphonies, the new life of Dmitry Dmitriyevich Shostakovich started with a single sound: the chime of a telegram. Punctuated with sudden stops, the little piece of paper brought to him brief but grim news: Leningrad had fallen to the hands of the Nazis. He was attending a recital in Tomsk, in honor of an old friend. With his home lost and with no transport westwards, Shostakovich became stuck in the city, earning his living as a composer of eccentric repute in the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nThus began the Larghissimo of Shostakovich's life. A slow and ponderous walk across the years of the Republic, with almost nothing notable occurring in-between. He turned to his work, composing pieces that subtly criticized the Republic, and integrated himself into the artistic scene of Tomsk. When he found himself at the forefront of the Humanist Association, he had reached the Andante of his movement: a stable, forward pace.\n\nHowever, such a steady tempo would not last forever. Rebellions shattered the old Republic, with Novosibirsk tearing itself away over the issue of conscription. It opened to a chaotic second act: the anarchists rose in Kansk, and the generals mutinied in Krasnoyarsk. The denouement rested in Tomsk, where the ideals of the Republic survived and thrived. The artistic movements of the city, now Salons, thrived.\n\nThe lands of Central Siberia are to witness a new play fold out. With his triumph in the elections of the Republic, Shostakovich now stands to conduct it. The world awaits to see if his victory is merely an overture or the end of a beautiful coda."

TOM_Daniil_Kharms: "Daniil Kharms"
POLITICS_DANIIL_KHARMS_DESC: "Daniil Kharms - originally Daniil Ivanovich Yuvachev, before embracing his pen name - is not the kind of man anyone envisioned leading a nation. A stalwart of the Leningrad avant-garde movement, Kharms achieved only limited local recognition in the interbellum years. Known primarily for his children's literature, Kharms also wrote an extensive corpus of absurdist work that found favor with dissidents and irritated the revolutionary establishment to no end. His career was cut short in 1941 by his arrest and commitment to a psychiatric institute in Leningrad. He might have died in the following siege, if not for a sympathetic guard's kindness. An absurd miracle, for a writer of the absurd.\n\nThat Kharms has fallen in with the Bastillards is a surprise only to those unfamiliar with his work. Through metaphor and various other literary devices, he has made clear his ideological peculiarities: the sublimation of coarse, unbidden desires, and the importance of remaining human in a world fallen to animalistic barbarity. Not the most orthodox of men to lead a law-and-order party, but who's to say what's 'orthodox' these days?"

TOM_Andrey_Sakharov: "Andrey Sakharov"
POLITICS_ANDREY_SAKHAROV_DESC: "A learned man once said: "The truth is never simple." That man, of course, was Andrey Dmitryevich Sakharov, a complex man for complicated times. Born into the intelligentsia, Sakharov found shelter from politics in the gilded cage of Soviet science. Keeping his head down and immersing himself in his chosen field, Sakharov survived, despite occasionally drawing the unwelcome attention of the authorities for outspoken remarks against Party-approved academia.\n\nSakharov managed to find his way eastwards after the collapse of Bolshevik authority, taking up residence in Tomsk. His technocratic, idealistic views brought him into the clique that would become known as the Modernists. Espousing a sincere belief in the power of science and technology to create the foundations of a better society, Andrey Sakharov embodies the idealism of Tomsk like no other."

TOM_Dmitry_Likhachyov: "Dmitry Likhachyov"
POLITICS_DMITRY_LIKHACHYOV_DESC: "Of all Russia's cultural heroes, the Decembrists could ask for none better than Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachyov. A true child of European Russia, Likhachyov's passion for literature became his career at the tender age of 16, when he entered Leningrad State University. Arrested by the secret police in 1928 for nothing more than alleged involvement in a literary group for students, he was exiled without trial to the Solovetsky Islands, where he would spend five years in a gulag. He narrowly avoided execution, and then nearly a decade later lived through the siege of Leningrad, being one of the lucky few to slip through German lines along with his family.\n\nResurfacing in Tomsk some time after the war, Likhachyov became a devoted friend and follower of Pasternak, and soon joined the Decembrists. With the old poet's passing, Likhachyov has become their de-facto leader. Espousing a truly European vision of Russia, proud of its heritage, history, and diversity, he would see Tomsk lead the Motherland into a golden age of peace, cultural growth, and friendship with the West."

TOM_Moisey_Vainberg: "Moisey Vainberg"
POLITICS_MOISEY_VAINBERG_DESC: "When Moisey Vainberg began his rise in the CSR's politics, many surmised that the Jewish composer from Warsaw would struggle to step out from his mentor Shostakovich's shadow. After all, the talented musician's work, too, had thus far failed to earn their own place, independent of Shostakovich's orbit. However, just as his works had acquired fans of their own, Vainberg's political ambitions earned the rising star of the Humanist Salon his own place in the limelight. A patient, detail oriented introspective man, Vainberg excelled in negotiating with other Salons, as well as in coordinating the Humanist's famously decentralized political organization.\n\nNow President of the Republic, Moisey Vainberg brings his own influences and impact on the Humanist Project. His family consumed by the anti-Semitism of the century, his homeland of Poland fallen to the fascist threat, Vainberg knows the stakes of his presidency all too well; Tomsk's dream of a free Russia, a shining light of freedom and progress, cannot be allowed to wither. A better future must be built for all, and defended vigorously. From investing in infrastructure to connect the people better, to continuing Shostakovich's drive to educate the workers, to expanding Tomsk's direct democratic traditions, President Vainberg seeks to teach the lessons of a century marred by sorrow, that have shown again and again the importance of hope and courage."

TOM_Provisional_Duma: "Provisional Duma"
POLITICS_PROVISIONAL_DUMA_DESC: "Pasternak is dead.\n\nHis cold, lifeless body lies hidden away in a black casket covered by a lively, colourful sheathe of flora. Men and women alike take to the streets of Tomsk with tears pouring out their tired eyes as they grieve and mourn the passing of the Republic's gentle father.\n\nAway from the ruckus of the streets, the uppity politicians of the Artisans' Republic, be they the bleeding-heart Humanists, the cultured Decembrists, the innovative Modernists, or the industrialist Bastillards take to the Duma to continue their predecessor's work, to let the Central Siberian Republic's precious democracy, suspended since the Republic's near fall to ruination during the chaos of the Siberian War, bloom anew.\n\nThe author's soul may have left the confines of our mortal world, yet his story remains unwritten, his legacy incomplete and his goal unfulfilled. As if a will left to be executed by his children, the tale of Tomsk is one left for his successors to conclude.\n\nBe it with a tragedy or with the flame of hope."

TOM_White_Duma: "§dWHITE DUMA§!"
TOM_White_Duma_desc: "The modern Decembrist Society, like its ancient forebears, has long looked to the west for constitutional developments. Popularly elected legislators are too easily swayed by populism and demagoguery, whereas appointed legislators are callous and distant from the common man.\n\nAs such, the Decembrists have modelled their Duma on a Bicameral model.\n\nA lower house elected by the people is able to propose laws that are then analysed by an appointed upper house. The upper house's powers are constrained, and its me mbers are some of the Republic's most respected citizens, from all political origins."

TOM_Violet_Duma: "§hVIOLET DUMA§!"
TOM_Violet_Duma_desc: "It is the Humanist society's most ardently held belief that the common citizens must be invested directly in politics. The Republic's legislature must thus be unicameral, and its members must be elected proportionally from a college of candidates sent on by the nation's communes, unions, and citizen groups.\n\nReferendums and direct democracy are the order of the day, with coalitions of members of the Duma lasting only as long as the people support their efforts through frequent political consultations. The democratic process is set to distil the population's will!"

TOM_Blue_Duma: "§mBLUE DUMA§!"
TOM_Blue_Duma_desc: "The rise of technocracy and meritocracy has increasingly clashed the will of the population with the will of entrenched bureaucratic interest. The Modernist Society seeks to preempt this threat to the Republic's foundation by combining meritocratic postings with popular mandates.\n\nAn apolitical electoral committee will design examinations for the various ranks of bureaucracy within each ministry. The best and most capable layer of candidates will be given the right to run for political offices, and present their projects to the people. This Duma of experienced public servants will work hard to fulfill their pledge to the electorate!"

TOM_Grey_Duma: "§sGREY DUMA§!"
TOM_Grey_Duma_desc: "The Bastillards have long held as their thesis that the excesses of the French Revolution, and of all ensuing failing democracies, can be directly liked to the populist platform given by an elected legislature holding all the cards. As such, their constitution has designed a Duma where the traditional bicameral legislature is flipped on its head.\n\nElected officials representing the people's will serve in a lower house whose duty is the analysis of laws proposed by the upper house.\n\nLaws carefully designed by dispassionate experts in the upper house may live or die under the public's scrutiny.\n\nBut never shall the Bastillards allow populists to introduce their poison into the Republic's bloodstream."

However, the great poet's final gift is not universally loved, especially among recaptured territories. Independent politicians struggle to win power outside of the great Salons. Many citizens in the provinces believe this system is meant to cynically maintain the dominance of the Tomsk elite at the expense of everyone else.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, and show that our four vanguard political associations are true to their ideals, and welcoming of any newcomer. Failure to do so could result in rising §RCynicism§!, or in the rise of §RIndependent Politicians§!. Left unchecked, both issues could cause the failure of our revolutionary diplomatic experiment."

TOM_a_year_away_from_woland: "A Year Away from Woland"
TOM_a_year_away_from_woland_desc: "When our provisional leader Boris Pasternak decided on his experiment, to form a new society of intellectuals in the depths of Siberia, little did he know how far it would get. The Republic found itself as a bastion of democratic tradition, as it became surrounded by tyrants, sometimes coated in red paint, sometimes not. Even the writer-President himself was soon overwhelmed by the task of guiding the nation through storm after storm.\n\nNow in his seventies, Pasternak is an old and fragile man. Yet, at no point did he lose the respect of his followers, fellow artists or scientists. Being sick, he has enclosed himself in the presidential residence, writing - whether that is proposed laws and acts, or creative texts of his own. The people who have surrounded him are the very best, and have played an increasingly significant role in governing, but everyone knows that the days of our leader are numbered. When that time comes, we must be ready, and continue his legacy."

TOM_end_the_provisional_government: "End the Provisional Government"
TOM_end_the_provisional_government_desc: "The Provisional Government, located in the only major city we still have control over, was formed by a circle of the President's close friends and associates. Only the most loyal, who in many cases had even followed him in his journey eastwards back in the days of the war, were allowed to participate. The Provisional Government, in its years in power, has thankfully managed to stay above the bickering between different factions and salons, paving the way to a constitution and true democracy.\n\nWith his inevitable passing coming closer and closer, Pasternak has made his wish clear for the Republic. This Government's goal has been fulfilled, and a smooth transition to the intended system is ensured. Thus, the next step is elections, where the voices of the people will be heard. It is time to finally begin the process of disbanding this authority."

TOM_the_first_draft: "The First Draft"
TOM_the_first_draft_desc: "Even though he knows that his provisional rule shall not last much longer, our President is willing to do anything for the democracy he has built in Central Siberia. From his lavishly decorated house, and with the help of advisors, he has begun writing the foundations of a document to lead the country into the future. That document is the Constitution.\n\nA constitution is of the utmost importance for a state such as ours. Pasternak has only been left with one job to do, and that is to show the intellectuals and the salons the path to their dream through a simple manuscript. He has based it on everything from the laws and ideals of short-lived Republican Russia to the constitutions of the Western world. Freedoms and liberties in expression and religion shall be protected, while the people will elect their representatives. It is more than certain that any successor to him will take Pasternak's first draft, and sculpt it into a proper constitution for the years to come."

TOM_empower_the_associations: "Empower the Associations"
TOM_empower_the_associations_desc: "In the years since the grand evacuation of Russia's class of intellectuals to Central Siberia, they have had to adapt to this new environment. Over time, as expected, they organized themselves into small groups and associations. Some were built on their common profession, giving way to teams of poets, musicians, scientists, and philosophists. Others were created on the basis of a common ideology or belief, many of which had a chance to be heard in the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nTomsk houses a vibrant and colorful collection of these associations, who hold significant sway on how things are run in the last remnant of the Central Siberian Republic. If the President is to finally dissolve the government and begin the process of transition, these groups will be critical, giving their support to the system and being the founding blocks of the democracy. Thus, they must not be abandoned by the administration, but instead empowered and encouraged."

TOM_suspend_the_provisional_government: "Suspend the Provisional Government"
TOM_suspend_the_provisional_government_desc: "It is now time. The stage is set for a new era of Russian democracy. Or rather, perhaps the stage is set for the final death of the Central Siberian Republic. President Pasternak is set to announce to the citizens of Tomsk the dissolution of the Provisional Government.\n\nAfter shepherding us through years of crisis and stabilizing the situation, it is a little sad to see the last remnants of the Central Siberian Republic go. But as democracy is a process that sees endless death and rebirth of political power, so must the Provisional Government go for something else to take its place."

TOM_the_legacy_of_white_russia: "The Legacy of a Democratic Russia"
TOM_the_legacy_of_white_russia_desc: "The Russian Republic, murdered in its infancy by Bolshevism, shackling Russian freedoms to a fragile and unsteady regime. The Central Siberian Republic, a fragile creature lying in the ashes of the Soviet Union, torn apart by traitors and rebellions. Our Republic is heir to two of the twentieth century's most disappointing governments, inheritor to a dream twice shattered by external events.\n\nThis dream shall not be betrayed a third time. We dream of Russia free, its people's future taken back from fascists and despots.\n\nCitizens, to arms! Fight for what is yours!"

TOM_the_first_amendments: "The First Amendments"
TOM_the_first_amendments_desc: "Pasternak's new basic constitution has been distributed widely throughout our nation so that every citizen can read it. Now it is time to legislate on its adoption.\n\nA committee consisting of members of the old Provisional Government as well as envoys from the four great salons has been assembled to review the constitution point by point. This tedious work must be done so that the new nation has a firm basis to stand on, and so that each salon's candidate has a good idea of what they are campaigning on.\n\nGreat writing is achieved through thorough editing. It is time for the Poet-President's last great work to be made ready for publication!"

TOM_pursuing_a_feverish_dream: "Pursuing a Feverish Dream"
TOM_pursuing_a_feverish_dream_desc: "Our adversaries mock us as soft, lacking in backbone, too fragile for the Russian Anarchy. They decry our obsession with democracy, with freedom and with fairness as wholly unsuited for the tough realities of modern Russia.\n\nLet them laugh, for the dream we chase so feverishly is the vision of a new Russia, unbroken, undaunted, freed from its past. The Tsar's autocratic regime did not succeed in crushing the free spirit of our people. Nor did the NKVD thugs terrorize their way to subservience. To say nothing of the German fascists, having hoped against reason to see their nihilism infect the character of our people, render us subservient and incapable of dreaming of the future.\n\nThe Republic does not endure in spite of its dreams, but precisely because of them. We will show the world the strength of our resolve."

TOM_the_death_of_the_author: "The Death of the Author"
TOM_the_death_of_the_author_desc: "President Boris Pasternak has passed away. He leaves behind loving friends and family, a colossal literary output, and an important political legacy.\n\nCritics both within and without the Republic have accused him and his government of causing many of catastrophes that have befallen the Central Siberian Republic. None, however, will deny his fervent belief in a renewed Russia, free and democratic. Nor his efforts to prepare the Republic for life after him. All future leaders of the nation will live in the shadow of this flawed, but courageous, founding father.\n\nA week of mourning has been declared, and arrangements are being made for state funerals for the former President."

TOM_the_permanence_of_the_manuscript: "The Permanence of the Manuscript"
TOM_the_permanence_of_the_manuscript_desc: "Two sets of writings render Boris Pasternak immortal. The first are his literary work: his poems; his translations; his magnum opus, Doctor Zhivago.\n\nThe second set of writings are his political efforts to leave the Republic a new constitution, and a clear way to arrange the transition of power. A new Duma is to be assembled, and rule the Republic until a new President is chosen.\n\nWe will ensure President Pasternak's legacy by following his final will. He has given us the tools we need to end the crisis caused by the collapse of the Central Siberian Republic."

TOM_integrate_the_salons: "Integrate the Salons"
TOM_integrate_the_salons_desc: "In the era of Revolutionary France, the "salons" were cultural hubs that encouraged social interaction, and were composed of intellectuals who could exchange and spread their own idea. Much like then, the salons have been revived in our own small Republic, now by a new generation of artists and scientists who still have the same goals and dreams. Thankfully, they all have one in common: their loyalty to an indivisible, democratic Russia, something that Pasternak's government believes in as well. It will not be difficult to begin the process of contacting the salons, aligning them to the Republic's goals, and then finally integrating them into the social and political life of the nation which they reside in."

### Duma Tree ###
TOM_the_last_solstice_day: "The Last Solstice Day"
TOM_the_last_solstice_day_desc: "Elections are afoot!\n\nThe Republic stands at a crossroad, with several factions running for the State Duma as well as struggling to gain the presidency. Pasternak's faith in the educated and talented members of Tomsk's intelligentsia shall not go unrewarded as the nation's very best hammer out one another's ideas so that truth and progress spring forth at the ballot box.\n\nSet for the darkest day of the year, the elections will first seek to fill the Duma, before a President is elected and a constitution is chosen for the nation's next four years."

TOM_the_open_window: "The Open Window"
TOM_the_open_window_desc: "Among the various ideologues and thinkers who desire to shape the future of the Republic, the four great salons of the Bastillard, Decembrist, Humanist, and Modernist Societies desire to take hold of the Duma and presidency.\n\nAs each faction makes its case, it remains unclear which issue will be the dominant one for the electoral campaign. The citizens of the Republic are divided, and it remains to be seen if the Decembrist platform of respect for tradition and rural democracy will triumph over the Bastillard and Modernist ideas of urban industrial renewal. Or perhaps the Humanist Society's social democratic platform of decentralised democracy and investment into the people will clinch the debate?"

TOM_the_whispers_of_camaradery: "The Whispers of Camaraderie"
TOM_the_whispers_of_camaradery_desc: "It is a truth not acknowledged enough in Russian history that true power lies in the people, and that the songs and traditions of the past need not be mocked and dismissed as hindrances to the future.\n\nLed by medievalist Dmitry Likhachyov, the Decembrist Society has run on a classical liberal platform of respect for the citizenry, of reforms of the criminal system, and of respectful industrial development that preserve Russia's environment for the future.\n\nCritics of the Decembrist decry them as soft hearted paternalists, elitist yet unwilling to go all the way into dirigisme. Let them complain! The Decembrist Society knows that Russians throughout the ages have embraced new ideas and new ways of doing things, and that the state need not browbeat the people into submission."

TOM_a_walk_in_the_forest: "A Walk in the Forest"
TOM_a_walk_in_the_forest_desc: "Critical to the Decembrist Society's view of Russian development is Russia herself. A land of forests and plains, settled by hard working men and women. An archipelago of communities out in the endless green sea of the Siberian forest.\n\nSuch a land produces hardy folks. Yet it also creates endless cultural exchange. Between the west, between the east. Russia is a melting pot, a place where ideas are traded and where the people slowly incorporate new ways of doing things into their life.\n\nTo take a walk in the forests of Tomsk is to see why the Decembrists must lead the Republic. Only the Decembrist Society and Dmitry Likhachyov understand how Russia came to be, and how it shall continue to evolve."

TOM_the_tammering_of_machinery: "The Stammering of Machinery"
TOM_the_tammering_of_machinery_desc: "A lot of the Republic's population lives in cities, and a lot more citizens arrive in our great urban centers every week. The staccato noise of industry punctuates the ebb and flow of workers going to and fro great colossuses of steel and smoke. The work of urban industrial workers is no less noble than the work their forebears did in the countryside. After all, hard work is eternal, and its applications limitless.\n\nThe Modernist and Bastillard Societies, alike in some aspects yet dissimilar in others, have both made the life of urban workers the main issue of their respective campaigns. The Bastillards see in the urban masses a permanent dagger to the heart of the Republic, and claim that a strong state is necessary to defend the Republic. The Modernists see in the new industrial class the crucible in which the future of Russia is to be forged, and seek to form a government capable of harnessing this opportunity.\n\nBoth parties urge the citizens to make urban renewal the core concern of the Republic's new government."

TOM_the_crackle_of_gunfire: "The Crackle of Gunfire"
TOM_the_crackle_of_gunfire_desc: "While the Modernist Society does not fully accept Bismarck's century old pronouncement of blood and iron as the best way to unify a divided nation state, the fact remains that Russia is divided between warlords and that without the strength of arms, unification under Tomsk's benevolent leadership remains a far off prospect.\n\nThe Republican Army shall be the shield for the nation's leaders. Yet valor and a great number of men under arms are nothing without modern equipment and strong supply lines. It is thus among the Modernist Society's driving doctrines that the nation's strong industrial core must be used to arm a strong army, capable of defeating any regional rival."

TOM_the_clammering_of_the_factory: "The Clamoring of the Factory"
TOM_the_clammering_of_the_factory_desc: "The Bastillard Society is wise to the ways in which populists and demagogues can bring forth the destruction of a once proud nation state. The mass industrialization of Tomsk has accumulated powers in the cities of the Republic, and surrounded the offices of state with clamoring masses, easily roused from their apathy by anti-social forces.\n\nThe Bastillard Society thus favors a policy of prudent economic development, squarely aimed at keeping the citizens content and confident in the state. Having thus excised mass hysteria from politics, the Republic under the presidency of Daniil Kharms and his associates from the Trinity Group will flourish into a new age of strength and progress."

TOM_the_humming_of_the_music: "The Humming of the Music"
TOM_the_humming_of_the_music_desc: "The soul of our Republic is its music, its hope, its dreams, and its letters. It is with these that a nation and society truly exists. The arts and culture are the backbones of history; where progress is actually made. The people of Tomsk deserve to enjoy the benefits of the arts and live whole and satisfying lives. People are not meant to merely survive, they are meant to thrive.\n\nThat is why the Humanist Society believes in the dreams of the Republic's citizens, to master their instruments, the pen, and the brush. The Humanists desire to invest in their strengths and talents. A better Tomsk and a better Russia can only be created by the skills of its people, not merely its leaders."

TOM_tea_time_with_shostakovich: "Tea Time with Shostakovich"
TOM_tea_time_with_shostakovich_desc: "There is no better way to connect with the voters than to actually meet them. The leader and candidate of the Humanists, Dmitry Shostakovich, has begun a program where he campaigns and meets with the masses. These "tea times" as they are called let Shostakovich learn the problems of the everyday farmer to the elite artist.\n\nShostakovich's charisma and populist movement have become famous and beloved all around Tomsk. This has given the Humanists great popularity with the people and within the salons.\n\nAlongside their simple solutions and promises of a better life the Humanists' ideology has reached all the hearts and minds of Tomsk. More and more people are beginning to believe there is a real chance of achieving a humane and unified democracy."

TOM_the_associations_make_their_vote: "The Associations Make Their Vote"
TOM_the_associations_make_their_vote_desc: "The time has come for the associations present in the Duma to vote. With the hearing of speeches made by each candidate and debates in the Duma and salons, it seems all have come to a clear choice. The new President to be voted in will wield the executive power of the government and will decide how all of Tomsk will move forward into the future. Also with the election of the President comes the party's own constitution, which allows the party to govern how they want, instead of governing within the rules of a set constitution. While it may only last as long as the party is in power, it still means each party has the power to transform the entire government. The association's vote could quite possibly change the future of Tomsk."

TOM_the_gymnasiums_follow_suit: "The Gymnasiums Follow Suit"
TOM_the_gymnasiums_follow_suit_desc: "With the Associations now having voted, it is time for the regular people of Tomsk to do the same. While not choosing out of every candidate as the Duma did, the people choose the two who had the most support in the Duma. Once the people's votes are counted the new President and salon will take power. It is expected however that the first choice of the Duma will be the first choice of the people as well, as the Duma was just voted in by the people a few months earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, to further complicate things, the educated are also put into special pools to be able to vote on more specific matters. This will be dictated by the constitution the ruling party puts into place, but can vary from choosing ministerial positions to having no special powers at all."

TOM_the_new_chairman: "The New Chairman"
TOM_the_new_chairman_desc: "The results are in and a new President has finally been chosen! After weeks of campaigning and speeches, a new face can finally lead Tomsk into the future. A new agenda and constitution have been chosen, and it is finally time for the people to be led onto a new path. Tomsk can finally move on from a provisional government to a legitimate one. The future looks bright for our democracy and for Russia.\n\nA new Republic has risen, one that can come forward as the representative and protector of all who yearn for freedom and democracy."

The Humanists, under Dmitry Shostakovich, has acquired the popular mandate to change the constitution of the Republic. An organization vowing to preserve and extend the direct democratic elements of the last government, they have also promised a period of growth and prosperity, and to free the factories and laborers from under the yoke of repressive laws. Time can only tell whether Shostakovich and the Humanists can rise to the challenge, but the whole Republic watches, and arms bear their flag aloft in the streets.\n\nTo celebrate, the famed composer himself has invited the people to witness the performance of his most beloved work - the Jazz Suite. For a day and a night, no citizen of Tomsk shall know work and worry, only joy and music that flow through the city, and every citizen shall drink their fill."

TOM_build_our_government: "Build Our Government"
TOM_build_our_government_desc: "The time for revelry is over. Now, the first days of the new government begin. The Humanists have inherited a system built on the foundations of the Decembrists: though their intentions were noble, no state can remain provisional forever. The rights of the workers and citizens have eroded in the years since the foundation of the Republic, all in the name of an "emergency." Although danger still looms over Tomsk, the Association has decided to put its faith in an idealistic constitution that guarantees civil liberties, as well as to enshrine basic needs as constitutional rights.\n\nOver the coming weeks, the transitional authority of the Decembrists will slowly begin to hand over the institutions of the state to the Humanists. Shostakovich shall formally assume the presidency, and with him shall rest the chains of his office. The coming years shall decide if the Humanists succeed in the defense and expansion of the Republic's ideals, or fail."

TOM_stability: "For Stability"
TOM_stability_desc: "For too long has our government ignored the cry of the workers and citizens of the Republic. Although Tomsk stood behind the Urals, and thus safe from the bombing that had crippled the warlord states of Western Russia, it borders neighbors that look forward into dismantling its ideals and claim the riches of the Siberian Plan for themselves. Thus, the early Republican government deemed it a necessary measure to limit the rights of the people and bring together a united front to stand against enemies from all sides. While the Humanists sympathize with this goal, they do not agree to its means.\n\nFrom this day onward, a citizen of Tomsk shall have their basic needs clarified as a constitutional right. The labor unions that had flourished in the days of the Central Siberian Republic shall again have a place in the vanguard and forefront march of progress. None shall know destitution and poverty in the home of idealists, scientists, and heroes."

TOM_the_laborer_and_his_labor: "The Laborer and His Labor"
TOM_the_laborer_and_his_labor_desc: "In the 20s and 30s, throughout the height of the New Economic Plan, the Soviet Union lavished Central Siberia with funding and industry. It became one of the most industrialized areas in the Union, and during the West Russian War, the aid in armaments and supplies the Central Siberian Republic sent became legendary. With it, the Revolutionary Front pushed far further west, coming close to breaking the German yoke on Moscow, before everything collapsed. The soldiers who fought and died for the ideals of a single motherland became etched in the Russian psyche, but the workers are the unsung heroes of the conflict.\n\nFor their steadfast support of the Republic, as well as their role in ensuring that the foundations of the state are secure, the Humanists shall bring the unions back to the negotiating table. The President himself shall inquire and strike a deal with the workforce; every worker in Tomsk shall be free to enjoy the fruit of their labor."

TOM_free_the_farms: "Free the Farms"
TOM_free_the_farms_desc: "Food is scarce in Russia. The most fertile lands lay in the West, beyond the Urals. In Central Siberia, industrial materials are aplenty, and the factories that process them are everywhere. The Siberian Plan has given Tomsk much, but food remains a problem. With the constitutional changes demanded by the mandate of the Humanists, the government needs to find a way to secure a steady supply of foodstuffs and staple crops to ensure that no one goes hungry under the watchful eyes of the Republic.\n\nThe government shall subsidize the farmers. The cost is immaterial; for the security and safety of its citizens, there is never too high a price for the Republic to pay. The President shall appoint commissioners to survey the land, as well as to determine the mechanical and material needs of agriculture. The threat of famine and hunger shall never again set its foot upon the doors of Tomsk."

TOM_free_the_factories: "Free the Factories"
TOM_free_the_factories_desc: "During the times of the old Soviet Union, Tomsk was a beneficiary to the Siberian Plan: Bukharin's plan to revitalize and renew the lands of the Siberia. Though it did not receive the most amount of aid - that would be Novosibirsk's lot - it received enough for the City of Tomsk to maintain its republican standards of living and political freedoms. However, with the changes that the future will bring, it may not remain so forever. Those that have broken free during the times of the Central Siberian Republic now eye the City with great interest, a piece of importance for the great Russian game.\n\nThe Humanist government, though it would have liked to instead focus on the welfare of the people, has deemed this looming threat as a danger for the people of the Republic. As such, it has set aside budgets for the construction of new factories and the reopening of old ones, with new safety standard codes to go with them. After all, a worker deserves to feel peace and security."

TOM_overtures_to_the_people: "Overtures to the People"
TOM_overtures_to_the_people_desc: "Though the Humanist government respects Pasternak and his transitional government's accomplishments, it must admit that the latter's time in power was fraught with mistakes. Chief of this was their preference for democratic elitism, cutting the common man and woman of the City and its environs out of the electoral process. It might have been an emergency measure, but to say that the average citizen could not decide for themselves the best courses of action in defense of their City was unacceptable. The people drew inward, becoming apathetic towards their role in a democracy, and a critical part of the ideals of the republic now lies again on its deathbed.\n\nShostakovich and his ministries aim to change this. Elitism, though it has its merits, has no place in a democracy. The people must step forward and lend their shoulders to both the defense of the republic and its governance. Now begins the era for a government of the people, by the people, and for the people."

TOM_direct_representation: "Direct Representation"
TOM_direct_representation_desc: "The legacy of the Pasternak government is immense, and although they have done much good, there also parts of it that the Humanists plan to repeal and reject. In the years prior, there used to be two chambers of governance: the Senate and the House. Ostensibly used to represent the outer territories and the City equally, it had been used to check and halt the voices of the majority who demand change. The Humanists plan to demolish the idea of an upper house, perhaps for good.\n\nFor that to happen, however, the people must understand the repercussions of such change. The Humanist government shall not waver over this issue: the voice of the people shall remain the most potent power in politics, and when they speak, parliament must hear. They shall elect their representatives directly, and laws will be introduced to hold the politicians accountable to their constituencies. The Humanists accept that the masses are flawed, but their opinions need change, not ignorance and limitation."

TOM_transparency_and_responsibility: "Transparency and Responsibility"
TOM_transparency_and_responsibility_desc: "The Salons of the City do not act as political parties of other polities in the world. The Four Great Salons, the Modernists, the Bastillards, the Humanists, and the Decembrists, are as much artistic movements as they are political: this resulting fusion has rendered the state's very nature as opaque and labyrinthine, perhaps even byzantine. The common citizenry is unfamiliar with the inner workings of the governments, and as such, they cannot hold the Salons accountable to as much detail as they would have liked.\n\nSuch things must change. Opacity and obscurity shall have no place in the City. The citizens must know their duties and their obligations towards the ideals of the Republic, but they must also retain their rights and voice in the government. We shall lift the veil over the nature of the state, and the people shall know the specifics of the political process. We have kept them blind for so long, and now they must see and learn."

TOM_opportunity: "For Opportunity"
TOM_opportunity_desc: "For the past two decades, the economic hierarchy of Tomsk has not changed much. The collapse of the Union brought about an era of stability carried on by the presence of the gains made during Bukharin's Siberian Plan. As such, many citizens of working-class origins have the same status as their predecessors: poor, with neither the background and opportunity to achieve more. The Humanist government has sworn from the very beginning of their Salon's existence to end this stagnation and usher in a new era defined not by the stillness of life but the pursuits of happiness.\n\nThe state shall open schools, and the funding for education will increase severalfold. All the doors in the Republic must open for all those who live in it. The Humanists shall go further than providing the mere opportunity to obtain comfort, but also the means. All within the City shall know happiness and, if not, the ways to achieve it."

TOM_the_individual_and_his_capabilities_desc: "The Republic has made great strides in the area of education. Although recently-opened, the public schools are popular with the people, and many are already planning their way to higher levels of expertise. Yet, there are many within and without the Humanist Association that have felt that Shostakovich and his cabinet have not gone far enough to reach the educational benefits promised by their campaign. The government shares their concerns and has decided to take action in furthering the cause of culture and science.\n\nIt is not enough for the individual to have the opportunity to achieve greater things in life. They, as human beings, deserve the means to do so as well. This need transcends all the others in life, whether it is for political power or military might. It is not enough for the people to merely have the thought of poverty expunged from their minds, but they must know plenty, and for this feeling to never leave them."

TOM_labors_revolution: "Labor's Revolution"
TOM_labors_revolution_desc: "While Russia descended into chaos following the collapse of the Union, the outside world had changed. Within our interests are the revolution in the matter of industry and production - ways to maintain productivity while giving the workers more free time to pursue their private interests. Among these are the science of management, as well as mechanical automatisation: the same fields that brought about America and Japan's ascension to their places among the powers of the world. From what we have heard of the broader world, these are also applicable to Tomsk, and to Russia as a whole.\n\nThe Humanists shall implement these innovations into the City, although with a different intent than most. The government shall aim to free more hours for the workers, using automatisation and shifts to maintain the same level of productivity and pay. Perhaps, given time, they would produce surpluses, not deficits."

TOM_a_relentless_push_forward: "A Relentless Push Forward"
TOM_a_relentless_push_forward_desc: "So far, the Humanist government has done all that it can in promoting the cause of the war against illiteracy. In this aspect, they have done what is expected of good governance and ethical integrity. The government has fulfilled what it had promised during the campaign season of the last election, but Shostakovich means to take it a step further. Amid warlord Russia, there is a need not just for prudent and necessary measures, but also for revolutionary deeds. That is precisely where the Humanists have decided to go.\n\nIn the middle of chaos, the City shall provide the eye of the storm. In the middle of illiteracy and stupidity, the City shall provide shelter and education. To all the peoples of Russia, whether citizens or not, shall know peace and security within the boundaries of the Republic. More schools, more universities - for every worker a degree, for every worker a place to learn more."

TOM_the_rights_of_man_desc: "The foundation of a nation is its people - of the rights enumerated to them, and the duties the nation expects of them in return. The state will provide the work, the shelter, the sustenance, and the small luxuries; the hallmarks of a dignified life that has been absent from Russia for nearly two decades. In return, the state will expect that every man will do his duty: the duty of bearing the standard of the humanist project through reasoned political participation, the duty to provide care and charity to their common citizen, and the duty to offer their lives in defense of the nation against its enemies."

TOM_the_rights_for_living: "The Rights for Living"
TOM_the_rights_for_living_desc: "It has been decades since the emergence of the Central Siberian Republic and its successor state, the Republic of Tomsk. During those times, many workers and soldiers have given their blood, sweat, and tears to defend and secure the ideals of democracy amid a Russia engulfed in chaos and civil war. Yet, the governments of the past have been notably lax in honoring their services. The age of retirement remains high, and the pensions low: not many live to retire, and when they do, the rewards of doing so are disappointing.\n\nThe Humanist government plans to correct this problem. They will lower the retirement age, perhaps at a significant risk, and to allow older workers to retire and enjoy their lives in peace. The cabinet has also discussed a scheme to increase pension funds without affecting the younger workforce much. Those who serve democracy do not only deserve honor, but the rights to live out the remainder of their time on this earth in peace and comfort."

TOM_the_rights_of_humanity: "The Rights of Humanity"
TOM_the_rights_of_humanity_desc: "Since their coming into power, the standards of living for the average Tomsk citizen has increased dramatically. However, to say that it is rosy for everyone is an exaggeration. If the bureaucracy and the cabinet would be frank, the rate of poverty in the City and its environs remain disappointing and outright heart wrenching. Many still live below the poverty line, and so far no governments have striven to provide the primary social services to them. The government considers this a travesty; no human being should live in these conditions, without a home and a stable source of food.\n\nThe cabinet has cleared a budget for the expansion of affordable and cheap housing in the outskirts of the City. Once there, they will receive essential education and unemployment benefits to help them on their feet. The Humanist Association has faith in these feeble, destitute people. More important than their rights as citizens are their rights as human beings - something the Association is more than happy to give."

TOM_progress_from_safety: "Progress from Safety"
TOM_progress_from_safety_desc: "The Central Siberian Republic has become somewhat of a model for the Humanists, despite the flaws in its democracy and weakness to external threats. For a time, a region in Russia had been free from the chaos that had overwhelmed other parts of the Union and had not succumbed to the desire of power as had the states to its west and east. However, the dream's violent end had mangled its legacy from a miracle to a nightmare. The Association realizes this, but admiration and criticism do not clash: they merge and mix into a greater appreciation of the object at hand.\n\nThus, a model is born. The people deserve to feel safe, with a home, a job, and a steady rate of pay. From this base, they shall go far in defense of the Republic that had given them these and more. Under the Humanists, the Republic shall take a bold new step into the future, to finally exceed and surpass its predecessor."

TOM_the_road_to_norilsk: "The Road to Norilsk"
TOM_the_road_to_norilsk_desc: "In the days of the Central Siberian Republic, Tomsk and Novosibirsk were not alone in being the chief recipients of the Siberian Plan. In the North, coasting the Arctic seas is the city of Norilsk, a lone beacon of human habitation amid an inhospitable climate. During the collapse of the Union, the city continued as humanity's main outpost in the North, before the fall of the Central Siberian Republic made any contact with Norilsk impossible or unfeasible. The city holds the last important part of the Siberian Plan, with which Tomsk may finally match Novosibirsk in the south.\n\nThe cabinet proposes a plan to the President: an expedition to the far North. There might be survivors yet in the cold waters of the Arctic, eking out a barebones and harsh life in the middle of the wastes. We shall rescue them, and in turn, they shall aid us in revitalizing the city. Given time, even Novosibirsk will not stand against Tomsk."

TOM_a_free_culture: "A Free Culture"
TOM_a_free_culture_desc: "From the times of the Union to the Central Siberian Republic, the artistic freedoms of the composers and writers throughout Russia were restricted for fear of political subversion and intrigue. Censorship boards proliferated in their offices, striving to distill art into something clinical, something acceptable to the ideas of the authoritarian ideologies, running contrary to the intention and definition of art itself. As a result, the varieties of artistic mediums that had survived and prospered outside of Russia do not have the equivalents here. Not even Tomsk could claim to reach the heights that the others had attained in Russia's absence.\n\nIt is not enough for culture to merely be free. The censorship laws that remained in the books after the formation of the government and cabinet shall be struck out, one by one. Culture must be in liberty for it to be active: after all, what defines Russia as a nation, if not works that will last beyond the lifetimes of puny mortals?"

TOM_a_free_people: "A Free People"
TOM_a_free_people_desc: "The Union and the old Republic treated the people with the same distrust as to their art: with distrust and wariness of political elements. Secret police prowled the streets and listened to the conversations and the daily lives of citizens, proactively seeking to defend the ideology of the state, rather than the liberties of the people. To their credit, the transitional government had lessened, if not outright abolished, the role of domestic intelligence within the City of Tomsk. Only vestiges remained of the old system, but the fear had stayed behind, preventing the people from enjoying the political liberties they ought to have.\n\nThe average citizen should not be only technically free. Freedom of speech and opinion are the blood and veins of a functioning democracy. Whatever secret police institutions that had been spared the wrath of Pasternak's government, the cabinet shall swipe away. The government has determined that now is the moment of action, not speech."

TOM_safety_from_progress: "Safety from Progress"
TOM_safety_from_progress_desc: "Since its inception, Tomsk has become a primary hub for the scientists and educational base of the old Union. By some miracle, the Republic contained within its borders a plurality, if not an outright majority, of skilled scientific workers currently living in warlord Russia. Thus the path of progress and survival of the city depended on the harmonious cooperation between the two things that could not have been more different from one another: art and science. Though the city of Novosibirsk in the south retains the majority of the Siberian Plan's gains, Tomsk's scientific base might provide a way to counteract and resist that.\n\nThe government intends to start slow. Previously, it had established primary schooling and invested heavily in education; it is now time to look into higher ends of learning. More teachers for more universities with little tuition fee should help us to overcome the rebellious mutineers in the south, but also strengthen our scientific base."

TOM_create_the_all_russian_university_association: "Create the All-Russian University Association"
TOM_create_the_all_russian_university_association_desc: "The scientific base of Russia is sparse. Amid all the chaos and civil strife, not many can afford to learn the basics of the scientific disciplines. Many young men who would have gone on to grow into great scientists now languish in the wastelands of Russia, becoming scavengers and bandits instead. For the few who undertook proper training and education, however, they receive a value perhaps even higher than an infantry or tank division. The Republic, with all its idealism, cannot let go of the opportunity to gather what was left of the old Union's scientists and fashion something new from it.\n\nA fresh idea drifted from the parliament into the ears of the President. The creation of an All-Russian University Association, which will oversee the gathering of scientists on the run from powers who are likely to abuse their abilities to cause more grief in violence on Russian soil. The government shall put them to work, not to research weapons of mass destruction, but to open a new day for the people."

TOM_for_the_commonwealth: "For the Commonwealth!"
TOM_for_the_commonwealth_desc: "Shostakovich and the Humanist Association has come far. From a fringe artistic-political movement in an obscure city in Central Siberia, he now helms what is likely to be the best hope for a democratic Russia. The government, which he presided over, has transformed the life in Tomsk, ensuring that basic needs become not only a necessity but also a right. People come to Tomsk in search of something better: a shining lantern in the darkness that pervades Russia.\n\nYet, there is much more to be done. The Humanists might have lifted the city of Tomsk into the heart of Central Siberia, but enemies still lie in wait. Rebel generals and warlords still rule the lands to the east and the west, each flaunting their rights as the successor to Russia. Shostakovich cannot allow this insolence to stand for long. After that, however, the idea of the Commonwealth remains. A state ruled by Russians not based on class or ideological differences, but of the common bond of the human condition."

The party's promises of democracy, education, and bureaucracy have won over the hearts and minds of the voters. A strong republic can only be created by expert schooling, excellent schooling can only be created by a powerful civil service, and a powerful civil service can only be created by an efficient government. That is the Modernist motto, preached by the countless Modernist professors and scientists during their campaigns.\n\nWith our victory in the elections, we have our chance to transform Tomsk. We must not let Russia be a wasteland, devoid of innovation and advancement. A government led by expert scientists and professors are more fit to rule a country than any politician. After all, excellent merit always makes the best leaders."

These include Industry, Technology, Science, Infrastructure, Education, Commerce, and Military.\n\nHaving these cabinets will surely make implementing our reforms easier. Who knows when the next crisis could occur? The armies across our borders aren't just going to sit around and do nothing. We need to be prepared and have countermeasures waiting before they strike.\n\nThe cabinets will work on solutions faster than any legislation. We can build more factories. New discoveries every day.

While we still need to stick to our roots, we can't just leave problems unsolved. Our ideals have been important to our leadership from the beginning of our independence. They must be perfected and molded into a new shape for the future. Tomsk and all of Russia has fallen behind other nations for far too long now. Dealing with these issues first will prepare us for the challenges to come, and pave the way towards a modern Siberia.\n\nThere is a bright future ahead. It is time we meet it head-on. There won't be a clear path ahead though. Choices and sacrifices will need to be made to pave the way towards progress."

TOM_democracy: "Democracy"
TOM_democracy_desc: "We must build a better democracy. Due to the difficult conditions of Siberia, many people have trouble getting out and voting, due to them having to worry about actually surviving the harsh climate and not having access to voting locations. This makes our mandate of democracy thin. Are we even democratic if no one votes?\n\nThis is an issue that cannot stand. Everyone should have the chance to vote without worry. If we want to claim to be the greatest democracy in all of Russia we need the people to get out and vote.\n\nWe have two choices ahead of us. Either go with the tried and true approach of more ballot boxes and more voting booths or something new, such as machine registration. Either way, we'll have to do it right; every vote counts in barren Siberia."

These methods have worked for years and there is no reason to abandon them now. Just improving what we have will be much more efficient. When has it ever failed? If we try hard enough nothing can go wrong. The same can't be said about machines.\n\nWe will build more infrastructure and make more voting tools available to the people. Sometimes the simpler answer is the correct one. More voting booths in the cities and places to register will work best. Also what could go wrong with building a little infrastructure?"

TOM_ballot_boxes_for_everyone_desc: "Everyone deserves a vote, there's no denying it, but making sure they get their vote is the challenge. While voting booths are easy to set up in the cites, getting it to our rural population is the problem. Ballot boxes need to get to your everyday Artur and Victor in a remote village just as easily as a walk down the street in Tomsk is for others.\n\nSome members of our government say this is pointless, and we shouldn't need to waste resources trying to get people to vote in these places. But if we want to have a steadfast democracy, we need as many votes as possible.\n\nMore infrastructure will be required to reach these areas, but it is a necessary expense. Democracy must not stop if it can't reach some lonely town!"

TOM_a_new_approach_desc: "It is time we take a new approach to voting. New machines have been developed that can make voting easier and faster. We can use these machines to make the voting process more efficient. However, this is a new process, and very experimental. We have no idea if it will even work as intended. Anything could go wrong, so it is very risky.\n\nNevertheless, the reward could be even greater than the risk. A modern democracy like ours could be very prestigious. It will also be cheaper and easier than getting a ballot box to every small town and village and making sure all votes are counted manually. Why do we call ourselves Modernists if we don't even modernize the country?"

TOM_machine_registration: "Machine Registration"
TOM_machine_registration_desc: "The next step in machine voting is machine registration. While also very experimental, this technology could possibly make the voting process even more simple. Instead of the practice of manually registering everyone, it could be automatically done by a machine, which will save a lot of effort. That's if it actually works of course.\n\nMachines are the solution to making our democracy thrive. This is our chance to create a Tomsk everyone can be proud of.

Since we first started increasing voter turnout, more and more people have been voting than ever before. Prior to our efforts, only the well educated were voting. Now, more people of more classes cast their votes towards a better Tomsk.\n\nBut we can still do better. People need to know that voting is important and necessary for our democracy. Let's convince everyone that they need to vote to make a greater Tomsk. It is the citizen's duty in a democracy to vote. People need to use the power given to them to improve the lives of everyone.

We can have the best schools west of the Urals. Who would ever want to study anywhere else in Russia? Definitely not under the close eye of any dictator.\n\nOur first effort will be to build schools in rural areas.

We must not get distracted from our main task, creating a modern and efficient Russia. No lab experiment can fix social problems or make sure all the people have food to eat.\n\nThe people of Russia want sensible solutions, so that is what we will give them.

He has made many useful discoveries serving Russia and Tomsk.\n\nWe should try to expand these educational services to be able to teach even more students interested in the sciences.

We need the technology our neighbors don't have.\n\nMore equipment will be necessary to be given to the labs and schools, and we need to make sure our scientists cooperate in their studies.

We need to create a smoother administration to make our government even more effective. There can always be a better Tomsk.\n\nTo start, we're going to have to shuffle around a few departments. It is also necessary that we train more bureaucrats in the art of coordinating a country. Of course, there are also more modern solutions. We could use the new technology of computers instead of people to do some of the tasks needed. A more capable and efficient administration is just around the corner."

Continuing with a human workforce will help us achieve bureaucratic efficiency. Machines and computers could make our administration even more costly and inefficient, you can never trust a computer to do a human's work.\n\nMore people will need to be hired to take on the new jobs of our growing government, we need a skilled administration to make sure the job gets done right. Corruption and incompetence cannot fester in our government. Tomsk must heighten its standards so more capable bureaucrats can handle all of the behind the scenes work that needs to be done."

It is necessary, a nation as large and spread out as ours deserves better management.\n\nBetter examinations will find the better people for the job, not one bureaucrat should be lazy or careless! Only the most hardworking of the population deserve to work for the government.\n\nOf course, we will need incentives for people to actually join the administration. Government work doesn't really appeal as an enjoyable or well-paying job. Hopefully, our efforts will prove fruitful and we will have a competent bureaucracy fit to lead a real nation."

A machine could do this faster than any person, and it could allow them to be moved to more important jobs a computer cannot handle.\n\nA group of scientists, engineers, and researchers in Tomsk are willing to build these machines that can process data inputs and categorize them efficiently. We can help by funding their project. A new future of technology and innovation awaits."

Of course, we still need to train people on how to use these computers. They aren't exactly the least complicated machines out there.\n\nThankfully, we have promises that these computers will ensure bureaucratic data is rendered smoothly and without error. A computer can't possibly make as many blunders as a human, right? Regardless, we are still much better off than where we started. With enough maintenance and upgrades, computers might be able to do the jobs of a dozen workers."

There is a lot of opposition among our workers as they are demanding better conditions and more rights. We need to handle this quickly and carefully if we do not want it to get out of control.\n\nWe also need to focus on reforming our industry to meet the challenges of defending our democracy.

However, our government will have to decide if we want to go for even more reforms or remain with the status quo and only use ones that are necessary. While it may be better to give the workers better jobs, maybe if we continue down the status quo we could do it our way.

We need to end absurd worker injuries and make sure managers are more responsible for their employees. A minimum wage will also make sure the workers are paid fairly and can actually afford to live.

Productivity remains at the same level of where we started and it seems like no progress is being made.\n\nProductivity will not be increased by means of longer work or lower pay, if anything it will decrease production due to worker's displeasure. Lowering hours or increasing pay will also be too costly in the long run. We need a scientific solution.\n\nOur government could create a better, more scientific management. A management that focuses on peak efficiency over selfish profit. One that uses mathematical and scientific principles to produce more with less.

This would quell any idea of a revolt and finally end the issue for good. However, many entrepreneurs in the party have come up with a new solution, one that would instead reform how the unions - and the workers, are managed. While not as likely to stop a full on workers' revolt, it would be much more better for business, would it not? Besides, the workers should count themselves lucky for the great conditions they already have in the Republic. It's not like they're getting any worse, right?"

We need a higher work rate so we can outproduce our neighbors. Our enemies cannot have the upper hand in the coming struggle.\n\nIn addition, we must choose between our civilian and military industries. We can't put all our effort into both.

We can't ignore the needs of our own citizens who cry out for better living conditions onto deaf ears. We must listen to their cries and help them, not let them suffer.

These workers must be led, protected and cherished by the elites of the city, much as dutiful parents seek to let children grow strong and independent.\n\nThese are difficult times for the republican dream in Russia. Beyond our border, treacherous Siloviki, deranged kings and rioting anarchists plot the demise of our nation. If the Republic is to endure, we must show the citizens that we are there for them, and that the story of Russia's rebirth is theirs, and theirs alone.\n\nOur Decembrist forerunner fought to free the serfs from cruel bondage.

Our government equally places great importance on the Russian landscape for its beauty as well as its opportunities. Finally, our political salon knows that the prison system is an important aspect of society, a set of kidneys that filter out toxic elements from our republic while letting go cleansed elements back into the world. We must get to work on these three issues!"

The great force that allows him or her to associate to others is liberty, the liberty to join labor with others, the liberty to seek a better future, the liberty to try new things. Our Decembrist forebears fought to keep Russians free from Napoleon's foreign tyranny. Then, they fought unsuccessfully to free them from the bondage of serfdoms.\n\nThe freedom our precursors sought was not the nihilistic freedom of anarchism and socialism. Rather, it was the simple, honest freedom to explore the natural order of things. Likewise, the freedom we seek to impart on the people should not give them the ability to rob other citizens of their freedoms. Free enterprise need not be a pathway to enslaving industrial workers anew, just as it needed not be cause to enserf the Russian peasant. Our Decembrist government shall thus protect freedom within the bounds of decency and of charity, values so important to the Russian people."

Unlike Marxists, technocrats, and other cynical ideologues attached to the material world as an end in itself, we remain aware that reality is impossible to separate from those who experience it. The days of harvest cannot be separated from the peasants who have tended to their fields, nor can it be separated from their traditions and cultural heritage. Severing this deep connection between our environment and ourselves in the name of progress is a deeply dangerous threat to the well-being of our society. Idealism must be embraced, and materialism must be expunged from the body politic!"

This freedom includes the freedom from dangerous and degrading work conditions. Their salary must be decent, and their work conditions safe.

To learn more about the wider world, yes, but also to learn about Russian traditions, about the song and stories of the people.\n\nWe shall create a new table of ranks, for a new nobility of the mind, where the greatest bureaucrats and leaders of our society will constantly seek to demonstrate their learning and their practical abilities.

Russians in particular are healed by the vastness of nature around them; their mind healed and strengthened by forests without end; their body tended to by the bounties of the land, furnishing food and shelter both through industry.\n\nIndustrial development must thus be carefully considered, in this context. The peasant communities' desire to be left alone must be respected as much as possible. Nevertheless, we must also link up cities and industrial sites through new roads, as well as find a proper balance to resource extraction. The Decembrist Society is uniquely qualified for this delicate work of balance."

There is no need to direct investment, as the failures before us have done when the average peasant wisely chooses to work in a factory, for the betterment of his society, in the ultimate defense of the Motherland! Next season we will not only be harvesting wheat, but we will also be gathering guns, artillery, armor, whatever is necessary to ensure Russia's future!

How can we live in a just and modern society, or even a proper society at all, if our brothers sit behind bars? We need to organize a committee to re-evaluate the gulag system, emancipate thousands of wrongly imprisoned citizens, and define a line between the guilty and innocent.

Two local newspapers have criticized our decision to keep the gulag system, but they are mistaken. We do not wish to condemn men for minor transgressions like the Soviets did. Rather, the gulags serve as a doorway, one that divides the 'small, dank room' that is crime from the outer world, where the enlightened reside.\n\nIn other news, the rehabilitation program has reported moderate success.

The peasants of Tomsk no longer look at the distant camps as death chambers, but rather as beacons of hope in a dark world. Some governors have capitalized on this success by comparing our gulags to the justice systems of other warlords - whereas less civilized men execute fellow Russians for even minor transgressions, or so we have been told, Tomsk showers mercy upon all of its children.

Unfortunately, the only way to build any roads or factories is through the industrial unions, tycoons and capitalists whose brutal working conditions and exploitative practices have angered many workers. Many industrial workers will not like our cooperation with them, after all, many of these workers may have been injured and even killed by such unsafe working conditions. Many workers think we should actually be cracking down on these so-called unions rather than cooperating with them. However, if we want the factories to run and the construction projects to get built, we'll need to negotiate. In the end, it will be to the benefit of everyone."

TOM_evaluate_the_agricultural_question: "Evaluate the Agricultural Question"
TOM_evaluate_the_agricultural_question_desc: "Ensuring our food supply is of vital interest to the stability of our state, a lesson the Bourbons and Romanovs never took to heart until it was too late. Given how far north we are, our agricultural situation is always teetering between sufficiency and rationing. A poor crop season could mean the end of our small democracy. We should check in on our farmers and their farms to ensure their health and safety. Furthermore, we should begin planning on how we can increase our agricultural productivity, whether that be through more efficient machinery or some new kind of fertilizer."

TOM_cooperation_agenda: "Cooperation Agenda"
TOM_cooperation_agenda_desc: "Efficiency can only be achieved with all apparatuses of the economy moving as one. By connecting our farmers with the various food companies and our central planning committee, we will be able to coordinate the entire agriculture industry. With all these moving parts now under our control, it's only logical that we try to organize it now. Given the rate at which our population is growing, there has been massive job growth with few workers to sate this labor demand. We should rectify the shortage by moving workers from our crowded cities to the countryside temporarily, not only to boost agricultural productivity, but also to provide employment to the many unemployed in the city."

TOM_form_the_urban_planning_board: "Form the Urban Planning Board"
TOM_form_the_urban_planning_board_desc: "In order to maximise the efficiency of the state, we should endeavor to centralize all economic and urban development offices into one larger urban planning office. From here we will be able to coordinate all manner of industrial, residential, and business developments within cities and towns. Additionally, we should bring in our private sector associates in order to accommodate their needs and the needs of the companies they represent. Should all go well, we should notice a great reduction in construction times and general increase urban development as a result."

TOM_the_new_mangazea: "The New Mangazeya"
TOM_the_new_mangazea_desc: "Mangazeya was one of the largest trading posts of Siberia hundreds of years ago. Its trading routes and abundance of furs and ivory made it one of the wealthiest and influential cities of the region. It was the Baghdad of Siberia. Sadly, over the course of centuries, a series of Tsars with little care or even knowledge of Mangazeya destroyed the city with their own geopolitical concerns. However, times have changed yet again, and Tomsk has need of the northern trade routes and access to the Arctic sea that Mangazeya was provided. A new Mangazeya will be built, both as a bastion for the northern borders and as a trade hub from whence the riches of the outside world will be available to us."

TOM_the_industrial_rationalization_council: "The Industrial Rationalization Council"
TOM_the_industrial_rationalization_council_desc: "The work we have put into working with the private sector has really started to pay off. Private investment into the economy has risen exponentially and unemployment is dropping further every day. In order to preserve this prosperity we will need to ensure that future governments hold to this policy of cooperation with the private sector as well. An organization will be created to help integrate public and private firms alike. While the blue collar workers might complain about private industry amassing more power, we know that this policy can only serve to benefit the citizens of our great democracy."

TOM_the_four_year_plan: "The Four Year Plan"
TOM_the_four_year_plan_desc: "With the help of our new private sector associates and allies, we can now embark upon our first four years plan for Tomsk. This ambitious plan has several goals, among which includes boosting resource production, increasing factory productivity, and building more infrastructure. With hope, these measures will not only serve to increase Tomsk's general productivity, but also serve to strengthen Tomsk's military industrial strength. All that's left is to decide how our resources should be divided."

TOM_heavy_industrial_priority: "Heavy Industrial Priority"
TOM_heavy_industrial_priority_desc: "Heavy industry is the backbone of every modern economy. Heavy industry can refer to a number of industries, from steel and chemical manufacturers to electrical and automotive production, which all typify the modern industrial nation. We should invest into these industries so that they may form the basis of a far more robust and influential economy. Additionally, an investment into our heavy industry is also an investment into our future productivity. As our population and economy grows, its needs will as well, and having the heavy industry to support them in the future will free them them build up other parts of the economy."

TOM_support_the_military_complex: "Support the Military Complex"
TOM_support_the_military_complex_desc: "If Tomsk is to invest into any industry, then it must invest into the military industrial complex. Roads and steel foundries aren't going to protect as columns of tanks roll into Tomsk. No, we must invest into the industries that will protect us. The production of guns, artillery, and ammunition must be prioritized if we are to maintain our freedom and independence of our nation. Without a doubt our enemies are just as surely building up their armies and military industries as we plan to. Additionally, if nothing else, the added jobs and fiscal stimulus should be enough of an incentive to go ahead with the project."

TOM_urban_infrastructural_reinforcement: "Urban Infrastructural Reinforcement"
TOM_urban_infrastructural_reinforcement_desc: "The infrastructure that connects our nation should be the top priority for investment. Not only does infrastructural investment provide excellent monetary stimulus for our economy, but it also also makes commerce easier to conduct in and around our lands, encouraging trade. It also eases the extraction of resources from our land. Furthermore, an investment into our infrastructure could also be considered an investment into our defense. The ability to move our military units into position rapidly to respond to invasion and raids is of the utmost importance."

TOM_our_finest_bureaucrats: "Our Finest Bureaucrats"
TOM_our_finest_bureaucrats_desc: "Workplace regulations and pollution controls may be standard, or even required in other nations, but we simply cannot afford them in Tomsk. On all sides we face enemy warlord states bent on our destruction. We cannot afford to let our industry be held back for the sake of a few workers' comfort. Our bureaucrats will separate the wheat from chaff and come up with a list of law and regulations to loosen or remove altogether so that we might unchain our industry and march into the future as an economic superpower in Russia."

TOM_the_trinity_group_rebuffs: "The Trinity Group Rebuffs"
TOM_the_trinity_group_rebuffs_desc: "The Trinity Group needs not the help of so called captains of industry! While their work developing the nation is commendable, their understanding of the economy is by necessity parochial and incomplete. Only the government of the Republic can help steer the ship of state away from dangerous reefs.\n\nIt is certain that by rebuffing their help, we will lose some opportunities for development. However, we will assert that the Bastillard Society makes its own path. This will increase our political prestige and reassure many workers that our government disdains all outside concerns, not only the poor workers'. Only the will of our government matters, and as we develop our own institutional experience, we strengthen the Republic's foundations."

TOM_the_new_stakhanovite_movement: "Lessons from Fordism"
TOM_the_new_stakhanovite_movement_desc: "Fordism was an economic and social system that sought to increase industrial production by both streamlining how factories were run, and by increasing the worker's pay so he could afford more of the factory's produce, thus driving up demand.\n\nWe believe that a critical aspect missing from Fordism is a layer of nationalist motivation. The workers of our Republic are not only earning a living wage for themselves and their family, but building the future of our nation.\n\nThus buttressed by material and psychological gains, the workers of our nation will bring the Republic in a new era of prosperity!"

TOM_universal_modernization: "Universal Modernization"
TOM_universal_modernization_desc: "While it is true that poor workers blame their tools, it is equally true that great workers can be hindered by shoddy tools.\n\nWe've inherited a bounty of equipment and tooling from Bukharin's Siberian Plan. However the years of chaos have prevented us from reinvesting much in industrial tools. To stop the waste of time caused by tools breaking down or needing increased maintenance, we must build a new generation of industrial equipment and give it to our workers. The upfront cost will be more than amortized over the coming years of improved productivity."

TOM_rejection_of_ideology: "Rejection of Ideology"
TOM_rejection_of_ideology_desc: "A man cannot live off dreams and fresh water. Why then do ideologues of all stripes exalt sacrifices made for ideology, and their inevitable revolution? By promising a better future through current sacrifices, communists, fascists, and liberals offer naught more than a simulacra of religion, bled of all its sacred traditions.\n\nThe Bastillard Society rejects ideology. Workers work hard simply because it is their station in life. In return the state offers them quantifiable improvements to current concerns.\n\nAs citizens realize that a non-ideological, policy driven perspective is preferable, voter turnout will naturally lower and the Bastillards' non-ideological position will grow in strength. Demagogues might cry about the health of our democracy. We have more important concerns than popularity contests."

TOM_universal_incorporation: "Universal Incorporation"
TOM_universal_incorporation_desc: "Small businesses are the engine of the economy, moving nimbly into specific niches and sowing the seeds of future progress by the nation.\n\nHowever, many such small entrepreneurs are not as well versed in the basics of law. Many of our Republic's small workshops operate in a legal gray zone, without full incorporation. It is thus hard to keep track of who is doing what, and who is legally responsible when a problem occurs. Our supply chain's smallest gears are thus needlessly fragile.\n\nWe must help small businesses to incorporate, to rectify this issue. To encourage people to do things legally, a fund can be set up to defend small business owners in courts as long as their business is legally incorporated."

TOM_form_the_peoples_industrial_vanguard: "Form the People's Industrial Vanguard"
TOM_form_the_peoples_industrial_vanguard_desc: "The workers are not insensible to the power of labor organization. Were our industrial workers to be federated by ideological trouble makers, the safety and prosperity of the republic would be gravely affected.\n\nOn the flipside, channeling the worker's energy to our own purpose would unleash great energy in the Bastillard Society's projects. We have thus begun a new union, the People's Industrial Vanguard. This group's leadership, drawn from industrial workers and state bureaucrats, will apply rational economic principles to determine where the average citizen is missing needed resources. Rights and privileges granted to industrial workers will be managed through back channels, to discredit mass action in favor of calm negotiations. And through all this, the work on the Republic's new urban industrial synthetic culture can proceed forward!"

TOM_the_three_year_plan: "The Three Year Plan"
TOM_the_three_year_plan_desc: "The Trinity Group is beginning to acquire industrial planning expertise through successive reforms and by attracting smart young minds. This expertise, combined with our new working ties to industrial workers, can be used as a starting point for a more ambitious industrial program.\n\nA three year plan is being prepared. Incorporating several fall back plans in case something goes awry, as well as clearly defined targets, this program will aim to further integrate the nation's industry together and build a strong Republic.\n\nWhile the main focus of the three year plan remains to be chosen, the Republic can move forward with the plan's beginning! Arise, Tomsk!"

TOM_blitz_the_cities: "Blitz the Cities"
TOM_blitz_the_cities_desc: "The city is the industrial worker's natural habitat. Its jungle of steel and concrete sees the urban citizen's nest; a thousand smokestacks mark the inhabitants' working places where resources, muscle and mind meet to generate progress.\n\nIt is thus a priority then that our cities are targeted by our three year plan. Better public transportations can help workers reach their factories. New schools can train the next generations. Parks and plazas can host the fruits of the growing urban cultural industry.\n\nSo many ruins, so much decay left over from decades of misery brought on by the German. No more! We shall build an earthly eden, where our citizens will live productive lives under our directives."

TOM_strike_the_farms: "Strike the Farms"
TOM_strike_the_farms_desc: "A society is three meals away from chaos. A lesson that neither the Tsar nor the French kings headed. A lesson we shall not forget.\n\nFarmers feed our city, and thus allow centralized government to operate. We can increase the farmer's food supply by equipping them with new tools and methods. Mechanizing agriculture, teaching modern techniques such as new fertilizer and pesticides, opening new agricultural schools. All these will increase yield and prosperity within the countryside.\n\nAn additional benefit is that a prosperous peasant is a happy peasant. Were there any trouble to break out in the cities, we can be assured that our rural citizens would happily side with the party of order against any upstart revolutionary. If cities are the future of the nation, farms are its past and present!"

TOM_hit_the_road: "Hit the Road"
TOM_hit_the_road_desc: "Modern medicine, it seems, does nothing but discover new illnesses of the heart, veins and arteries. Indeed, a malfunctioning cardiovascular system brings the body to its knees. Deprived of nourishment, the body withers and dies.\n\nOur roads must thus be the priority of our first three year plan. Our infrastructure is woeful, leaving our city isolated islands of civilization within the vast green sea of Siberia. We must repair crumbling roads, dilapidated railways and decrepit pipelines, before we do anything else.\n\nIn peacetime this infrastructure will help us develop our economy, and will thus be merely vital. In war times, however, being able to brought to bear the full extent of our supplies against the enemy will make or break the Republic's destiny."

TOM_multi_capacity_specialization: "Multi-Capacity Specialization"
TOM_multi_capacity_specialization_desc: "The needs of industry, infrastructure, and defense are all as one. They are all integral to one another, none could exist without the other. Given the innate relationships they all share, it only follows that they be centrally organized under the state. A centrally organized comity would allow us to more efficiently utilize the resources we have at our disposal. Additionally, such a syndicate would streamline our decision making process and allow us to better accommodate for each of the three interests."

TOM_mass_specialization: "Mass Specialization"
TOM_mass_specialization_desc: "Tomsk stands as one of the greatest bastions of intellectualism and rationality in all of Russia. The experts and geniuses that reside within our nations are some of the most gifted and intelligent anywhere. More importantly than that, there exists a generation of young Russians growing up in Tomsk that could stand to learn from these valuable academics we have access to. By encouraging them to participate in and specialize in the academic fields, we could raise a new generation of experts to bring Tomsk into the future."

TOM_the_industrial_aesthetic: "The Industrial Aesthetic"
TOM_the_industrial_aesthetic_desc: "Tomsk is an old city. Many of the buildings and landmarks of the city were built during the time of the Tsar, and while it is an honor to be able to house such precious historical architecture, especially considering how much of it was destroyed since the Russian Revolution, we must adapt for the modern era. By infusing the zeitgeist with refined aesthetics and culture that glorifies the industrial worker, we will hopefully be able to bring new energy and vitality to the workers as we work to improve industry in Tomsk. A new city landscape for a new Tomsk, and hopefully, in time, a new Russia."

TOM_the_united_labor_movement: "The United Labor Movement"
TOM_the_united_labor_movement_desc: "While many workers seem to have this idea in mind that the Bastillards are anti-union, this couldn't be further from the truth. We consider unions to play a valuable role in the economy, shielding the common man from the rapacity and greed of the businessmen and tycoons of Tomsk. To that end, we have endeavored to bring into law a variety of legal protections for unions and workers in Tomsk. The most important of these is our protection of sector wide bargaining. Hopefully, by enshrining sector wide bargaining into law, we will ensure that companies deal only in fair and efficient bargains with the public."

TOM_spiritual_efficiency: "Spiritual Efficiency"
TOM_spiritual_efficiency_desc: "With the government and economy reorganized, it's about time we get to working on Tomsk's culture. The government has the power to shape everything about a society, most importantly, it can shape how people think. We must shape people's thoughts in a way that encourages stability and favours progress. In order to achieve such a goal, we will embark upon a large-scale propaganda campaign, using posters, radion, cinema, and anything else we can influence. Hopefully, with some time, we can give the people of Tomsk a mindset that benefits everyone."

TOM_an_urbanized_atmosphere: "An Urbanized Atmosphere"
TOM_an_urbanized_atmosphere_desc: "The city will, by and large, become the center of Russian society as Russia becomes increasingly urbanized in the future. We experienced such a cultural shift decades ago during the reign of Bukharin as thousands moved into the cities to work in the factories. As Russia stabilizes, the city will again become the basis of Russian society, and when it does, there will be a flowering of urban intellectual culture unlike anything seen before in Russia's past. However, such an urban renaissance can only occur if we provide it the conditions to exist. To that end, we must build Tomsk into a world class city, or at least make it a rival of old Moscow."

TOM_synthesize_industrial_history: "Synthesize Industrial History"
TOM_synthesize_industrial_history_desc: "The history of industrialization abroad and in Russia will be vital to understand if we are to understand our modern society, especially if we are to combat the crass explanations put forth by the fascists and communists. Our current Marxist understanding of industrialization and revolution, something we have inherited from the Bukharin era, may not be incorrect, but rather incomplete. We should strive to deepen our understanding of the modern society and how it came to be by examining a variety of historical sources and theories."

TOM_a_common_culture: "A Common Culture"
TOM_a_common_culture_desc: "No matter who you are or where you live in Tomsk, we all can lay claim to a common history and struggle. We have all been shaped by the Siberian experiment and its effects, both good and bad. The common worker needs to understand that his leaders are just like him, and are working towards the same goals as he is. Furthermore, the common worker should understand that under our leadership Tomsk will not only survive, but it will thrive. We are the shining city on a hill, and, in time, our light will illuminate even the darkest corners of Russia."

TOM_a_new_industrial_system: "A New Industrial System"
TOM_a_new_industrial_system_desc: "All across Tomsk, there seems to be a vague sense of contentment and cautious optimism. For the first time in decades, it feels as if, at least in our small portion of Russia, we have achieved some sense of normality. The workers are working, industry is humming along, the new government and its agencies are working fine, and it seems as if the quality of life has started to increase for everyone. It feels like everything is going to be alright. It's been a long time since Russians have been able to feel this way."

TOM_Expanding_the_Core_desc: "During the unification wars, our military wasn't as powerful as our neighbors. The fight against the separatists and the rogue generals was made difficult by our rump military. It has been a rough start for our republican army, but one that must be addressed if we are to defend the territory we have conquered and continue expanding. Our military deficiencies are many, and there isn't any simple fix that will rectify it.\n\nThe military as a whole must be strengthened. Marshal Shaposhnikov has put forward a set of recommendations, on which all salons have been agreed upon. Such improvements will be expensive and time consuming, but necessary if we wish to one day reunite Russia."

TOM_Stronger_Armor_desc: "One of the most important lessons learned from the Second World War was the necessity of a modern tank corps. Panzers with more powerful guns and stronger armor than we'd ever seen before broke through our lines as if they were made of putty. We face similar difficulties today. The warlords who have managed to acquire some portion of the former Soviet Union's tank stockpile or figured out some way to produce their own are often the warlords causing us the most damage and casualties. An armoured corps will be vital in ensuring our continued military supremacy."

TOM_Better_weapons_desc: "The rifle is the most important tool the modern soldier has at his disposal, and the quality of a soldier's rifle is as important as the training he receives to use it. Even the greatest soldier armed with a musket wouldn't be able to do half as much damage in the field as an untrained conscript with a Kalashnikov. The more lead one can saturate the battlefield with, the greater the chance that something or someone is going to be hit with said lead. Our enemies across the border are surely working on newer and more advanced versions of the rifles they already have, and if we allow them to advance significantly past us, we may find ourselves overpowered in the field."

TOM_Improved_organization_desc: "Uniting our region of Central Siberia was no simple task. It required the collective efforts of thousands of soldiers and officers working in tandem in order to subdue the smaller warlords on our borders. The experience these soldiers and officers have gained thus far will prove vital as we attempt to improve our military in the future. We should tap on this experience through the promotion of our most experienced and successful officers and soldiers. Additionally, we should begin interviewing our soldiers to see what they believe needs improvement in our armed forces."

TOM_Republican_Eagles_desc: "For decades, the Luftwaffe has unleashed hellfire upon our Russian brethren in the west. There isn't a single Russian in those lands without a story to tell about the bombings. Men and women swept up in firestorms in cities, villagers seeing their village entirely destroyed in single carpet bombing, oil fields alight for days after a strategic bombing. All stories that support the common logic; If we lose the war in the air we lose the war and we lose it quickly. Aerial supremacy is of the utmost importance if we are to reunite Russia and one day combat Germany. Currently, our air force is a joke. We need to produce more planes and better quality planes if we are to catch up, and we need to do so rapidly."

TOM_Steel_Caravans_desc: "Every army marches on its stomach, and if you can't supply an army's ravenous appetite, it will die. Living in the rough and varied lands of Russia, logistics can be a major challenge. Supply lines often run long and snake-like, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The terrain and weather can also make transportation of materials and goods a slow and arduous task, with snowstorms and mud a very real and present threat. Mitigating these threats to our supply lines through the use of new technology is vital in this regard. Improved trucks with all terrain capability alongside trains which can pull ever larger loads will surely increase our logistical capacity."

TOM_Duty_to_the_Republic_desc: "Our army is an army of citizen soldiers. Our ranks are filled with men of the common folk, not elites from fancy school with special training. These are men who are doing their duty for the Republic, many of them volunteers. However, with each war our ranks dwindle further, even as our enemy's armies swell to ever larger sizes. We must go to the cities, the towns, and the villages of the Republic and ask them to help us defend our democracy. Those we help must help us defend the country if we are to survive."

TOM_A_nation_of_Yeomen_desc: "We are a nation of peasants and yeomen. The vast majority of our people live on farms or in isolated villages. This can make it quite difficult to call upon them for the military, for when a peasant with little knowledge of rifles or riflery is suddenly given a Kalashnikov and sent into battle, he has just as much of a chance of killing his own comrades as he does the enemy. In order to rectify this issue, we will begin mandating a few hours rifle training every week for men and women over sixteen. They will be given rifles and taught to shoot at targets in local shooting fields. Thus, when the time comes for them to fight, they will be able to slip into the soldiers role with ease."

TOM_Military_Education_desc: "Officers are one of the vital pieces of the modern military unit. His responsibilities include organizing his men, coordinating with other officers, and leading his men in battle. The qualities we believe to be of the greatest importance in executing those three tasks are initiative and creativity. Officers trained in our military academies have this idea of initiative and ingenuity drilled into them. For example, officers must be able to generate at least three solutions to any one test we present them, and execute it in a reasonable amount of time. There are hundreds of young, creative, and motivated soldiers in our armed forces who have the potential to be officers, but cannot afford the cost of schooling. We must make officer training and schooling available to these men so that we might capitalize on their skills and ambition."

TOM_Principle_of_Directive_management_desc: "The worst possible thing a military can do to itself is implement a rigid chain of command with strict oversight, where every action must be pre approved by the man above him. It can allow one to exercise great control over their military, but it also ensures that your lower ranks will be essentially braindead, and will limit your army's effectiveness. Instead, one should encourage their lower ranks to think for themselves as to how to interpret or apply strategic directives from above. The officers and troops on the ground often understand the immediate military situation a lot better than generals miles away from the front lines do. If your men can't function autonomously from high command, then the second your men are encircled or communications cut off, they are as good as dead."

TOM_Moderne_Amalgame_desc: "During the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars, the French military would often mix conscripts with their core army. In doing so, they ensured their conscripts would be brought quickly up to speed with the rest of the army, developing their skills through close proximity with experienced soldiers. We should endeavor to do the same, taking our conscripts and mixing them in with our professional army, bringing everyone up to speed on the front lines and saving the army plenty of time in training."

TOM_Support_weapon_corps_desc: "The two single greatest military innovations to come out of the 19th century was artillery and machine guns. These two weapons together would prove to be some of the most deadly and destructive in human history, with a death toll in the tens of millions and climbing. The ability to bombard an enemy position from miles away or to saturate an enemy position with hundreds of bullets in a matter of seconds is an incredible advantage. We must train our men on the use and maintenance of these weapons, including them as part of our mandatory military training program."

TOM_Military_healthcare_desc: "The men we have on the front line deserve the best medical care we have to offer. They risk their lives every day protecting us at home, the least we can do for them is provide decent healthcare. Additionally, in providing them better medical care, we minimize our losses and preserve valuable military experience that these soldiers accumulate on the battlefield. Even more importantly, providing them free military healthcare will boost morale in the armed forces, encouraging our men to fight harder and take bigger risks, knowing that they will be covered in the event of a medical emergency."
TOM_Military_healthcare_bonus: "Field Hospital and Logistics Technology"

TOM_Strong_Undaunted_Defiant_desc: "The Citizen Army stands strong! Following numerous reforms and expansions, we can now proudly say that our army is one of the greatest in all of Russia. Should any nation be so foolish as to attack us, we will have thousands of men, citizens of this great Republic, ready to crash upon the enemy like a tidal wave, sweeping through their lines and past them towards their capital. Should they survive that, our tanks divisions will pincer them from the sides as artillery rains down upon them like hail. Let it not be said Tomsk could not fight."

TOM_A_different_path_desc: "We reject the falsities of Marxism and Anarchism. We offer our own kind of workers republic, one unlike the Soviet Union's, from whence our republic was born, or the Siberian Black Army's, who, through the inevitability of human nature, was destined to fall back into despotism. Our republic is real, with legitimate democratic elections, rejection of the one party state, and with freedom of speech and expression for all citizens. Sadly, ours is a unique path, and there aren't many who follow our ways. Hopefully, however, in time we will be able to spread democracy to all of Russia."

TOM_Potential_Enemies_desc: "There aren't many democracies among the warring states of Russia. Most are communist one party states, fascist dictatorships, or military juntas, and all of which are hostile to our continued existence. Dealing with these threats will require the finesse of diplomacy as well as the muscle of the military. Any nation on our borders could be a possible enemy, it's up to our diplomats to find out who intends to be, and our military to make sure that they don't. As we trend ever closer towards the inevitable reunification of Russia, our list of enemies will only grow. It's important we be prepared."

TOM_Diplomatic_education_desc: "A republic only functions so long as the people stay involved and vote. However, this is only possible if the people stay informed. Too many of our citizens are either unaware or misunderstand of our foreign policy, with many believing lies about it in the absence of other information to the contrary. We should turn our foreign policy into more easily digestible information for the worker's consideration. We will explain our positions and reasoning for the actions we take with other nations on our borders and abroad, and hopefully our citizens will approve."

TOM_Potential_friends_desc: "Though we are mostly alone as a social democracy in Russia, there are still many socialist nations who might be amenable to us. Our government is often more moderate than many of these socialist nations, but we are certainly more similar to each other than to the various fascist and despotist nations in Russia. We should reach out to these socialist nations, and should our meetings go well, potentially establish some mutually beneficial relationships. In these cold, sprawling wastes we call home, danger abounds across every hill and behind every tree. We would do well to have some allies."

TOM_Central_Asian_Overtures_desc: "Are there any lands or peoples more intertwined with the history and peoples of Russia than those of Central Asia? For centuries we have traded with each other, fought against each other, and in past decades, with each other. These lands now lay as divided as Russia, but this state of affairs likely won't hold. There are various warlords and nation states who contend for dominance over the region, and who also might be acquiescent to an alliance or some sort of mutual defense pact. In any case, we must strive to appear as strong and favourable potential allies should such a Central Asian nation ever choose to support a contender for Russian reunification."

TOM_Through_Cathay_desc: "As we march onwards towards the reestablishment of Russian power on the world stage, we mustn't forget the nations with which we are to share borders. To our east lies one of the strongest nations in all the world at this moment: Japan. Over the course of several decades since the beginning of the century, Japan has slowly but surely conquered all of East Asia, most impressively pushing through most all of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia during the Second World War. However, despite Japan's impressive conquests, its grip over Asia slackens. The Chinese giant stirs, and Japan may not be prepared for what it will unleash. We should endeavor to endear ourselves towards China and the Chinese nations on the Sphere's periphery in the hopes that we might one day secure an alliance."

TOM_Toward_our_Destiny_desc: "Our Republic has surpassed any and all expectations others had of it. Time and time again, we have proven that not only is our way of government practical, but it is also righteous. We have conquered all of Central Siberia and in due time will move to conquer, whether diplomatically or militarily, the rest of Russia. Our march towards the reunification of all of Russia has now become, for all intents and purposes, unstoppable. Democracy will reign from Arkhangelsk to Petropavlovsk, and, one day, from Moscow to Vladivostok as well. Long live the Republic!"

TOM_Expanding_Politics_desc: "The Republic stands triumphantly over all its former territories!\n\nYet in this hour of victory, the Republic has perhaps never been more divided politically. Emboldened by years of independence, separatists, former siloviki, mutineers of Krasnoyarsk and anarchists of the SBA all mill around, uncertain of their future, and wary of our political system.\n\nOur innovative constitution is limited in some aspects, with its strict emphasis on the four greatest salon. At the same time, Pasternak's great constitution empowers us to experiment, to try new things, to welcome new ways of doing things.\n\nIf our great republican project is to endure, we must dare to dream ever bigger dreams, and inspire ever greater amount of people to believe in our ideals. The Republic must endure!"

TOM_Discord_In_The_Salons_desc: "The topic of how to integrate so many new citizens into the salon system has sparked quite the debates in the great salons of Tomsk. Some argue that the common constitution should be amended; others suggest political restrictions that would cast an ominous shadow over our democratic dream.\n\nIt is important to calm tempers and soothe the chaos within the salons. We will need every salon to operate at its peak if we're to offer a united front to calm the political storm. By appealing to everyone's heart and minds, we will be able to pool the vast talents of Tomsk together to figure out new solutions to the crisis."

TOM_Subversive_Parties_desc: "Already new citizens of the Republic are assembling to form new political parties. Some are fairly mundane liberal or conservative. Others are more extremist, such as a radical agrarian anarchist party, or are mere front for dangerous group of former military separatists or shadowy businessmen.\n\nTheir progress are limited in some way by Tomsk's constitution; all candidates have to be endorsed on the electoral list of one of the four great salons. We can further monitor the situation by putting dangerous parties and associations under police surveillance. This will go against our idealist principles, but be an invaluable source of information. Once a list of moderate and extremist factions is drawn up, we can encourage moderates to join the salon system, and try to eliminate extremist influence."

TOM_DecembristS_Urge_To_Calm_desc: "The Decembrist Society has long been seen as the odd man out in Tomsk, conservative and more prudent in its vision of the new idealist Republic. This prudence should not be mistaken for cowardice, however, as Dmitry Likhachyov is preparing a powerful speech arguing for calm and determination in maintaining the Republican system.\n\nTomsk's elites, he argues, are used to steering the ship of state, and a great deal of new talent has been developed since the end of the Provisional Government. This elite has the backing of the people, as the Republican system and the free society on which it stands are a public arena for ideas. As long as the citizens show faith in their institutions and leaders, those who try to divide the Republic are sure to fail!"

TOM_Modernists_Appeal_To_Reason_desc: "The Modernist Society, rallying around Sakharov and Kamov, have published an appeal to reason. They argue that to panic is not befitting of Tomsk's leadership, and that the problem can be attacked rationally and efficiently.\n\nBy compiling information on new political candidates and attacking radical network of influence, calmer and saner candidates can be integrated to the salon system while demagogues and problematic politicians can be left to the wayside. The only need the Republic has right now, the Modernist argue, is for its leadership to maintain a clear head."

TOM_HumanistS_Call_For_Compassion_desc: "The Humanist Society has launched a series of radio ads, read by Shostakovich and Vainberg. The two friends beg the Republic's citizens to show love and compassion to the new citizens.\n\nMany that live in the new territories have endured years of dictatorship by radical elements. Now they are once more in the Central Siberian Republic, and are afraid for their future. Is it so surprising, then, that many seek extremists and demagogues as patrons? We should not begrudge drowning men and women for seeking ways to stay afloat. Rather, we should dive into the tumultuous waters and show our fellow citizens that there are few reasons to be afraid."

TOM_BastillardS_Plea_For_Action_desc: "The Bastillard Salon has been at the forefront of the salon conferences in demanding action. Led by Kharms, the members of the Trinity Society have thundered publicly that now is not the time for indecision; the Republic fought hard to regain its former provinces. Now it must fight to integrate them, and to reduce its opposition to irrelevance.\n\nThe Salon system and Tomsk's rotating constitution are shields against extremism, granting the political caste supreme powers over proposing new laws to keep the Republic alive and strong. Now is the time to use these powers, to build a veritable rampart between the state and its enemies!"

TOM_Freedom_For_The_Independents_desc: "The Humanist and Decembrist Salons have united behind a joint proposal to rewrite the common constitution to make it easier for properly vetted political independents to run under any salon of their choosing. The four great salons would still be allowed final say over their presidential candidates and policy platforms; however independents would be allowed to have a full political career.\n\nThis proposal has been heavily criticized by the Bastillards for allowing populist poison to seep within Tomsk's system, and by the Modernists for weakening the party system. Nevertheless, the proposal is widely popular within the independent political crowd, and is likely to strengthen confidence in our Republic."

TOM_Work_To_Integrate_The_Independent_Into_The_System_desc: "The Bastillards and Modernists, strange bedfellows as they may be, have countered the Humanist and Decembrist's proposal with a policy program of their own. Their joint program would see vast infrastructure investment in the new territories, allowing new citizens to get involved within the Republic's society. Over time their attachment to old ideas and old political factions would weaken, aided by the work of our intelligence agency in dissolving radical organizations. This slow way would in time reduce greatly reduce independent pressure on the Republic's systems.\n\nThis method, counter the Decembrists and Humanists, is little more than mass deployment of bribes and pork barrel spending, to buy peace from the new citizens. Nevertheless, the Modernists and Bastillards are forging ahead with their own campaign to see this new legislation passed."

TOM_Advisory_Referendum_desc: "The common constitution allows for advisory referendums on thorny societal debates. A super majority of the deputies of the four salons now request an advisory referendum on the political issue: the referendum is to ask the citizens wether the Modernist-Bastillard program of long term integration, or the Decembrist-Humanist plan of independent political rights is to be made the law of the land.\n\nThe campaign has spread throughout old and new territories. As mandated by the common constitution, the sitting President is in no way forced to follow the referendum's results. §RRejecting the popular will, however, is likely to have grave consequences on our legitimacy.§!"

TOM_Novosibirsk_Conference_desc: "A great conference is to be held in Novosibirsk, under the recommendation of the Decembrist-Humanist program. There, independents of all sorts shall be brought within the salon system. Already a great number of political parties have come forward with candidate lists, applying for membership to a salon of their choosing.\n\nGiving out this much power to independents is likely to affect the political situation in the Republic for the coming years. To the plan's supporters, this is irrelevant. None should see their political freedom put on hold, no matter the circumstances. The nation trusts its people, and this trust shall be rewarded!"

TOM_Integration_Bureau_desc: "The government is to go ahead with the Modernist-Bastillard plan. To help along with this, a new set of "Integration Bureau" will be deployed in all new territories. These bureaus will be staffed by neutrally appointed bureaucrats, and be tasked with aiding the integration of the new territory into the Republic's economy. Poverty, joblessness and political radicalism are to be fought hard against.\n\nThe Republic must do right by its new children. All shall be nourished, all shall be taught, and all shall be made proud to live in our great nation! Let cynics say what they may, none shall be left behind!"

TOM_Dealing_With_Extremists_desc: "The government has now gone ahead with a program to tackle the political crisis. The wind has been taken out of much of our opposition. However, some determined critics of our Republic remain. Hardliner militarists in Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk, intractable critics of the late CSR, anarchists remnants in the east, all united in their hatred of our government.\n\nDiscord has once again broken out in the four salons over the topic of censure. Many argue that the Republic has no place for extremism, and that the voices of these enemies of the state should be silenced. Others point out that with our new approach to the political crisis, the opposition's power base dwindles day by day. Better to let the radicals rage to an ever shrinking crowd.\n\nThe President is likely to be asked to make a final decision."

TOM_New_Friends_In_The_Salons_desc: "The four great salons have opened new branches all across the nation, and scores of curious citizens have begun attending them. Not all of our new residents find the salon system pertinent, but enough do that the four great societies have seen their membership swell.\n\nDozens of new thoughts, artistic techniques and political programs have begun swirling around each salon. Despite the grumbling of the old guard, the growth of the salon system is in the long run the likeliest candidate to fully resorb the political crisis, and for that reason it could be a good idea for the central government to aid its spread throughout the nation.\n\nArts, science and politics shall be democratized! A new set of citizen assemblies are given birth throughout Central Siberia!"

TOM_Resolving_The_Political_Crisis_desc: "Through cooperation and disputes, the four great salons have managed to weather this first political challenge to Pasternak's new republic.\n\nThe issues of independent politicians and of cynicism in our nation are far from solved. Left to fester, these twin threats could end up fatally undermining our idealistic republic. This is no reason to despair, for our great democratic experiment also gives us the tools needed to weather this storm.\n\nWe must stand vigilant, remain true to ourselves, and open to compromise. Pasternak's legacy must endure, and as its guardians, the four great salons must constantly strive to rise above petty politics to ensure that the flame of idealism burns in Central Siberia!"

TOM_The_Peoples_Spring_desc: "Is it not beautiful, what we have achieved? A government, beholden to the people and in support of the common worker, managing to carve out a place in Central Siberia. Years ago, such a thing would have been treated as no more than mere fantasy. A pipe dream, dreamt up in the ivory towers of Tomsk by the intellectuals with knowledge of the real world. Yet, here we stand today, able to proudly say that we are citizens of a free republic in Russia. Many of our citizens bled for this achievement, and many more will surely die in the coming wars to reunite Russia. However, at least for a moment, our people are witnessing a Russian spring blooming in Siberia."

TOM_The_Great_Labor_Conference_desc: "The Great Labor Conference is upon us! Citizens, young and old, are invited to take part in a grand meeting of workers, industrialists, capitalists, and more! Discussion will be varied, covering topics such as the implementation of new technologies and labor practices in industry, the extent of government involvement in the economy, privatization of certain nationalized government assets, and the direction and focus of the national economy going forward. All are encouraged to come and impart their opinions and feelings on these most important discussions."

TOM_To_The_Victors_desc: "In our conquests of the various warlords and statelets of Central Siberia we've come into possession of a great deal of industrial machinery. Much of it is still operational, and what isn't can likely be repaired. We must begin cataloging and redistributing this machinery. The lion's share of it will be given to the worker's communes for their use in localized production. The next largest portion will go to the government for our needs in construction and manufacturing. The remaining pieces will be auctioned off at low prices to the capitalists in the nation, bringing the government a small profit and the capitalists more means with which to produce goods."

TOM_Rights_And_Duties_desc: "Every relationship in life is a game of give and take. The same applies to the relationship between a government and its citizens. A government is obliged to maintain the roads, work to keep the crime rate low with police, and protect the citizens from outside threats like an invading nation with a military. In return, the people are compelled to pay taxes, go to school, participate in the military, and most importantly, vote. So long as both parties continue to do their part and uphold the relationship, the nation will thrive."

TOM_The_Great_Clock_desc: "The citizens of our great Republic can be considered as cogs to a great clock. Each one of them minute in nature, serving a purpose as inscrutable to them as the purpose of timekeeping might seem to the tiniest gear nestled deep inside the machinery of the clock. However, every one of those gears and cogs working to keep the clock ticking are as vital to the clock's function as the arms on the face of the clock. Each one serves an invaluable purpose, just as every one of our citizens does for our grand democracy. Everyone has a place in society, and every person serves to make our nation greater."

TOM_Regional_Synergy_desc: "One of the great difficulties of Russian geography is how isolated our various peoples can be. Whether they be separated by mountains, forests, or just the great distances of the Steppe, it is often a laborious task to bring an item from point A to point B. Such separation and isolation of our population makes ruling over any great portion of Russia difficult, hinders our industrial development, and encourages separatism. In order to combat the various issues that arise from our isolation, we should begin patching the railways systems of our disparate lands into one large, cohesive railways system. Just as a seamstress might repair a sweater, we will sew our lands together with rail."

TOM_Improved_Healthcare_desc: "If there is one issue on which most all citizens are united, it's that our healthcare system could be improved. While the mechanism that provides the insurance and funding for healthcare is functional, the hospitals themselves are grossly out of date and in need of renovations. Machinery that's decades old, medicine that's long since expired, and far worse have been discovered in hospitals across the nation. While this may have sufficed in previous decades, we now live in a rapidly modernizing Russia where such inadequacy will no longer do. Hospitals will be allocated greater funding, and a new oversight committee will handle the further modernization of our nation's healthcare facilities."

TOM_Family_Subsidies_desc: "Despite conjecture to the contrary, we are of the opinion that aid to the poor and ailing in Russia does more good than it does harm. By implementing a system of sustained fiscal stimulus into the poorest regions of our nation, we can raise the overall productivity and quality of life in those regions, eventually bringing them up to speed with the rest of Russia. By providing the poor family money with which to pay for their food and buy coal for their furnaces, we free up capital that they can spend on other products and appliances. By increasing consumption we boost industry, increase standard of living, and this upward spiral snowballs until the fiscal aid isn't even needed anymore."

TOM_Guns_Of_The_Citizens_desc: "Our citizens are no strangers to the military. A good portion of them are serving right now, serving on the front lines or guarding the border, protecting us from whatever enemy might try to extinguish our light. A good deal more would certainly be willing to enlist and serve if not for one great problem our military has. It needs more arms. Guns, artillery, support equipment, you name it, we need it. Our citizenry may be ready and eager to serve, but our military just can't have them without any equipment. While we may be a peaceful people, our neighbors are assuredly not. If the need ever arises for a mass conscription and arming of the populace, we must be ready, which is why a large investment is needed in our military industry immediately."

TOM_Bureau_Of_Military_Industrial_Development_desc: "Everything in warfare is industrialized now. Whether it be the truck one rides in to get to the battlefield, the scout plane one uses to scope out the battlefield, or the tank one drives to fight on the battlefield, all of it originates in factories far behind the front lines. One simply cannot do without these modern machines of war, and attempting to do so would be foolish. A new bureau is to be created which will manage the production and distribution of all the trucks, tanks, and aeroplanes coming out of those factories behind the front lines. Even if we can't beat the enemy with the quality of our weapons, we will at least be able to out-produce them."

TOM_A_Great_Symphony_desc: "Our expert handling of the economy has resulted in a boom! Several sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, utilities, and finance have breached double digits in growth. With this explosive economic rise, we have seen a great deal of financial resources flooding our coffers. With these newfound resources, we can continue to invest back into our own economy, increasing quality of life, lowering unemployment, reducing crime, increasing stability, and boosting economic expansion in our country even further. A great symphony of steel and steam is coming together, and the changes this melody will bring Russia are unfathomable."

TOM_Chair_Of_Economical_Research_desc: "As our national economy grows and diversifies, it will become increasingly unwieldy and susceptible to external market forces. The government has an obligation to the people to mitigate the influence and severity of these market fluctuations on the economy. Our method of combating this will be through greater integration and development of our domestic economy. A new governmental department will be formed, with the intent of further integrating our worker's coops, private businesses, and government industry. By encouraging further interdependence and communication between these sectors of the economy, we will be able to solidify our national economy."

TOM_The_Decembrist_Forebears_desc: "The Decembrist Society takes its names after the original Decembrists, all noble veterans of the Napoleonic Wars. Just like our forebears, we shall fight tyranny wherever we find it!\n\nThe original Decembrist led and fought with humble Russian peasants. On the soil of Europe noble and common blood fell and mixed, drawing the two Russian societies closer together. It is time for the Republican Army to adopt this ethos. Shaposhnikov's core army will lead thousands of recruits from all over the Republic in times of war. By supplementing our veterans in time of crisis with a flood of soldiers, we will be able to trap our enemies between a hardened, mechanized anvil, and a vast hammer of artillery and light infantry.\n\nThe common people look to their political leaders in time of peace for guidance; in times of war they shall look up to find the Republic's elite leading them to glory and freedom!"

TOM_Expand_The_Military_Academy_desc: "It is a grim business to study the dismal science. We cannot, however, let our enemies outdo us in the grim art of causing death and devastation.\n\nThe military academy in Tomsk will be expanded, and students of the military sciences will be incorporated into our army's planning. Modern ways of organizing forces will be analysed; new ideas about the distribution of support equipment at various levels will be tested; innovative ways to use psychology will be used to enhance the deadliness of artillery barrages.\n\nOur adversaries have oft mocked our intellectuals. It is us that shall have the final laugh when we unleash our mastery of the military sciences upon the battlefield."

TOM_Clean_Conscription_desc: "If our army is to rely on masses of conscripts, it is important we make it clear to the people what we expect of them. Drafting peasants during the critical months of harvest, or conscripting urban workers haphazardly and making them lose their jobs are both ways in which the common man will grow to hate and resent military service.\n\nWe will maintain clear and accurate lists of men of military service age. From there, regional bureaus will seek to accomodate families and villages so as to avoid depleting local manpower in inopportune moments. Men joining the army will be given precise enlistment contracts, and none shall see their military service prolonged arbitrarily.\n\nIf we ask the people to give us something, the least we can do is be precise about our needs!"

TOM_Special_Forces_desc: "Born from experiments in the Second World War, most modern armies feature at least some special purpose troops. Well trained and equipped with specialized equipment, special forces operatives can appear behind enemy lines and perform surgical cuts to enemy material and personnel. After all, an army operates in coordination, much like the human body. Is it so surprising, then, that the right cut at the wrong place can induce catastrophic consequences?\n\nThe Republic shall invest in its special forces, and incorporate elements from special force training into regular forces. Far better after all to experiment novel tactics with small groups of smart and dedicated soldiers, before spreading information to the rest of the army."

TOM_A_New_Cavalry_desc: "Marshal Shaposhnikov's modernization and mechanization of the Republican Army has united several excellent veteran battalions into the embryonic form of a respectable armored corps. It is now time for us to build on his efforts and develop a formidable group of armored divisions! These soldiers will form the spearhead of the Republican Army; clad in steel and equipped with devastating fighting power, this modern cavalry will be a formidable asset for our army.\n\nSome question the idea of putting most of our veteran soldiers in armored divisions. The Decembrist Society believes that the force multiplication of mobility and firepower will be best applied by our best soldiers. The versatility of our tank divisions will allow us to reinforce failing defenses as well as strike vulnerable enemy positions at rapid speed. Let us renew the awe inspiring shock of the cavalry of old!"

TOM_Skirmishers_desc: "The illusions of the modern landscape reveal themselves a few hundred meters beyond roads and railways. Hills, forests, rivers and swamps make progression through nature unaltered a difficult proposition.\n\nFortunately, the common Russian peasant makes a living from his comprehension of the environment. Many citizens from the countryside are used to exploring forests looking for mushrooms or animal meat. In winter as in summer, these hardy men and women travel across the land to make a living. Their experiences can be incorporated into our reconnaissance regiments. While we may not always fight in Central Siberian nature, the institutional attitude of being prepared for anything will let our infantrymen go where they please and strike the enemy wherever it is most advantageous!"

TOM_Private_To_Marshall_desc: "Some accuse the Decembrist Society of elitism, of fermenting a new nobility able to lord over the common man. We deeply regret this misunderstanding. As our Decembrist forebears once sought to break down the walls between common and noble folk, so does our modern organization strive to unify all social groups of the Republic.\n\nIt is this crucial that we look for talent within the ranks. Humble soldiers should not be precluded from leading other men if they show promise. No matter a man's social group, out in the field there are only brothers leading brothers to defend the Republic. We shall promote the best of the best, and order our army accordingly!"

TOM_Militarize_The_Elite_desc: "Russia has a long and storied military history. Its leaders were once expected to know military life, and it was a rare noble family that did not sacrifice at least one military hero to the nation.\n\nTomsk has had a reputation as a city of artists, poets and scientists within the CSR. It is time for us to trade the pen for the sword. For Russia to be saved and for light and hope to endure, we must accept into our hearts sorrow, hardship, and the possibility of death on the battlefield. By once more militarizing the upper rungs of the Republican society, we seal our covenant with the common people in blood. The blood shed by the enemies of Russia, and the blood that shall be lost in liberating it.\n\nWe must fight, so that one day songs and poems replace explosions and gunshots across the Russian lands."

TOM_The_Republican_Artillery_desc: "It is the great axiom of modern warfare that firepower kills. The vast, vast majority of casualties on armies of the twentieth century result from artillery shells of various sizes, lobbed from great distance.\n\nThis lesson was taught to Europe by the little corporal himself, and a century later the armies of the Great War fielded gun batteries that would no doubt have impressed Napoleon himself. We shall place the Republican Army in this tradition by maintaining a permanent artillery corps, to be placed at our conscripted infantry's disposal. The long guns of the Republic will be our infantry's swords and shields!"

TOM_Towards_A_New_Patriotic_War_desc: "It was not the decrepit Habsburg Empire that ended Napoleon's rampage through Europe, nor the haughty militarist Prussians, nor even the sophisticated and modern British. The Grande Armée was fatally wounded by the Russian nation through its long advance through Russia and at the Battle of Borodino, never recovering its prestige.\n\nIn the other Russian warlords and in the Wehrmacht we face a different, more dangerous foe. The former will stop at nothing to break Russian democracy; the latter will mortgage their own future if given the chance to finally destroy the Russian people. A new, even more terrible Great Patriotic War is on the horizon. One we shall win! Russia will never bend to tyrants!"

TOM_The_Siberian_Phoenix_desc: "The fall of the Russian Republic in 1918 shocked the world; it harbinged the rise of the first communist nation, and the end of a brief experiment in Russia of republican democracy. In the aftermath of the fall of Bukharin's union many assumed that the Central Siberian Republic would form the kernel of a new Russian Republic. When it too, fell, all wrote off the rump government in Tomsk as likely to fall within the year.\n\nNow the Central Siberian Republic is back, stronger than ever! The world shall hear of this good news, as we try to make the best of our isolated and land locked position to reach the wider world. It is time for a diplomatic charm offensive."

TOM_Far_From_Friends_desc: "Europe is in agony, the continent of the enlightenment critically wounded by fascism, few nations spared from gangrene as the Third Reich agonizes. Yet, one beacon of the old West remains beyond the Atlantic, the United States of America.\n\nThe Americans are not perfect, and they are very far from us. This shall not preclude us from reaching out to them. Any financial aid or scrap of recognition we can deprive our rivals from will go a long way toward helping us reach the top of the Russian unification."

TOM_Close_To_Rivals_desc: "To the east, on the shores of the Pacific, and to the west, near the great Ural Mountains, various Russian states are emerging from the Russian Anarchy. Our intelligence agencies have reported a range of candidates for Russian unification, from professional remnants of the Red Army, to military juntas of the type we found in Novosibirsk, to things as far afield as German death cults and theocratic popular uprisings.\n\nWe must be ready for anything. Being able to negotiate diplomatic integration of any moderate republic we find into our own government would be a great boon. Being forced in a fight to the death for the future of Russia would be of great danger to our mission. We must be prepared."

TOM_A_Declaration_Of_Intention_desc: "Many we encounter have heard of the transformation of the Central Siberian Republic and ask of our commitment to democracy and Russian freedoms. To clarify the purpose of our mission to expand the Russian Federation, we shall present a declaration of intention.\n\nAll of the salons in Tomsk fight to maintain the flame of democracy in Russia. Of all the political associations, the Decembrist Society is the one most dedicated to the people's freedom, to the respect of tradition and to the embrace of modernity and western ideas. Wherever the Republic meets friends of liberty, it shall embrace them with open arms. Our enemies should not mistake this kindness for naivety; the errors of the past have taught us well. All threats to democracy will be terminated in the appropriate manner, their perpetrators judged and reeducated."

TOM_The_Northern_Path_desc: "It is not true in a strictly speaking way that we are a landlocked nation. To the north is the Arctic Sea, one of the hardest to navigate bodies of water in the world. Frozen most of the year, and barely reachable from the east or west, our distant northern shores are a mixed blessing.\n\nHowever, it is important we make use of all we have. Flying a great circle route over the northern Arctic allows diplomatic planes to significantly cut down their travelling distance. Local fishermen also extract stocks of food that can supplement our resources. Settlement like Dikson on the Arctic shores and villages among the Yenisei Gulf can serve as refuelling points for planes and ships in the region."

TOM_The_Southern_Path_desc: "The recent years have not been kind to Central Asia. With the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the western parts of Central Asia such as Kazakhstan have fallen to warlordism and banditry. As to the east, Xinjiang lives haphazardly in Tokyo's orbit, its daily affairs left to local strongmen as has been tradition since the beginning of the Chinese Warlord era.\n\nCentral Asia is also one of our few ties to the outside world. Through Xinjiang we can reach the Sphere's leadership. To the west in resurgent Kazakhstan, local trade and air hubs have reached much deeper into the south, to Persia and India. It is a long path to the wider world, but one we have to traverse as long as the shores of the Pacific are denied to us. Time to start visiting local leaders with gifts and diplomats, to see what kind of deal we can reach."

TOM_The_Russian_Federation_Is_On_The_March_desc: "The world thought us buried. Thought the Central Siberian Republic a failed state, a mere moment of calm in the chaos and horror of the Russian Anarchy. Thought the militarists, the anarchists and the other separatists had fatally wounded Pasternak's dream.\n\nThey shall dismiss us no more! The Central Siberian Republic of old was reborn in war, its egg warmed by the hope and determination of the common Russian people. Our state forms the embryo of a new Russia, one determined to fight for freedom and equality for all our citizens. Let our enemies quake in fear! Let our friends rejoice! The Russian Republic is on the march."

TOM_Legacy_Of_The_Workers_Uprising_desc: "It's imperative for our long term survival that our citizens believe that the economy of our nation is fair and functional. The Workers' Uprising was a direct result of our failure to convince them of that fact. Many of those workers that participated in the revolt had been exploited by the government and private businesses during our expansions on the Siberian Plan, working long hours and hard shifts, boosting overall production and mineral efficiency, only to get nothing in return. Is it any wonder they were so angered? In any case, we must begin to improve the economy and quality of life in our nation so as to avoid such violence in the future."

TOM_Watch_The_Private_Sector_desc: "The private sector is much like a toddler, capable of bringing one great joy, but when not handled correctly can make your life a living hell, an outcome we'd much like to avoid. As we attempt to reform the economy and implement good policy, we must be cognizant of the ever ravenous and greedy businessmen in the private sector. If, during our attempts to deregulate the market or implement new taxation policies, we leave even a minor loophole or misplaced comma, we could end up losing tens of millions of dollars. We mustn't let the private sector get ahead of us."

TOM_Rationalize_Soes_desc: "The government is a large and unwieldy thing. Like a giant, its motions are clumsy and sweeping, and often inefficient. Such is the case with many of the government's State Owned Enterprises, or SOE's for short. These government run organizations suck up millions of dollars every year, and we seem to have accumulated quite a few of them. It's time to cut back and slim down the government. We will have to analyze the functions and success of our various enterprises and decide what to merge, what to privatize, and what to close down."

TOM_Relief_For_Farmers_desc: "Heavy fighting in recent years has disrupted many rural areas within our nation. Fields have been shelled, tread over, and in some rare cases, gassed as well. Crop production has fallen across the nation and many farmers are unable to make ends meet as a result of circumstances entirely out of their control. We must work to aid these ailing farmers. Free materials and supplies for rebuilding will be made available to all farmers whose livelihoods have been destroyed. Additionally, tax exemptions will be offered to farmers affected as they work to repair their farms."

TOM_Report_From_The_Commission_On_Industry_desc: "A few months back, a commission was created with the purpose of identifying immediate issues that need resolving in our industrial sector. The commission recently published a report discussing the various problems our nation has, and they are immense. Massive damage is being inflicted on our environment, workers' rights are being abused, and poorly maintained, in some areas nonexistent, infrastructure is choking transportation around the nation. The issues presented have no simple solutions, and balancing the economy with other interests of the nation will prove difficult."

TOM_Integrating_The_Siberian_Plan_desc: "The Siberian Plan was the final legacy of Nikolai Bukharin. In the final years of the Second World War and a few months afterwards, Bukharin had laid the groundwork for a massive industrial system to be created far behind the front lines and protected by the Urals in Siberia. Significant progress had been made with the plan, but ultimately, with Bukharin's fall, it was abandoned. Now with our ascent, however, not only will we finish what he started, we will use modern technology and industrial techniques to expand the plan far beyond what was ever planned for it."

TOM_Environmental_Rights_desc: "Although the Siberian Plan has done much to amplify our productive capability and provide us an industrial base, it's also had numerous effects on the environment. Our scientists have noted increasing contamination of rivers, lakes, and other sources of drinking water for the public, increased rates of acidic rain, and vastly increased amounts of smog. Many in our salon have taken issue with the vast and increasing destruction of the environment that our industrialization efforts have brought, and demanded that action be taken. It may be time to take a stand on environmental rights and issue regulation to protect our natural resources."

TOM_Workers_Rights_desc: "The delicate balance between workers' rights and business owners' profits is a fickle thing. While instinctively, one might automatically side with the workers, it's important to remember without the capitalists, there would be no investment into the economy, save government expenditures. However, treading too much on workers' rights could lead to riots, rebellions, and even revolution if we're not careful. And so the government walks this fine line, attempting to appease both sides and not hand to much power to either faction."

TOM_A_Light_Touch_desc: "The free market is one of the most powerful and transformative forces on Earth. In just a few decades, the free market turned the backwater agrarian United States into a global industrial superpower. Being that Russia was first under communist rule and then unsplit between dozens of warlords, we were never able to experience these transformative effects. Now, however, we've reunited a significant portion of Russia and have built an economic framework in which the free market can thrive. It's time to sit back, relax, and let the free market do its work."

TOM_Healing_The_Land_desc: "Decades of wars, roving raider bands, and smog-inducing industrialization have taken a mighty toll on these lands. Forests lie barren, destroyed by years of heavy fighting and destruction. The links of rail and road that once held the nation together are now disjointed and fragmented. However, it doesn't have to stay this way. Peace and civil governance is returning to these lands, and so too does the opportunity to fix all that we've wronged. The forests can be regrown, and the new railways put down to sew the nation together again. What point is there in reuniting Russia if all that's left is ash?"

TOM_Toward_Modernity_Confidently_desc: "The Russian peasant and worker is a cautious optimist. He must be, or else he wouldn't be able to survive in bleak lands such as these. However, in recent years, with our slow advance across Russia, he may finally have reason to be. Our state is a democracy, with liberty for all. Our industry is advanced, and sits atop the sturdy basis of the Siberian Plan. Our free market policies have opened the country to foreign investments and new technologies. Most importantly of all, under our rule, peace and civility is returning to his lands. The barbarous Russia of old is gone. A new, modern Russia approaches."

TOM_Sword_Of_The_Free_Man_desc: "No man is entitled to the blessings of freedom unless he be vigilant in its preservation. If our great republic is to survive, we will need to greatly expand our army and its capabilities. Though our small beacon of democracy has come a long way, the Unification Wars are far from over. As long as Russia remains divided, we must prepare for the possibility that, even against fellow democratic nations, we will have to fight. We must endeavor to field an ever more powerful, larger, and modern military, capable of dealing with every possible threat."

TOM_The_Jotunns_Chariots_desc: "The future of large scale land warfare is in armor. Tanks, IFVs, APCs, and all the rest are increasingly going to become the standard in this mechanized world of ours. The advantage that thick armor and piercing explosives offer on the battlefield is immense, and necessary if going up against similar units. Ideally, by the time we confront Germany, we should hope to have fully mechanized elite forces to combat Germany's large panzer fleet. If not, we may find ourselves in the Second World War all over again."

TOM_We_Fly_Where_We_Please_desc: "If we control the skies, we control the war. Unfortunately, we don't control the skies right now. Our air force is not only pitiful in numbers, but wildly outdated, with some of our oldest aircraft having been manufactured as early as the late 1930s. German jets and bombers are leagues ahead of ours, several times faster and equipped to fly at altitudes thousands of meters higher. We need to research jet engine technology and advance our air capabilities, if for no other reason than to gain a leg up on neighbors."

TOM_No_Matter_The_Terrain_desc: "Historically, geography has been a major limiting factor in warfare. Assaulting across a river, up into a mountain, or into forests would give your enemy's a major advantage over you. This holds true even today, however, modern technology can help mitigate the problem. Come across a river? Deploy an AVLB. Attacking a mountain position? Use modern rappelling devices. Attacking into a forest? Use air cavalry to smoke them out. Better training and technology will ensure that in no cases will these natural impediments ever slow us down."

TOM_The_Zealous_Elite_desc: "Instead of making an ever larger and more cumbersome military, we should instead be focusing on creating a smaller, better trained, and better equipped army. The advantage of this is that our forces will pack a hell of a stronger punch in whatever battles they are to fight in and will also take far fewer casualties as a result of having more experience and material at their disposal. Furthermore, we will be able to select only the best of our citizenry for the army, choosing only the most loyal and talented. Our new army will be fanatical in its defense of the Republic, vowing hatred of the Republic's enemies and accepting no failure or surrender in the face of overwhelming odds."

TOM_Modern_Knights_desc: "One of the greatest draws of Knighthood for those in the Middle Ages was the prestige that the rank drew. Knights were elite forces, so distinguished as to be considered a form of lower nobility. We must do the same for our army. Serving should be thought of as the highest honor and treated with the highest respect. We should portray our army as accepting only the best, the crème de la crème. If we can convince the people of this fact, then we will be able to greatly increase the number of volunteers to choose from. After all, if the people believe a path to prestige and respect lies in service, they will surely enlist."

TOM_Valkyries_Of_The_Sky_desc: "Air cavalry has proved one of the most impressive military innovations of the past several years. Used extensively during the South African War, their utility and efficiency has led to its mass adoption in major militaries across the world. If we wish to bring our forces towards military dominance in Russia, we should adopt this new and promising helicopter technology and integrate it into our forces. We have reason to believe that these air cavalry units will vastly increase our combat capabilities."

TOM_A_Shining_City_desc: "Tomsk, the city on a hill, the shining city from which all of Russia shall be illuminated. A republic of thinkers, dreaming of a better world, not just for Russia, but for all peoples. It's time we reach out to the world, to spread our message of benevolent intellectualism. We dream of a future where the blue collar worker is as secure in his livelihood as the white collar worker, of a future where all humanity is united in democratic self governance. A lofty ideal to be sure, but one that may be possible in due time with the right allies."

TOM_Render_Unto_Caesar_desc: "The greatest driver of any modern economy is credit. The ability for Russian entrepreneurs to be able to take out loans on the promise of future profitability for their companies is massive. It would spur massive growth in the economy as more secure foreign banks help Russian businessmen grow their companies and the overall economy to heights never seen before. However, this is only possible if Russia breeches the international financial markets. Our current credit rating is low amongst most major international banks, and they aren't willing to invest and possibly lose money on a nation in such a vulnerable position like our own. We work towards making friends in the financial community and see if we can change their minds."

TOM_Cultural_Missions_desc: "Russia has been stuck in the 1940s for decades now as nations around the world moved forwards into the modern era of today. They have evolved scientifically, culturally, and economically in ways that seem radical to us. We should send our diplomats to these foreign countries to explore how their society has changed, and what changes we might expect in our own culture and society as we industrialize and shift into the global middle, and possibly even upper, class. Hopefully, such preparation will allow us to preempt some of the worst growing pains."

TOM_The_Foreign_Policy_Council_desc: "As our nation rapidly approaches preeminence among the various Russian powers, we will increasingly find ourselves in contact with foreign powers, whether diplomatically, economically, or even culturally. We should assemble the greatest minds of our nation in a council to help chart a course for the nation in managing the interests of the various powers we will be working with and against in the future. This council will further help us to decide what kind of foreign policy goals we should have with our neighbors and interests abroad, like encouragement of foreign investment, technology sharing, and mutual economic agreements."

TOM_Hoping_For_The_Best_desc: "Our state has grown strong as a contender for reunification, and many warlords have taken notice. As our armies continue their unstoppable march in nearly every direction, several smaller warlords have contacted us about the possibility of truce, or even a peaceful reunification. If we were to be able to negotiate the peaceful return of these smaller nations into the fold, that would greatly increase both our standing and the value of these regions, given that they will suffer no damage from war. We should open up diplomatic channels with these smaller neighbors and see what we might be able to do."

TOM_Preparing_For_The_Worst_desc: "By failing to prepare, one is preparing to fail. Though we have only hopes of peaceful reunification, we must prepare for the possibility that negotiations will end in war. Plans must be drawn up for the various scenarios that might play out, such as a northern armoured assault or southern infantry thrust. Any good diplomatic negotiation is backed with the implication of a nation's military power, so we should have our forces at the ready on our borders. Should diplomacy break down and war is declared, we will be ready to move in at a moment's notice."

TOM_Truth_Unshackled_desc: "Our republic stands for all that is good in humanity. We stand for truth, justice, and democratic self governance. There are nations and people in Russia who are fundamentally opposed to these concepts, who would seek for nothing more than to enslave all the people of Russia under a singular dictatorial rule. We are those who stand against them, the righteous and the moral, whose obligation is to spread such virtue to all of Russia. Our foes cannot expect to hold us off for long."

TOM_Bukharins_Inheritor_desc: "Though Bukharin's sins were many, his legacy in the Siberian Plan was great. A massive industrial complex, spanning the breadth of Siberia, complete with resource extraction operations, infrastructure, and modern factories of their time. Though the Soviet Union collapsed before any great use could be made of it, our nation happened to coalesce right on top of it in Tomsk. With the vast economic resources of the Siberian Plan at our disposal, we have a strong basis on which to form the rest of our modern economy."

TOM_Talk_To_The_Worker_desc: "As we learned decades ago during the October Revolution, to ignore the worker and his needs is to invite revolution and bloodshed. We must consider what we can provide the worker, after all, all of our work in developing our industry, the Siberian Plan, and every other economic endeavor we've embarked upon has been for the benefit of the people. What use will it have all been if it's just the capitalists and industrialists reaping the benefits of our collective hard labour? In any event, we must be wary that the common worker doesn't get too displeased."

TOM_Tea_With_The_Bosses_desc: "Just as we must not ignore the workers, we would be remiss to ignore the thoughts and wishes of the captains of our industry. It is imperative that we move forward developing our economic plans in tandem with the market so that our nation's businesses and economy flourish as we implement the Central Siberian Plan.\nLet's sit down and have some lengthy discussions with the most powerful businessmen throughout Central Siberia. If they bring a willingness to cooperate and a good faith in our desire to help the economy grow, we'll bring the tea."

TOM_Hear_From_The_Bureaucrats_desc: "Above all, Central Siberia under our vision is run by and relies on our extensive civil service. In order for them to carry out the industrialization plan, we need to start assigning and delegating like crazy. But before we can rush into things, we need to hear what the situation on the ground is for our bureaucratic staff. Every last drop of information regarding the status of our bureaucracy and our current progress on industrialization must be submitted posthaste. Give us numbers, give us stats, give us everything you have! Move it, people!"

TOM_A_Fair_Deal_desc: "We've heard from both workers and businessmen from all over Central Siberia. Unfortunately, as expected, their desires do not always overlap. In fact, there is a significant amount of conflict between these two groups, and we need to smooth things over as soon as possible.\nOur government is beginning to strictly enforce an extensive arbitration process that will hold hearings to resolve disputes between the workers and their bosses. Workers being forced to do too much overtime in the name of industrialization? Arbitrate. Bosses angry at their employees for demanding too much paid leave? Arbitrate. Any other problem? You guessed it: Arbitrate.\nBy staying out of these matters and allowing a neutral third party to resolve any and all issues, both worker and businessman will say we have given them a fair deal."

TOM_Calibrated_Performance_desc: "The amount of numbers being crunched, buildings being constructed, permits being granted, goods being produced, and paperwork being filed is beyond overwhelming. In order to help businessmen, bureaucrats, and academics alike maintain and adjust ongoing plans as necessary, we will consolidate all of our data into one publicly available database that anyone can access. No doubt we will need to assign several civil servants to manage this data store full time, as it will be massive and constantly growing."

TOM_Two_Years_To_Modernity_desc: "Great progress is already underway with the revamped Central Siberian Plan, but both it and our nation are rather outdated. If we want to someday become a great economic power, we will need to modernize at an unprecedented speed. Our government will invest in both public and private enterprise with the goal of promoting rapid technological development as a part of the industrialization project. Let's see just how many patents our entrepreneurs can file over the next two years."

TOM_Ad_Astra_desc: "Central Siberia has developed beyond the wildest dreams of even Boris Pasternak! The factories are more plentiful and well-run than ever, the people's spirits and work ethic are at an all-time high, and the economy runs smoothly enough that somehow both the workers and businessmen are satisfied. Sure, we still have problems as you do anywhere else, but Central Siberia has become a bastion of material success and happiness in a world which sorely lacks both of those things. We have reached the moon; now, to the stars!"

TOM_Cultural_Shift_desc: "Tomsk, and now all of Central Siberia, has already made great material and spiritual gains. But why stop now? We've already proved that modernizing our industry and culture has seriously benefited our society, so why not get ahead of the curve with our social policy as well?\n\nIt'll be ambitious, but we can create a culture and set of laws that guarantee our society accepts every single person on an individual level. This means increasing the rights and opportunities of women; they should get the chance to study and work too! It also means protecting the rights of other groups even if it isn't popular. We'll legislate protections for ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities, and even more controversially, our population of sexual minorities. If something is out of your control or part of your personal identity, you shouldn't be discriminated against for that. Let's make Central Siberia the most modern and progressive place in all of Russia."

TOM_Raising_Children_desc: "Everyone in Central Siberia has the right to study and find a paying and fulfilling career... including women! Historically our culture has strongly pressured women to remain nothing but homemakers while men have enjoyed the freedom of pursuing their dreams and cash to put food on the table.\n\nA free and universal childcare program will be introduced for all Central Siberian families, whether rich or poor, so that mothers have the same opportunities to learn and work as everyone else."

TOM_The_Modern_Russian_Culture_desc: "Let's kick things up a notch and truly broaden our citizens' cultural horizons.\n\nWe've already modernized Russia's visual arts, theatre, and film scenes; why not encourage the rapidly evolving music industry, which is currently developing a new techno-electronic style popular with our younger population? Why not support new radio stations and hold music festivals? Let's upgrade our cuisine too! We can hold fairs and special markets featuring exotic foods, and demonstrating other nations' cultural traditions and celebrations to expose our people to a wide range of foreign experiences. The people of Central Siberia will be the most well-versed and culturally enlightened people in the world!"

TOM_Rotating_Education_desc: "Part of the new, modern culture we want to instill in our people is a desire to learn and gain knowledge. So many hidden geniuses could be stuck performing menial labour for the rest of their lives because they have not had the proper educational opportunities provided to them.\n\nTo remedy this, we will initiate a rotating education program supported by both public and private institutions that will allow any worker who wants to do so attain an affordable higher education. We can always use more scientists, artists, teachers, politicians, and thinkers, but we can't expect the majority of those who live in Central Siberia to pursue these avenues without a little push."

TOM_Republican_Vanguard_desc: "The Army is arguably the single most important apparatus of state. Not only does it protect the nation from outside threats, like the roving warbands of Russia or more organized hostile warlord states on our borders, but it also provides an important interior defense, defending the government from subversives within. These subversives may have any number of ill intentions; We know not why, only that they're there. They intend to subvert democracy for their own aims, whatever they may be. Only through the strengthening of the Army may we safeguard ourselves from these enemies, at home and abroad."

TOM_Defensive_Doctrine_desc: "A declaration of war against our nation is simply the acknowledgement of a relationship our nations have already shared. There is no peace amongst the warlords of Russia, only prolonged truces. This is the mindset with which we must approach all our neighboring nations, be it during peacetime or war. Our nation will be impenetrable, whether to raids coming across the border during times of "peace" or to a full frontal assault during times of war. Every meter of land they take from us will demand thousands of their soldiers, just as every man we lose will demand ten more of theirs. We will make attacking our land as attractive a prospect as invading Germany might seem to Finland."

TOM_Counterattack_Doctrine_desc: "Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength. Even if we can manage to kill an invading enemy at a rate of ten to one at all times, should we fail to seize the advantage and counterattack, we will inevitably lose. Enemy troops, fatigued by warfare, can be most effectively destroyed by rapid counter attacks by mobile forces. Their weakened troops won't stand a chance against the overwhelming speed and strength that our armoured vehicles and supporting mobile infantry can provide."

TOM_Matryoshka_Preparations_desc: "You don't get to pick what bad things happen to you. An obvious statement, but pertinent nonetheless. At any hour, any or all of our enemies may choose to storm the border and go to war with us. We must be prepared for any and all situations that could come our way. Defensive lines upon defensive lines, counterattack plans for every possible nightmare scenario, a plan for every possible type of war that may come our way. It's far better to organize such plans now than to agonize without them later."

TOM_Degrading_Enemy_Performance_desc: "One can't win a war hiding behind bunkers and clinging to WW1 artillery tactics. The French learned as much in the summer of 1940 when Paris first fell under occupation by the Germans. The war of the future will be fought with with highly specialized units suppported in the air on the front lines with CAS and behind them as well through strategic bombings, crippling the enemy's logistics. The enemy's units will hardly be able to put up a fight by the time our main army meets them on the battlefield should our elite forces and air wings be given the resources to do their jobs."

TOM_Endless_Material_desc: "Material is cheaper than the lives of our elite army. We can use our vast industrial might as a shield for our troops on the front lines. Artillery shells will blot out the skies of our enemy as we obliterate advancing armies at a distance. And should these armies manage to get close enough to attack us, they will only be met by miles of concrete bunkers spraying out metric tons of lead each and every hour. Our nation's factories will put out concrete and steel until the whole of Russia is bled dry before succumbing to enemy invasion."

TOM_To_The_Jugular_desc: "The Germans named their tanks after panthers and tigers with good reason. Much like the fearsome feline predators, our tanks' imposing speed and attack can rip through an enemy line with ease. We learned of their striking power years ago on the battlefields of the Eastern Front, and we've learned it here in the wastes of Russia again and again as we encounter ever larger and more industrialized foes. However, with our enemies bled dry of their equipment and manpower by the rest of our army, our tanks will know only decisive blows as we crush enemy resistance once and for all."

TOM_Nothing_Is_Forgotten_desc: "Russia is not kind to governments that cannot feed the people. This is a lesson that the Tsar learned decades ago, as have many warlord governments since then. If the people are starving, then no amount of intelligence gathering in the world will feed them. Resources dedicated towards ensuring a continuous supply of grain, meats, and other foods will invariably go far further towards preventing the formation of a fifth column than an intelligence agency ever will. Only the most desperate turn to revolution to remedy their situation. If the people are never forced into such a situation, then there won't be any problems."

TOM_All_Is_Known_desc: "Russian intelligence gathering operations are vital for our state's continued survival. Not only do such operations provide us with information on what our enemies are doing abroad, such as their planned invasion, technological developments, and political movements, but they also help to ensure domestic safety and stability at home. There are any number of agitators, dissidents and insurgents within our borders and even within our army that, should they be given the chance, would tear down everything we've created thus far. Our intelligence services must know everything to prevent such a thing from happening."

TOM_We_Will_Bury_Them_desc: "Should our elite units in the army and the air force fail to subdue the enemy and our armies pushed back far into Tomsk, will will unleash our final weapon: concrete. Bunkers, miles upon miles of them spanning in every direction, blocking our enemies paths and corraling them into slaughterhouses of our own design. A wall of reinforced rebar unassailable by all but the heaviest and most powerful armored vehicles. More resources should be put towards our defense and securing our borders. If we can't drown them in bullets, we'll bury them in concrete."

TOM_The_Iron_Republic_desc: "The Republic stands tall! Several years of bloody warfare, Luftwaffe bombings, and gruelling industrialization has led up to this moment. A Russian superpower, emerging from the ashes of the Soviet Union. A nation that has experienced some of the worst atrocities and horrors the world could throw at it, and somehow managed to survive, and even thrive, against all odds. A battle hardened democracy, ready to assume its title on the world stage. The Siberian Republic sets out into the wider world, confident in its abilities."

TOM_Western_Outlook_desc: "Russia's destiny is inextricably intertwined with the west. The west is our homeland, the homeland of all Russians. It is no longer tolerable to allow German jackboots to tread on Russian soil. Preparations are to be made for the liberation of German occupied territories in Moskowien, Ukraine, Ostland, and Kaukasia. These lands are inherently Russian, and nothing less than their full return will be acceptable. The future awaits us in Europe, and although the great continent has fallen a long way since Russia was last a nation, we have nothing if not hope for its recovery."

TOM_Eastern_Possibilities_desc: "Although Russia's ultimate goal is to reclaim her western territories lost in the Second World War, we mustn't disregard our former holdings in the east. Vladivostok is a wildly valuable prize for us, giving us not only a port in one of the fastest growing economic regions in all the world, but also access to lucrative American ports and markets. Additionally, those eastern holdings could further offer us an entrance into Asian politics, which we might use to our advantage in further dismantling the already ailing Co-Prosperity Sphere. In any event, we should be standing at the ready to seize on any opportunities that may arise to liberate the Russian Far East."

TOM_The_Waiting_Game_desc: "With our diplomatic office set up and relations established with our neighbors and other nations abroad, we now have the opportunity to begin running espionage operations. Our spies will infiltrate foreign governments, leaking a steady stream of state secrets which we will further the interests of our nation. Every effort should be made to acquire compromising information so that we might better influence leaders in these nations. It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and gives us a piece of information we can use."

TOM_Central_Asian_Hinterland_desc: "Central Asia is one of the few paths we have to the wider world. Not only will it allow us a path into the giant that is India, but it also provides us a buffer with German controlled Persia. It would be beneficial if we were to find allies or partners in the region with which we might share a mutual defense pact. Additionally, the expansion of our economy into Central Asian markets could make for some tidy profits on boths sides of the border. We should attempt to make contact with some Central Asian businessmen and see if they wouldn't be too opposed to establish trade relationships with us."

TOM_Rising_Sun_desc: "Although Japan was never considered to be as great a threat to Russian sovereignty as Germany, they still remain one of the world's few superpowers and their Sphere shares with Russia one the longest borders of any nation on Earth. We should send some diplomats to Tokyo and see what exactly they think of us, and determine whether or not they are a threat. Perhaps, if our initial meetings go well, we may well even be able to set up an embassy and parlay our talks into greater discussions about Vladivostok and its potential future ownership."

TOM_The_Failing_Eagle_desc: "Germany is a nation far gone. Years of economic failure and a recent civil war have made Germany into a shadow of what it once was, yet they remain one of the greatest threats to a reunified Russia's survival. Given that our republic has been fighting off warlords for several years, focusing mostly on day to day survival in Siberia, our knowledge on the specifics of Germany and the Pakt are rather limited. We must endeavor to learn as much as we can about the dying empire and its vassal states, as well as how we can exploit its weaknesses for our own gain."

TOM_The_Bastille_Stands_desc: "The workers' revolt has come and gone, and we've managed to come out on top. With the revolt put down, hopefully for good, we should begin focusing on restarting the economy. The Central Siberian revolt destroyed a lot of economic infrastructure and forced us to shift the economy into a military oriented mode of production. Our efforts should be focused on shifting military production back into civilian production, and from there move to rebuild the damaged parts of our nation. What's important is that the Bastille stands. So long as it survives, the nation will move forward."

TOM_Legacy_Of_The_Four_Year_Plan_desc: "Interestingly, some of our friends in the private sector have recently expressed interest in following up on the four year plans we implemented previously, though with an interesting slant. Instead of having the government build new factories and set higher quotas for state owned enterprises, our friends instead suggest that we instead invest those resources we'd put aside for that into the free market. The funds would be used to prop up new businesses in our nation and give it a boost after the destruction of recent wars and revolts."

TOM_Exporting_Synthetic_Culture_desc: "What's to stop us from synthesizing a culture all our own? We control the state, and with that power we also gain the ability to influence the nation's culture, more specifically the workers' culture. Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to begin promoting Protestant style work ethic with Confucian obedience and Soviet worship of industry. Indeed, we should hope that such encouragement of this synthetic culture will bring about more productivity amongst our citizens and work to further increase the efficiency of the state."

TOM_Legacy_Of_The_Three_Year_Plan_desc: "The bureaucrats in our government are working diligently to design our next three year plan to further develop the economy. While convincing arguments have been made in favor of investing government resources into furthering the free market as opposed to the centralized economic apparatus we currently maintain, we are of the position that until Russia is unified under one government, state control of vital industries like the military industrial complex is necessary. When our nation is safe from the constant threat of invasion it currently languishes under we might consider privatizing some industry and opening up the markets, but until then the centrally planned economy will remain."

TOM_Convert_Friendly_Unions_desc: "There are a variety of independent unions operating in several sectors of the economy in our country. From steelworking to transportation to agriculture, there's a union for it. These unions are disparate and limited in their bargaining power. As part of our domestic policy, we have begun pushing for larger state run unions to organize and control the various local unions being run across the country, which would help to strengthen the workers' cause overall. Though there are many unions that reject the idea wholeheartedly, there are others that have been swayed by the arguments of a national union backed by the government and supported by government funds. We should endear ourselves to these unions and encourage them to join."

TOM_Making_Use_Of_Dirigiste_desc: "The new lands and territories we've acquired in recent years are vast, and brimming with people. Organizing and ruling over these lands with our current administration is proving greatly problematic. Not only is our staff too limited to handle the paperwork and bureaucratic load these lands have put on our shoulders, but we are also finding that the new bureaucrats we have managed to bring on board to manage these lands have been entirely incompetent. There are many former leaders and bureaucrats from the warlord governments we previously conquered with the experience and intelligence needed to effectively administer our new territories. We should seek them out and bring them on board. If nothing else, it should help us to better integrate these new territories, by offering them leaders of their own people."

TOM_Learning_From_Foreign_Corporations_desc: "The unification of our region of Russia has brought about an economic boom. The peace and stability we've brought to our homelands has improved investor's faith in the economy and has encouraged young entrepreneurs to begin building their own companies. These new companies are going to be competing with foreign corporations with stronger logistics, better management, and lower production costs. If our domestic companies are to survive, they will need to emulate these foreign corporations in everything mentioned before. We will not become another market to exploit."

TOM_Tailor_Welfare_Net_desc: "The government only has so many resources, and although we'd love to be able to support everybody, choices must be made concerning who gets what and how much they get. A new administrative welfare body has been assembled to assist us in that regard. It will aid us in determining what populations have the greatest need for aid, and what form that aid will take. In some cases, a financial stimulus is needed to lift a region out of poverty, and in others, it might be the construction of new soup kitchens and homeless shelters. By targeting exactly what is needed in our varied population, we will maximise efficiency and quality of life."

TOM_Stamping_Out_Dangerous_Ideologies_desc: "While an educated, conscious, and politically free citizenry is important for any good democracy, there must be limits as to the ideologies we allow to operate within the country. Dangerous ideologies like Marxism and fascism led to the oppression and murder of millions. These ideologies have served as a net negative for society and have actively worked to bring humanity backwards. It would be both irresponsible and careless to allow such ideologies to manifest themselves within our populace, and steps should be taken to ensure such a situation never occurs."

TOM_Expanding_Our_Bureaucracy_desc: "Our Republic is growing and changing at a rapid rate, and our bureaucracy needs to get bigger if we are to handle it. We recently quadrupled our population during the reunification of Central Siberia, increasing the need for bureaucrats that can manage these new peoples, and have also been implementing more encompassing welfare and labour policies which will require a larger bureaucracy to run and operate. As the Republic grows, so too must we if we are to sate the administrative and logistical needs of this nation."

TOM_The_Expanded_Trinity_Association_desc: "The Bastillards are, and have always been, a hub of thinkers and industrial planners. A sense for the practical paired with a little idealism can go a long ways towards making what might seem like dreams into reality, and what dreams we've had. We've brought our Republic from a weak warlord state of the fringes of Siberia into one of the foremost contenders for Russian dominance, and people have taken note. All manner of thinkers and highly skilled professionals have flocked to the party of rationality and intellectualism. The Bastillards have become the golden standard for how a government should be run in Russia."

TOM_humanist_the_pacific_shores_desc: "Now that we have unified the Far East and Central Siberia, we are no longer fenced in. Our Republic stretches from Lake Baikal to the Pacific, and now we can finally start to begin trade with the outside world more easily. Our economy itself shall grow due these newfound advantages such as the Port of Magadan and Vladivostok.\n\nWith these ports under a unified republic that has consolidated its power, we can begin to expand our knowledge of the world. We can also begin to contact the great powers of the world such as the United States, the leader of the Free World and the OFN. Possible trade ties could begin between our nation and theirs benefiting us both at the end of the day. Our nation can finally throw off its shackles of being far from the sea and the world."

TOM_humanist_uprooting_dogmatic_marxism_desc: "Marx himself was yet one socialist thinker, one that was too self centered onto himself and his teachings. While his methods and ideals have influenced us to an extent, the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat has no place in our society. One of the recently conquered states that we had liberated and brought into the fold has influenced from a Marxist society, we need to remove these influences. The state had gone through a civil war due to differences in the Marxist belief.\n\nTo some of the more extreme members of our country, this could be seen as an overreach by us. However this is nothing more than curing a virus that had stained Russia for many generations. Once we do remove his influence from the Far East, stability can take the place that these ideals had held in the people. The people may seem callous at first, but then should be more accepting once they realize the good we have done."

TOM_humanist_expanding_worker_democracy_desc: "Workers are the lifeblood of our society. Our rule in Central Siberia was quite focused on the idea of helping the workers instead of oppressing them like the former rulers of Russia. Unlike the former Union, we have placed the utmost importance on protecting them with labor laws and unions. However, when it comes to the Far East, the lands that had been formerly ruled by a group of men called the "Heirs of Harbin" and the dogmatic Father, worker democracy is a non existent idea. We need to change this.\n\nMany of the former workers in this region had lived under the oppressive yoke of men who like to call themselves rulers while they couldn't give a single bit of pity to the man keeping the country afloat from his labor. We must take these old ideas and morals and toss them out. In our society, there is no place for this. It must be our goal to develop worker democracy in these regions for the future."

TOM_humanist_advancing_our_projects_desc: "Before we had the power and the opportunity to reunite the east, we had far fetched plans that would help the region as a whole with great economic benefits, now that we have the resources and reach of the Far East. It seems that an industrial base was constructed by the former denizens of the region, but we can always improve on this. The Central Siberian Plan, while helping our region Siberia, the east was much more neglected by these plans.\n\nAlong with these advancements in technology and our project, we can also begin reforms in the many cities and regions we have under our control, such as Magadan and Buryatia. They had been exposed to extremist methods such as Leninism and fascism. We must reform these regions to guarantee a hopeful future."

TOM_humanist_the_peoples_war_desc: "While some of the more advanced and developed nations may disagree with the idea of a mass citizen army, if we can train these reserves and the main army enough, they will turn into a formidable force. Some of our political opponents have opposed this idea due to the risk of an uprising possibly or even a stunning defeat caused by a much better trained opponent. However, this would be unlikely after our training regime has gone through.\n\nWe are beginning to acquire books from the West on military tactics and battle plans, using these we have begun to adapt them to the conditions of Central and East Siberia to help us win our wars. Along with this, we have planned to introduce new equipment that we have also shipped to us from the West using our newfound ports in Magadan."

TOM_humanist_the_peoples_education_desc: "Education is the backbone of a successful country and society. While many of the more developed countries in the world agree on this idea, some in Russia had been opposed to this idea in the time after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Before the Central Siberian War, we had preached the idea of higher education through our universities, but since we had regressed the idea in Central Siberia had disappeared while in the Far East it was nothing more than a dream.\n\nNow that we have control over Central Siberia once again, and now the Far East, we can implement our education reforms. While some of our other reforms may have caused rifts between the Salons, this would be one seen as a quadripartite effort between us. While the salons may have ideological differences, we can all agree on education."

TOM_humanist_the_workers_economy_desc: "The Central Siberian Plan was a decisive action planned and executed by the General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the time, Nikolai Bukharin. The plan was to build factories and to reform the industry of Central Siberia. It had made us extremely strong during the post Union years, however due to the breakup of Central Siberia, we had lost quite a large base of our industry. We can began to rebuild these factories now we have control of them once again and now we can spread this plan to the Far East.\n\nAs we build these factories, many of them will be worker co-ops. As these factories will be owned by the workers themselves, who will vote on the many decisions that pass through them. This will in turn, make the factories more efficient and the workers more complacent due to them running the factory and not an issue of the state."

TOM_humanist_the_grand_humanist_conference_desc: "It appears that it is time for us to pool together our great minds of the Humanists into one convention. Unlike many of the other official meetings we have held over the years, this one will encompass the entire country and we will be met with thousands of new members to the Humanist cause and even more returning ones from past conferences.\n\nUnlike many of the other ones, which had focused on our ambitions to rise to power in Tomsk, this one will highlight our current height of power and how we will expand upon these ideas. The central idea of this conference will be the expansion of the Central Siberian Plan, we will also announce our project that will modernize Eastern Russia. However, in this time, we also have been needing ideas for a project that all of the other contenders to unify the country would want. We are planning on asking many of the Humanists who come to the conference to pitch their ideas to use in these matters."

TOM_humanist_the_tomsibar_plan_desc: "It is finally time for us to reveal our plan that we had made during the Grand Humanist Conference to the world. The name of it is the TomSiBar Plan and it aims to modernize Central Siberia very quickly.\n\nSome of the other salons will call us a hive of madmen for even thinking of this plan, however we are optimistic. The plan calls for three things. One is the development of "Hypertrains" these trains will use a type of engineering that was pioneered in Japan during the past few years. They will connect most of Central Siberia, turning it into a very connected region and modernizing it. The second is the increased connection of the many cities dotting the region, building more and more in between them to foster connection. The third and final phase, is the merging of the many cities into one "Megacity" that will serve as the capital of our country. This plan if completed, shall serve as the envy of the many countries around the world."

TOM_humanist_the_capillaries_desc: "It's hard for us to claim to be interested in the wellbeing of our people when our cities barely provide for our people.\n\nInfrastructure within the few urban centers we have are a mess. The collapse of the CSR, infighting, and decay have all taken a toll on public services and roads. First things first, though. We need to repair and build seriously damaged and unusable streets so people can use them again. Whatever rail lines, trains, and buses that are still salvageable should be pressed into service for the public, and for God's sake, someone get the water running everywhere?! Citizens living in the suburbs of our cities deserve functioning infrastructure like any other urban dweller."

TOM_humanist_the_arteries_desc: "While local infrastructure needs a momental amount of improvements and work, we can not afford to neglect the major transportation links between our scattered towns and cities if the TomSiBar Plan is to succeed.\n\nThe most efficient mode of transporting goods such long distances is by far by rail lines. We should make the investments and take the time to rebuild, repair, and place new lines so that all of Tomsk is connected. Improving our links will not only be great for the economy, but will also be vital for our armies; the lines will be of the utmost importance for moving our military across our state in good time."

TOM_humanist_the_main_organs_desc: "The cities of Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Barnaul are currently our main centers of population and production. While they are the most developed regions in our state, compared to modern standards, the cities are archaic. Novosibirsk and Barnaul also remain some of the greatest beds of resentment against Tomsk's government\n\nWe need to desperately improve living conditions, industry, infrastructure, and human services in all three of these urban centers. The cities are too important to neglect, and their true potential makes them attract places to invest in."

TOM_humanist_to_the_west_desc: "While we have successfully unified one half of Russia, another half remains under control by a separate nation who has fancied themselves a potential rival and even enemy if it truly comes to war.\n\nOur country must prepare for war, if it is truly needed. While we may not want to fight a potentially stronger opponent, we must make sure that we can stand up to them. However, if there is a chance we must prepare to have diplomatic contact with the nation in the west. We should consider all of our diplomatic options before even thinking about the option of total war. However, we must be prepared for this at all costs. Luckily, due to our ports that we now have under our control, we can finally import new weapons that are more efficient and more durable. The harsh winter in Siberia could be an issue if we must fight in it, so our soldiers and their weapons must be hardened for the fight. At all costs we must survive, but we should attempt the diplomatic route."

TOM_humanist_neutrality_to_the_sphere_desc: "When it comes to the many superpowers of the world, there are three major ones. The Germans and their Einheitspakt, what we can not join obviously enough. The second is the United States and the Organization of Free Nations. While they are the champion of the Free World and many of our literature and other supplies come from them, they do not officially recognize us. However we can remain neutral with them.\n\nThe last great superpower of the world is Japan and their Co-Prosperity Sphere. While it seems that their power per day seems to be falling, they are our closest superpower. However, they seem quite fine with zero interaction with us or any of the conquered warlord states. While we may not agree with any of their policies, they will still acknowledge and trade with us, less officially like the OFN. Maybe we should not pledge our allegiance to either, but instead be neutral to them. This should hopefully make us more viable for new trade agreements."

TOM_humanist_science_of_the_free_world_desc: "Due to Tomsk being relatively unscathed from the West Russian War and even the Central Siberian War in some places, we have our universities stand proud. However, like most things in Eastern Siberia, they could always be better.\n\nNow that we have ocean access, we can start to send letters to the many great universities of the Free World. Places such as Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, McGill, all of them. Hopefully, if the students and administrators of these universities listen to our letters, they can start to send some of their knowledge they have in the many fields of science. Fields such as medicine, engineering, technology and industrial development. All of these fields would help develop our country further, in exchange, many of their students would be able to come over to Tomsk to help us develop one of our projects. If they wanted to, of course."

TOM_humanist_russian_determination_desc: "Our armed forces must be prepared for anything. While we may not have the mechanized divisions like many of the other more advanced powers of the world, we have something they do not. Determined people who are willing to become soldiers to protect their home, and who are well trained. While much of our army is a mix of professional soldiers and worker units who could be raised if needed, we should train all of them more hard. We must be able to hold on against the onslaught of an invasion if possible to make sure that we can issue more men and women into our forces to be ready for battle. Due to this, our worker units will be reforged as a national guard type army. This army will live most of their lives as workers in our country, only training for one week per month or so. However, if our country is ever in a war, they shall be activated as a full combat unit and must be prepared to fight."

TOM_humanist_heirs_to_1917_heirs_to_1918_desc: "Tomsk is a paradise in the Russian wastes. No other state cares for its people like us; our workers; men, women, and children are not disposable resources to be thrown away in pointless border skirmishes or raids. Our people are our future, and they should have a say in government. Tomsk and her people are one and the same; we must all work together to build ourselves a better tomorrow!"

TOM_modernist_o_brave_new_world_desc: "We've reached the Pacific Ocean! A brave new world stands across the horizon. No longer landlocked, we have access to the far east's ports. Trading will be much easier now, so we should prioritize our relationship with the Pacific powers. We will need as much aid as possible for our plans, we cannot fall behind the West.\n\nAccessing our newly gained resources will also be very important for our growing economy. Extracting these resources for our industries will be needed if we want to compete with our neighbor to the west and finally bring Russia out of the past."

TOM_modernist_integrate_new_assets_desc: "With our annexation of the Far East more industries, businesses, and people are now under our control. We need to take advantage of these to expand our economy and fully develop Siberia. Expanding firms and integrating them into our economy will surely give a boost to our GDP, which is necessary if we want Siberia to appear as a modern nation.\n\nUsing the Far East's industry, while limited, will be necessary if we want to compete with the industrialized west. Meanwhile, giving the people better jobs and eliminating the more useless ones should create a more efficient system and make the population more satisfied."

TOM_modernist_decontaminate_the_land_desc: "Fanaticism and radical ideologies dominated the Far East in the Warlord Era and under the Far Eastern Regional Government. These ways of thought continue to affect our control over the Far East, as many people do not support the ways of democracy.\n\nWe must work on diminishing fascism, socialism, and despotism to empower our rule in the region, ensuring support for our government. Educating the populace on the benefits of republicanism and democracy has to be done, no matter what some in the duma may say."

TOM_modernist_stars_and_stripes_desc: "America is one of the few more powerful democracies on this planet. We have many reasons to align towards them, our political systems are similar, we share the same enemies, and both of our nations have fought to spread democracy. Their science base is also significantly powerful, with inventions and technological developments that surpass the world.\n\nFor all these reasons, we must ask America for aid! Our economy, science base, and military could all use American help. America must be on our side in the future, we don't know what conflicts lie ahead."

TOM_modernist_all_that_weve_missed_desc: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, innovation became a thing of the past. The only technological developments pertained to the military. Now that we have brought stability and democracy to Siberia, it's time we read up on the twenty years of science we missed. There is a lot to learn, and much of it can be used to improve the lives of the people.\n\nIn particular, developments in computer technology have gained the interest of our scientists. We need all the modern technology we can get our hands-on. If we do, we will far surpass any other backward nation in Russia."

TOM_modernist_a_new_sibplan_desc: "The Russian Republic exists in the remains of Bukharin's Central Siberian Plan. The industrial development of the past allowed us to further expand Central Siberian infrastructure and cities. Now, however, it's time we begin the next phase of the plan.\n\nElectronics are the technology of the modern age. Our government has decided to create a city working towards the development of new technologies. Computers, telephones, radios, and even televisions could be designed and built in Russia! If there is a way to bring Russia into the modern age, it's technology!"

TOM_modernist_theoretical_computer_science_desc: "Siberia has a plentitude of universities, it's time they study electronics. Everything has to be taught, the assembly, programming, even theoretical sciences. Our scientists, professors, and researchers will have to work as hard as possible if we want to make Siberia into a center of technology for the world.\n\nIf all goes as planned, new electronics will be invented and discontinued within days. Each development will propel us further into the future, an age where everything is electronic."

TOM_modernist_business_effort_desc: "If we want a chance at creating a Siberian electronic powerhouse, not everything can be done by the government. The private sector will be our most useful ally, with private companies competing with each other to create the best electronics Russia can come up with.\n\nHowever, we may have to help these private companies start up, planting the seeds if you will. Grants will be given to these new companies working in the computer and electronic fields. Hopefully, we should soon see some progress."

TOM_modernist_importing_foreign_computers_desc: "Russia cannot develop reliable and well-functioning computers and electronics on its own. To give us a base to work with we will begin importing Sphere and American computers to figure out how they work and reverse engineer them.\n\nThis will give our engineers and theorists much-needed ideas to build and invent better computers. If all goes as planned, our computer scientists will be able to improve on American and Japanese designs, paving the way towards innovation."

TOM_modernist_new_architectures_desc: "Vacuum tubes are good for computers, but they now seem to be a thing of the past. New, silicon chips are smaller and faster, allowing for even more advanced computer technology.\n\nA future for silicon chips in computer processors seems to be the way forward. We should experiment with silicon chips, perhaps our theorists or scientists could create an even better design! If not, we will still be able to prove the benefits of silicon circuits over vacuum tubes."

TOM_modernist_the_city_of_lights_desc: "Our project has entered its stage of completion, and we are nearly ready to unveil our project. What once was Kemerovo has changed significantly, and its transformation into the City of Lights has taken great effort.\n\nTurning an industrial town into a modern Russian Silicon Valley will hopefully have fulfilled the dreams of our Modernist government. Surely the work of countless individuals will be fully realized?"

TOM_modernist_a_cutting_edge_military_desc: "Integrating these new ideas into future military equipment is a necessity. A technologically advanced military is a powerful military, and we need the best of the best if we want to win over our western rival and Germany.\n\nElectronics can be incorporated into tanks, planes, trucks, AFVs, and even support equipment. The best counter for a larger enemy is better technology. Their tanks and guns will be no match for ours!"

TOM_modernist_financial_markets_desc: "Progress towards a Russian electronic powerhouse is steady but slow. Many companies working towards new inventions and developments for computers often find themselves low on cash necessary to continue their work.\n\nTheir failure means our failure. If we want to solve the funding issue, we have to funnel in more financial investments. Grants, donations, anything to get better results. As much money as possible must be pumped into developing electronics."

TOM_modernist_west_where_we_must_return_desc: "The reunification of Russia is nearing, and we have to be ready for it. More men must be trained and deployed to the field, and our army size has to increase. A front against the west will be a large one, and we cannot allow any holes in our lines to appear. Deploying the army to the western border will guarantee our security in case of war, and will show our rival our might.\n\nAlthough, war may not be necessary. We should probably start off with negotiations before we prepare for any attack. Perhaps the West may be more willing to unify peacefully?"

TOM_modernist_my_dolzhny_znat_my_budem_znat_desc: "We must know, we will know. Our republic has grown in the last decade. From a city to half a country we have so far brought democracy and freedom to the depths of this wasteland in which we reside. Our republic will only continue to expand until we have regained all of Russia, restoring liberty and democracy to what once was a land of darkness and despair.\n\nProgress and modernity are also within our reach, as new technologies are spread across Russia and people are brought out of their misery to thrive. All across Siberia hope, progress, and science are on the march. Let us bring it west."

TOM_decembrist_the_lost_sheep_desc: "The military victories that we achieved in the Far East left many peasants without their leader, Father Men. Their anger at being abandoned and exploited by unscrupulous tyrants is understandable. To stabilize the situation we must first calm their anger. We can pacify Men's followers by leading them to our Eastern Orthodox churches and slowly assimilating them into our society, though it is their decision whether or not to participate in church. Nevertheless, we cannot allow the radical teachings of Men to bleed through into our great society."

TOM_decembrist_the_wretches_of_harbin_desc: "Warlords that rose up around the city of Harbin harbored a dangerous ideology, one that cannot exist in our democratic system. It is now our job to clear the fascists that once lived in Amur and Magadan to ensure the safety of our republic. In its place we will plant seeds of hope and prosperity, and we will lift up those who were persecuted by the Fascist regimes that once spanned the Far East."

TOM_decembrist_last_of_the_reds_desc: "Our conquest of the Russian Far East may have granted us access to the outside world, but many radical communists still remain in the region. These men are living remnants of the former Soviet Union, whose NKVD officers purged many of Russia's intellectuals before and during the German-Soviet War. We shall give these men no remorse just like they gave our intellectual friends no remorse; we must eradicate any shred of communism remaining in the Russian Far East."

TOM_decembrist_the_great_discord_desc: "Much of Pasternak's salon-based republic remains stained by political strife between different parties. For our nation to progress, we must decide how to integrate the various political parties in order to reduce turmoil and produce a more unified government. In this way, we will end the confusion and step together in harmony."

TOM_decembrist_the_militarist_and_the_silovik_desc: "Many citizens of conquered Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk territory are still loudly patriotic for their former countries. While this can be accepted in our society, we must search the population for any militant separatists who could inflict harm on our people. To benefit the peaceful residents, we must encourage them to remain patriotic of their states while cracking down on the more violent, rebellious inhabitants."

TOM_decembrist_new_business_desc: "All of the lands that have just been reintegrated into our Republic have vast economic opportunities and industry under the control of industrialists and businessmen which have also recently become citizens of the Republic. If we so choose, we have the power to act decisively and bolster our already growing industrial base by having a few chats with some of these entrepreneurs.\n\nOf course, doing so may help to illustrate the ridiculous narrative that we care more about factories and natural resources than we do about the political and material interests of our people, and we might be better off continuing to fight off the cynicism that pursuing reckless economic progress creates in the first place."

TOM_decembrist_idealizing_the_center_desc: "Our end goal is to ultimately integrate everyone, within reason, into our political system. Independents of nearly all stripes should be encouraged to share their ideas and wishes not as outsiders, but with the Salon which most closely matches their personal ideology.\n\nWhile we cannot expect every single person to sort themselves cookie-cutter style into a Salon in an instant, and we can of course encourage some people to focus on things other than politics, we can definitely help people voice their grievances in a manner where they will actually be heard and where we will more readily be able to respond. It's a matter of practicality for us and for them."

TOM_decembrist_a_new_school_of_thought_desc: "As a means of further integrating all sorts of people into our political system, we should encourage the formation and growth of new political philosophies at our universities and all across our realm with the ultimate aim of guiding these unique thinkers into one of our four Salons.\n\nEssentially, by both allowing and advocating for individuals to voice their own political thoughts, while simultaneously directing them subtly towards our existing system, we can strike a perfect balance; we'll demonstrate our flexibility and desire to listen to the people's will while still maintaining the status quo at the end of the day."

TOM_decembrist_the_fractured_left_desc: "Soviets, anarchists, and assorted radical socialists alike all heavily populate some of our newly conquered territories. We are no fans of them. Or rather, we are opposed to their beliefs; hate the sin, love the sinner...\n\nStill, these misguided people are now our citizens and if we hope to integrate them into our Salon system and resolve this godforsaken political crisis, we at the very least need to hear what their grievances are and look like we are taking their wishes into account. Our Salons should be a place where people of all beliefs and all walks of life should be able to have their say, these folk are, unfortunately, no exception."

TOM_decembrist_the_counter_reformation_desc: "Supporters of the ideas of Marx, Yagoda, and Sablin are all the same. Well, they're not literally the same, but for our purposes we can treat them as such.\n\nSocialism and communism are massive, grandiose ideologies that span a vast array of theories and ideals, and thinkers like Marx are just ordinary people like you and I. We can try and tame some of these radicals a bit and push them towards the Humanists' camp and away from damaging goals like revolution. While we are remiss to be directly supporting a rival Salon, doing so is decidedly preferable to allowing a bunch of leftists from collapsing our Salon system altogether."

TOM_decembrist_forging_ahead_alone_desc: "The Decembrists were the ones who transformed a measly Tomsk into a strong and powerful Russia. We've already taken our republic this far, industrializing, reconquering, policymaking, developing our people's culture. Without our hard work and uniquely effective ideology and philosophy, we would be nothing. There is simply no time and no reason to ask the other Salons for assistance as we continue to move forward and put an end to the nation's political crisis. After all, we are the only Salon that is well and truly in touch with the wants, needs, and feelings of the Russian people."

TOM_decembrist_the_great_symposium_desc: "A Salon system is no system at all without the input of dissenting ideas and collaboration from people of all different perspectives. We are going to fix the political mess we're in, but we're going to do it the right way: working together will all of the Salons to finally integrate everyone into our political machine.\n\nThe Humanists, Bastillards, and Modernists all have a role to play in definitively convincing the people that our way of running things is for the best. Not everyone wants or has to be a Decembrist, and we have come to a point where we can accept that for the good of Russia."

TOM_decembrist_a_new_era_for_the_republic_desc: "The wave of political independents and cynicism has been a pain in our rear ends for a damn long time by now. But at long last, after many months of intense campaigning and hard work, our Great Discord Project has come to an end. After announcing this to all of Russia, we shall see how we fared in our efforts."

TOM_decembrist_expand_the_eastern_economy_desc: "A new channel to the Pacific has opened for us, and it is time to extend our free market economy to the easternmost border. We must develop these lands just like we developed our original states, by building factories and starting new supply chains. There is plenty of potential to be found in these new eastern provinces, and we must treat both man and nature with respect as we bolster the regional economy."

TOM_decembrist_arms_for_the_soldiers_desc: "Our newly-conquered eastern lands and our Pacific border could be beneficial to our military development. We should use part of the acquired eastern resources to construct weapons for our liberation army. Now that we have a post on the Pacific, we can visit the outside world and discover new methods to develop stronger weapons, and who knows, we might be able to return with patents of our own."

TOM_decembrist_bread_for_the_homefront_desc: "We are always in need of more food for our people, and it is imperative that we improve the current food situation in the conquered Far East. We shall work to expand our farms to the region, produce more farming tools, and import food from other world markets to ensure that our citizens are fed and healthy."

TOM_decembrist_a_visit_to_uncle_sam_desc: "Our entire governmental system was partly influenced by that of the United States, and many in our population look to the Americans as a true savior of democracy, a beacon of hope for the world. Now that we have expanded our influence to a large part of Russia, we have the opportunity to send our leaders to the United States. This is currently our best chance to establish a friendship with the Americans, and they may be able to assist us in creating a democratic Russian state."

TOM_decembrist_a_new_far_eastern_fleet_desc: "Our expansion into Pacific territory requires us to gather whatever we have into a ragtag navy capable of ensuring our naval supply routes and defending our coast from invaders. We might be able to salvage what was left of the former Soviet navy or old warlord-era ships that remained in good condition. It would be our first step towards developing a competent Russian navy to patrol our coasts."

TOM_decembrist_the_great_federation_desc: "Yes! We are inches away from being the one and only Russian Republic, but there is reason to celebrate even before the reunification is finalized. We're in a very strong position to be the nation doing the aforementioned reunifying, as our political crisis is at an end and we have developed the means to stand alone as a geopolitical force in our own right.\n\nWe have shown the world the light and power of democracy as we promised, and it is now time to spread freedom to all and drop bombs and roll tanks upon the tyrants of the world! For Russia, and for democracy!"

TOM_bastillard_to_the_east_the_azure_eternal_desc: "We've reached the Pacific Ocean and we are even closer to uniting Russia! Our prospects of victory have greatly increased, and we have shown the world we are truly a major force in Russia. Finally no longer landlocked, we can begin to orchestrate trade across the ocean and finally bring foreign riches into Siberia.\n\nThis is a major achievement for the Bastillards especially. Our plan of free trade across the Pacific is finally possible. We have not just brought democracy to the Far East, but great wealth as well!"

TOM_bastillard_harbins_dark_legacy_desc: "Harbin has a dark legacy in the Far East. The center of Russian Fascism, these groups thronged into Russia to destabilize it and enslave the Russian people. Fascism must be removed from the Far East for we cannot allow radical ideologies to tarnish our republic. Eliminating fascism from Outer Manchuria will also secure the ports, as we cannot have fascist resistance hurting our business efforts.\n\nIt is also important we conduct business in Harbin, as we must have ties with Japan so we do not rival them into the Pacific. A neutral relationship will be the best."

TOM_bastillard_the_red_hinterland_desc: "The legacy of communism is especially seen in Irkutsk and Buryatia. It is the Bastillards' duty to remove these red stains and ensure supplies can move freely between our ports and cities. Partisans and resistance movements must be snuffed out as quickly as possible before they spread and gain strength. Once we stabilize our control, we will be able to enact our plans. No bandit will reach our trade routes!"

TOM_bastillard_any_port_in_a_storm_desc: "Magadan is our only lifeline to the outside world, being the only major port under our control in the Far East. We must build more roads, more bridges, and more railways if we want Magadan to be as effective as possible, allowing us to transport goods and trade at a faster pace. Upgrading the port itself by building more docks and using new technologies will also be necessary if we want Magadan to be useful."

TOM_bastillard_but_this_one_desc: "Even with our improvements to Magadan, the port will never be as good as Vladivostok or any other port in Outer Manchuria. To get a more robust trade network with the outside world we must expand our diplomacy and political strength. The negotiations will be difficult, but failure could jeopardize our entire economy."

TOM_bastillard_the_new_pacific_policy_desc: "To bring our project up off the ground a new Ministry will be created to oversee it, integrated into the government. Named the Ministry of Trade and Defense, it will focus solely on trade operations in the Far East and the Pacific as well as the defense of convoys and trade lines. Funding this new ministry will hopefully bring the right people to the table and progress our plans."

TOM_bastillard_american_trade_desc: "Trade with America is absolutely critical if we want to have a strong economy. We will ask them to trade in Magadan, and while they may not like conducting trade in a port that is frozen half the year, perhaps giving them a bit more will pique their interest. Perhaps special treatment in our economy will do the trick."

TOM_bastillard_open_the_port_by_any_means_desc: "The current lack of naval infrastructure makes trade a difficult and dangerous operation. The new Ministry of Trade and Defense will work to quickly construct and develop new ports and aquire ships. The legality of such an operation considering the dubious ownership of the land in up for debate, but we can hardly afford yet another set back. The operation will have to go ahead."

TOM_bastillard_japanese_bargains_desc: "Japan now holds our old port of Vladivostok, which once was one of the best trading hubs in the Empire. We must ask them if we can make use of the port to trade and transport our goods. We could also request access to Manchurian railways which would give us the ability to send goods overland faster."

TOM_bastillard_the_special_economic_zones_desc: "Manchuria may not be the best place to operate, but it is better than the Far East. Nevertheless, if we put our industries near the ports, the transportation of goods will go much faster and our economy will undoubtedly grow."

TOM_bastillard_breaking_the_salon_deadlock_desc: "Dealing with Japan has proven very unpopular with both the citizens of the Republic and most of the Salons. However, there are those within one other salon that do understand our motives, the Humanists. Aligning ourselves with the Humanist Salon should hopefully give us the majority to pass all the necessary policies dealing with America and Japanese trade."

TOM_bastillard_preparing_the_western_positions_desc: "We must be ready for war in the west. While the government there may perhaps be willing to negotiate with us, it is much better to be safe by preparing for war. Developing local areas along the border and planning future campaigns must be done now before it may be too late."

TOM_bastillard_expand_the_welfare_state_desc: "With our economy growing, we can accommodate better social welfare and civilian oriented policies. Let's focus on this to satisfy the everyday citizens, as it will act as an outflow for anger against our government."

TOM_bastillard_a_final_round_of_preparations_desc: "Conflict is nearing, and we have to be prepared. Men must be trained, better weapons must be distributed, and a propaganda campaign must be completed. This will be our most challenging fight yet. We cannot lose if we wish for democracy to survive!"

TOM_bastillard_the_west_will_be_ours_desc: "To the West, Russians toil underneath our rival. Beyond that, the horror of RK Moskowien, where Russians die under the boot of the Germans. We will win in the West, liberating all Russians, and the Iron Republic of the Bastillards will march to the gates of the Reich!"

TOM.1.t: "Passing On the Torch"
TOM.1.desc: "The President walked the halls of the Presidential Palace, alone at this late hour. None walked with him but his memories, echoes of a better time. Pale moonlight drifted through curtains of cloud in the sky, beaming through the hallway's grand windows.\n\nOnce, the Central Siberian Republic stood as one of the strongest successor states to the Soviet Union. Inheriting a wealth of industry from Bukharin's Siberian Plan, the government in Tomsk set to work rebuilding a new Russia, one where the citizens would be free to prosper, and free to give their opinion on governance. Yet the Russian Anarchy would not spare Central Siberia. Landlocked, and surrounded by hostile governments and warlords, the beginning of the Republic's end had come in from secessionists in Novosibirsk. Then, Yagoda's accursed Soviet Union remnants had launched its quixotic invasion. Both nations had been bled to death, their children weeping as war and famine came to once peaceful land. In Central Siberia various provincial governors rose against the fatally weakened central government. Rogue military officers had blamed the civilian government for their own failures to put out anarchists and secessionists. One by one, provinces seceded, until only Tomsk remained.\n\nThe cold tugged at Pasternak's energy. Almost as much as the damn disease did. The door to his office, wooden and regal, felt a little heavier every day. But the President was not about to throw in the towel yet. The CSR's old government had failed. Tomsk's current provisional government would not rule eternally. Pasternak felt he and his generation had gotten the Republic in this mess; the least they could do was do their best to give the next generation the torch. In the sleeping city surrounding the presidential palace, workers and poets, soldiers and politicians, all of the Republic's remaining children slept. All the President had to do, alone in his office as usual, was entrust the future to them. So much work to do, so little time. Pasternak chuckled. It wouldn't be long before he had all the sleep he needed, anyhow."
TOM.1.a: "To the new generation, from failing hands."

TOM.2.t: "The Years of Steel, the Years of Ashes"
TOM.2.desc: "An entirely unproductive day. These had been a rarity in President Pasternak's long and eventful life. Now, the toll of illness and age were making such days a much more common occurrence. Boris Pasternak had thus spent the day reminiscing as he rested in his bedroom.\n\nHe had emerged as one of the early leaders of the old Central Siberian Republic. Things had never been easy, or evident. Some wanted a continuation of Bukharin's Soviet Union. Others in the army preferred a much more authoritarian type of government, a permanent military emergency until the nation could be re-united. But Pasternak and his allies had appealed to the intellectuals of Tomsk, those who dreamed of a freer future. They had also appealed to the common man, promising to the worker prosperity in return for their help. Now the President found himself leader of a much reduced Republic, its democracy temporarily suspended by a provisional government, its economy in shambles. Time had made a mockery of these early plans.\n\nPasternak had been surprised to see the public back his continuation as emergency provisional President. Had he not embodied everything that had gone wrong with the CSR? Yet, the people in Tomsk had somehow kept their trust in him. Even the workers dutifully continued their shifts in the great industrial works, after having backed the Provisional Government in a referendum. The food situation was not excellent, but it was at least stable. Perhaps none among the poor or the elite wished to chance another leader in these most dangerous of times. General Shaposhnikov had ensured the loyalty of the rump army to civilian institutions.\n\nThe President felt a bit humbled by the trust shown to him. He also knew his people expected much in return. This did not worry him unduly; his final projects would soon be presented to Tomsk's leadership. Just as Pasternak had put his affairs in order before his passing, so too would the Republic's affairs be arranged."
TOM.2.a: "A reading of his political last wills was in order."

TOM.3.t: "Changing of the Guard"
TOM.3.desc: "All eyes turned to him when he entered the room. Concern, sorrow, pity, a mixture of emotions was evident in the assembled visages. The President was used to seeing the progression of his cancer on the faces of those he did not meet often.\n\nThe men were from a range of backgrounds. Industrialists, academics, bureaucrats of the Provisional Government. A few outsiders stood awkwardly next to General Shaposhnikov. The trusty general had followed Pasternak's directives. The President nodded gratefully at his old friend. The general saluted, crisply. Pasternak began speaking: "Gentlemen, my time is probably more limited than yours, even." A few awkward laughs. Pasternak continued. "I've gathered you today to express my thoughts on the Provisional Government. I think none of us are particularly satisfied with its progress." A few nods of assent. "What was supposed to be a temporary measure to trim the old apparatus of the CSR, recalibrate our economy and tend to our diminished army has now stretched into months, and then years of sluggish progress. Political opposition has rightfully pointed out that without elections, our legitimacy is ever dwindling."\n\nPasternak sat at his chair, and addressed his attention to the outsiders. Men of the salons, all, and not shy about partaging their thoughts on the Provisional Government. Good. "I've invited these gentlemen from the so-called Decembrist, Bastillard, Humanist, and Modernist Societies. Many good ideas have been discussed in the city's salons over the past few months. I've followed the renewal of the capital's cultural and political scene with much interest, and I believe it is now time to end the Provisional Government."\n\nA murmur threatened to boil into a debate. Pasternak rose a hand to silence it. "This will be done with good order, and a suitable new constitution will be implemented. Gentlemen, those secessionists and rebels have shown more daring than us, and have seized the moment. I believe it is time to do some mobilizing of our own, and tap into the great minds of the Republic to see it endure into the next generations. I would like to hear the assembled men in this room detail what remains to be done before new elections can be called. Let's begin with you, General Shaposhnikov.""
TOM.3.a: "From many voices, a consensus will soon emerge."

TOM.4.t: "Drafting the Political Arena"
TOM.4.desc: "Reams of paper were filling up every possible surface of the Presidential office. Once in a while bemused secretaries came in to stabilize the tottering piles of paper. Law and history books were strewn about, opened at seemingly random pages. In the middle of it all was the President, busy at work.\n\nIt was no easy feat to draft a constitution, even with the dozens of legal advisors who had been given their own section to work on. Harder still was what Pasternak had in mind: a living, breathing thing, in which all would see the Republic they envisaged. Pasternak's constitution would end the Provisional Government, and begin a new era in the Republic. An era of experimentation, an era of wild and crazy ideas. Pasternak's task was to avoid placing himself in the center stage. His duty was to build a theater where all sorts of players might enter and leave the Republic's political sphere, bringing in their own ideas and vision of the future. People would add on to the constitution, and remove some things. Yet in it would live a spirit, a spark of Pasternak's own dreams and failed ambitions.\n\nOn and on the work went. Occasionally a lawyer came in to discuss something. In the afternoon a nurse administered the President his medicine for the day. Work progressed at a good pace. Every few days a compilation of recent ideas and changes was sent to advisors both within and without the Provisional Government. The President worked feverishly, a maddened maestro directing a raucous orchestra into simple and enjoyable harmonics."
TOM.4.a: "All the world's a stage."

TOM.5.t: "Ilya and Anna"
TOM.5.desc: ""Ilya and Anna: The greatest sibling duo the world over! The heroes Russia needs and deserves!"\n\n"Born to a loving family in Voronezh, the pair loses everything when the Huns invade and are forced to flee to the urbane metropolitan centre of Tomsk in Central Siberia. The lives they knew have been taken from them, but do they give up? No! Now, Ilya and Anna must travel across Tomsk through thousands of kilometres of forest and tundra, learning of Russia's past, discovering secrets and mysteries of our nation's rich folklore and history, and unveiling the greatest conspiracy known to the people of Central Siberia."\n\n"What is the conspiracy, you ask? Lurking beneath the shadows of Tomsk exists a great evil known as the 'Thule Society', who seeks to infiltrate our peaceful democratic state with German influence and myths of Aryan supremacy. They will stop at nothing to undermine Tomsk's survival and spiritual enlightenment, going so far as to summon demons! Only Ilya and Anna, with the help of friendship, teamwork, and friends they meet along their journey can prevent disaster from reaching Tomsk, and no doubt all of Russia!"\n\n"Tune into Radio Siberia to catch the action, excitement, and exploration of Russia's magnificent cultures and landscapes."\n\n"Ilya and Anna and all of the wonderful programming here on Radio Siberia is brought to you by The Central Siberian Telecommunications Department and various businesses working to provide opportunity and prosperity right here in Tomsk. Thank you for listening!""
TOM.5.a: "We'll have the budget for a cartoon version as soon as we reclaim all of Russia!"

TOM.6.t: "The End of an Era"
TOM.6.desc: "President Pasternak stood in front of the Cathedral of the Epiphany, alone on his podium. The cathedral had seen better days. As had their President, the assembled crowd thought. Even so both stood, proudly domineering Lenin's Square. More and more men and women crowded into the plaza, lured by the end of their work day to see the President in what all assumed would be one of his final public oratory.\n\n"Citizens. Friends. I come to you personally to announce the end of the Provisional Government. In the aftermath of the great calamities that fell on the Republic, you came forward and granted us our request for an emergency provisional government. With this vote of confidence in hand, the government and I have blindly stumbled forward, like drunks holding onto a train ticket, afeared of losing it and being unable to reach their destination. I now realize that our greatest mistake was that we tried to shoulder on the burden of righting the ship of state all on our own. For this great arrogance, this government has found itself unable to leave the dark valley in which it has erred for the last few years, unable to lead its people to a better place."\n\n"The Provisional Government must end, and in its place the people must take up their role, act onto the power granted to them by our Republic. A thousand, a million assembled candles will unite to illuminate our path. Citizens, I simply ask for your forgiveness, and thank you for your years of support.""
TOM.6.a: "I will fear no evil."

TOM.7.t: "Emptying the Offices"
TOM.7.desc: "It had been an ungrateful task, for sure. Somehow, the young bureaucrat knew he'd miss the job anyway. He lifted another stack of office supplies into the box. Few remained at this time of the day; most had already moved out in the days preceding the announcement. Now only the young bureaucrat and a few stragglers worked on moving out of the building. Here and there a few radios kept them company, all of them humming a recording of Pasternak's speech dissolving the Provisional Government.\n\nTheir office had been one of the subcommittees of the Provisional Government's ministry of the industry. Diligently the men and women had counted what remained of the CSR's industrial assets, what had been lost to the rebels, and what needed to be done to stabilize the situation. In the end all their efforts had not amounted to much. The Provisional Government didn't have a lot of resources to be devoted to massive industrial redevelopment efforts. Better to maintain the slow decay than risk it all.\n\nNot all was lost, however. Their reports had been compiled into easy to digest analyses, and then spread to the public by the government itself. The bureaucrat had heard that among the circles of the rapidly expanding political clubs, his team's work had been widely discussed and argued about. The bureaucrat smiled. Closed his box. Perhaps the new administration would have new work for him and his team."

TOM.8.t: "Lullabies for the Old West"
TOM.8.desc: ""Another glass of vodka?" the older man offered. Moisey accepted with a nod. He had long given up encouraging his friend and mentor to quit drinking. It always saddened him to see the old composer reduced in health. No one was spared by time, after all. Both friends toasted, to their old homes in the west. To the streets of Saint Petersburg, to the alleyways of Warsaw. Both lost to the years, fascist jackboots keeping them drowning in the ebbs of time until even memories were dissolved.\n\nThe two friends did not particularly enjoy musing on painful memories. Yet, the fall of Europe cast their shadow on both musicians' lives. To this tragedy, Dmitry Shostakovich could find echo in the more recent catastrophe of the destruction of the Central Siberian Republic. A nation of hope and progress, crushed by militarism, its corpse embalmed by faceless bureaucrats and kept on display.\n\n"What is there to be done?" asked Moisey. His mentor gazed into the distance, absent-mindedly pushing back up his glasses. Finally, the old composer spoke.\n\n"I've been discussing with fellows of the Humanist Salon. I will run for Presidency." Anticipating his friend's objection, Shostakovich lifted his hand. "Ironic, isn't it? Even as the poor Pasternak has a foot in the tomb, I stand in line behind him with my own poor health. Yet, something must be done. The President is a good man, and his call for election is the right one. I'm afraid, Moisey. So many candidates running, none of them understand why the old Republic failed. Everyone has solutions, to be implemented top down, orders and instructions for poor workers. But who will listen? Who will cherish the common man, the elites' so-called equals, their brothers and sisters? The old CSR didn't listen to the men in Altay and Novosibirsk, to the anarchists, to the poor and the hungry. I... I'd like to try to do something about it, Moisey. After a life of just being a victim of events, I..." Shostakovich fell silent.\n\nThe younger musician put his hand on his mentor's. "It's never too late to try, Dmitry. Now, how about we honor this bottle a final time for the day?" The older man smiled, nodded."

TOM.9.t: "Wise Men at Their End"
TOM.9.desc: "It was one of his father's bad days. Yevgeny Pasternak had always seen his father hard at work. Writing, thinking, speaking, acting. Now as the elder Pasternak burned his candle from both ends, the cancer that ravaged his body increasingly caused days where the President of the Republic lay in bed sleeping, coughing, sweating, slowly dying. As the eldest son, it fell to Yevgeny to take care of his father in these final days.\n\nEven as life ebbed from him, his father's eyes glimmered with intelligence and determination. He often talked of regrets of the past, and of future dreams. More mundane topics, of course. What was becoming of the extended family? How was Yevgeny's own work going in the much reduced capital of the Republic? The son gently encouraged his father to worry less about others and more about himself. The older poet laughed. "Say, did I ever discuss with you why I picked Tomsk?" "Why you picked Tomsk, father?" "As capital." A coughing fit. "Ah!" Yevgeny thought for a moment. "No, you haven't. Why Tomsk"\n\n"Why indeed." Pasternak smiled wistfully. "Novosibirsk had more industry. Barnaul was an important railway junction, and held rich farmland. Yet I thought it could not be anywhere but Tomsk. Tomsk, so spared by the war." Another coughing fit wracked his father's body. "Tomsk, with its schools, and gymnasiums, its cafes and its theaters. How can you terrorize a people that is learned? How can one deny a nation its history when books and songs and poems carry forward a thousand generations?" Boris Pasternak's sentence trailed off, perhaps ending less crisply than he had desired. For a moment the dying man's determination faltered, and he sought his firstborn son's eyes for comfort. Yevgeny clutched his father's hand. "It was the right decision, papa. Russia will see justice and freedom within my lifetime. Now, you should rest. I will go fetch you your dinner."\n\nThe Poet-President nodded, leaned back into his bed. The hot evening meal would give him some of its heat, perhaps."

Old friends, old rivals came to visit him. His wife, Zinaida, had come to talk, and talk they had. She had forgiven him some, although not all. Better that than nothing. His love, Olga Ivinskaya had also come by. How he wished he could have seen her more, have had something better for her than a few short visits, ushered in through a side door. Another regret for a life of regret. He had not done right to his wife nor his mistress. Hopefully he had done right to his country.\n\nHarder and harder to stay awake. Fitful sleep. Late afternoon coating the room in amber light. Standing by the bed, one of his sons, saying something. Hard to see him well, hear him well.\n\n"I can't hear you well. And there's a mist in front of my eyes." He tried to smile. "But it will go away, won't it? Don't forget to open the windows tomorrow.""

Elections have now begun. Candidacy for the State Duma are now accepted from the four great political salons of the Republic. Per the late President's final constitution, approved by the electoral commission, the sociopolitical rejuvenation of the Republic will pass through the popular movements known as the Decembrists, the Bastillard, the Humanists, and the Modernists. This college of political associations will tutor the reborn republic through these turbulent times. The party with presidential control of the Republic will offer a new constitution, allowing the people to experiment with their political institutions."\n\n"Citizens, the Republic needs you. It has asked you so much already; now in this zero hour, the nation needs your opinion, your insight. At the ballot box, inform us about your vision for this new era. You shall be tasked with voting for a local representative, as well as vote for a presidential candidate. Citizens, your help is critical!"\n\nThe news of elections ran through the nation like an electrifying current. Much remained unknown for now; in particular, few knew well the four political parties that had been chosen for the election. Fewer still understood the implications of voting for a constitution. But the presidential candidates were among the most well known men of Tomsk. The idea of moving past the era of controlled destitution with the Provisional Government was an appealing one."

TOM.12.t: "In the Hall of Mirrors"
TOM.12.desc: "Nikolai entered his favorite bar after a long shift. Working at the foundry was hard work, gruelling work. The pay, however, was quite good. All the better to provide for his family.\n\nThe bar's usual layout was much changed, that evening. Tables and chairs had been arranged in a wide circle around a makeshift podium of bar stools. On it stood a gaunt figure of a man. The skeletal individual, dressed as an English dandy, recited line after line of lewd poetry, a beer mug in one hand and a calabash pipe in the other. The bar's habituals roared with laughter, and hollered at the strange figure. When the poet ended his recitation, cheers and whistles crowded him out in the bar. A few of the men turned toward the door, and noticed the confused Nikolai. "Oy, Kolia, look what we've got here, an actual presidential candidate."\n\nThe emaciated poet turned to face the newcomer, bowed toward him, the makeshift barstool podium shaking. "Daniil Kharms, author, poet, not so humble representative of the Trinity Group for culture and industry, known to all as the Bastillard Club, at your service."\n\nNikolai of course knew of the author, most well known for his children's book as well as his charity work to teach literacy. An eccentric man. Nowadays a front for the elitist, anti-worker Bastillard Society. "Why bring politics here, poet? I thought you and the Bastillards had little wish to listen to the people."\n\nKharms nodded, climbed down from his podium to walk toward Nikolai. "Of course, of course! I'm an honest man, why would I run on a campaign of lies? As President, I'd want a strong republic, able to smash those fuckers in Novosibirsk and provide work and prosperity for all of us. Of course, every party claims that. But every party but ours claims that they care about the workers, don't they? Only the Bastillards are honest in their indifference." A chorus of laughter. A beer made its way to Nikolai, who cheered with the strange politician. Perhaps the elections this year would provide entertainment, at least."

TOM.13.desc: "Marshal Shaposhnikov, in his role chief of the Republic's armies, stood in a crowded room. Tomsk's top brass as well as a few high ranking civilians had been assembled to discuss the final steps in the prepared invasion of the federation of Novosibirsk and Altay.\n\nBetween Tomsk and its target stood a mixture of plains and woodland. Greatest obstacle of all would be the Ob River; the city of Novosibirsk itself was exposed, on the right flank of the river. But any commander worth their salt would keep large reserves west of the river, ready to attempt to relieve any besieged city. An important secondary target was the Altay region and its capital, Barnaul. At the moment the southern part of the Novosibirsk-Altay Federation, Barnaul and its surroundings had been some of the best farmland of the Central Siberian Republic, as well as a crucial railway junction. Recapturing it would be a great morale coup, and perhaps fatally weaken the opposition.\n\nSome general droned on explanation to an envoy from the ministry of war. Shaposhnikov tried to pay attention. His heart wasn't in it. He had served with Pokryshkin, Novosibirsk's strongman. The enemy officers were damned traitors, yet they were also damn fine commanders. Neither the city of Novosibirsk nor the plains of Altay would be ceded easily. Over land and in the skies, the Siberian Falcon and his associates would wage a determined opposition."

The trial of Vasily Shukshin, Alexander Pokryshkin, and all their associates of the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay saw packed courtrooms. The federates had been the most powerful breakaway faction of the Republic, and now their defeat had brought back to the fore the pain of the secession all those years ago.\n\nBoth of the main defendants appeared unrepentant before the court. Vasily Shukshin decried the difficult condition in the Altay region, where peasants were overworked to feed the whole of the Central Siberian Republic. Had it not been their right to march for their rights? When accused of leading violence against the central government, Shukshin retorted that the Republican Army had been sent in to crush the protest violently, forcing the citizens to arm themselves.\n\nLikewise, Pokryshkin was unmoved by the prosecution's accusations. Him, a traitor? As a military officer he had always known his duty to the common man. When the stalemate war against Yagoda's Red Army remnants had pushed the Central Siberian Republic to the famine, had the people not been right to call for peace? Had their desperate pleas deserved to be drowned under the crackle of gunfire?\n\nTheir arguments failed to sway either the crowd or the judge. "As military officers and as regional politicians, the accused failed to restore calm and order in their jurisdiction. Instead they invited the specter of civil war, and plunged Central Siberia in chaos. Unrepentant, these so called federates proceeded to build a corrupt, autocratic regime. No doubt had these federates had their way, Russian democracy would be buried, its corpse used to fertilize corrupt private interests. For this, this court condemns the accused, and will seek sentences of life in prison, where the accused will have time to reflect on their crimes.""

TOM.15.desc: "Nikolai Masalov hit the dirt as another bullet ripped through the air next to his head. He sat up as the sounds of combat raged around him, his back pressed against the south wall of a brick house. Attempting to regain composure, he rose to his feet and repeated his instructions to himself through labored breaths. Lead the local militia in defense of this village. Easy.\n\nHe just had not expected there to be so many damn bandits. His arrival to the bandit-plagued village was almost in sync with their ambush. Now the disorganized defenders of the village were spread out and vulnerable. Nikolai peered across the street where two of the local men, armed with hunting rifles, stared down a rusty truck with a salvaged machine gun from behind a hasty assortment of sandbags.\n\nThe aging soldier suddenly pulled back behind the wall as another hail of lead tore through the thin air beside his cover. He gripped his service revolver until his knuckles were white, drawing a sharp breath before leaning out of safety to find...\n\nA child, no older than 4 and clad in a crimson stained dress, was toddling into the dusty road where the skirmish was going on a mere 30 feet in front of Nikolai. Misty eyed and scared, the small girl cried out for her family as she staggered aimlessly in search of them, nearly in the bandits' line of fire. Nikolai's panicked thoughts wandered to his daughter at home, before he found himself bolting out of the safety of cover.\n\nBullets bit into the wall behind Masalov ferociously, barely audible over the deafening drumbeat of his heart. The girl was now almost in the street, her bare foot past the brick wall that had been shielding her from the bloodthirsty gunners. Barely a religious man, a curse laden prayer still escaped Nikolai's lips as he dove forward, his left ear now ringing from a barely missed shot. Scooping up the girl, the man rolled back into cover as a spray of gunfire dug into the soil where the toddler had been standing moments before."

He watched citizens with hollow eyes and caved stomachs dive on the bodies like a pack of wild dogs. He continued to call for his wife in the chaos of the bombing, his throat sore from his silent screaming. Panic gripped him as he found himself digging through debris until his hands were bleeding raw.\n\nDmitry shot up, drenched in sweat and staring directly at the family portrait on his bedroom wall. All of them were there. He turned over, looking at Zinaida resting peacefully beside him. She always could sleep through his night terrors. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, the old writer slowly stood up and went into his kitchen, moonlight shining through the curtains.\n\nDrumming his fingertips on the counter, he dialed his old friend Shostakovich. It was 2 AM, but Dmitry was a notorious night owl.\n\nPredictably, the phone rang but twice before the pianist picked up, "Dmitry, friend! A busy man like you can only be awake right now for one reason; what troubles you?" Spoke Shostakovich.\n\n"I dreamt of Leningrad again. There was- and I- Zinaid..." Ironically, the eloquent writer found himself barely able to form a sentence, his composure crumbling in seconds.\n\n"I understand, friend. The siege haunts me as well. Just calm down, it's over.

We cannot bring them back, certainly not by panicking."\n\nDmitry sighed deeply, calmer now but sinking into despair.\n\n"Let me finish, Dmitry."

TOM.17.desc: "Field Marshal Shaposhnikov's day had been long. The night would be longer still, occupied as he was to putting the finishing touches to Operation Oskolok, the planned recapture of Kemerovo.\n\nThe facts and matters of the operation were simple. Former general of the Central Siberian Republic Nikolay Krylov had seceded with several of the Republic's best infantry and mechanized divisions. The rich industrial town of Kemerovo and its coal basin had no doubt helped the separatists field several more regiments of well equipped troops. There were few good angle of attacks through the woods between staging point Yurga, and enemy capital Kemerovo. Shaposhnkov hoped it would not boil down to a war of attrition.\n\nRumors from the south were troubling. Shaposhnikov had served with Nikolay Krylov. Knew him well. The separatist leader had been a good officer. Now, word on the street was that the commander had gone mad. Claimed himself to be the heir of Rurik, the ancient king of Rus. Shaposhnikov had no idea if the rumors were true, no idea if his old friend had completely lost it after failing to defeat the anarchists in the east. All the Marshal knew is that for the Republic to live, Kemerovo's industrial assets had to be retaken.\n\nSome of Shaposhnikov's junior staff had expressed a mocking attitude toward the mad king and his lackeys. The Marshal had been quick to remind his officers not to underestimate any enemy. Crazy or not, General Krylov was a smart and charismatic leader. His subjects would fight to the bitter end to defend their new state. The Republican Marshal hoped that Operation Oskolok would not trigger a long and bitter bloodshed between Tomsk and its former province."

TOM.18.desc: "The central government had come around to ask for military plans to deal with the rogue Oyrotian territory. Shaposhnikov had hoped things would never come to this. He had also prepared just such a set of invasion plans, named Operation Vozneseniye. The Marshal of the Republic knew the civilian government had as little appetite for violence against the remote secessionists. Who knew how things would turn out, in this era of strife and conflict.\n\nThe military side of things was quite simple. Beyond the problem posed by high altitude fighting, Oyrotia's population was and had always been extremely low. Even with the influx of displaced Old Believers from western Russia, the tiny nation would struggle to field more than a few regiments of regular infantry. Beyond discussion of staging points for the invasion and a schedule aimed to acclimatize troops to mountain air, the military plan mostly discussed cultural issues tied to the occupation and how best to avoid making the locals feel as though their way of life is threatened.\n\nThe region had long been poor and semi-autonomous from the Central Siberian government. Local Burkhanists, follower of a Turkic faith, had complained to the government about the arrival of thousands of Old Believer refugees from the west. The ever marginalized Christian group had apparently decided on settling in a remote location for their own safety. Local tensions had been an issue, but not a critical one. The province had become separated from Tomsk in the collapse of the Republic, and had sought neutrality and isolation in the following years. Zavoloko, President of the tiny nation, was not a bad man. If only guarantees were made that his people would be left free to worship however they chose, then maybe violence could have been avoided, Shaposhnikov thought."

On the record player beside him was a particularly sentimental piece, but one he had not heard before. Recently, news had reached him of an old pupil of his gaining relative notoriety for a brand new composition - The Sun of Incas, by Edison Denisov. He had always been a promising trainee, going on to teach at Tomsk State, something Dmitry had always been proud of. So, when word of this composition reached his ear, he went out and found himself a recording.\n\nNow, he sat comfortably in his living room as the music began. It started off discordant but rhythmic, with an array of instruments playing in an almost frantic manner. The composition segued shortly into a much more subdued but utterly enrapturing work for most of the sitting, a lone female voice singing over a complexly constructed backdrop of wind, brass and string. Occasionally, the music would dip into the frenzy that marked its beginning, and remnants of that initial tune lay strung about the length of the work. The composition was loud and yet quiet, discordant and yet beautiful, rhythmic yet flowing. Shostakovich sat in that chair for 20 minutes as his former pupil's music spilled out of the record player and filled his home, leaving the man himself in an enchanted state. As the music faded at last, Dmitry rose to his feet, both intensely affected by the music but also swelling with pride in Edison.\n\nSmiling, he went over to his desk and grabbed a pen. Reaching for a few sheets of paper, he began drafting a letter to his old friend. "Dear Edison...""

Hell, he could barely even read, much less form any opinion on such esoteric subjects like Siberian history, but here he was. A symposium, a word he couldn't even define until yesterday when he was informed of his invitation, on the history of Russia's expansion into Siberia. The poster had stuck out to him when he saw it, an academic discussion, historical lesson, and banquet wrapped up into one not just for the scholars but for the common people of Central Siberia. Quite frankly, he'd just come for the free food and drinks, but he couldn't help but find an interest in the subject he barely understood.\n\nPhilosophers, politicians, artists, and academics fought on the proverbial battlefield of historical debate. Information was shared that Maksim could only dream of: deals brokered with local tribes, great khanates spreading across what is now his own home, peoples long gone and their customs. It was all both confusing and enlightening, to the point Maksim had left his plate only half finished as he sat for at least an hour drinking deeply from the cup of knowledge.\n\nWhen it was all over, he almost felt dizzy from the experience, but found himself still remembering everything he had been told. As he and the rest of the common folk filtered out of the hall, they talked about what they had learned, new perspectives they had formed, and of course how they never knew they could get so caught up in something they had once viewed as so dull. As Maksim walked home that night, his thoughts wandered to ancient history on their own, and he resolved to begin paying visits to libraries and lectures in the future."

The lines are long, you have to sit around for two hours, and they're never as good as advertised," replied Dmitri, in what he was sure was an exact repeat of the conversation they had last time they ate lunch together.\n\n"Innokenty Smoktunovsky makes it all worth it; he's not like those wooden actors you see in other movies," said Igor as he dug his knife into his steak. This fact was news to Dmitri, but so was the name.\n\n"Who the hell is that?"\n\n"Only the King of Siberian actors!

"I tend to prefer the humanist's outlook, a world in which the common man is taught to love and appreciate his society, as difficult as this may be to teach. What is your own take on it?"\n\nYou are naive, Sasha. I like that in an academic." Kharms smiled. "I do share your thoughts that this trend toward negative ignorance can be reversed. Not by giving understanding to the masses, but purpose. There have been complex societies before, nations whose working far eluded the common man. Did chinese emperors and mandarins care how much day laborers understood the system? Of course, I hear you object that as democrats we owe our positions to the common citizen. A new contract can be forged, one where all citizens sublimate the absurdity of modern life into something greater, into institutions that outlive them.

The pain he had endured in those days was excruciating at its most mild. If he had not been freed by his guards fleeing the destruction that came with the Union's collapse, he did not know what might have become of him.\n\nWith a simple nod, Pobisk turned and headed back to the train station.

I suppose not. You make a good point, Mr. President."\n\n"I'm glad you agree with me then," replied Kharms with a soft smile.\n\n"Oh, wait!" someone else interjected. "Shall we move forward with the four-year plan with the industrialists or the three-year plan involving the bureaucrats and workers?"\n\n"I'll think on it.""
TOM.25.a: "Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."

TOM.26.t: "Dealing with a Devil"
TOM.26.desc: "Central Siberia may have had an abundance of natural resources, but the excesses Kharms saw looking at the oligarch's mansion were unjustifiable. He understood the desire to live comfortably, but the sheer size of the place was jaw-dropping and could easily cause one's blood to boil. Kharms could say nothing, of course, as his nation required the investments of an ultra-wealthy man like Boris Khodorkovsky.\n\nStanding before the grand front doors was factory and infrastructure mogul Boris Khodorkovsky. "Good morning, Mr. President! How do you do?" called the billionaire as Kharms approached the palatial front steps. He appeared to be friendly enough, but of course a major investment opportunity like this one would have that effect on a person.\n\n"I'm fine. Yourself?"\n\n"Good, very good! It's a pleasure to meet with you." Kharms nodded and said nothing. He climbed up the steps and gave the man a firm handshake. Khodorkovsky gestured Kharms inside.\n\nThe two men walked through too many rooms to count before reaching the oversized dining room where they would presumably discuss their business. How such an elegant and massive table and set of chairs was brought to the middle of Siberia was a mystery to Kharms. Both men pulled up chairs across from each other and took a seat.\n\n"So what do you have to offer me today?" asked a very eager Khodorkovsky."
TOM.26.a: "It's a little humiliating that this is necessary."

TOM.27.t: "The Harmonious Wasteland"
TOM.27.desc: "The life of the average townsperson or city-dweller in Tomsk is the same as it as across Russia and, indeed, the rest of the world; it consists of working a long and gruelling day at a factory, farm, or office before returning home to one's family for the night, and eating and sleeping so they can wake up the next day and do it again. Under the Bastillards' new cultural plan, this has not changed.\n\nWhat has changed, however, is the ambience of Tomsk's towns and cities. Posters promoting and praising the strong work ethic of the Central Siberian individual line the streets, news updates on the radio applauding the opening of new factories and the labourers who will work in them occur after every song is played, but above all the new cinema scene of Tomsk is the Bastillards' crowning cultural achievement.\n\nA wave of "Bastillard realist" style films have been released over the past months, depicting the people of Central Siberia, no matter their walk of life, as hardworking, determined, and industrious. The great challenges standing before us crumble before the face of everyone working, thinking, and learning together. One film titled "The Harmonious Wasteland" has even managed to gain some slight traction outside of Tomsk due to its thrilling story and powerful message. It details the story of how the Central Siberian Republic initially formed from the ashes of the USSR, and how the Republic never could have come together without soldiers, politicians, and workers coming together. Its message of rejecting class conflict in favour of having all classes working together to further the goals of Central Siberia strongly resonated with the film's viewers, and has helped instill exactly the sort of values that the Bastillards were hoping for.\n\nThe people of Tomsk can now display great pride in their excellent work ethic, their powerful industry, and their inspiring history."
TOM.27.a: "We have come together as one."

TOM.28.t: "We'll Do It Ourselves"
TOM.28.desc: "This was the price of refusing to use investments from the industrialists; having less money and fewer opportunities for development was a steep one, but a price well worth having the state and the people reap all of the benefits of industrialization themselves. The Bastillards had intelligence and ingenuity, so they could surely develop plans without the help of some wealthy tycoons.\n\nSitting at a desk, writing and reading over development proposals, engaging with an endless back-and-forth dialogue with the leadership of the trade unions, and crunching numbers. This was the exciting work that the Bastillards, technocrats that they were, had signed up for. They were the experts who would ensure that all of the calculations were correct and that everything was up to scratch with surgical precision.\n\nOf course, these promises which were made to the people of Tomsk were very much easier said than done. Gradually, things would begin to slow down as the tedious and repetitive work became a great chore, and the government was forced to focus on the industrialization project and ignore everything else. It was tiring. But, expertise would begin to develop too. Combing through old Central Siberian Plan documents from the Bukharin era provided many ideas and much inspiration for new plans as well.\n\nThe Bastillards had a monumental task before them, but they would push forward and get it done."
TOM.28.a: "We don't need help."

TOM.30.t: "A New Central Siberia"
TOM.30.desc: "Kharms read through his weekly report. It was totally devoid of surprises. The fantastic numbers regarding industrial scale and efficiency, estimated GDP, government approval, and all other sorts of metrics that would have shocked him a few months ago had since become amazingly consistent.\n\nWhen Kharms walked the streets of Tomsk, it was easy to sense a more jovial and upbeat aura among the everyday people. People strolled along happily, the cafés were full, long lines of people waited to watch the next exciting film at the cinema... Tomsk was genuinely a nice place to live!\n\nEven better was the pure devotion everyone seemed to have to the betterment of their society. Reports often showed that many workers were regularly offering to do overtime, citizens went out into the community every week to collect trash and clean up, and the number of military recruits had steadily increased as more people acknowledged the need to and Tomsk's newfound ability to pacify the separatists across Central Siberia.\n\nIndeed, Kharms felt that Tomsk was almost ready to reclaim all of the Central Siberian Republic's territory, and that the military would be more capable of handling a worker uprising than it was before. Everything seemed to be falling into place perfectly, and so Kharms allowed himself to feel a great deal of self-satisfaction. A New Central Siberia was emerging."
TOM.30.a: "A few intelligent heads and a devoted population can get anything done together."

TOM.31.t: "Envoys from the Old Republic"
TOM.31.desc: "President Zavoloko was surprised to find the strangers land their plane on the city's outskirts. Even more surprised to hear they were diplomats from Tomsk. The men were escorted to his house.\n\nThe diplomats offered reintegration into Tomsk, with Oyrotia's autonomy maintained. As successor state to the Central Siberian Republic, Tomsk asserted its right to ask for its wayward province's return. Refusal of this diplomatic overture would mean war.\n\n"So strange to think that someone out there has not forgotten us." Thought the President. His aides hovered next to him, awaiting his answer."
TOM.31.a: "We will rejoin the republic!"
TOM.31.b: "We will fight for our independence!"

TOM.32.t: "Reintegration of Oyrotia"
TOM.32.desc: "Today, cheering citizens have greeted the arrival of Oyrotia's representatives into the capital. The envoys were a pair; an Old Believer priest, and a Burkhanist elder. Both were driven to the presidential palace, where a great ceremony was to be held for the peaceful reunion of the Republic with its wayward province.\n\nIn Gorno-Altaysk, little had seemingly changed. President Zavoloko had resigned, letting a new provincial governor be appointed by Tomsk. A list of good candidates had been prepared; a suggestion of choosing a man from each religious community had been put forward. In the hills and among the mountains of the Altay, the two communities continued to live, and continued to pray. Slowly, the old resident grew accustomed to their new neighbors. This process would continue as Oyrotia took back its place within a new Republic. The only difference was that, hopefully, war would not visit the autonomous province in the foreseeable future. In the new Republic, Zavoloko had hopefully found a protector, and a friend, that would let the Burkhanist and Old Believers finally live in peace."
TOM.32.a: "Welcome home, citizens!"

TOM.33.t: "War for Oyrotia!"
TOM.33.desc: "Shaposhnikov's long face said much. His aide for the day had seen the Marshal enter in his office for a long phone call with his civilian counterpart in the war ministry. "Sir?" The aide spoke up. Shaposhnikov turned toward him.\n\n"Oyrotia has rejected our offers of diplomatic unification. The central government has given us the go ahead to enact Operation Vozneseniye."\n\nThe aide noded. "What are your order, sir?"\n\n"Tell our troops on the border to begin acclimatization to high altitudes. And reinforce discipline. If I hear of any looting incidents, I'll have the officers in charge scrubbing toilet until the end of his career. The Oyrotians are afraid of us; if we make them hate us as well, the insurgency will be never ending. This needs to be quick, decisive, and a permanent end to hostilities in the region."\n\n"Sir, yes sir! Should I prepare another cup of tea, afterwards?" Shaposhnikov nodded. Perhaps the hot drink would ease some his displeasure at the news. What was President Zavoloko thinking?"
TOM.33.a: "Diplomacy has ended. To war!"

TOM.34.t: "The Planet of Storms"
TOM.34.desc: "A popular new book is circling through the upper echelons of our society. The Planet of Storms by Alexander Kazantsev is a fictional story about Russian cosmonauts set in the distant future of 2010, performing the first exploration of the planet Venus. The cosmonauts face many dangerous challenges such as meteorites, carnivorous plants, dangerous aliens, and deadly diseases. The end of the book reveals an extraordinary plot twist that takes both everyday readers and accomplished critics by surprise.\n\nThe book is widely believed to be influenced by the ideas of major Russian cosmist thinkers such as Alexander Bogdanov and Nikolai Federov. Kazantsev has confirmed he was inspired by these ideas and did include them in his novel.\n\nThe concepts of Cosmism primarily include the ideas of a new, almost utopian world, one where humanity would have free reign in space with the ability to acquire an infinite amount of resources. Cosmism also focuses not just on science and technology, but also on culture and natural philosophy. Cosmism even includes ideas of bringing the dead back to life and the achievement of human immortality. This Russian philosophical current has gained much-renewed interest in Tomsk with the rise of the Modernist Salon, and its ideals of a well ran free society that values knowledge.\n\nWhile the book has its share of detractors, its fiercer critics slamming it for being scientifically impossible, many people both young and old are complimenting the book for its many twists and thrilling writing. While it may be popular in Tomsk, it, unfortunately, has not seen much popularity beyond the Republic's borders. It seems not many people are up to purchasing and reading books in warlord Russia. However, there have been rumors of a movie adaptation being produced, so Alexander's story might not be quite over yet."
TOM.34.a: "Where's my copy?"

TOM.35.t: "Dissolving the Principality"
TOM.35.desc: "The loss of Kemerovo and its surroundings had been one of the final nails in the Central Siberian Republic. When General Krylov had gone mad and emerged as the self styled Rurik II, the industrial assets of the Kemerovo region as well as its vast coal mines had slipped from Tomsk's grasp. Recapturing the region with the much diminished Republican Army would have been the height of folly. Some of the CSR's best troops had gone east with Krylov, and those men that had not left for Krasnoyarsk soon formed the core of Krylov's new royal army.\n\nNow, the region has been liberated! Even as our Republic's soldiers enter the streets of the enemy capital, our bureaucrats are already at work implementing Shaposhnikov's post war ideas. Every captured industrial complex has seen its damage assessed and its potential outputs added to the tally. All of this information will be put to good use for future economic planning. Equally important in the tallying are captured soldiers and surrendering garrisons. It is hoped that many of the men are not very ideological, and can thus be reintegrated into our army. These elements of questionable loyalty will be placed in front line duty, allowing them to keep their jobs while expanding our military capacity.\n\nAll of this will take time. Trials for local officials and military commanders who joined in Krylov's mutiny will be a complicated affair, and expose deep wounds left by the fall of the Central Siberian Republic. With malice toward none, we must set to work tying back together the fate of Kemerovo's residents to the fate of our great Republic."
TOM.35.a: "Let's get to work."

TOM.36.t: "The Fate of the Mad King"
TOM.36.desc: "After our triumph over the so-called Principality of Kemerovo, our men have captured the mad king Rurik II, formerly General Krylov of the Central Siberian Republic. The poor unfortunate has returned to Tomsk not as a conquering hero, but as a prisoner of war, his fate uncertain.\n\nFor many in the capital, Krylov deserves the fate of every captured separatist. After a trial to establish his degree of guilt, Krylov shall serve a long sentence in prison where the remnants of his fractured psyche are able to think about the blood he shed in his hunger for power.\n\nOthers, however, hold a more nuanced perspective on the disgraced general. Krylov had long battled depression after the annihilation of the Soviet Union and the death of so many of its people. Sent east to fight for the Central Siberian Republic, his defeat by the anarchist and the treachery of his officers in Krasnoyarsk have sent Krylov's mental health into a final free fall. The faction pleading for clemency, led by Krylov's former friend Marshal Shaposhnikov, have published an open letter requesting Krylov be placed in a mental institution. There, the former mad king might hopefully see his mental health improved, and some of his megalomania removed.\n\nThe debates about this issue have been fierce. Many who express sympathy for Krylov's plight still decry the general's failures, and argue that it is unknown if the general is truly mad, or invented his Rurik persona to justify his secession. The people desire to know which way the President's office leans on this issue."
TOM.36.a: "Mercy is not weakness. Place him in a mental hospital."
TOM.36.b: "Krylov must be tried for his crimes."

TOM.37.t: "The Weekly Visit"
TOM.37.desc: "Shaposhnikov presented his ID before being allowed into the room. Armed guards sat outside it playing cards, their submachine guns dangling loosely in their backs. Few chances of followers of the fallen king trying to rescue him. Or of the king trying to flee. The Marshal of the Republic still made a mental note to insist on better discipline for the guards.\n\nKrylov's room was sparse. A small library held the book on loan to him from Tomsk's libraries. A desk with a simple chair, where the former king received correspondence from his former subjects, and from citizen throughout the Republic. The former missed their king, strangely. The latter were curious about the fallen general. That day, Krylov himself wore an old Soviet style uniform, well ironed.\n\nShaposhnikov had visited his old friend once a week, and had occasionally chatted with the hospital's staff. Krylov's delusions of being Rurik's reincarnation were easing away. Only rarely did he give orders to the staff to fetch him food fit for his regal majesty. Shaposhnikov could see the strange mania was draining from the old general's eyes. Only sadness remained. Sadness for the fall of the Soviet Union, sadness for failing the republic before, sadness for failing his new subjects and his children.\n\nKrylov asked about Boris, Lydia and Yuriy. Shaposhnikov would give his old friend any news he had, and offer to carry to them any letter he wanted. Krylov politely declined, saying he didn't feel ready yet to face them. The old general asked about the rest of Central Siberia, and news from the wider world. Whenever Shaposhnikov spoke of such topics, some of the former mad king's energetic expressions returned. The Marshal of the Republic could only hope that his old friend had removed the Mad King's mask, rather than have the Mad King put on Krylov's mannerism. In time, full recovery would happen, the Marshal hoped."
TOM.37.a: "It was good to take tea with a friend."

TOM.38.t: "Operation Khorei"
TOM.38.desc: "In front of the assembled generals and commanders, a blackboard had been installed, upon which the words "Operation Khorei" had been written. The invasion to recapture Krasnoyarsk from former Central Siberian Republic Colonel Andreev and his acolytes.\n\nShaposhnikov detailed the opposition, as well strategic concerns for the invasion. The mutineers had chosen their location well; upon their betrayal of General Krylov, the rogue military units had seized the city of Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei River. Recapturing the city would have been a dicey proposition for the failing CSR, forcing an attack upon both sides of the mighty river. The mutineers' hijacking of heavy guns meant to rout the anarchists had ensured that their position was all but unassailable, forcing Krylov to retreat in disgrace. The modern Republican Army would be a far better match for Krasnoyarsk. Yet caution remained of the utmost importance.\n\nAfter giving his presentation, and listening to subsequent discussions, Shaposhnikov's thoughts went to Andreev. Personal disdain had no place in a commanding officer's mind. The Marshal of the Republic, however, hated Andreev and his mutineer. Not only had they cost the Republic dearly in blood and treasure, their betrayal had done much to send Krylov into a downward spiral. Not too long after his old friend had declared himself a king and began his mad reign. Shaposhnikov knew that as long as he and his men kept their calm, the rogue province would be recaptured. Only then would justice against the traitors take place."
TOM.38.a: "We will silence these traitors."

TOM.39.t: "Trial of the Krasnoyarsk Clique"
TOM.39.desc: "The trials were held in front of a limited crowd. If the Novosibirsk and Altay Federation were seen in Tomsk as the great betrayers of the CSR, the mutineers of Krasnoyarsk were the Republic's undertakers. To avoid heckling crowds, the capital's police held a close watch on the spectators as the treason trials were underway.\n\nAndreev and his accomplices defended their action by declaring the central government had lost the people's support. After being routed by anarchist rebels, the thought of regrouping for another attempt to subdue the desperate population had broken the soldier's morale. Their act of rebellion against General Krylov had been meant to save Krasnoyarsk and the eastern territories from further bloodshed.\n\nUnfortunately for the mutineers, intercepted transmissions and letters that had predated the mutiny had been saved by fleeing CSR soldiers, and brought back to Tomsk. There, Andreev's duplicity had revealed itself; the coup had been long planned and organized from the top down. Ambitious military officers had lied to their men about Krylov's intentions. Once Krasonyarsk had been captured, a junta had ruled the fallen province, depriving the people of their freedoms. For this treason against the Republic and her people, the judge sentenced the mutiny's leaders to long prison sentences. Never again would armed men impose their dictats upon the population."
TOM.39.a: "An ignoble fate for ignoble men."

TOM.41.t: "The Union Debate"
TOM.41.desc: "It had been put off for long enough, and the union issue had finally come to a head. Now, for the first time, the government and the unions have begun negotiating. The room was unsurprisingly tense as the chief Modernist negotiator and his committee sat down across from the presidents and negotiators of the largest unions throughout the nation.\n\nThese discussions would be onerous, as they perfectly encapsulated the great dilemma the government had faced since coming into power: Tomsk needed to industrialize so that the separatists could be reclaimed and Central Siberia could reunify. The workers and unions were demanding better conditions and pay, but if such concessions were made now that might make it impossible for enough goods and munitions to be produced in time to secure Central Siberia, and thus the possibility to protect those workers' rights in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the demands being made by the unions was the pressure being exerted by the Decembrists and the Bastillards, who both more strongly emphasized the long-term solution of focusing on re-conquest. If the Modernists upheld the status quo and refused to make concessions, the other parties would surely increase their support of the government.\n\nUltimately, the primary demand being made by the unions was a reform of Tomsk's collective bargaining system to be fairer and more beneficial to the unionized workers. It was not an altogether unreasonable demand, and conceding to it would no doubt improve stability and workers' rights, but it did run the risk of making Tomsk weaker in a time where it especially needed to be strong. Either option was viable."
TOM.41.a: "Rights come before productivity."
TOM.41.b: "We cannot secure your rights in the long term without maintaining productivity now."

TOM.43.t: "Operation Tvyordaya Ruka"
TOM.43.desc: "Shaposhnikov nursed a cup of bad coffee as his aides ran back and forth in the war ministry. Any moment now, President [TOM.GetLeader] was expected to call and give Operation Tvyordaya Ruka his official approval.\n\nTvyordaya Ruka. Mostly recycled plans from the initial attempt by the CSR to crush the anarchist uprising all those years ago. It had not been a bad plan; a rapid push to cut in half the territory occupied by Anarchist rebels, and lay siege to the capital of Kansk where the Siberian Black Army's main headquarters could be found. Krylov's initial push had come close to doing the job. Andreev's betrayal had ensured that there would be no follow up offensives. In the Black Army's success in routing Krylov's heavy guns from the outskirts of Kansk, the final death of the Central Siberian Republic was determined. The anarchists had fought hard, and they had fought well. But this time, they would not face an exhausted Republican army.\n\nInformation sources on the SBA were hard to come by. The Republic's intelligence agency had still not determined how exactly the initial revolt had been sparked. Nor had it figured out who among SBA leaders Stepanov and Siuda really spoke for the army and its men. Shaposhnikov hoped that in battle the truth would become clear, and the Republic would finally understand its foe enough to destroy it.\n\nA phone call. Even before answering, the Marshal knew it was time."
TOM.43.a: "We march east to wash the sins of the past."

TOM.44.t: "End of the Revolt"
TOM.44.desc: "In the end, victory in the field had broken the back of the famed Siberian Black Army. The anarchist soldiers had fought long and hard. When their situation had grown impossible, however, the SBA had lost men as fast as melting spring snow. The Tomskian offensive, combined with Shaposhnikov's suggested land reforms and food delivery, had done much to peel away communes from the Black Army. The surrender of General Stepanov and his men had rendered the Black Army remnants into a determined insurrection. Tomsk's generals urged their men on, isolating hostile communes and slowly forming a grid of pacified territory within the region.\n\nThe capture of Councilor Siuda was the Republican Army's highest priority, a culmination to the final campaign to eradicate anarchist ideology. The dedicated anarchist ideologue remained defiant to the end, unwilling to accept the offer of amnesty. Siuda died with his last companions, cornered in a forest safe house in the north. The men and women fought to the last bullet, refusing to grant their Republican foes any legitimacy. The martyrdom of Siuda echoed through the former Free Territory, and for a moment it seemed the insurrection might be sparked anew. But as loved as the councillor had been, the communes throughout the region were exhausted by a decade of conflict.\n\nThe Republican Army took care to listen to their grievances, and brought food for the poorest. Perhaps their leader would have cast his judgement on them for willingly accepting servitude to the invading state. The peasants hoped the councillor would have found in himself the strength to forgive them.\n\nGeneral Stepanov's trial is due to begin soon. He is expected to argue that he merely wanted to protect local citizens from endless violence, as had all other captured separatists. In Tomsk, rumors abound of a reduced sentence meant to reward him for agreeing to end the bloodshed and give back to the eastern territories a sense of normalcy."
TOM.44.a: "The Republic forgives, but does not forget."

TOM.45.t: "Operation Shkola"
TOM.45.desc: "War Plan Shkola. Shaposhnikov had first dreamed up this contingency scenario during the old CSR days, when the People's Revolutionary Council was the last bit of land not claimed by either the Republic and Yagoda's eastern Soviet. Back then the assumption had been that the rising CSR would be able to complete its conquest of all of Central Siberia. The Marshal smiled. How foolishly short sighted.\n\nUnderestimating Vasilevsky and his Soviet remnants had never been in question, however. Many observers had mocked the ambitions of the under armed Mongolian Red Army remnants and of the under strength light tank divisions that Vasilevsky had united in his PRC. Keeping a low profile, Vasilevsky had had the last laugh when his biggest rivals in the Far East and Central Siberia had torn themselves apart. This stay of execution had let the PRC thrive, and the tenacious Red soldiers had clung on to their land, even in the face of the almighty Sphere.\n\nTheir goal was admirable, of helping the Mongols fight for their homeland, and of reforging a Soviet Union kinder to its peoples. Shaposhnikov admired their courage and determination. Those qualities sadly also made them a threat to the Republic. Vasilevsky's army had to be defeated in the field."
TOM.45.a: "A regrettable war."

TOM.46.t: "From Reds to Republicans?"
TOM.46.desc: "The soldiers of the PRC had expected death or exile at the end of their lost war. Many were pleasantly surprised to find forgiveness from the Republican Army.\n\nThe PRC's higher ups were tried in Tomsk. The prosecution against him was not as aggressive as it had been against defeated separatists. The men of the PRC had broken no laws of the CSR by staying true to their old allegiance. Nor had they joined in Yagoda's war of aggression to destroy the Republic. The prosecutors noted that the Red Army remnants were still illegally occupying land claimed by the CSR. This did not warrant, however, treason charges as had been used before.\n\nThe common soldiers and officers were offered to join the Republican Army. This was a tempting offer to many. War was their craft, and the Republic seemed honorable men intent on helping Russia. Others found the humiliation of joining their enemies too much to bear. They had fought for Vasilevsky, who now risked a lengthy prison sentence. They had fought for communism, not the restoration of a shaky capitalist regime.\n\nThe People's Revolutionary Council came to a bittersweet end, torn apart by the Republic's mercy. Old comrades said goodbye to one another as half of the men gave up their swords, while the other half agreed to be deployed away from Mongolia. Many Mongolian soldiers vanished without a word into the border with Mongolia, seeking to continue their own fights. They would miss their Russian brothers in arms."

TOM.47.desc: "Andrey Sakharov sat in his small study, dimly lit by the old lightbulb that had kept him company for so long. Thoughts came into his mind one minute and went out the next, a never-ending cycle. He looked back down towards his papers, calculations on some, ideas on the others. But today, it wasn't the physics problems he cared about. He wanted to work on Russia's problems. The failures of their democracy and the failures of their military. All of Russia's modern history seemed to be a failure.\n\nHe thought back to the past when the Central Siberian Republic fell into disarray. Sakharov had not been a major politician, but now as he went to meeting after meeting in the Modernist salons, it seemed his prominence had grown.\n\nAndrey continued to think, but he was ignoring his physics papers now. They didn't matter as much. Tomsk, Siberia, Russia, everything had been destroyed by dictators, past and present. They needed to move into a new future, one of democracy and modernity.\n\nNow Andrey dreamed. He dreamt of a Modernist future and a Modernist Russia. One that cared about the people and improved their everyday lives, one where he was the President. What Russia could be like with a strong democracy and a powerful government, what Tomsk could be like if it could stand up to the despots and radicals of the south, and what Siberia could be like with a functioning economy and a higher quality of life.\n\nAs his pen continued to write word after word on the papers, his old lightbulb dimmed more and more, barely lighting his desk at all. Andrey smiled, and he left his office to finally replace it."

TOM.48.desc: "The young man knocked on the door. A faint reply to enter, quickly. The secretary found his boss, Dmitry Likhachyov, standing at the window with a cup of coffee. On his desk, a pile of paper was neatly stacked next to a typewriter. The Decembrist Society's new manifesto, most likely. The young man stood at the door, and awaited his boss' orders.\n\nLikhachyov looked to the horizon. No doubt observing the Tom as it snaked next to the capital. The famed historian and medievalist had asked for a window view on the river. The reason was known to all, mentioned by none. The older man missed Saint Petersburg, the city of his youth. No doubt he found the Tom a poor substitute for the Neva, meeting the Baltic Sea. As the Tom was to the Neva, so was Tomsk, the quaint Siberian city, to Saint Petersburg, crisscrossed with bridges and canals. A treasure of the Russian people, lost to the advancing tide of fascism. The young man thought to himself that it was a blessing he was too young to know the sorrow of the older generation, the sadness of the last St. Petersburger.\n\nLikhachyov finally turned to his secretary. "Thank you for leaving me to my thoughts a few moments more. The manifesto is completed. Have the others review it, and distribute it."\n\n"Yes sir." The young man picked up the papers. "So, you're throwing your name in the hat?"\n\nLikhachyov nodded. "I've faith in the Russian peoples." He paused, his eyes distant for a moment. "We've... We've lost much these past few years. But we can rebuild. Must rebuild. If only to spite those who seek only destruction. I think Kharms, and Sakharov, and the other candidates, they get this. But they are too hasty to throw away the old days. We must bring the past with us. Now go, we have much to do."\n\nThe secretary nodded. Dmitry Likhachyov smiled, nodded back. Headed to his desk, his cup of coffee forgotten on the window sill. No matters; the Tom would still be flowing when his work would be done for the day."

The lower house was crowded, members of the House of Peers sitting on temporary chairs next to their colleagues of the House of Representatives. The din and chatter in the room began to ebb away as the President walked to his podium.\n\n"Friends, colleagues. Thank you for joining me in this inauguration of the Decembrist Constitution, the first of the new Republic. The government of the Decembrist Society sees many problems plaguing the nation. Some were inherited from the Soviet days. Others have grown from mistakes made during the Central Siberian government, and then in the days of the Provisional Government."\n\n"Chief among them is the state of the prison system. The number of prisoners is exceedingly high. Many do not know what they are accused of, or have been giving hasty trials during the dark days of the Provisional Government. I..." The President searched for his words a little. "I was a victim of the barbaric prison system during the Soviet days." Another moment of silence. "The Republic cannot live if it decides to destroy the life of its citizens arbitrarily. I do not ask the nation to forgive criminals, but to spare the innocents from imprisonment, and to treat the guilty with compassion, and with an eye to rehabilitation. Prison reforms will be one of the core aspects of this government's mandate."\n\n"The other angle will be to help develop the countryside. Our rural citizens have been left forgotten by successive governments. Their way of life is under threat from urbanization and from the lure of industrial work. We need not cower from modernity. We equally do not need to forget our origins. Better rural infrastructure will help city folk develop their businesses, while giving new opportunities to their fellow citizens in the countryside."\n\n"This assembly will not always support this government's programs. I merely ask you all to do your work as best as you can and to follow your convictions with courage, and dignity. We all hold the keys to a better, brighter future for the Russian people.""
TOM.51.a: "Thank you, President Likhachyov."

TOM.52.t: "The New Road"
TOM.52.desc: "It had once been a difficult task to go from Tomsk to Lesosibirsk. The small city, known for its forestry industry, had been tied to other regions of the Central Siberian Republic by railroads. With most of the former Republic now occupied by separatist rebels, the city of Lesosibirsk had been cut off from its capital. A patchwork of freight raillines had hastily been redirected to carrying wood back to the capital, through large detours in the Siberian forests. For the average traveller, however, the fastest path was still a simple two lane road to and fro the industrial city. Unfortunately, the road itself had always been little more than a dirt track, rendered unusable in the autumn and spring by mud.\n\nPavel had always been the one sent by the Lesosibirsk branch of his company to look for business partners in the capital. The direct path was always the fastest, when it was available. Sitting in a freight train for two days in a row had long been Pavel's least favorite part of his job, when the rasputitsa made travel overland by truck too difficult. Now, though, the businessman had the opportunity to try the new road.\n\nThe ride was smooth, enjoyable. Pavel was surprised to find himself drifting off to sleep, the vehicle travelling without hitting any potholes on the fresh pavement. He could definitely get used to this."
TOM.52.a: "Such a simple thing, such great results."

TOM.53.t: "The Decembrists' Three Freedoms"
TOM.53.desc: ""Citizens, we have often been asked, what is it the Decembrists stand for?\n\nThe name of our great Salon alludes to our aims. The Decembrists were men who ardently desired the end of serfdom, and a modern Russia integrating the best idea of the West into Russian traditions. Not an end to the old Russia, but a rational continuation of it. The Russian people had seen their liberties eroded by tsarism, and the heart of their tradition, the village community, trampled by the diktats of uncaring noble landlords.\n\nLikewise, the modern Decembrists seek to ensure Russian freedom. This time, from a different danger, the danger of industrialization. This is not to say that industry is a threat to the Russian way of life. Like many other western ideas, modern industry offers a great many things to the nation. However, it also brings with it threats. Chief among them are a twin headed beast: destruction of nature and the environment, the traditional cocoon in which Russian culture has grown; destruction of liberties, by governments or corporate interest tempted to brutally optimize the pursuit of material goods.\n\nThe Decembrists stand for freedom, citizens. Freedom to enjoy the environment of your forefathers. Freedom to earn a living decently, without industrial serfdom. Foreign from foreign tyrants, who seek to destroy our Republic. As long as one of us still stand, we shall fight to defend these three freedoms for you!"\n\nIntroduction to the Decembrist Manifesto written by President Likhachyov."
TOM.53.a: "A new spin on an old idea?"

TOM.54.t: "The Yesenin-Volpin Plan"
TOM.54.desc: "A new conference has been announced by Decembrist Minister of the Economy Alexander Yesenin-Volpin, to smooth over tensions between the industrial magnates and the workers of the Republic. While a number of unions have announced their lack of interest in the conference, a good majority of the worker representing bodies are expected to attend. Likewise, the upper crust of Tomsk's business elite is expected to be present, seeking to earn goodwill from the Decembrist government. The conference is expected to see the state of worker conditions in Central Siberia discussed, and grievances from employees and employers both brought to the government's attention.\n\nAnalysts believe the conference is unlikely to provide deep reforms or significantly soothe worker tensions in the region. The Decembrist government is occupied by many issues, only one of which is the industrial sector. Nevertheless, the openness of the Likhachyov administration and its willingness to confront problems head on has earned it praise from the citizens. The Yesenin-Volpin Plan will likely increase stability in the Republic and further improve the popularity of the Decembrist government."
TOM.54.a: "All shall work together in the Decembrist Republic."

TOM.55.t: "Tea Time with the President"
TOM.55.desc: "President Likhachyov enjoyed receiving his ministers and advisors for tea once a week. An informal moment to discuss projects and policies in a more casual atmosphere, while enjoying what little tea made it to Tomsk.\n\nMost pressing for the week had been the issue of prison reforms. Likhachyov's personal push for aggressive and immediate reforms of the prison system had been surprisingly contentious in the Decembrist Salons. Few of the President's political allies had great interest in immediate judicial reforms; Likhachyov had found himself constantly monitoring their progress and making sure everything was moving along.\n\n"With respect, Dmitry, it's difficult to redevelop our industry in urban and rural areas while also speeding along prisoner release," said Andrey Sinyavsky. "Our partners in regional administrations and among the mayors worry about a flood of former convicts disrupting the fragile economic recovery."\n\n"Irrelevant, Andrey. Call in favors, give out a few political appointments. Get this done. We've got a manpower shortage, and thousands of good citizens are rotting in jails since the CSR days. Some since the Soviet era," the President replied. His prime minister swirled his cup of tea pensively.\n\n"We can integrate a lot of freedmen into our infrastructure initiatives. Give them apartments in the countryside, near highways and train stations. It will reintegrate them into the nation, and giving them work will save them from destitution."\n\n"Excellent plan. Any of them that has family outside, try to place them in their family's district. That, or offer their family relocation. And keep pressuring the justice departments to process through their backlog. We'll retroactively cancel every wrongly accused citizen's conviction." The President raised his hand to prevent another objection. "We do it not because it is easy or expedient, but because it is right. Now, would you enjoy another cup of tea?""
TOM.55.a: "The prime minister nodded."

TOM.56.t: "Tea Time with the Composer Candidate"
TOM.56.desc: "Boris was quite surprised to find his neighborhood's tea house monitored by policemen. Perhaps they had come for tea, not that the teahouse often held any tea these days, but Boris found the prospect unlikely. They checked him for weapons and then warmly ushered him inside.\n\nThere the sixty years old widower saw the usuals of the teahouse, many of whom sitting around a familiar figure. The famed composer Shostakovich, holding a tea cup in his one good hand, was chatting with the people in a lively fashion. Boris headed to a table and hopefully asked for tea. The owner nodded. Perhaps the electoral candidate had brought some tea with him.\n\nBoris read the newspaper for some time. Eventually some new regulars came in and some went out. Shostakovich limped over to his table, accompanied by Sasha, one of Boris's old friends. The composer asked if he could share a cup of tea with Boris, and Boris nodded.\n\nThe presidential candidate chatted a variety of topics with Sasha and Boris. The conversation flowed awkwardly at time, and naturally at others. A reserved intellectual as he was, the man's warmth and charisma helped lubricate any social friction. Eventually the topic of music came, and Shostakovich asked if Boris possessed any records.\n\n"Only the one, a symphony by Stravinski." Boris replied. The President's eyes lit up. "Can't say I'm a big fan. Ain't no fan of fancy orchestras. The record was my daughter's." The President nodded. Didn't say anything. Boris couldn't help but sigh. The other man was too insightful to inquire about his daughter's fate. "She disappeared east, during the war with Yagoda." Boris concluded. His friend Sasha winced at the topic.\n\nThe composer smiled tightly. "I know she still lives, my friend. When the Republic marches east, you will be freed of Stravinsky's harmonics when we return her the record. Unless by then you've acquired a taste for it?"\n\nBoris smiled sadly. So did Sasha. The candidate was a likeable bastard, even for an egg head intellectual artist."
TOM.56.a: "All in all, a pleasant conversation."

TOM.57.t: "A Most Unusual Political Event"
TOM.57.desc: "A strange idea to hold a political rally out in the woods. There was a gentle summer breeze as men and women were heading out in the open, to an open air festival organized by the Decembrist Society on the shore of the Tom River from a nearby train station.\n\nLocal peasants, organized by their branch of the Decembrist Salon and monks from a nearby monastery, had already organized a large temporary cabin in which tables, benches and fires could be used. A day of drinking, poetry, praying and political speeches.\n\nPresidential hopeful Dmitry Likhachyov welcomed those that arrived. "Thank you for taking the time to come here!" He told the assembled crowd of city folk, engineers, scientists and ordinary workers. "It is certainly a commitment to travel out here on a bright summer day. But sometimes, leaving one's habitual home lets us leave one's habitual thought patterns, yes?"\n\nThe day's events were remarkably convivial. Peasants intermingled with industrial workers and university academics. Songs and traditional poems and plays were enjoyed by all. Each discussed their problems. Few easy solutions came from the conversations, especially once the participant had had their share of alcohol and good food. But the ties that bind, the invisible strings that link one Russian to another were considerably reinforced. As the city folks trudged back to the train station, often supported by their new peasant friends, the prospects of mending the old Central Siberian Republic didn't seem so poor after all."
TOM.57.a: "All of us Russians, with one beating heart."

TOM.58.t: "Two Propaganda Posters"
TOM.58.desc: "The train and tramways of Tomsk had always been fertile ground for political art and propaganda posters. Of late, the elections had driven the poster posting into overdrive. Two parties principally targeted the urban industrial workers: Sakharov's Modernists and Kharms' Bastillards.\n\nThe former's art often held beautiful, futuristic designs. Modern gleaming cities under the moonlight, built by workers of the Republic. Another popular design combined two posters posted together. The first depicted a strong father kissing his family goodbye before going to his factory shift, leaving his son to his studies The second poster depicted a Russian cosmonaut flying to the moon, a photo of his father in the space ship's cabin. The Modernists would reform the Republic and bring it to a new age of human progress and ingenuity.\n\nThe Bastillard campaign, in contrast, had a stark, surreal aesthetic. Simple slogans such as "Harder work, greater prosperity, stronger Republic" framed angular figures emerging from giant ironworks. The most often used designs were of a particular martial note. One of the posters showed men of the Republic battling a chimera with industrial tools such as hammers. The great beast's twin lion heads represented the traitor generals Pokryshkin and Andreev; the snake tails stood for the anarchists in the east; the eagle body, for the mad kingdom of General Krylov in Kemerovo. A vote for the Bastillard would be a vote for the destruction of the separatists."
TOM.58.a: "Industry will defeat the secessionists!"
TOM.58.b: "Technology will build the future!"

TOM.59.t: "The Three Pillars"
TOM.59.desc: "The eyes of everyone in the Duma were directly on Sakharov. These were the opening moments of Tomsk's most crucial period. "Democracy. Education. Bureaucracy. You have heard me recite these three words over and over again over the past several months, and you will hear me repeat them again and again until they reign clear and true across all of Tomsk. With these three pillars, our government will work endlessly to make Central Siberia the most efficient and well-run place from Moscow to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.\n\n"By protecting our democratic institutions and by listening to the will of the people, we will ensure that your vote counts. By educating the populace and making our people industrious, intelligent, and capable of critical thinking, we will make our future secure. By reforming and expanding our civil service and training them to run Tomsk as smoothly as possible, we will be able to take care of you and everyone else.\n\n"A government is at its best when it employs a meritocratic system to select only the most capable and competent people for civil service. We will allow the average and working people to focus on their own lives while we manage Tomsk and maintain its productivity so that the quality of life of the masses is sustained and then improved."\n\n"The next few years will be the defining moments of our republican experiment. Central Siberia must be reunited and the working people must be placated. There is no guarantee of success. However, our odds can only be hurt if Tomsk falls victim to the spectres of populism, political extremism, or restraint. Only a Modern government with modern principles can efficiently and sufficiently guide us through these trying times. And so I finish off using the words with which I began: Democracy. Education. Bureaucracy.""
TOM.59.a: "Let us begin!"

TOM.60.t: "The Civil Service Exam"
TOM.60.desc: "Vasily walked into the crowded yet eerily quiet exam hall and sat down at a desk near the corner of the room. This was probably one of the more important days of his life, he worried, nervous about the test he was going to take. These new tests had been introduced after the Modernists were elected into power, supposed to hire even better bureaucrats. He heard it was much harder than anything before it, but he was smart enough to pass. He got through the entrance exam. He could do this. Besides, he couldn't go back home to his village. He had to get this government job so he wouldn't have to become some boring farmer like his Dad or Brother before him.\n\nSuddenly and old woman in the front of the room who must be the test proctor spoke up. "I will be handing out your tests now, please read the instructions on the first few pages and sign where needed. Your test will begin in five minutes after the last person receives their test."\n\nVasily was one of the last to receive his, but he didn't mind, there was enough time. He signed where needed and turned the page, reading the instructions.\n\nThis test will determine your skills as a bureaucrat. It has five thirty-minute sections with sixty questions each. There will also be a short break between every two sections or after every hour. The five sections are: The History of Russia and the Republic, Organization/Leadership, Science, Philosophy, as well as General Knowledge such as math and language questions. You may begin when your proctor starts the timer.\n\nThere is a lot to know as a bureaucrat, Vasily noticed. But he had been studying every day since he learned of the job, and he wasn't going to let another test get in the way. Hopefully, he would even get the ministry he wanted, the Ministry of Industry.\n\nThe proctor spoke up again, three words that would begin the sounds of pages being turned and pencils on parchment. "You may begin.""
TOM.60.a: "When was the Central Siberian Republic first founded?"

TOM.61.t: "A Better Chance?"
TOM.61.desc: "Roman sat in his small dorm and read his textbook which seemed to be larger than the room itself. He had a big university exam tomorrow, and it could determine his grade for the entire semester. He was lucky he could even get into a university with how poor his family was. His father had nearly sent him to the lumber mills back home.\n\nRoman had the Modernists to thank for his education. The government had actually funded the university he was currently enrolled in, as it was the only one in the region. It was even expanding with the new students enrolled, most construction also being funded by the government. The university didn't even have a library before he came.\n\nHowever, university was never free, and he was only enrolled because the government had paid the scholarship for him and many others. His grades though hadn't guaranteed a free scholarship, so Roman spent most of his time volunteering at the university, acting as a courier, doing janitorial jobs, and even some administrative ones. This gave him barely any time to study, making nighttime the only option.\n\nBut Roman had kept going throughout all his struggles. He couldn't give up now, after all the luck that had already gotten him here. One day, all his hard work will pay off."
TOM.61.a: "It will all be worth it once I graduate."

TOM.62.t: "Every Voice Heard"
TOM.62.desc: "A quick, energetic knock came at Kiril's front door. He wasn't expecting anyone, and he was exhausted after a long but typical day of work at the construction site. Grumpily, he rose, stretched, and answered the door. What was this young child doing here? He couldn't have been older than sixteen.\n\n"Good evening, sir! My name is Max and I'm a volunteer for the mayor's office. Have you heard about the upcoming referendum on whether we should increase the size of the Tomsk City Council?"\n\n"Um..." the boy had spoken so quickly that Kiril was still trying to process what he had said. "Yes, I think so. But look, I'm not interested. Have a nice day."\n\n"Please just listen to me for a moment, sir! Increasing the size of the city council will allow more neighbourhoods in the city to have local representation, and having more people on the council means more people's voices can be heard, such as yourself. It's very important that you vote!"\n\n"I can see, Max, that you're a very smart and idealistic kid. But you're probably too young to remember when the Central Siberian Republic collapsed and years of progress were lost for nothing. I used to be interested in politics like you until I saw that the people in charge are barely able to hold things together and can't do anything for people like us. I'm so busy just trying to keep food on the table that I barely had the time to go vote on the Constitution. You think I have time for some local referendum?"\n\n"This is very important both to me and the people of Tomsk. Please just take this brochure explaining the pros and cons of each side of the referendum and have a look. It's for the greater good. Have a lovely evening, sir." The boy briskly walked away to go and canvass Kiril's neighbour.\n\nKiril placed the brochure down on the table and stared at it. That young boy was so passionate and seemed to really care about the future of his nation. Kiril hated to admit it, but maybe he had been wrong to become so cynical and ignore politics. He picked up the brochure and started reading."

TOM.63.desc: "Leonid's patrol group stopped in a snow-covered field and began to set up camp. With their new gear and supplies, they could construct a camp much easier and faster, and it was even more comfortable than ever. Now they actually had tents and sleeping bags! What a luxury!\n\nBut it wasn't just new supplies that his patrol group had received. New and more modern weapons had finally been given to him and his squadron. He didn't need his father's old gun anymore. Weapons weren't the only thing sent out to the new military though. New radios, new recon kits, and best of all, they were being promised with new vehicles. Cars and trucks would finally replace endless hours of drudging through the snowy and desolate wilderness. They were actually being treated like a real military!\n\nWith all these new weapons and equipment, perhaps it was time they saw some real action. Leonid was ready to march all the way to Moscow, liberating Russia from the warlords and the Germans. The Republican Army was finally ready for battle."
TOM.63.a: "They'll see action soon enough."

TOM.64.t: "Status of the Workers"
TOM.64.desc: "The President's office was silent except for the ticking clock behind President Sakharov. A long report lay on his desk, details of mounting worker unrest and threats of strikes spreading through the factories. If there were a time where the workers couldn't be unhappy, it was now. Something needed to be done before everything spiraled out of control. The workers had to be satisfied.\n\nSakharov and the Modernist government would take immediate action to stem the crisis. It was time to bring forward the issue of Tomsk's industry. Now that they had dealt with the major tenets of bureaucracy, education, and democracy, it was time to focus on even larger issues. There will be multiple courses of action that they could take, Sakharov just hoped he chose the right one."
TOM.64.a: "The workers deserve something better."

TOM.65.t: "To the Future"
TOM.65.desc: "Sakharov read the stacks of papers neatly laid upon his desk, organized to his liking. Each paper detailing the changes his reforms had brought to Tomsk and what could be done to further modernize the Republic.\n\nTomsk had come a long way since the Modernists were elected, but there was still so much left. The basics had been dealt with, bureaucracy, education, democracy, workers' rights, and industry had all been transformed into the Modernist ideal. The five main tenets of the Modernists were complete and had gone better than even Sakharov had expected of them. But they had only begun the Modernist dream, and if only Tomsk had more resources to act on them.\n\nThe future was still very uncertain. Had Sakharov done enough? Will the Modernist reforms continue to work? Were they ready for what the southern warlords had in store?\n\nMaybe it was time Sakharov took the future into his own hands. The threats against democracy and the republic had to be eliminated before Tomsk could truly thrive."
TOM.65.a: "Perhaps it's time to expand the Republics borders, to reclaim what once was."

TOM.66.t: "Tomb of the Giant"
TOM.66.desc: "His guards always left him alone for the final part of the trip. Thirty or so meters to the tomb. Likhachyov carried with him four flowers. One for each of Tomsk's salons. An even number, as was tradition. Every month, he laid a new wreath of flower on Boris Pasternak's final resting place. Took a moment to reflect on the trouble life of the author President. Words from Pasternak's book often came to mind on these monthly visits.\n\n"I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled. Their virtue is lifeless and of little value. Life hasn't revealed its beauty to them."\n\nHad Pasternak sought to justify his own failings, his own past errors? True to his word, the President had fought until the end. Carrying his cross to the bitter end. Perhaps it was why the citizens of Tomsk had forgiven him so much.\n\nFootsteps behind him. Likhachyov had told his guards not to stop anyone from visiting the grave. The Decembrist President turned and saw her, Olga Ivinskaya. Pasternak's lover and accomplice. A mostly apolitical figure, these days, content to see Pasternak's new Republic run itself. She left her own flowers on the grave, and took a moment to pray.\n\nThey chatted a little. Some politics, but mostly about the wider world. Events in Russia and beyond. The conversation drifted to a natural end. The woman looked at Likhachyov, and the President returned her stare. "Will you march west, when the time comes?" She asked.\n\nLikhachyov nodded. "I will be buried in Saint Petersburg. No matter what."\n\nBoth parted ways, walking out of the cemetery and back to the temporal world. Much remained to be done."
TOM.66.a: "Pasternak will be the last President buried here."

TOM.67.t: "The Theoretician and the Engineer"
TOM.67.desc: ""Oh, thank you for the papers," Sakharov said, taking the bundle of Tomsk's morning papers from Kamov's hands, "how much for these?" They sat in the parlor of the Modernist section of the building. Shelves upon shelves of scientific books and journals books lined the alcoves of the room. Outside, they could hear the sleepy city of Tomsk rousing herself awake, as cars thrummed and blared, and paperboys announced the most recent items in the papers aloud.\n\n"Eh," Kamov said, taken aback by Sakharov's manners, "you don't have to. It's pennies on the dollar anyway, professor."\n\n"Come on," Sakharov parried, wearing a kind and serene smile, "I'd feel bad if I have to have my papers at your expense."\n\n"No, Professor," Kamov laughed. "It's not even rubles. Drop it." Kamov laid a hand on Sakharov's shoulders. "Think of it as a favor for the coffee the other day."\n\nSakharov smirked. "Thanks." He glanced at the front page of the newspaper and the headline. PRESIDENT PASTERNAK TERMINALLY ILL - NEW TIMES FOR THE REPUBLIC? "You know, newspapers have this uncanny ability to deliver even grave news with bombast. Maybe it's the capital letters. Would newspapers even exist ten years from now?"\n\n"If the Republic elects you, I think not."\n\n"You flatter me, Kamov. I'd serve a term or two and then get out. Got to keep the system running."\n\n"Have you thought of a successor?"\n\n"I think you'll do." The remark shocked Kamov. "I am but a theoretician. You are an engineer. I lay the foundations, you make it work."\n\n"But I-"\n\n"I am going to get some coffee. Want some?""

TOM.68.desc: "Our plans for a strong industry are proceeding well, but we are running into problems daily, problems that involve every citizen and every member of the high class.\n\nSeveral businesses are expanding their factories deep into the forests of Tomsk. These industries are causing plenty of environmental damage and must be stopped before the wildlife of our country is eradicated. This kind of expansion is contradictory to the very message we have pushed to our people, and it is our job to prevent the citizens from falling into the never-ending cycle of labor and nature reduction.\n\nA few of our businesses are also abusing our worker population by increasing work hours, reducing pay, and reducing factory quality. In a way, these businesses are enforcing their will on the workers, causing them to feel more resentful and radical towards the factory. We cannot have class division in our democratic system; we must work to give the workers what they want and institute a law that prevents worker exploitation.\n\nMuch of the infrastructure in our country is still damaged from the warlords and Soviets before us. We need to start a nationwide plan to build up our infrastructure once more to ensure our citizens live healthy, easy lives."

TOM.69.t: "Integrating the Siberian Plan"
TOM.69.desc: "The time has come for us to begin the integration of one of our largest plans to develop Siberia and its people. First and foremost, it is imperative that we preserve the free-thinking ideology that citizens of Tomsk share; an idealistic democracy does not work when there is disunity. We must have a way to communicate with the more extremist Russians so that they will be properly absorbed into our democratic system.\n\nWe must also develop a program for our workers to receive a share of the nation's wealth. These moderate payments will help to reduce the spread of hateful, radical ideologies by improving the workers' situation without making their normal pay meaningless. Along with this, there will be a conscription to develop soldiers for our grand liberation army, and they will bring our democracy to a united Russia.\n\nThe plan has many different parts, but it will be used to bring the whole of Siberia together in a loving, cooperative community. Through our efforts we will unite the salons and work for a Tomsk that stands strong in the face of authoritarianism. Through this plan we will ensure that our idealistic democracy survives for many years to come, and the Republic will be preserved for generations."
TOM.69.a: "Long live the true Russian democracy."

TOM.71.desc: "Our current lands are surrounded by many evil warlords, enemies of our state that seek to transform our people into slaves of an unnatural ideology. Of course, we are referring to our fascist and communist neighbors. Unfortunately, much of Russia has fallen to the fascist scourge and the communist plague, and Europe is dominated by the abhorrent National Socialists. Our fellow democratic friends are simply too far away, and it is imperative that we establish relations with a respectable defender of democracy.\n\nWe now look to the United States for a potential friendship, as they are the only bearer of democracy that will listen to our plight. We must establish diplomatic ties with America for the sake of our own Republic, and our people must have a shining example of democracy to idolize."
TOM.71.a: "Surely the Americans will listen to our story..."

TOM.72.desc: "Though Russia remains suspended in anarchy, it is through teamwork that we will escape this dreadful era. Warlords from all different backgrounds await our message; some may wish for our painful demise, others may seek to form a friendship, others may only want to maintain a state of peace. Perhaps we can establish diplomatic relations with the other Russian powers, see how they are holding up. When our potential most valuable allies lay on the other side of Europe, our only option is to extend our influence into Russia itself."
TOM.72.a: "Agree to establish diplomatic relations."
TOM.72.b: "They will have to find other partners."

TOM.73.t: "Discord in the Salons"
TOM.73.desc: "With Central Siberia once again under our control, many problems are starting to appear, mostly in our administration. While we are overextended, the main issue is with the Salons. Any form of cohesion we once had has been shattered, and unity within the government is at an all-time low as each salon has its own idea on how to govern the new territory. Bickering and arguments fill the Duma and the coffeeshops as those loyal to their Salon disagree with whatever any other salon has to say.\n\nIf we do not wish our form of democracy to collapse, we must attempt to keep the salons in the support of the government and end their endless quarrel. In the future some of our actions may create cynicism, which could end the system of salons if it reaches too high. We want to reduce this cynicism as much as possible if we do not want the Salons to collapse. However, that could mean not getting to work on our own projects, so we should balance cynicism with our own ideas.\n\nSuccessfully maintaining cohesion within the Salons will keep our democracy alive, and our future actions will very well determine the strength of our Republic."
TOM.73.a: "The balance must be kept."

TOM.74.t: "Subversive Parties"
TOM.74.desc: "Several commoners are beginning to show signs of radicalist thought belonging to undesired ideologies. Political groups centered around radicalism are popping up within our borders, and if we don't fix this issue soon, it will brutally tear our democracy apart. We must find the individuals who snuck into our lands and contaminated our flowing well of intellectual thought with the poison of tyranny.\n\nWe will be keeping a watchful eye on the commoners and even the political elites for any important developments. In the meantime, our agents will find and crack down on any radical political party that may attempt to corrupt the peasant minds."

TOM.79.t: "Our Diplomatic Situation"
TOM.79.desc: "It's time we approach foreign nations that we may have an interest in, especially the major powers in the Pacific. Our most major concern is how some nations may be interested in us, primarily America and Japan. We have to secure our neutrality in the Cold War, aligning ourselves too closely with an alliance may endanger us in the future.\n\nThis means playing nice with both the United States and Japan, and while it may anger some of the Salons for not growing closer to America, it is much more important if we do not want the ire of Japan's aggression. At this point, we cannot risk any sort of embargo or invasion. An embargo would absolutely destroy our economy, and end any chances of us overcoming our western counterpart. And while an invasion might not be likely, we must always be prepared for unexpected outcomes.\n\nFor this reason, in the future, we must be friendly with both Japan and America. Perhaps keeping cordial relations with Japan will even be able to reward us. Hopefully, both nations will not be angered if we try to keep relations open with both of them."
TOM.79.a: "We are playing a dangerous game."

TOM.80.desc: "With the gauntlet of extremism gripping tightly our nation, we must decide how it should be handled. The ideologies of fascism, communism, and all their cousins threaten to strike at the heart of our very democracy and eliminate the experiment we started. Nevertheless, our mission is to allow people from all backgrounds to have a say in our government.\n\nWill we decide to ban the radical political parties to ensure our democratic system? The idea of placing asterisks around freedom of speech contradicts our original message, but it will protect our government from falling under the oppressive boot.\n\nAlternatively, we could continue permitting the radical rhetoric at the cost of the possibility that one independent party may gain too much support. In the end, however, we would maintain our belief that everyone in our country should have a say in the government."
TOM.80.a: "These independent parties are too dangerous."
TOM.80.b: "We stand for freedom of speech and the right to vote."

TOM.81.t: "Report on Germany"
TOM.81.desc: "Germany has been seen as Russia's main enemy, and we will continue down that path. The German Reich goes against all of democracy's values and has subjugated much of Europe. We must make sure the world knows our position on the Reich, and that is one of enmity.\n\nGermany is also in control of lands we lay claim to, primarily in Moscow. We must continue to press these claims making sure the world knows we have not given up on reuniting all Russians in the republic.\n\nLastly, maintaining a more hostile position with Germany may even increase our relations with both America and Japan. Both rival Germany, and will be happy to know we do not intend on making good relations with the Germans. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend as they say."
TOM.81.a: "While focusing on our friends, we must still focus on our enemies."

TOM.82.t: "Report on Japan"
TOM.82.desc: "The Japanese Empire is the strongest power in the Pacific, meaning it holds great influence over us and may continue to do so as we expand. Even dominating the great tiger of China, Japan has shown its might to the world. Japan currently dominates Asia, so we can not appear as a threat to Japanese influence in the region.\n\nJapan is also the main rival of America, which controls a lot of territory America wants to be returned. We should not involve ourselves in this rivalry, as we cannot risk one of the power's hostility towards us.\n\nAnd despite America being our main ideological partner, as we do share a similar political system, Japan is much closer to us and currently holds greater influence over our country. Japan's power in Asia is not to be trifled with, so we must maintain relations with them, no matter what happened in the past and what territory of ours they may control."
TOM.82.a: "It's good we have a plan."

TOM.83.t: "Approaching the Humanists"
TOM.83.desc: "Even though darkness reigns within the world, there still remains some nations that have retained their care for humanity. The nations of the OFN, Sweden, the Republic of India - all of these nations are examples of democracies that have survived the last decades. Getting their support will be crucial for the survival and recognition of our regime as legitimate. To this end, diplomatic envoys have been sent to these nations. While we do not expect recognition as the legitimate government immediately, we can slowly sway them to our side - a trade deal here, intelligence there. With this strategy, it is hoped that we can achieve something of a mutual understanding between the humanist nations of the world."
TOM.83.a: "Humanists of the world, unite!"

TOM.84.t: "Through Cathay"
TOM.84.desc: "The Japanese Sphere is home to numerous nations - China, Thailand, and Vietnam, to name a few. Approaching these nations would do well to improve our international standing. While reports have reached Tomsk about the conditions enforced by Japan in their member states, beggars simply cannot be choosers. When the greenlight is given, diplomatic delegations to Burma, Vietnam, Thailand, China, and Indonesia will all be sent. From there, cultural exchanges and trade deals will be negotiated in order to improve relations. Already, many in the Foreign Service have volunteered to be a part of the missions, curious to venture out of Russia and into unknown, exotic lands."
TOM.84.a: "Go east, young man!"

TOM.85.t: "Our Situation"
TOM.85.desc: "It is of the best interests of the Central Siberian Republic to conduct sound diplomacy, as it may be our only chance at gaining the upper hand over our neighbors. Some nations may be interested in hearing of our Modernist ways, and we should approach other democracies in an attempt to receive aid. We should also focus on diplomacy with the superpowers as they are the ones most transforming the world.\n\nPrimarly, the United States could be our best benefactor, as they are the defender of democracy on the world stage. They may be very inclined to help us as we are one of the limited democracies in Russia.\n\nNext is Germany, and we should most likely show the world our hostilities against them. We will return to Moscow one day!\n\nLastly is Japan and is a more touchy subject. While very imperialistic, Japan is the nearest superpower to us, and it could very well be dangerous to us if we are hostile towards them. Some in the Salons are saying we should remain neutral towards Japan, yet still, Sakharov and the Modernists in charge believe allying with America is the way forward. If that angers Japan, so be it."
TOM.85.a: "It's good we have a plan."

TOM.86.t: "Foreign Policy Council"
TOM.86.desc: "To analyze the capabilities of our neighbors, primarily those in Russia, we have assembled a new group, the Foreign Policy Council. Those who are possibly friendly and those who could be threats must be identified now for use later. We have to know if one regional government is more likely to attack us than another.\n\nThe Foreign Policy Council will also focus on analyzing the military, scientific, and economic capabilities of our neighbors as well. Intelligence will come in handy so we can ensure that we will be stronger than our neighbors while not funding useless endeavors.\n\nOnly the experts can decide what is best for our foreign policy, and that is why we placed only those who are elite in their field on the council. With hope, this council will grant us huge amounts of intelligence and prepare us for the reunification of Russia."
TOM.86.a: "Always trust the experts!"

TOM.87.t: "Sakharov's Fear"
TOM.87.desc: "Andrey Sakharov sat in a new desk, one much nicer and more lavish than his older one. On his desk were the piles of paper as usual, except instead of the usual official party papers, it was filled with theories once again. Equations littered the pages as Sakharov's mind wandered back to his main objective. He was developing a nuclear bomb.\n\nAlways an expert on nuclear physics, Sakharov was of great use to help in developing the Republic's new weapon. Being busy with government didn't mean he couldn't work on his own passions as well. Yet, he always idealized his work of being that for peace, not the total destruction of another country and possibly the world. Still, here he was, solving the math that could wipe out an entire civilisation.\n\nHe knew it would only be used to defend against German aggression when war would inevitably occur, yet he still felt like it was wrong. Even trying to tell himself that if they had no nuclear weapons, Germany would surely end Russia once and for all did no help. Was mutually assured destruction really the answer? For once, Sakharov wished humanity hadn't discovered the atom at all."
TOM.87.a: "It's for the greater good."

TOM.88.t: "The Winds of Change"
TOM.88.desc: "Vasily had been attempting to understand for the past few minutes. Ivan was politically informed, especially for a fisherman in Siberia, but everytime he went into a nuance of the Tomsk political system, he only felt more hopelessly lost. "Wait, Ivan, explain that again," he cut in, resting his fishing rod against the side of the boat. "You said there are four men in Tomsk, and they meet in a salon and argue. But what if they don't agree about something? Do they just keep arguing with one another? And what if two of them agree on something and the other two disagree?"\n\nIvan was taken aback, but tried not to let it show on his face. He nuzzled further into the folds of his coat. "Well, they also disagree about how to break the tie," he started, with some authority. "One of them, Vainberg, thinks that only artists should decide on the fate of the country. So he sticks to his opinion, even when he's outnumbered. Sakharov is the same, but he thinks that only scientists should decide." Vasily was peering at him with naked suspicion. Ivan sped up a bit. "And the others are similar. Likhachyov - that's the Decembrist one - he thinks we should all be farmers, so that's what he says in the salon. And whenever the others disagree, he gets into a real temper, and calls them enemies of the farmer. And Kharms..." The fisherman faltered. For a second they blinked at one another, hearing only the water lapping at the boat and the wind. Ivan shrugged. "I don't properly know what Kharms wants, Vasily. But I know he's in the salon as well, and that he argues with the best of them."\n\nIvan was not a cynical man. But when he tried to explain things to Vasily, he discovered he was less informed than he thought."
TOM.88.a: "How can four men in a salon decide the fate of Russia?"

TOM.89.t: "Alienation"
TOM.89.desc: "Once, Erkemen Palkin had been a high level official in the government of Oyrotia, doing what he could to serve his people, the Altay, as well as the newly arrived Old Believers. Those days might be past, but he was no less committed to serving his people's interests. With the restriction of political involvement to the salons and their members, however, he had to join one to do so. As such, he had begun attending the meetings of the Humanist Salon, seeing them as the most closely aligned with his ideals. However, it hadn't exactly gone as planned.\n\n"Why do you say we must focus on improving the cities first?" Erkemen found himself asking this as a response to a fellow Humanist. They were both at the latest meeting, full of leaders and aspiring leaders alike. "What about the people of rural areas? Some cannot afford to wait, and might die if they must. Protecting the welfare of the common man must include all of them."\n\n"And it will, I assure you." The other man replied, with a patronizing smile that Erkemen immediately hated. "The cities must be our priority for improvement, because as the lives of the people in them are bettered, so too will the lives of rural people be.. I understand your concerns, but for the sake of the villages the cities must come first. Now, if you'll excuse me..."\n\nThe other man walked past him, as though he was of no importance. That was his other problem with the Humanists, Erkemen thought. While their focus on the welfare of the common man was well and good, they put too much of an emphasis on the ideas of leadership at the same time, and too little on the thoughts of the people.\n\nAs he came to this conclusion, he began to wonder if all the salons had this same nature."
TOM.89.a: "Even the selfless lose faith at times."

TOM.90.t: "Endearment"
TOM.90.desc: "Staring into his drink forlornly, Erkemen Palkin hardly noticed when a man walked into the bar and all heads turned towards him. He hardly cared either. "The usual, please." The man said as he sat down next to Erkemen. As the bartender went to get the liquor- from the top shelf, Erkemen noticed- the man beside him turned to look at him with a frown. "Are you alright there?" He asked.\n\nErkemen let out a sigh and gave a thin, insincere smile. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. What's your name, by the way?"\n\n"I'm surprised you don't recognize me. I'm Dmitry Likhachyov. And you?"\n\nThat certainly caught Erkemen's attention. What a cosmic coincidence, that he should meet somebody that important here. Glancing to the door, he saw a couple of bodyguards paying close attention. "My name is Erkemen Palkin. Currently, I'm with the Humanists, but... it hasn't been working out." Likhachyov's surprise on hearing that seemed genuine, and he seemed to want him to continue. Though he hesitated a moment, Erkemen ultimately gave in. "Bunch of damn elitists who think city people are so much more important than everyone else. I agree with them on their goal, but their approach is insufferable!"\n\nThat made Likhachyov smile. It was the most sincere one Erkemen had seen in weeks. "His drinks are on me," He told the bartender. "He needs them." Then, Likhachyov again turned to Erkemen, seeming to study him for a moment. "I can't say that we'll agree on everything, but... among the Decembrists, it is always the people, city or rural, Russian or not, who come first. So if that's the sort of attitude you're looking for, then you're always welcome to attend our meetings."\n\n"That so?" Erkemen replied, feeling a strange sort of relief and acceptance. "You know what, I think I will. Thank you, Dmitry.""
TOM.90.a: "Hope once lost is restored to the heart."

TOM.100.t: "Pages from the Humanist Manifesto" #Tomsk humanist warlord event On Humanist Theory
TOM.100.desc: "On Democracy\n\nDemocracy - true democracy -is the ultimate goal and the ultimate end of the Humanist program. The Humanist seeks a society where every facet of life is entrenched ultimately in the democratic process. The workplace should not be a place of oppression, but a place of inspiration, creativity, and cooperation. To this end, the institution of councils and cooperatives are paramount to the spreading of the Humanist ideal; as society and work becomes more and more democratic, the taint of capital will become lesser and lesser upon our society.\n\nAs the people become more educated, participate further in governance, learn to love each other once more, then the lofty ideals of Socialism may come into practice. This is why the Humanist supports education for all of his fellow man, not simply those fortunate enough to be able to pay. This is why public works and good deeds are of paramount importance. Society will not change for the better if we enforce it upon the people, becoming little better than the tyrants of old.\n\nUtopia will only be achieved when every man, and woman, and child strive together to achieve it. This is why we do not ally ourselves with so called Marxist-Leninists. While Marx surely provides a valuable insight in the deconstruction of Capital and the bringing of Utopia, the cynical devotion of that ideology's adherents, their disbelief in their fellow man, leads to the ruin of democracy and the oppression of the proletariat they so love. It is a tragedy, and one that we must seek to prevent in our own Republic.\n\nThis too applies to the devotees of Anarchism - while the Humanist, his heart full of empathy and love for fellow man - may understand the longing of total freedom that drives men to Anarchy, he must remember that ultimately, such a state of being is only possible when all humanity wills it. Until then, the sad fact is that Anarchy is too easily oppressed by outside forces, too easily corrupted by opportunists and evildoers.\n\nThe Humanist, therefore, must remember that his faith in fellow man must never be eclipsed by his pragmatism - for if it is, he has already lost.\n\n- D. D. Shostakovich"

TOM.101.desc: "Across the Central Siberian Republic, radios crackled to life at once, bringing a special announcement from President Shostakovich - a wheezing cough echoed across the nation before he spoke. Shostakovich spoke quietly, a weary edge to his voice - but there was a determination in it that few had known before.\n\n"My friends," he began. "My friends, today the drums of war beat in our lands once more, and today our brave citizens march again to defend their Democracy."\n\nHe was silent for a moment. "It fills me - as I am sure it fills you - with sorrow and regret that we must march to battle, where brave men will surely lose their lives. Some have wondered, as I have, why we fight this war. To what end do we send our sons, our fathers, our brothers, our citizens to risk their lives?"\n\n"I will tell you what I have told myself. The separatists to the south, to the east, to every direction we may imagine, they do not seek to protect their citizens and workers. They exploit and desecrate their people, turning their very lives into naught but a commodity!" The President spoke now with an uncharacteristic fire in his voice.\n\n"The Anarchists and Leninists, overcome by their cynicism and hubris, have fallen into this same very trap - either they are unable to defend their workers, or they become yet another oppressor. This fate must not - can not - fall upon our Republic."\n\n"Thus I ask you, brave citizens, to fill your hearts with Determination and Resolve. Determination to defend your homes, and your Democracy, and your lives. And Resolve - resolve to work for the best interests of peace in peacetime, and to do your best to quell the fires of insurrection with all haste in wartime. When the blood is done flowing, I swear to you that we shall all come together as brothers once more, but the time for this is not now.

TOM.102.desc: "The militia trained early, and Andrey had set his alarm accordingly. In the frigid early morning darkness, he pulled on his telogreika jacket, pausing for a quick second before the door to brace himself before setting out at a jog towards the training grounds.\n\nHe thought he'd be early; he wasn't. At the grounds, almost twenty men - the grognards from the old army, no longer in active service but still employed to train the new citizen's militias - were running laps in the snow, their boots crunching in unison. Andrey's jog turned into a run as he rushed to fall in formation, joining the growing column snaking through the grounds.\n\nThe militia set up their targets with the sunrise, before assembling on the firing line under the watchful eye of the old soldiers. Andrey cocked his Mosin-Nagant and zeroed in on the sandbag dummies, before squeezing the trigger, once, twice, and then a third time.\n\nThe first shot went wide, the second landed off-target, and the third barely scratched the widest circle of the target. A grizzled soldier shook his head, and started to walk towards Andrey. Expecting a raised fist, Andrey's body tensed, and the fourth shot struck the target next to his own.\n\nThe blow never came. "Boy," the soldier growled, as he adjusted the sights on Andrey's rifle, "if you want to hit anything, you need to stop worrying about your comrades and more about the enemy.""

TOM.103.desc: "Likhachyov always kept his eyes on the other salon leaders during salons and negotiations, and while this was partially in order to maintain one step ahead of the others, he also couldn't help studying them on a personal level and admiring them for their positive qualities. One man, who was not yet a leader, but was effectively a leader in waiting, had recently begun to fall under Likhachyov's attention as well.\n\nMoisey Vainberg was a man with an interesting story. How does a Polish, Jewish composer who lost his family to the Nazis end up as the heir to one of the main contenders for control over an idealistic, experimental republic in the middle of Siberia? Surely, he had to be something of an idealist himself, steadfast in his convictions and forceful in his desire to improve the lives of others. He'd also been forced to flee all over the place due to the German invasion and Soviet collapse, relocating to Minsk and then Tashkent, and finding his way into both Central Siberia and politics as his plans to move to Moscow after the war could never come to fruition.\n\nWhile in Tashkent, Moisey befriended the current leader of the Humanists and fellow composer, Dmitry Shostakovich. The series of events that lead to Moisey becoming the heir to the Humanist Salon was certainly... turbulent. Although, the man did possess certain qualities that made him a rather natural leader.\n\nLikhachyov watched him as he negotiated. While sharing his friend Shosta's strong idealism, he also had a fair share of pragmatism and charisma that allowed him to appeal to both his political counterparts and average citizens alike. From Likhachyov's perspective, Moisey may have been somewhat ideologically misguided, but he could clearly see that the soon-to-be Humanist leader was a good man at heart."

The workers are returning to their factories and the citizens of the other Central Siberian factions are not yet in open revolt, but tensions are palpably high.\n\nAs of now, the rather overextended republic is... still functional. Gradual progress is being made with the Central Siberian Plan, though the industrialization project will of course have to be expanded to the entirety of the region. The government has at least a semblance of legitimacy and loose authority over its people, but will have to tread very carefully if it wants to earn the trust of its people and develop into a fully-fledged nation state, not to mention reunify the entirety of Russia.\n\nIn the cafes, homes, bars, and factories, the people question openly to each other whether Pasternak's great constitution and our Salons are truly as idealistic and for the people as they claim to be. There is a great risk of our citizens becoming cynics, whose apathy could single handedly be our republic's downfall; some may become so angry they run for office outside of our Salon system, threatening the balance and stability our government currently enjoys. For starters, developing the economy, maintaining political stability, and improving our army are imperative for our administration's success.\n\nOur idealism can only take us so far. This great republican experiment is in a survivable but challenging position, and we must do what it takes to keep it alive.

As was the norm, a few backroom meetings, cups of tea, and IOUs. were necessary to unite each Salon under his ideas for the military, but at the very least Shaposhnikov acknowledged that they all had reasonably good military plans regardless of their ideological differences.\n\nThe behind the scenes work was behind him now, but ahead came the actual task of serious military reform. Shaposhnikov was aware of the importance of his job, as the core Republican Army would serve as the foundation and bulwark of the Republic's defences.

Will the nation's army and politics be reformed or modified? Above all, will the new President make good on his bold words and fulfill his promises, or will he make too many compromises or even go back on those promises? President [GetTomskPresidentLastName] has the opportunity to shape Central Siberia in his image, and so all eyes and ears are aimed directly at him, waiting for him to succeed or fail.

Located near the main city railway station, the School of Foreign Affairs' completion marks a major milestone in the government's efforts to reach out to the world. At the School, students from all walks of life will study international relations, history, language, and political science, among other fields. The goal is to train a new generation of diplomats, who will represent our nation on the world stage. In addition, they will hopefully be able to spread our Humanist ideals to far-flung countries, creating new political and social bonds that will benefit all mankind. Already, agents of the school are traveling the republic, seeking out prospective students. Within only a few years' time, we hope to see junior foreign service officers staffing embassies and consulates around the world!"

The results of the statistical questions were not good. Outside of Tomsk, the people were overwhelmingly against the extension of rights for the sexual minorities. The black ink that dappled the towers of the "disapproval" columns were like soot upon his fiery heart. Perhaps, here, they have run aground.\n\nHe breathed a sigh. During the Soviet days, it would perhaps be effortless: enforcing rules from on high was no troubling matter for the apparatchiks of the communist party. On paper, anyway. In the constitution of the former Union were protections granted to minorities that went unfulfilled for many years. As a Pole and a Jew, he would know the malignance of ignorance and malice that stemmed from it. Without a popular mandate, there would be no point to his bill. He would have to shelf it for now.\n\nInstead, he picked up his fountain pen and began writing. His handwriting wasn't something that he would call beautiful, but it would have to do. An education bill would perhaps be in order. Flowing from his pen were rivers of ink, cursive, like the notation of musical pieces and compositions. He would have to shelf this one too - but perhaps one day, this would be just like a stepping stone after another. Moisey envied the Modernists: but the Humanists should try nonetheless."

The core of Shaposhnikov's army will become the elite noble cavalry of old, acting as the main sword of the army. We will then support this primary "sword" with our great Russian masses which managed to halt Napoleon back in the 19th century; great hordes of men drafted during wartime will form a huge army of light infantry and artillery divisions to hold the line!\n\nBy combining the patriotism and education of our elites with the grit, spirit, and numbers of the masses, we will create an unstoppable force that will crush every enemy in sight!"

Living standards have gone up and a small but steady social safety net exists for those who cannot find or are unable to work. The number of hungry mouths in our republic has decreased greatly. Many families are even able to afford new furnishings for their homes such as electrical appliances and televisions!\n\nThese new furnishings are produced by the workers, but overseen and invested in by our country's growing business class. Our free-market economy coupled with the expansive industrial base we have built over the past few years means there has never been a better time to run or own a business here. Factories, farms, shops, and mines flourish under management both new and old, making record profits despite our strong environmental regulations and adequate worker protections. It's okay to be a worker in Central Siberia, and great to be a businessman!"

TOM.119.desc: "Over the past three months, our team, based at Tomsk State University, has been monitoring populations of various freshwater fish in the Kondoma River, a left tributary of the Tom River. Data from previous assessments has been difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons, but according to Baranov (1938), Taliev (1951), and Bychowsky (1961), the Kondoma's populations of freshwater fauna in general has declined since the 1920s, in large part due to pollutants from mining and industrial operations in towns near the river, such as Tashtagol and Kaltan.\n\nDuring our assessments, however, we were able to confirm rebounds in a number of populations, including: Carassius carassius, Acipenser ruthenus, Gobio sibiricus, Leuciscus idus, Cobitis sibirica, Barbatula tomiana, Esox lucius, Coregonus maraenoides, Stenodus nelma, and Cottus altaicus.\n\nIt is likely that the introduction of new environmental regulations and ecological protection measures is in large part responsible for this rebound in populations. In addition, in keeping with observations by Shwarts (1963), our team took note of new and extensive flora growth near the banks of the Kondoma, which is also likely attributable to aforementioned policy changes. It is unknown if fishing by local populations will result in increased pressure on these newly growing fish populations. However, we recommend that fishery quotas be extended to local communities in this region, in order to avoid such an outcome."

Over the past decades, countless leaders and fighters have come and gone promising to bring peace or stability or glory or workers' rights to Russia and nearly all are now historical footnotes. But this time, it is different.\n\nThe peasants of Western Siberia have heard the Decembrists' call to bring freedom and democracy to Russia and the world, and for once they are listening. The Central Siberian Republic has become a force to be reckoned with, and many tiny voices across the wastes whisper, wondering if the republic will defeat the new and equally powerful governments to their west and east.\n\nThe promises of peasants' rights appeal strongly to the Western Siberian masses, as these are promises which for the first time in decades might actually be fulfilled. But there is a degree of confusion regarding the republic's complex constitutional system, and fear that our strange, experimental government may be too gridlocked to bring lasting positive change to their lives.\n\nRussia is at a precipice, and on both political and ethical grounds we are the rightful heirs to the motherland."

TOM.122.desc: "In the middle of Tomsk, a new, unfamiliar sight made itself known to Valery's eyes. It was the House of Wisdom, as the Modernists termed it. A place where everyone and anyone can find employment, where those left bereft from a dismissal can apply for benefits. Its style was thoroughly modernist, different from the rest of the old city that surrounded it. Curves and lines that go up and under and loop and loop. Its rotating doors breathed warm, air-conditioned flurries that seemed to embrace Valery's soul.\n\nJust in time, too. Valery was, until very recently, a manager in one of the Republic's coal-mining concerns. The company was in dire straits, however, and they let him go along with the rest of his subdivision. He had spent a few nights pacing around his little room while his wife delivered his child to school and, from then on, proceeded to her own work. Valery loved her with all his heart, but it was unfair to her to bear the burden of factory work - not least because of the low pay.\n\nClamping down on his feeling of shame, Valery pushed the door handle and stepped into the building. The sight of it was dazzling. He had never seen ceilings curve and drop so suddenly. Before him were counters behind which the keepers of this place resided: men and women in sharply-tailored shirts and who worked with tireless energy and joy. Valery sauntered to one of them, an elegant young woman in her early forties, wrinkles barely showing. "Uh," he said, confused.\n\n"How can I help you?" she said, her energy infectious through her smile.\n\n"I want to apply for a job. I lost mine a few days ago, and I don't know what to do."\n\n"Have you prepared your documents?"\n\n"Uh, no." Valery blushed. He should have known better.

It was almost six o'clock in the evening, the sun preparing to sink into the horizon, casting shadows off the spires and rooftops of the city. Reaching the scientist, Sakharov laid a hand on his shoulder. "There's something I need you to see."\n\n"Must be something very interesting if you are running, Mr. Sakharov." Pobisk Kuznetsov laughed. "I've never seen anyone as happy as when we were set free from the Gulags! Good man! What news do you bring?"\n\nSakharov sank, hands on knees, panting.

The sweet ashen tobacco smell wafted through the dimly lit room. "Are you okay, Mr. Sakharov? Shall I fetch the doctor? He's still up in this hour, I am sure."\n\n"No need." Sakharov said. "I am fine physically. If it were something physical, it would be easy. Prescribe me a dose of morphine, and surgery after - I would be well. This," he said, pointing to the stack of photographs neatly piled on his table, "this is worse than any physical harm that can come to me."\n\n"May I turn the lights on, Mr. Sakharov?" The President nodded, weakly. Examining the photos, he found himself staring at the images of war. Bodies contorted into painful shapes, gore, the works.

"How did you come across this?"\n\n"The war archives."\n\n"Mr. President, with all due respect to the position of your office, I must urge you to calm down.

Immensely complicated, meticulous, and planned down to the last detail, the games were the reformed Republican Army's first real opportunity to test out its new advanced tactics and hardware.\n\nUpon their conclusion, the games were considered to be an all-around success, and we can be confident going forward in the capabilities of our state-of-the-art armed forces."

The same dilemma hung over every person's head: How to treat the workers of Central Siberia in the wake of their crushed uprising?\n\nBoth sides of the debate could be heard if one listened closely enough to any of the many conversations that slogged late into the night, and each had legitimate and well-intentioned points. In fact, this crucial debate had even created something of a schism among the Bastillards.\n\nThe first side: Granting the workers more rights and improved working conditions is not only the right thing to do, it's necessary if we want to restore their loyalty and keep the Republic stable and peaceful.\n\nThe second side: Making these concessions to the workers is ideal, but impractical. Central Siberia needs to industrialize rapidly, and besides, the uprising was inevitable regardless of any concessions made.\n\nWhile lively and intellectually and philosophically stimulating, this debate between the two Bastillard factions was already settled. Kharms had already decided that industrialization had to take precedence over everything else to prevent the Republic from losing everything, and so the workers would simply have to wait."

Entitled "Welcome to Dolina Nochi", it has become one of the most divisive entertainment products to have come over our airwaves in recent years.\n\nThe serial is set in the small town of Dolina Nochi, a former mill town on the Ob River, which is now centered around a bicycle factory. It follows the daily goings-on of the town's inhabitants: Boris the foreman, Daria the schoolteacher, Alyona and Artyom the factory workers, and so on. However, Dolina Nochi is much stranger than appearances might initially imply. The serial depicts it as almost existing in a bubble, seemingly free from Russia's divisions and turmoil. Moreover, the townsfolk seem to be constantly afflicted by supernatural occurrences. A vast glowing cloud appears above the kindergarten, before becoming the principal. A five-headed dragon is arrested by the local police for committing fraud. And a strange forest on the outskirts of town begins whispering to residents to join it.\n\nThe absurdism of "Welcome to Dolina Nochi" is contrasted against the seemingly repetitive nature of its plots, which are unnervingly normal, given the circumstances. This has made the serial especially controversial, as the show constantly veers between mind-numbing boredom and surreal horror. Some decry it as bizarre and meaningless, while devoted fans gather in cafes to compare notes and share theories. One particularly noteworthy bit of speculation is that the entire town exists in a time loop. Others say that it's all a dream, or that the town is in fact located in the American Southwest. Or, perhaps, all three. With "Welcome to Dolina Nochi", nobody really knows."

They have thrown together a lovely music festival featuring the works of Humanist composers being played by workers.\n\nDespite mocking from the other Salons, the Humanists have provided free music lessons to workers who want them, and the performers have surprisingly done quite well so far, though not as well as professionals. The workers' musical prowess is most certainly evidence of the Humanists' long-held belief and vision that education and the pursuit of one's passions is a right to all.

It was a low-level government bureaucrat. "Good afternoon, sir. The government has begun a program of giving children free toys to help stimulate their development. Are your children home from school? They can come pick a few things they'd like."\n\n"Oh, uh sure. Thank you. Luka, Liuba! Come here, the government is bringing you toys!" Confused but also excited for toys, Vasily's two young kids immediately popped their heads out of the front door and browsed the box of toys being carried by the employee.\n\n"I want that one!" yelled both children at the same time, picking an action figure and picture book respectively.\n\nAfter supper, Vasily and his wife watched the two young children playing with their new presents with glee. They were both totally enamored and absorbed by the toys, so surely this was providing some benefit to their childhoods? This new "Bastillard" political party and "Salon" government was awfully strange, but it seemed they cared about making life bearable for their citizens. They couldn't be too bad."

TOM.141.desc: ""There is no other choice. You make use of the opportunities that exist, or you fail to survive. I would be interested in hearing alternative plans for our development, but I already know you have none."\n\nKharms's dry, stinging words hung briefly over the deputies in the parliament before a deafening rabble consumed the entire room. Jeers and boos came from all over, including from some especially opinionated Bastillards, until Kharms yelled "ENOUGH!" over all the noise. It was incredibly rare that he got even a little flustered. Instantly calming down, the President continued,\n\n"I am no fan of the policies of the Empire of Japan myself. But it would be a grave mistake to ignore the massive economic boon we would experience by opening trade links with them. All we need to do is build up Manchurian industry and expand our Pacific ports, and our Republic will have an economy that eventually eclipses even that of Germany. It is impossible to act in a morally pure fashion at every single crossroads, and we have an obligation to ensure that we spread democracy and prosperity as far and wide as we can. We need to finish this project to do that. And besides, you don't think Japan will find someone else to trade with if we don't trade with them? You are not that naive."\n\nThe parliament was much quieter than before. The deputies heavily pondered what their President had said, but whether Kharms's grand eastern development project came fully to fruition was still up in the air."

Mandatory classes are being taught to more moderate people on the evils and lack of freedom brought by fascism and monarchism. Every last vestige of authoritarian tendency will be wiped off the face of the Far East, even if we have to use rather... authoritarian means.\n\nSome of the most radical among the local populace are even being forcibly sent to re-education camps, and many people are being put on government lists, but these extreme circumstances mean we must reluctantly resort to these extreme measures. It is sad that we have no choice but to violate some of our principles, but it is absolutely necessary for the safety, stability, and eventual prosperity of our Republic."

Their colourful, neo-Napoleonic uniforms really were odd, but they certainly stood out. "Those are some impressive weapons we have in our arsenal," commented Likhachyov, gesturing towards some modern tanks and self-propelled artillery pieces.\n\n"Yes," replied Shaposhnikov, "but these are easily the best-equipped men in the entire army. There is still very much work ahead before we are ready for any major conflict."\n\n"That's good to know, General. But at the very least, the people will be reassured of our strength and glad to see the men who fight for our republic up close."\n\n"There is definitely value in that, Mr. President.""

Every single person here knows exactly what I am referring to: our Salon system is utterly incapable of dealing with outsiders."\n\n"Disunity is plaguing us, it's slowly killing us like the venom of a snake, but we're simply ignoring it and allowing the lifeblood of the country to slowly drain out of it. So many care nothing for what our government does, or have lost faith in us ages ago. So many more still wish to belong to some other rival state because their ideology is so much better than ours or they miss their dear leader. This is a severe problem! But it is not impossible to solve."\n\n"We can integrate people from all circles into our system; the independents, the majority of the radicals, the cynics, the siloviki, just about all of them! But some of us are scared to place their power in jeopardy. This is about the good of the Republic, not your desire to keep your seat in the chamber. Start acting like it."\n\n"I have a great many plans to put an end to this great discord, but we need everyone fully committed and working harder than ever.

You like freedom, democracy, capitalism, and you aren't making any bones about giving Fritz one to the nuts."\n\n"Very good, Mister Rostow."\n\n"Now for the RDC, there's a guy who will for sure want to be your friend. Name's George McGovern. Have a talk with him, and you'll get along just fine if you want good relations with America. He'll give you some more RDC members who will want to be your friend as well.

President Kharms and the Bastillard Salon as a whole seeks to redress that discrepancy.\n\nThe Salon, with help and support from the government, has been involved in the transportation of both teachers and materials needed to expand the reading capabilities of the population. Classes are held for both young and old to participate in. President Kharms praised the actions of his fellow Bastillards, stating that the population 'needs the skills in order to keep our Republic safe, stable, and prosperous.'\n\nWhile the reading materials are varied from famous novels of the Russian canon, others are more experimental in their styles. President Kharms' novels in particular have made a great impact upon the youth of the nation, with many parents surprised at their children's newfound interest in literature."

The city was a major transport and communication hub for Central Siberia. Hence the Humanist Salon sending some of its best assets to oversee the rebuilding process. Nikitin could not help but be amused at history's cyclic nature. Designing Novosibirsk's train station had been one of his first gigs. Now he was in charge of carting off the rubble and starting all over again.\n\nThe Humanist minister prided himself on his experience with large foundations. Novosibirsk's foundations had unfortunately been chewed through by heavy artillery. As termites did to wood, the war had done to the train station. With the bonus of unexploded ordnance slowing progress, of course. Nevertheless, work continued. It was human to seek order where chaos once stood. Nikitin thought of the thirties, of Bukharin's Soviet Union. How different had things be then!\n\nHe thought of the Palace of the Soviets, once supposed to represent the triumph of the world revolution. Designing the foundations of such a colossal project had taken much work, and many technical advancements. How ironic, then, that the triumphal monument to revolution had been swallowed by the fascist tide. Nikitin knew not what happened to the Palace of the Soviets. Probably demolished, like everything else in Moscow the Germans had not found to their liking. Once a testament to the people's future, the palace was now forgotten.

Though the book managed to awaken a slight feeling of national pride in readers, the movie managed to broaden its impact, perhaps even setting it ablaze even more so as countless citizens, inspired by the movie and its protagonist's struggles against the Nazi Reich no doubt, start enlisting in service of the Republic, for the Motherland needs all of its children to defend it from further ravages carried out by Germany."

"Orders are orders, and if you keep being a spineless idiot then so help me-"\n\nA shot rang out, then another, then another. They were loud, and more importantly, close. The entire platoon froze where they were, and looked around for the source. None of them were fresh recruits, even Nikita. Yet something was off about the shots they had heard, were continuing to hear. They followed each other methodically, almost mechanically, as though they were fired against no resistance.\n\n"There!" Nikita shouted, pointing to a clearing in the trees along their path. The uniforms they saw clearly belonged to the damned Eurasians, and Danil wasted no time in getting his rifle ready, seeing the others do the same.\n\n"Open fire!" Their commander cried out, causing the Eurasians to turn to face them. Too late. The platoon's fire decimated the smaller squad of Eurasians, and those few that managed to return fire soon followed. It was when they approached the enemy position to search for survivors that they saw the reason for the strange gunfire a short distance away. Nine CSR soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the Eurasians lay dead on the ground, clearly executed. Three more kneeled to their side, soon to follow had their would-be executioners been spotted any later. To Danil's side, Nikita shook his head in disgust.

Thus, she had found herself in Kemerovo, visiting one of the region's dwindling refugee camps. The end of unification wars had brought normality back. Only the very sick and impoverished remained.\n\nThe administrator of the camp led her to the field hospital.

Doctors had intervened rapidly.\n\nIsaac slept soundly. She stood by the bed, lost in memories. How often had she seen him sleeping peacefully like this. Cold reality superposed on warm recollection. Her love was gaunt, his trait chiselled by deprivation. Now and then a cough would upset her husband's rest, shaking his body cruelly. A few silent tears rolled down her face. None of this mattered, he was alive! Alive!\n\nAnd so Antonina sat by her husband's side. The war had separated them. No doubt had it brought to him challenges and trials.

Why can't I run as an independent?"\n\nThe woman's smile faded. "That's not how Pasternak designed our unique democracy, dear. You must be backed by a salon or else you will not appear on the ballot.

Three of the candidates of the 1963 elections stand again for the presidency: Likhachyov of the Decembrist Salon, Sakharov of the Modernist Society, and Kharms of the Bastillard Society. Dmitry Shostakovich's health being too poor, his friend and protege Moisey Vainberg is picking up the torch of the Humanist Salon.\n\nIt is too early to tell who has the advance, but going into the election one party has been doing unusually well lately in its campaign.\n\nWhich Salon's campaign do you want to follow?"

Four years of direct democracy, referendum, and the pursuit of Humanist ideals.\n\nPresident Vainberg has campaigned on the importance of converting the Central Siberian Plan to one of the world's largest worker run economy. Equally important to him is the development of the national army, building on Marshal Shaposhnikov's basic reforms to build a citizen's army capable of outnumbering any threat to the republic.

Noted Russian Medievalist Dmitry Likhachyov will use the support of Decembrists representatives and senators in the bicameral White Duma to lead the nation on the axioms of democracy, environmentalism, and pragmatic liberal conservatism.\n\nLikhachyov's ambition for the next four years is not a mystery. The Central Siberian Plan is to be liberalized within strict environmental rules. Workers are to be given a share of the nation's wealth in the form of a safety net; enough to ward off misfortunes, but not enough to dull the citizens' appetite for the work that lies ahead. On the domestic and foreign policy side the Decembrists have long argued for an end to extremism in all its forms, and for an expansion of conscription to aid the Republican Army in its efforts of liberation. Russia must be united, Russians must be free, and a better future must be defended from those who would kill Russia's past."

Already the Modernists are hard at work implementing their so-called Blue Duma, a meritocratic board of ministers of various political salons. Once the ministries are fully staffed by qualified politicians and bureaucrats, Sakharov hopes to work on improving the economy. Having now inherited all of the Central Sibeiran Plan, the Modernists argue that a combination of free market reforms guided by expert policy making will catapult the Republic into a more modern economy. This new age of prosperity is set to be accompanied with more rights for disadvantaged groups. Though Sakharov is noted for his personal pacifism, he and his party have also campaigned to use the Central Siberian industries to build a modern army capable of overrunning and cutting down any threat to the Republic. In foreign policy once contact with the outside world is restored, the Modernists are likely to lean toward a pro-OFN policy."

Through the years of the Anarchy and during the slow and painful collapse of the Central Siberian Republic, others had lost faith in the decency, the inherent goodness of each Russian citizen. Not the Humanists.\n\nThroughout the celebrations, workers gathered around public speakers, listening to the Humanist Salon's manifesto. The party's activists loudly rejected Marxist socialism as well as disorganized anarchy. A new, modern choir of democratic voices would rise, directed by the government as maestro. To the citizens, the nation would bestow help, would try to limit the excesses of industrial work, and would ensure education and health in good times as well as in bad times. In return, the nation would expect effort from its children. A new culture of political assemblies, a willingness to dare and to improve the world around them, and a steely determination to join the army of citizen soldiers that would march out unto the fields of Central Siberia.\n\nIn his apartments, Dmitry Shostakovich celebrated with friends and family. The following years would not be easy. But from Pasternak's frail shoulders unto Shostakovich's own failing body, the burden of state would be carried. The Republic would endure."

After the end of vote counting the previous night, Dmitry Likhachyov of the Decembrist Society had won the presidency of the Republic.\n\nLikhachyov's speech was brief but concise. After thanking his voters for their tireless support, he expressed his sincere hope that the other salons would accept him as President and work with him. He went on to explain which reforms he would pursue, chief among them being reforming Tomsk's prison system, overhauling the rural infrastructure that tied the scattered cities and villages of the Republic together, and robust protections for the environment and Russia's traditions. In contrast with this very rational and calculated string of objectives, Likhachyov added a flourish of emotion to cap off his speech.\n\n"As a scholar, I've long spent my days reading about Russian history, about the good people of wide steppes and deep forests, about their ability to incorporate new ideas and strange customs into their own life. I must thank you all once more for giving this old student of Russian history a chance to make his own mark on the destiny of this great society. Russian freedoms endure within all of us.

Scientists, bureaucrats, professors, and common men and women who just wanted a better future had all united behind the Modernist Slogan. Now, it was time to make it a reality.\n\nAndrey couldn't hide how truly happy he was, this was the proudest moment of his career. "Thank you, all of you, for your support of a smarter, more modern Tomsk. Together we can get to the heart of every problem and fix it from the ground up.

Our great education will become even greater, where all will be promised basic schooling and the best universities in Russia. Our government will be rebuilt to be one of merit and efficiency."\n\n"I also promise to the workers of Tomsk that they will see great changes in their jobs, ones that will satisfy both the workers and their bosses. More factories will also be built, to modernize our economy and provide civilians with what they want and the military with what they need. On that final note, we will not just bring these reforms to Tomsk.

The results of the elections were on every person's lips. Of the main parties, the Bastillards were the least well known at the dissolution of the Provisional Government. The salon had its adherents, of course. Among the bankers and industrialists, whispers that the Central Siberian Republic had not been hard enough were rife. Ideas of an iron republic, where the workers knew their place, and an endless stream of weapons and consumer goods made the nation strong and prosperous. The salon also had its adherents among the Republic's soldiers, who felt that the army needed rebuilding in the wake of the devastating war with Yagoda and mutinies.\n\nDaniil Kharms had been the Salon's secret weapon. Well loved for his humanitarian work and as a writer of books for children, the eccentric poet had run a fantastic campaign among poor workers and among the elites of the capital. Over and over he hammered his points: Tomsk needs industry; it needs rigor; it must be fanatically opposed to extremism. The separatist province would be brought back into the nation. Domestic and foreign threats had to be dealt with aggressively, if Russian democracy was to live. To this simple end, the Bastillard Society had prepared robust economic plans to stimulate civilian and military industry and infrastructure.\n\nWith the day's end, all began to return home. Only, this time, train stations and city centers the nation over were covered in art. Songs written by workers, posters painted in the style so common to the murals found in Tomsk. Street theatre, acted on by members of the Bastillard Society. Most common were crude statues, hammered from industrial scraps, a veritable immobile army. All oriented toward the south, where the renegade provinces cowered from a resurgent Tomsk."

Having just turned eighteen, he had an announcement he wanted to make to his family, but he knew he would have to force an opportunity to do so. Because breakfast in the Petrov household was no simple, or quiet, matter.\n\nAs expected, his father and sister were already arguing. His father, who had worked in the Tomsk industrial yards all his life, had long aligned himself behind the Bastillards, while his sister, having just entered the university for economic studies, had embraced the Modernists and their technocratic principles. Bitter arguments ensured over almost every issue. His mother subscribed to the conservative viewpoints of the Decembrists in the interests of stability, and to try and keep the peace besides.\n\nAs for Anatoly himself? He had found himself immediately entranced by the fundamentally constructive ideals of Shostakovich's Humanists. It seemed only natural to him that the only way forward for a people and a nation was that of collective cooperation. Which was why his decision had, in truth, not been much of one at all.\n\nAs his mother placed his food in front of him he interrupted his father and sister, and made his announcement: he had enlisted in the Republic's army, and would be departing the next week for training. The normally lively atmosphere of a Petrov breakfast immediately fell silent, and Anatoly could see that while his father intrinsically understood the duty his son felt, his mother and sister could not. He prepared himself for a very long morning indeed.\n\nIn the end, however, he knew he would not be deterred. President Pasternak was always talking about how one had to be willing to work, willing to risk, to stand up and make life better for all.\n\nAnatoly intended to do just that."

TOM_petrov.2.desc: "If Anatoly had thought his family represented a microcosm of the Republic, of opposing viewpoints engaged in spirit debate, he soon found that the army was even more so.\n\nHowever, and unlike his family, a Bastillard drill instructor could refuse to accept that a 'soft' Humanist could not run ten kilometers after only a week of exercise. A Modernist intelligence officer could scoff at the 'slow' Decembrist who took an extra hour to classify all of the Anarchist vehicles. Every group it seemed had some way to strike against the others.\n\nAnatoly had found the factionalism inherent to the Republic alive and well in the military, and though no action ever escalated to outright malice or insubordination, the undercurrent was always there. He wondered if such discord was also present in the Duma, and if President Pasternak had ever been frustrated by others in similar fashion. The thought saddened him. But, he supposed, much like with his own family, disputes within did not necessarily mean a lack of overall unity.\n\nIndeed, despite those differences in outlook and behavior between him, his fellow soldiers, and their superiors, they could all agree that the Republic was an entity worth defending. That, under the careful and intelligent command of Marshal Shaposhnikov, they would act to ethically expand the reach of multiparty democracy to a region long denied it, and to those suffering so long under oppression.\n\nHe was proud that he had made his choice to join it, and could not but feel eager to, one day, be on the march."

Pasternak's inspirational speeches were the reason he had decided to enlist, and had defined the worldly ideals that a man of conscience, such as Anatoly, could not ignore. Now he was gone, and Anatoly was adrift.\n\nAlmost as distressing was the response of many of the soldiers and officers around him. Though they all of course expressed public mourning for the President, in private and within their salon cliques they all spoke with excitement about the chance for their own faction to emerge victorious from the elections that everyone knew would be announced in short order. Even those that, like himself, called themselves Humanists.\n\nAnatoly stayed far away. How could a true Humanist express remorse for a great man's death while simultaneously looking with relish at the chance to replace him? And what did it mean that so many would do so with seemingly no remorse or self-awareness of that fact? He could find no answers to such disturbing questions.\n\nHe did know, however, that things were about to change. For himself, having now completed training. For his family, where the arguments over the table would only grow more heated as any election progressed, and which he knew he would soon hear about in letters. And, finally, for the Republic as a whole, where the outcome of the election could determine its entire course for years to come.\n\nThough he could not suppress his unease, Anatoly believed, had to believe, in the institutions of the Republic itself. That they would endure. He did not want to think about the alternative."

TOM_petrov.8.t: "The Petrov Salon: Ultimatum of Industry"
TOM_petrov.8.desc: "When the order came to march on the secessionist government in Novosibirsk, Anatoly Petrov had grimly understood its need.\n\nThe actions of those in command of the city had fatally weakened the Republic during Yagoda's invasion, and its continued separation prevented the unification of the most populated and industrialized region of Central Siberia with the central government in Tomsk. Reclamation was essential.\n\nNovosibirsk had an experienced military, led by some of the finest officers east of the Urals, and they furthermore leveraged the massive refugee population within their borders, conscripting them into militia formations. Militia formations which were well-equipped, owing to the city's many industrial zones. The result had been a bloodbath, and as Anatoly's unit had swept through the city he had lost count of the broken and mangled bodies he had seen.\n\nLeading a small patrol through one of these industrial zones after the surrender, Anatoly could not but reflect on everything his father had argued for years, on the importance the Bastillards gave to industrial expansion and production. He had once seen merit in those ideas. And all he could now see in them was death. All he could now see was that cold rationale of productive calculus as applied to bullets, guns, cannons, and how many deaths per unit could be achieved.\n\nThey cared nothing for the ages of those cut in two by machine gun fire, or of the cries of the fractional group of mothers who lost their children to a fractional production quota of artillery shells. He wanted no part of such beliefs.\n\nHe did not know how he would tell his father that."

TOM_petrov.9.t: "The Petrov Salon: Ultimatum of Experts"
TOM_petrov.9.desc: "It seemed absurd to Anatoly Petrov that he would find himself questioning liberalism while helping to reclaim a city from a traitorous military government, but such was the case.\n\nKrasnoyarsk, sitting astride the crucial railway junction along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, was always a city that had to be reclaimed. This was doubly so given the military-dominated regime of General Andreev which, as far as Anatoly had been told or had once thought, went against everything the Republic stood for. And yet upon arriving in the city, he had seen little evidence of the severe oppression the Republic's rhetoric had emphasized.\n\nIt was true that Andreev and his clique dominated the government, yes, but they also provided a stability and framework to encourage progress instead of endless debate and political paralysis. They had promised, and begun working towards, packages of political, economic, and social rights that rivalled and, in some cases exceeded, the Republic's own. And now their nation was occupied, and those who had fought and died for those promises were all but forgotten.\n\nThe liberal and technocratic policies that his sister Galina was always going on about in her letters, that she and Sakharov's other supporters were convinced as the only possible way to govern a modern nation, were largely considered impossible under a military administration. Much of that liberalism had existed, in a strange way, in Krasnoyarsk. Until he had helped to destroy it.\n\nAnatoly had tried, and found himself unable, to reconcile the dichotomy. Did his observations correspond to an isolated observation? Or were they evidence of a fundamental weakness in Modernist philosophy? Increasingly, Anatoly found himself believing the latter.\n\nHe did not know how he would tell his sister that."

TOM_petrov.10.t: "The Petrov Salon: Ultimatum of Stability"
TOM_petrov.10.desc: "Anatoly Petrov had not known what to expect when his unit was ordered, along with other elements of the army, into the so-called 'Mad King's' domain in and around Kemerovo. But it was not what he eventually received.\n\nThe Mad King's offensive failures, and eventual madness, during the anarchist uprising had significantly sapped the Republic's strength, and his seizure of territory had removed important resource deposits that had to be recovered. And, as his mother had long reminded him, the central Decembrist concept of the removal of absolute monarchies such as the Mad King had established seemed a noble concept - without representation, how could a people be content?\n\nYet, as Anatoly's unit entered the city, he had seen people who were exactly that. The Mad King's children could not have been more different, the daughter a cold autocrat, but the son a man with ideals. Apparently dedicated to improving the lot of so many of Kemerovo's citizens. Enough so that they could, and did, fight for him in large numbers. And die for him in nearly equal numbers. Fighting a representative republic for a monarch.\n\nAnatoly was having a hard time processing that fact. Constitutional government, the inherent stability of which his mother had long praised, had failed these people utterly when the anarchists rose, but their 'King' had not, at least as far as they were concerned. And if that Decembrist concept had proven to be non-universal, which others were similarly so? He no longer saw how he could trust any of the tenets of Likhachyov's adherents.\n\nHe did not know how he would tell his mother that."

A chance to bring the advantages of responsible and representative government to those who had had it stolen from them. But with every village and town he passed through, with every pair of hate-filled eyes that stared at him from the family of a man killed in its defense, he found himself questioning.\n\nShostakovich's speeches and literature spoke of the utopian ideals of cooperation and collaboration. About making the world a better place for one's fellow man. Anatoly had long believed these ideals, knowing that without them he would not have joined the military at all.\n\nAnd that was the key that had cracked his image of the campaign. The anarchists believed just as strongly in their commune-based society as he had in the Republic. They believed that they fought for each other against tyranny, and from what he had seen from their citizens, that belief was widely shared. Indeed, even bereft of what could be considered a strong central government they worked cooperatively to construct a better future. Until he had helped tear it down.\n\nWhen that realization hit, he felt as he had upon hearing of President Pasternak's death - adrift and alone. Had many of his deepest beliefs proven questionable at best? Could anarchists achieve a utopia? And, if so, could monarchists do the same? Could fascists? He could not find an answer. And that, he knew, was an answer in itself.\n\nHe did not know if he could, or should, convince himself otherwise."

He had returned home, to warm hugs from his mother and sister and one of even greater respect from his father. Each had believed, in their own way, that he had fought for, and shown the truth of, their own outlook. Their own salon.\n\nBut he had done nothing of the sort. Indeed, everything he had seen had proven to him the limited worldview of each set of ideals. The Bastillards, Decembrists, Modernists, and Humanists all had, at their core, had a set of beliefs that they could not, would not, deviate from, beliefs which their adherents, including his own family, could not see the limitations of.\n\nHe could. And, as a result, he no longer believed in any of them. His belief was a belief in nothing, a paradox in itself that Anatoly had naturally questioned. Could a man exist without any beliefs? And, if so, what did that make him? What did that mean for how he approached life? Did it make him more able to respond to challenges, no longer shackled by one static viewpoint? Or did it make him less able, without a consistent moral center?\n\nAs another round of arguments erupted between his father and sister on an aspect of economic policy, one which he once would have gladly participated in, Anatoly remained silent.\n\nHe no longer saw the purpose."

They all provided more than enough of that in any case.\n\nAnatoly looked at the Duma for another long moment, and then turned to leave.

Anatoly had returned it with an empty nod.\n\nTrue, lots of goods were exiting from the port, destined for all the corners of the world, and bringing wealth to those who had once had little. But much of what was coming in was clearly destined for use by the military. And after his experiences in Novosibirsk, Kemerovo, and elsewhere, he knew well what those weapons could do. He was powerless to stop any such efforts, but that did not mean that he, like his father, had to support them.\n\nInstead, he had chosen to focus on the small things. Earlier that day a cargo ship from The United States had arrived, and as it had exited the port he had reviewed the manifest.

TOM_constitutional_crisis.1.desc: "Worrying news has been reported recently about our democracy. Calling themselves the Electoral Progressive Movement, people from the liberated territories of Central Siberia are now calling for the abolition of the special voting system and the requirements for being backed by the salons. While this may sound good on paper to them, for Tomsk's unique democracy it means the end of Pasternak's ideal design. Technically anyone is able to run for office, but the Salon system constrains the type of ideologies candidates can run on. Some may say this is by design, but it has been more beneficial than anything. The salon electoral system has kept Tomsk's democracy stable, something rare for Russia. If not, who knows of the dangerous ideologies that could sneak into our democracy, tearing it apart from the inside.\n\nThere have already been many responses from major political individuals, but it does not seem like this Electoral Progressive Movement will be going away anytime soon. We may have to prepare for a confrontation that will decide the fate of our democracy. Hopefully, it will be peaceful."

TOM_constitutional_crisis.2.desc: "More worrying news from the Electoral Progressive Movement, multiple marches in the streets of Tomsk have started to pop up. Mostly made up of people asking to expand democracy, there is no doubt that this is connected to the movement. More worrying is that there are reports of more unsavory elements, former separatists, anarchists, and communists. However, there are also a lot of genuine democrats in the crowd as well, showing the movement is not just a separatist plot.\n\nPeople in Tomsk are split as to whether the system of Salons should be reformed or kept similar. While reforming may allow these unsavory elements into the government, there is reason why things should not be kept the way they are. The Salon system is constraining, after all, but would reform betray Pasternak's ideals?"

"As you can see here, Mr. President, the analysis of the independent movement shows that, while mostly made up of legitimate groups, radicals also lurk in their midst. We have no doubt they could pose a serious threat to our democracy. For every dozen true republican, a communist or fascist plots to end our republic."\n\n"We can't just go and shut down every group of people who disagree with us!" said Antonina Pirozhkova, Sakharov's leading minister. "We'll be harming the republic ourselves if we just ignore the people's voice."\n\n"Antonina, do you not see the dangers all of these people pose to our unique republic, though?" came the voice of Pobisk Kuznetsov, another leading minister. "These people want independents in our elections! The destruction of Pasternak's ideal democracy! If independents get in, who knows what they'll do if elected- especially the fascists or communists!"\n\n"Hold on, Kuznetsov," said Sakharov, not wanting the meeting to get out of hand. "The people are still justified in their point of view. They see our democracy as limiting, and as running as independent the only way to get their voice heard. While I agree we cannot change the system, promises need to be made to the people. If we ignore this, who knows what will happen in the future.""

After so much time, so much struggle to piece the Republic back together after it had nearly shattered, these damned protestors threatened to make it all for nothing. If only they could understand that it was for their own benefit!\n\nNow, he found himself calling moderate after moderate, seeking to calm some political tensions in order to reduce the strain upon the government. While many had proved agreeable, some, such as that last one, had wanted nothing to do with it. What he could have done to solve all this, to reassure the people, had he had just a little more time to prepare! He had not had that time, however, had not prepared, and now it was worthless just thinking about it. Letting out a long, exhausted sigh, he reluctantly picked the phone back up and began dialing yet another number. He wondered what Pasternak would do, were he alive to see what was happening. Would he have maintained course even then? Likhachyov had no way of knowing, so he simply placed the phone to his ear once more."

And yet, he couldn't find the will to go and defend the government against the protests.\n\nSuddenly, his attention was dragged out of his thoughts to the sound of someone running up to him. It was his longtime friend and ally, Moisey Vainberg. "Moisey! You bring good news, I hope?"\n\nShostakovich's hope was dashed as soon as it appeared when Vainberg shook his head. "I'm afraid not. The unrest has only gotten worse, though it's still manageable."\n\nBiting his lip, Shostakovich turned his head away. "Then, what do we do?" He asked, a question aimed as much at himself as at Vainberg. "We're better than suppressing dissent with violence, but the only other way I see out of this is..."\n\n"Reforming the electoral system and expanding voting. Which, while we've always supported such a thing, would challenge the constitutional order and leave the Republic at risk when it comes to reactionaries and revolutionaries."\n\n"Precisely. Thank you, Moisey. You're always quick to catch on." Shostakovich smiled gratefully, then headed to his office with renewed determination. "I'll continue to give out orders to calm any violence.

The separatists are a minority, yes, but this does not make them any less of a threat. Their recent protest, for instance, could spread their message. They demand an end to the salon system, a system that has kept this Republic safe for years now."\n\nKharms stopped, looking at his cabinet for approval. They nodded, and he continued. "That is why they must be dealt with, and soon."\n\n"President Kharms, should we deal with them like we have dealt with the workers?"\n\n"No, that is not necessary, Shaposhnikov. They are dangerous, but not that dangerous."\n\n"Their protests will not be conducive to stability," replied Oleynikov. "Already the Humanists are giving their sympathies in the Duma. Not to even mention its effects on faith in our institutions."\n\n"That is why we must keep an eye on them, and prepare full measures if they get... violent.

Unfortunately, however, some protestors did not see the desired effect. Several anti-republicans fought with the police and counter-protestors, leading to many being wounded during the fighting. However, after the fighting, many of the protestors have now been pacified as more police presence is being seen in the city. It seems our decision to bring the police in was a good one, as the protestors begin to head home.\n\nHowever, many in the government are criticizing our actions.

Police presence was kept at a minimum, and there was almost no intervention.\n\nNow, while several streetfights continue to rage, most have ended with both sides burning each other out. There were multiple injuries with several people being evacuated to hospitals but thankfully no fatalities have been reported. It seems the protests have thankfully ended, as both sides are too exhausted and disorganized to continue. Our plan of non-intervention has apparently worked.\n\nAnd while many are criticizing our administration's actions, or rather, inaction, many still say we did the right thing by letting the protestors fight it out themselves. However, while there is no doubt that we did stick to our ideals, the confidence of the independents has all but grown."

Many in the government have stated that while this crisis in democratic faith has been worrying, it could have been significantly worse. 'Violence could have resulted in rioting,' one source stated.\n\nMany political commentators are worried about the results of such cynicism in the population, especially from citizens from former seperatist territories, and are all calling on the government to restore democratic faith in the people, and to ensure stability once more."

Created to give more privileges to the educated to vote on more important matters, it allows the intelligentsia a larger say in government. While the voting bloc is technically open to all who pass the entrance exams, the League for Expanded Democratic Rights, made up of mostly independents, has decried the special voting pool as undemocratic and has mounted a legal case in favor of abolishing the voter pool.\n\nThey say all people deserve the same vote, no matter their education. While it may sound sensible at first, the voter pool is very important for Pasternak's constitutional design and is one of the very ideals of our Republic. Eliminating it could very well lead to the end of the salon system.\n\nStill, many citizens are supporting the move that the League is making, especially people of newly integrated provinces. The case is expected to head to the Supreme Court, despite its lack of legal basis. Judges of lower courts have issued inconsistent rulings, and this while this case could seem small at first, it may very well lead to the fall of our Republic's unique democracy."

The League, primarily made up of citizens from newly conquered territories and those critical of the salon system of political representation, has made significant gains in the past months, both in membership and funding.\n\nMost surprising to most of the salon establishment, many prominent Humanists have made themselves available to the League, either as lawyers, researchers, or even as representatives from other salons, all in order to assist in the case being brought forth by the League's legal case. 'I believe,' said one, 'that is it immoral for a group of citizens to be denied because their ideology is beyond the salon style. For many, this is the first time that they've encountered such a structure, so it is completely understandable that they would seek something more representative of their needs.'\n\nThe exact court date has yet to be finalized, but many in Tomsk and throughout the Republic fear the political repercussions of the decision made by the Supreme Court, regardless of the outcome."

'The salons, the elites, they tell us that we are a perfect democracy - but I must ask, friends, can a democracy that bans those outside of its nonsensical and arcane parties truly be 'democratic?' Can a free country truly be free, if those outside of the four salon system can't even get on the ballot, let alone be elected?'\n\nStepanov took a long, hard drag on his death stick.

The only people who thought otherwise were wide eyed idealists, Humanists, and similarly idiotic people.

TOM_constitutional_crisis.18.t: "A Working System"
TOM_constitutional_crisis.18.desc: "TOMSK - Today the Supreme Court has given its final decision today on the League for Expanded Democratic Rights today in favor of the special voting blocs, stating that 'the Salon status requirement for ballot access is fully constitutional, and thus the majority of the plaintiff's case has been rejected.'\n\nMany in the League are disappointed with the decision, but many report that the outcome was expected. 'We just don't have public or constitutional support, really,' said one anonymous staffer. 'We were always gonna lose.'\n\nIn spite of its most central point - that being the special voting blocs is within constitutional bounds - the chief justice's speech has drawn the most attention among both League supporters and salon loyalists, stating that:\n\n'This Republic is based upon values of democracy and an all encompassing freedom. That is why we must do better, must do more, must never stop trying to listen to its citizens, regardless of political belief or prior loyalty, and only then will democracy flourish as it has around the world.' It then argued for expanding the voter pools, with a specific eye towards the legislative and executive branch."

TOM_constitutional_crisis.19.t: "Joint Statement"
TOM_constitutional_crisis.19.desc: "The crowd gathered around the stage in Tomsk talked with confused and worried looks on their faces; the salons cooperated plenty, but it wasn't too often that you saw a leading member of two different salons make an announcement to the people together. Perhaps it had something to do with the recent unrest and protests?\n\nThe talking hushed when Moisey Vainberg and Andrey Sakharov both took the stage and went up to one of the two podiums on it. The crowd seemed even more unsure what to make of this situation now. "A good day to all you people of the Republic," Sakharov said, looking tired but as determined as ever. "I have no doubt you've all seen the recent protests for changes to our governmental system. My friend and colleague Moisey Vainberg and I are here today to address that." He nodded towards Vainberg with a smile. "Please, speak."\n\nClearing his throat, Vainberg looked over the crowd once, and realized he didn't recognize any of them. A democracy couldn't continue like this. "I promise you, good people, that we are listening to your worries, your pleas. We are working towards a resolution of this crisis as fast as we can, so all I ask is that you place a little more faith in us. With this Republic standing together, it will survive anything; but to be worth surviving, to be worth all of you standing together in defense of it, it must constantly reevaluate itself."\n\nThe crowd began to murmur, surprised by this development above all else, though they did look generally pleased by it. Unable to hide his excitement at the approaching resolution to the unrest, Sakharov grinned merrily. "In time, with your support, we will craft a Republic that is worth fighting for. Until then, I can promise you this.""

TOM_constitutional_crisis.20.t: "Free and Open Discussion"
TOM_constitutional_crisis.20.desc: "Pyotr wrote furiously as the debate got rolling in the Duma. It had been a busy couple of weeks, with all the constitutional discussions and court cases going on, but even in spite of that, his editor wanted him to stick to Duma reporting. Typical, Pyotr thought.\n\nStill, it wasn't all boring. The debate didn't just deal with basic, moderate stuff, but with the founding principles of the Republic - but on the nature of their place in the constitutional structure of government. What, many asked, was the purpose of an upper house? The answers to such questions ranged from the Humanists' ideals of protecting freedom and the working man, to the Bastillards' cynical hatred of populism. Towards the end of the debate, one representative, a Humanist, took the proverbial microphone, going to the dias and giving a speech to his fellow members.\n\n"Friends, comrades, I speak to you as not only a representative of the Humanists, but as a loyal patriot and citizen of Central Siberia, and a believer in the liberties of mankind. I speak to the belief that all men are created equal, and that any man willing to take away those fundamental liberties is an enemy of the people. That is what we are doing, protecting the people from the will of despots who would wish to take away their freedoms."\n\n"But that alone cannot protect us, for it is only when the people lose their faith in democracy, in our constitution, and in our institutions, that such men can even take power. Without faith that our leaders have our best interests at heart, why would the people listen to us?"\n\nThe chamber went quiet. Even Pyotr's pen stopped scribbling, looking down at the young man.\n\n"I believe in nation before Salon. Any honesty, well meaning attempt to improve the faith of the men and women of this nation is something I support, regardless of which side of the aisle they may be on. Many of my allies would agree with that sentiment."\n\nThe man left the dias, but the noises did not reappear."
