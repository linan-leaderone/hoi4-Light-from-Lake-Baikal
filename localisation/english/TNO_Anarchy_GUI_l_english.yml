 TNO_Anarchy_diplo_tt: "This is an anarchic territory, we therefore cannot interact with it."
 
 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_tt: "§oAnarchy§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_tt_delayed: "Long before thinkers like Proudhon and Kropotkin developed the theory of anarchism, there was only one definition for anarchy: chaos. It is what Thomas Hobbes referred to as the "State of Nature," an era of war by all against all, where life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." It was the earliest state of man, from the time of hunter-gatherers, and it was gradually abandoned in favor of the settled agrarian life. And it is a state to which some of mankind has unfortunately returned.\n\nWhether due to continual warfare, natural disaster, or political instability, a region of the world has been left with no governing body able (or willing) to assert its authority. The end result is less a withering away of the state and more a total collapse of all centralized authority. No power extends beyond the outskirts of one's village, and any sort of institution or infrastructure beyond the local level simply does not exist. Those who live outside of the occasional hamlet do so as nomads, hunting and foraging for foods while dodging predators and roaming bandits. It is a lifestyle that does not allow for art, culture, or higher education, because even those who want to pursue those are too busy surviving to focus on thriving. In time, the circumstances that caused this collapse may fade, and civilization can flourish once more. But until then, there will be no gods and no masters here."

 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_Nuclear_tt: "§xThe Nuclear Wastelands§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_Nuclear_tt_delayed: "Once, there was a reason all this happened. A misunderstanding, maybe, or a game of chicken pushed too far, or a war so terrible, so awesome in its scale, that it left those who lived no choice.\n\nThe reasons why are long gone. So are the nations who cared about them, and the leaders who made the fatal decision, and the people who could do nothing but watch. It's all been blown away by the wind, taking billions of stories, structures, souls with it. What remains scrabbles at the ruins for life, and finds none.\n\nHumanity has not been extinguished. Embers cling on to what remains of their forefathers, marveling at now-ancient wonders and ruins, slowly pulling coherence and knowledge from the muck.\n\nIf they're lucky, they may even be able to make the same mistake someday."
 
 TNO_Anarchy_OMO_tt: "§BThe Wilderness of Northeastern Siberia§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_OMO_tt_delayed: "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."
 
 TNO_Anarchy_VIL_after_midnight_tt: "§sThe Dead Wasteland of Northeastern Siberia§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_VIL_after_midnight_tt_delayed: "In a distant, faded memory, on these faraway, remote lands, there was a dream. A dream of a peaceful Russia, free from all strife and suffering, under the caring guidance of one of God's many servants, a son of Men himself.\n\nHowever, God's favor was not enough to protect him, and the land suffered under a usurper, who used of His name for a tragedy beyond understanding.\n\n§xNow, from this cradle of hope, all that lies is poison and death, for God dare not give Russia a false hope again.§!"
 
 TNO_Anarchy_DRL_tt: "§sThe Anarchy of the Southern Urals, the legacy of§! §oOskar Dirlewanger§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_DRL_tt_delayed: "The monster lies dead, his legacy is not that of an empire rivaling Alexander, but one of bloodshed and misery.\n\nDirlewanger's base and perverted interests were widely shared by his men but his ambitions were not, only serving him and his fiefdom out of fear and a need to satisfy their own greed. With their king dead, the loyalty among thieves has been shattered, forming rival bandit factions that fight amongst each other for the remains of what is left in the Southern Urals.\n\nThis collapse is no reprieve for the Brigade's victims, who continue to suffer as this constant state of warfare has prevented any possibility of a new government forming that has more authority than a village elder. These villages focus inwards to protect what little they have left from men who only believe in wanton violence and cruelty. This chaotic situation will continue to be the status quo until an outside power can put an end to the anarchy in the future.\n\nBut for now, the residents of the Southern Urals must persist in a failed state where life is nasty, brutish, and short."
 
 TNO_anarchy_NRL_tt: "§BThe Isolated Settlements of Northern Siberia§!"
 TNO_anarchy_NRL_tt_delayed: "When the Siberian Plan was drafted by the economists of the Soviet Union, there were great plans for the northern parts of Central Siberia. Roads would connect the desolate wastelands with the rest of Russia, industries were to be built atop the region's bountiful mineral deposits and cities would be built where once there was nothing. All those lofty plans quickly turned into ash as the thirties went on. Shovels could barely pierce the permafrost and the use of forced labor became commonplace. Instead of being integrated into the industrial cities to the south, a rough patchwork of improvised roads barely connected a few towns and Gulag complexes. Once the Great Patriotic War began, the development plans for the region were largely abandoned except for the rapid exploitation of the mines in the far north by forced labor. When the Great Patriotic War was lost, the region fell into abject disrepair and isolation.\n\nToday, only the decayed metal husks of great projects remind the few people who venture here from the southern portions of Siberia of the great projects of the Siberian Plan. The gulags are deserted, the mines are long since derelict, and the few roads built into the region have largely been consumed by the harsh elements of Siberia itself. What little life exists in this edge of the world now more closely resembles that of centuries ago with isolated hunting and subsistence farming communities scraping by as they have for hundreds of years before industrialization briefly reached this part of the world. And as long as the anarchy persists in the rest of Russia, things are unlikely to change for a hundred more years."

 TNO_anarchy_UZB_tt: "§nThe Vast Stretches of the Turkmen and Uzbek Territories§!"
 TNO_anarchy_UZB_tt_delayed: "How does one erase a national idea so thoroughly? How does one pick the strong pillars of a nation, a history, and wreck it even worse than the collapse of the USSR did?\n\nThe answer, if you ask the Afghan and the Japanese, is to systematically break every single pivot that made a country work and broadcast live the murder of their dream.\n\nHow can a country supply itself, when the heads of its chain of production were murdered in their sleep? How can country pass laws and legislation, when those responsible for it seemingly vanish into thin air? When your heroes and symbols of unification all turned to ash, in a grand explosion for the world to watch?\n\nYou can only break a people's spirit so many times before they return to a system that works. These territories have returned to a tribal local economy, heavily distrustful to an outside world that, twice, broke their world and left them to pick up the pieces.\n\nWhatever may come from the Turkmen and Uzbek Territories, one can be sure, that the crimes other countries committed against them won't ever be forgiven, nor forgotten."

 TNO_anarchy_MCW_Dissapearance_tt: "§JMoskowien's Dissolution§!"
 TNO_anarchy_MCW_Dissapearance_tt_delayed: "It is amusing how, sometimes, two souls can be connected. Adolf Hitler breathed life into the National Socialist movement in the early 1920s, and not long after Siegfried Kasche joined suit. Adolf Hitler waged war against Russia to kill it at all costs, and Siegfried Kasche accepted his invitation to lead the Reichskommissariat Moskowien. Once Adolf Hitler died, Siegfried Kasche departed from Moskau to Germania. To restore communications, to rally troops for Moskowien's pacification, to confirm whether or not his Führer really was dead - Kasche's mind found itself preoccupied with what §CDestiny§! held in store for him, even as he handed the control over the colony to his Deputy, Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff.\n\nTime passed, and Kasche did not return - nor did he answer any attempts at communication. Thus, §JMoskowien's Dissolution§! began - a result of 20 years of negligence towards hundreds of "small" issues in contrast to the fundamental goals of the colony, even as the Darwinist nature of the warfare enveloping Moskowien continues in light of §CDestiny§!'s desire to get rid of Kasche.\n\nIf Moskowien was a prison, now it experiences a revolt. In the sea of fights, explosions and ear-shattering crumblings that the prisoners cause to its walls, one can see a tall-standing figure. "Who is he?" - one may ask. "My favourite", §CDestiny§! will answer."

 TNO_Anarchy_MDM_Collapsed_Authority_tt: "§JThe Chaotic Collapse of Authority in Madagascar§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_MDM_Collapsed_Authority_tt_delayed: "From the moment Antanarive's Gendarmerie declared resistance against the colonial government, French rule in Madagascar had ended. Administrative institutions of the French colonial office have since been subverted by forces of the Militärkommission von Madagaskar, and pro-mutiny revolters have seized control of many coastal provinces. Yet, much more of Madagascar is without government and, in some cases, is entirely unaware of events unfolding in the island's contested zones.\n\nThe first word of change reached the provinces by telephone, and soon whispered anxiety permeated among French plantation owners and the privy elite. In some communities, the gentry villas and enclosed mansions were quickly evacuated; other regions, especially those organized by the communist Antoko'ny Kongresi'ny Fahaleovantenan'i Madagasikara, sought retribution for colonial-era abuses by seizing properties and land owners into the custody of local councils. Ad-hoc tribunals for colonial officials have been increasingly common in the 'unadministered zone', but, for the most part, these communities are stable and govern themselves.\n\nHowever, this condition of serene self-government is temporary, and the forces of revolt and imperial reconquest encroach, each seeking total control of the island, establishing themselves in these settlements. To the revolters, most go willingly, but the Germans are more brutal than their French predecessors and extract barbaric scores from conquered communities. Those who remain untouched can only wait and enjoy what remains of their reprieve from impending chaos and brace themselves for the war ahead."
