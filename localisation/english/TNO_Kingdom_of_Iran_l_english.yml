 ## Leader Descs  ##
 POLITICS_SHAPOUR_BAKHTIAR_DESC: "Shapour Bakhtiar has never asked for much from his opponents. Where the other claimants to Iranian leadership have denounced the Shah, Bakhtiar sought only to keep the monarchy in place with a constitution. For every call for blood he has called for moderation, reconciliation, and peace. For this many of the Iranian people revile him as an apologist for tyranny. They could not be more wrong.\n\nFor Bakhtiar has more than earned his stripes as a freedom fighter. During the Spanish Civil War, he had fought on the side of the ill-fated Republic. When the Germans subdued France, Bakhtiar used his contacts among the French Resistance to undermine the occupier. Now Bakhtiar fights for his own country, and he is determined that he shall not fight for the losing side another time. All he has ever wanted is for his people to be free, and to be led by a good man towards this goal. Only death will stop him."
