 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 
 POLITICS_VLADA_ZECEVIC_DESC: "Vladimir Zečević, better known as Father Vlada, is a man who has been many things. After joining the clergy, he served as a parish priest in a small town among the hills and woodlands of western Serbia, living a simple and pious life. It was only when the winds of war swept over the Balkans that Zečević left his church and flock to join the Chetnik resistance against the Germans. Despite rapidly rising through the ranks of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, he quickly grew outraged with Mihailović's policy of collaborating with the Nazi invader against Tito's communists, defecting to the partisans with five hundred of his men in 1942.\n\nHis newfound communist loyalty not at odds with his faith, Vlada simply pinned a red star under the cross on his cap, and continued to fight. Despite increasingly desperate odds, the partisans resisted in face of the invaders long after the end of the war, striking at the Nazis and their collaborators before disappearing again into the forests and mountains of the Serbian heartland. And throughout all those years, Vlada was always there, in the midst of the action, inspiring his comrades with his sermons and his deeds.\n\nAs tensions rose between Rome and Germania, the Serbian-Croatian border became heavily militarized on both sides, de facto cutting off Serbia's partisans from Tito's headquarters. Rapidly, ASNOS descended into political squabbling, and soon enough Vlada ended up in command of the armed wing of the liberation movement, as he was largely detached from such political struggles. Now, after so many years, the NOV has decided to launch its final, all out assault - but it is yet to be seen if Serbia will finally be liberated, and if Father Vlada will be allowed to return to his parish for one last time, resuming the simple life of a pious priest he was forced to abandon so long ago."

 POLITICS_ALEKSANDAR_RANKOVIC_DESC: "Sometimes known by his nom de guerre, Leka, Aleksandar Ranković is the foremost member of the partisan old guard in Serbia, and for many, one of the few remaining symbols of the Yugoslav dream. Born into a poor family in the outskirts of Belgrade, Ranković joined the Serbian workers' movement at the age of 15, soon entering the Serbian Communist Party. A dedicated and indefatigable organizer, Ranković was arrested and imprisoned for six years by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and upon being released immediately resumed his political activity, playing a vital role in the early strengthening of the Party in Serbia.\n\nNot even the war was able to stop him - immediately joining the partisan movement as Serbia was invaded by Germany, he was again arrested in 1941, but this time by the Gestapo. Surviving torture at the hands of the Nazi criminals, he was rescued by a daring partisan raid. In retaliation, Gestapo agents executed his wife and his mother. Ever more determined to fight on, Ranković would later go on to become a major leader in the communist leadership, founding and directing OZNA, the partisans' secret police and intelligence bureau.\n\nIn his role as president of ASNOS, Ranković was entrusted with keeping the flame of Yugoslav communism alive. An entire generation of Serbians grew up barely remembering Tito and his comrades, but Ranković was there to remind them - to remind them that through the people's struggle, a new Yugoslavia would be reborn from its ashes. As the red star has once more risen in the skies of Belgrade, a new light shines in the Balkans - destined to either lead the Serbs to the liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, or to be once more stamped out by the vile servants of fascism."

 #POLITICS_BORISAV_JOVIC_DESC: "In many ways, the life and rise to power of Borisav Jović is a mystery even to his supporters. Born in a small village in central Serbia to unknown parents, the details of his early life are barely known - however, young Jović studied economics in the University of Belgrade before joining the partisan movement. Distinguishing himself as a silent yet talented and ambitious organizer, Jović quietly and swiftly climbed the ranks of the liberation movement, managing the unofficial contact channels between the Serbian partisans and Italian agents in the Balkans, exchanging intel, and, according to some rumours, obtaining covert support from Rome.\n\nOrganizing the economic structure of ASNOS, Jović had already established a solid network of friends and supporters in the movement when he made his first public power plays. His outspoken Serbian patriotism and criticism of the partisan leadership quickly gained him sympathies among younger partisans, increasingly disaffected with their elders' Titoist and pan-Yugoslav rhetoric. After staying in the sidelines during the uprising that finally liberated Serbia, Jović only needed to give an order - without needing to lift a finger, he had almost the entire leadership of ASNOS arrested by his loyalists.\n\nRallying his supporters under the newly formed Socialist Party of Serbia, Jović won the first elections of free Serbia with barely any competition to oppose his widespread popularity. Using vaguely leftist and heavily nationalistic rhetoric, Jović paints the image of a reborn Serbia, one once again ready to become the lynchpin of the Balkans. While his detractors call him a populist quasi-dictator, his many supporters proudly rally around the red-blue-white flag that now waves free over Serbia - but many wonder if Jović's new Serbia is destined to be truly free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KAVAJA_DESC: "Patriot, criminal, freedom fighter, bandit, rebel, terrorist. Nikola Kavaja is a man whose name is whispered with terror in all of Serbia, by his allies, his enemies, and his victims. Born in 1932, Kavaja witnessed as a child the deportation of his family by the invading Nazis - and then he killed for the first time, pushing a wounded German soldier into a well. As he grew up, his hatred for the occupiers grew with him, as did his fierce nationalism - and soon enough, Kavaja gathered around himself a disparate group of Chetnik remnants, disgraced collaborators, and common criminals, founding the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement, or SOPO.\n\nAssassinations, kidnappings, sabotages, hijackings, bank robberies and bombings - with every action, SOPO grew more feared. Modeled after the Black Hand, SOPO compensated its relatively small numbers by mastering the arts of terror and brutality, striking Nazis when and where they least expected it. Even the partisans soon learned to fear Kavaja and his ferociously anti-communist gang - and yet, even when the two groups agreed to a truce before the offensive against the German garrison, nobody could expect what would come next.\n\nAfter quickly and brutally seizing power in Belgrade, Kavaja and SOPO took control of the whole of Serbia, violently crushing any form of resistance. Proclaiming the restoration of the Serbian kingdom, Kavaja and his men are now de facto in control of a new Serbia, their virulently nationalist propaganda being welcomed by the long downtrodden Serbs. And yet, the struggle for Serbian liberation is not yet over - and Kavaja is ready to ensure that no communist nor German invader dares ever again to try and usurp the throne of Nemanja, whatever the costs."

 POLITICS_DIMITRIJE_LJOTIC_DESC: "Of all the Serbs, only Dimitrije Ljotić and his clerical-fascist party ZBOR - the Yugoslav National Movement - are trusted enough to run the Serbian puppet régime. This makes sense given that he and his party were the only willing bootlickers of Germany in a country that was awash with anti-German sentiment even before the Second World War and the fall of Yugoslavia to the national socialist empire.\n\nBorn in 1891, he fought in the Serbian army during the First World War; afterwards, he entered politics. In 1931, he was appointed justice minister for all of six months, being forced out after proposing a political system that was too autocratic for even the notoriously authoritarian Alexander I. Afterwards, he founded the pro-German ZBOR only to be met with rejection in 1935 and 1938, forced into a lunatic asylum under not entirely false allegations of 'religious mania', and at last driven into hiding until 1941, when the Axis conquered the Balkans.\n\nWhen the Axis looked for collaborators, only Ljotić met the bill; very few were as enthusiastic, insane or sycophantic enough. A staunch anti-Semite, he proudly advocated the extermination of Jews before even many Nazis did. This combined with his crazed love of Germany, as well as an insane hatred of freemasons, communists, and capitalists, made him the perfect fit for control over the rump portion of Serbia left to native rule... too bad for him, then, that it does not work, and never could have.\n\nThe Serbian regime ruled by ZBOR is universally hated; not even the Church - who liked him for freeing their Patriarch from Dachau - tolerates him anymore. The country is a failed state that makes most basket cases look like Thomas More's Utopia. There is a refugee crisis, caused by Serbs that fled or were expelled by the Ustaše during their rule over Croatia. Various partisan groups - communists and nationalists alike - litter the countryside. Defections occur en masse every day.\n\nYet Ljotić, far from coming up with a solution, keeps ranting on and on just like his German idol. Why self-reflect, after all, when he can just blame the Jews, the liberals, the masons, the communists, and at times even the Pope, the Turks, or the Tsar of Bulgaria for his problems? The only solution to the Ljotić régime is putting it out of its misery. But at this point, it is not a matter of if that will happen but when."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_MUSICKI_DESC: "After the utterly despicable Ljotić, few collaborators are more notorious than Konstantin "Kosta" Mušicki - which makes sense, given among other things that Mušicki was the most prominent ethnic Serb fool enough to try to join the Ustaše despite, well, the Ustaše's well-known leanings.\n\nBut that was not Mušicki's only folly. Having joined ZBOR in 1934, after the assassination of the King, he was stationed in Slavonski Brod when the Axis invaded in 1941. Appointed as a colonel responsible for the Belgrade-Zagreb railroad, he supported not his country but the Germans during the invasion.\n\nAfter the war, Mušicki went to Belgrade, joined the Serbian Volunteer Corps - the German hatchetmen in Serbia - and was made its commander. During his time in that position he of course participated in any amount of brutal reprisals and massacres against civilians, supporting his patrons' aims. Due to that his forces were regarded as the only Serbian forces completely trusted by the Germans during the war.\n\nNow Ljotić is gone, and "Kosta" takes over. But Serbia of the ZBOR remains a failed state, still based upon cruelty, self-hating sycophancy, and corruption. It is still ruled by shameless fools and brutes led by a shameless fool and brute.\n\nThe reality remains the same; only the cosmetics have changed."

 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KALABIC_DESC: "For years and years the leader of the Ravna Gora Movement - colloquially the Chetniks - has waited for an opportunity to drive the Germans and their puppet ZBOR out of his tormented homeland. Now that that has happened, Nikola Kalabić feels his head spin at the shock of seeing something that he feared he would never get to see in his lifetime.\n\nA mere land-registry manager in Valjevo before the War, Kalabić entered service under Draža Mihailović's elite Mountain Guards. When Yugoslavia fell, Kalabić kept fighting, collaborating with both the Axis and the Allies. He was motivated by his abhorrence of leftism to enter agreements with Germany and Italy to fight the Partisans. Despite that, Allied commanders that dealt with him spoke highly of his unit and of Kalabić's authoritative personality and appearance.\n\nYet all that collapsed when Mihailović was suddenly captured and killed; the Chetniks suffered multiple critical defeats before they were able to reorganize under Kalabić's command - though it was all for the better in the end, since Kalabić is now in charge of what little remains of Serbia.\n\nBut the struggle of Nikola Kalabić is far from over. Two decades now he has fought both Germans and Partisans, wanting to free his fatherland against those he deems - rightly or not - to mean harm to it. But to his God, the God of Justice, who has saved the Serbs once more, Nikola Kalabić makes this vow: he will not fail or falter in his efforts until his eyes close forever."

 POLITICS_DOBRICA_COSIC_DESC: "In the aftermath of the Serbian Civil War, it is Dobrica Ćosić who has assumed responsibility for the welfare of the remnants of the Serbian state. Yet if you told a young Ćosić in 1938 or 1939 that this would be his fate he would laugh in your face or refer you to the local sanatorium.\n\nIn that time, the happy time before Yugoslavia was destroyed, Ćosić joined the Communist youth in Negotin. When the Axis came for Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the Communist Partisans and took to his duties with alacrity... until the Soviet Union fell, and the war kept dragging on with no true hope of success.\n\nThen, he began to doubt the validity of both Communism and Yugoslavism. As a result, as he continued to rise through the ranks, he became more a nationalist than a communist. Exploiting the divide between the Italians and Germans - which was leading to the fortification of the Serbo-Croatian border, and dividing the Croatian and Montenegrin partisans from the Serbs and Macedonians - he inspired others that shared his sentiment and developed a sizeable following within the Partisan movement.\n\nAnd now that has reached fruition. The man that could debatably be referred to as the father of modern Serb nationalism now is in charge of his country, for better or for worse - though others may well have something to say about that."

 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_TITO_DESC: "For decades, Josip Broz "Tito" has fought to defeat the fascists and their puppets within Yugoslavia. Even as the Soviet Union fell and the Westerners were prostrated, Tito did not fail or falter - instead he redoubled his efforts. And now, his efforts are rewarded; he and the Partisans have assumed responsibility for Serbia. For the first time in twenty years there is a modicum of hope in the Yugoslavian hell.\n\nBroz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec. Drafted into military service, he became the youngest sergeant-major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time. Captured by the Russians during World War I, he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains; when the Russian Revolution came, he joined in for a year. Upon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered Yugoslavia and joined the Communists. When the Nazis came, he led the Partisans against them throughout the old Kingdom.\n\nThings very nearly went to hell in Croatia in 1963 - Tito narrowly avoided a near-death experience, though he did not emerge uninjured. Fortunately, however, the ZBOR government in Serbia collapsed at that exact moment and his fellow partisans won out. He was taken to Serbia, ushered into the government, and made leader of the People's Republic.\n\nThis is a great opportunity, Tito knows. He will not squander it - no, he will restore hope to his tormented people. He will return freedom to Serbia, nay, to the entire Balkans."
 
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_COPIC_DESC: "Vladimir Ćopić grew up entranced by the stories of Karađorđe and other heroes of Serbian legend who threw off the shackles of the Ottoman Empire, knowing that his lot in life was to be a fighting man. First taking up arms in the Great War, he quickly found himself in the arms of the Russian Red Army, where he was introduced to Communism.\n\nUpon Vladimir's return to his homeland, he joined the Communist Party, traveling to Russia to learn tactics and Spain to fight once again. His warrior spirit gave him a following amongst the Marxists in Yugoslavia, eventually returning home once the Axis invaded and occupied the region to help found the resistance.\n\nHe quickly became a leader of the movement, rallying guerillas to strike at the Germans wherever they were weak. A newborn hero in a land full of villains, his task is no easy one. While no military genius, his natural charisma ensures that those around Ćopić will follow him through hell itself, which is not too far off from the killing fields of Serbia."
 
 POLITICS_DRAGOMIR_JOVANOVIC_DESC: "When one asks a foreigner who is well versed in contemporary Balkan history about those people in Serbia who embraced the Reich, they'd tell them first about Milan Nedić, then about Dragomir Jovanović.\n\nHaving been the chief of Belgrade's police prior to the war, Dragomir Jovanović already found himself with connections within the Reich, something which had allowed him to attain prominence swiftly in the Government of National Salvation. When the German occupation formally began, he was appointed as commander of Belgrade, bolstering its defense and aiding the Germans with whatever they had ever needed help with. Be it dealing with communist guerillas with his Special Police, or assisting in the creation of various camps across Serbia, Germany sought him out time and time again. They loved his reliability, his dedication, and the draconian measures he often employed to eliminate left-leaning resistance forces.\n\nHe has defined himself with those characteristics, and he will continue being just that. Reliable, draconian and dedicated, even if he is comparatively less fanatical about ideology than some of his other contemporaries in the government."
 
 POLITICS_MOMCILO_DUJIC_DESC: "To many, he's the culmination of all that's wrong with the Chetnik movement, a collaborator, a pillager, a rotten person. But to his men, he's the leader that got them back to Belgrade safe and sound.\n\nMomčilo Đujić was born in rural Dalmatia to a relatively wealthy family, where he later became a priest of Orthodox Christianity. The wealth of his family made him influential in the area, and the beginning of his association with the emerging Chetnik movement following the conclusion of the Great War landed him in the town of Knin. In Knin and around it, word was quickly spreading of Đujić's leadership capabilities, where he organized paramilitary formations within the greater framework of the Chetniks. When German tanks rolled through all of Yugoslavia, he moved to the newly formed Independent State of Croatia with his men, where he continued his resistance against the occupiers. Though his resistance was quite minimal, given he and his men were more involved in looting and ravaging the countryside, collaborating with Germans and Italians so they could survive.\n\nAnd it would be correct to assume that Momčilo was rewarded for his actions in the form of his chief's, Draža Mihailović's, assassination by Gorkić's communists following the conclusion of the war, given he had immediately consolidated himself as the new leader of whatever scraps of the Chetnik movement still existed. When the Italo-German split finally occurred, Đujić made for Belgrade, where his gamble had paid off - he and his Chetniks were key to the formation of the now legalized Serbian National Army."
 
 POLITICS_JAKOV_LJOTIC_DESC: "To many in Serbia, the death of Dimitrije Ljotić was nothing to celebrate, knowing who would very likely end up replacing him. And to those same Serbs, the former Prime Minister's spirit lives on through his remaining family, aiding in the most holy crusade against corruption.\n\nJakov Ljotić, the younger brother to Dimitrije Ljotić, is much like his brother. Pious, loyal to Germania, and deeply involved in the mysticism that the two were embroiled in since the early days of the Zbor. Jakov styles himself after fearless crusaders, supported by the Reich itself in his crusade against the satanic influences of communism, liberalism and masonic internationalism. His mission is one given to him by God - with his brother's death, Jakov takes the mantle of leadership, becoming the new spiritual leader of the entire country, guiding it through the muddied waters that Serbia finds itself in. And only through the proper implementation of religious zealotry and National Socialist policies can he ever hope to keep Serbia afloat, to prevent it from drowning into the Judeo-Bolshevik mud, and asphyxiating itself beneath the waves of masonic liberalism. And now, at the most important crossroad in Serbia's collective history, Jakov is ready to forge a path forward."
 
 POLITICS_BORIVOJE_JONIC_DESC: "Serbs have no need for self-deluded ideologues to marshal them, all they need is a patriotic God-fearing policeman, and with Jonić, their call has been answered.\n\nFor a man who led the Serbian gendarmerie since 1942, a role that closely linked him with the Reich, Borivoje Jonić's motivations remained a mystery. His fervent nationalism and zeal in hunting down communist partisans only allowing a glimpse at his true convictions, with his advocacy for the legalization of the Chetnik movement being the only other crack of light into beliefs.\n\nHowever, Jonić's views would be forced into the light by the man himself as the situation of his homeland took unexpected turns. Serbia's recent turmoil turned him into a voice for strong German cooperation, coming to the conclusion that only the Reich could protect his nation from its many enemies.\n\nThe defender of Serbdom now sits as its head of state, spying threats from every corner. Jonić has discarded any lingering remnants of his prior apathy towards the Reich, for he now knows they will deal with Serbia's enemies with the fury they deserve."
 
 POLITICS_BORISLAV_PEKIC_DESC: "An unwavering fighter for freedom and liberalism, Pekić's golden ticket to imbue these values into Serbia has finally arrived.\n\nAlways a skeptic, Borislav Pekić found himself working with the underground resistance since the days of his youth. His moral compass led him to develop a passion for liberal democracy and an unrelenting opposition to the dictators that have oppressed his nation.\n\nThe collaborationist regime came and went as Ćosić's presidency pledged to create a republic that would enshrine the liberal values that Pekić bled for... only to watch it become a twisted parody as his party attempted to entrench itself within Serbian society and eradicate any legitimate opposition to their dominance. The Oil Crisis proved the SPS' ineptitude, allowing him to ride the wave of people power into Serbia's highest office on a program of transformative change.\n\nThe eternal dissident now inherits Ćosić's broken promises of a democratic Serbia as its people look towards Pekić and the newly reformed Democratic Party for hope in these difficult times. His time is now to give his nation the liberty it deserves."

 POLITICS_NIKOLA_MILOSEVIC_DESC: "These years of radicalism have brought Serbdom to their knees, they turn to Milošević to provide them with the stability they cry out for.\n\nFor the longest time, Nikola Milošević was a bystander to the Serbian political scene. His apathy left him isolated from both the German-dominated government and when he eventually joined the resistance, he would only find ennui from the communists that gripped it until they were outmaneuvered by Ćosić's Young Guard.\n\nAs Ćosić's authoritarianism grew, Milošević would reform the Democratic Party of Yore with Borislav Pekić to oust the would-be dictator, leading its more anti-communist right wing. When the SPS fell apart after the Oil Crisis, the Democratic Party would experience a lesser split as Milošević would reject its republicanism in favor of constitutional monarchism while also rejecting the Radicals unwillingness to coalition, creating the Serbian Liberal Party with other like-minded intellectuals.\n\nNow president, Milošević's possibilities seem unlimited as he seeks a radical break from Ćosić's regime, anything from free market policies to a return of King Peter seems to be on the cards..."

 POLITICS_VELJKO_GUBERINA_DESC: "The partisans would have you believe that every Serb took arms against the German occupiers and their cronies, but it would be revisionist to ignore men like Guberina.\n\nThey were far from admirers of the brutal measures taken by it but comforted themselves with the knowledge that these were necessary evils to protect the innocent from Serbia's enemies. Yet the lingering viscera on the walls while walking to work made them question how successful it was at these goals.\n\nVeljko Guberina took this same path to his legal office daily, the resistance's victory did not change much in his life but as his expediency as a lawyer grew, he began to involve himself in Serbia's political landscape. Ćosić's crumbling regime provided ample opportunity for a more capable pair of hands to succeed in protecting Serbdom.\n\nThe silver-tongued orator has unified the disparate national factions under the banner of his Radical Party as the people elect him to their highest office. Patriots soothe themselves listening to his speeches on national unity, others pray that he will not be another Ćosić'."


 ### Ideas ###
 SER_Serbia_Shall_Not_be_Pacified: "Serbia Shall Not Be Pacified"
 SER_Serbia_Shall_Not_be_Pacified_desc: "The Serbian people have fought valiantly against the fascist occupiers and their lapdogs for decades. The Wehrmacht has continually struggled to maintain control over the mountainous and forested heartland of the nation. Instead, the Germans focused on fortifying key positions such as Belgrade, Banat, and the Bor mines. Beyond these few key areas, the vast majority of the countryside has been utterly discarded by the occupiers, effectively presented to the partisans on a silver platter."
 SER_government_of_anything_but_salvation: "Government of Anything But Salvation"
 SER_government_of_anything_but_salvation_desc: "Serbia, or officially the "Government of National Salvation," finds itself in a horrible, and unending decline. Created as a facade for German occupational control during the Second World War, it has been brutally suppressing dissent ever since. Rather than focus on actual nation building, the government instead fanatically pursues the destruction of "Judeo-Bolshevism" and "Freemasonry." Only gaining token concessions from the Germans, the government has done little to build up any legitimacy."
 SER_majka_srbija: "Majka Srbija"
 SER_majka_srbija_desc: "Ever since 1941, the people of Serbia have been degraded and spat upon by various powers. The Ustashe brutally persecuted all Serbs within Croatia's borders, forcing them to flee or die. Italy redrew the borders of Albania, and undertook Albanization programs in Kosovo. Despite oppressing its native Serb population, the Government of National Salvation tries to present itself as the caretaker and protector of all of its people, even if reality contradicts its propaganda."

 SER_National_Liberation_Army: "National Liberation Army"
 SER_National_Liberation_Army_desc: "After decades of low level insurgency, the Serbian partisans have seized their chance to deal a final blow to the German invaders who plagued their homeland since World War Two. Organized in the ranks of the National Liberation Army or NOV, the partisans are numerous, well motivated, and an effective guerrilla force, but are sorely lacking in modern equipment and training."
 SER_SOPO_Terrorism: "SOPO Terrorism"
 SER_SOPO_Terrorism_desc: "A shadowy terrorist organization, SOPO is made up of hardline Serbian nationalists, monarchists and former Chetniks, united by their hatred of the Nazis. While also opposed to the leftist NOV, SOPO have agreed to a truce with the partisans for the duration of the uprising - their terror tactics have proved very useful against the German troops, but their rising influence and power might prove dangerous down the line."
 SER_Generational_Divide: "Generational Divide"
 SER_Generational_Divide_desc: "Under the banners of the NOV, two generations fight together. One is the partisan old guard, loyal to Tito's pan-Yugoslav and communist vision for Serbia - the other is the younger wave of Serb recruits, who grew up during the war and barely remember a unified Yugoslavia. The younger partisans often don't share their elders' commitment to Tito or to Yugoslavia, instead espousing Serbian national sentiment and shunning communist doctrine - as their influence in the movement rapidly rises, it's hard to predict what the future of the partisan movement will be."
 SER_Refugee_Question: "The Refugee Question"
 SER_Refugee_Question_desc: "The numerous Serb refugees from neighboring regions in the Balkans are a vital source of manpower for the National Liberation Army - however, many of them wish to return to their homelands, and our country lacks the economic resources to provide adequate housing and jobs for them all. In the future, it will be necessary to either make arrangements for their repatriation, or integrate them into the Serbian economy."

 SER_Reactionary_Remnants: "Reactionary Remnants"
 SER_Reactionary_Remnants_desc: "Despite the establishment of our socialist republic, there are a few elements in our country that cling on to reactionary sentiments. These dangerous terrorists must be eradicated for the sake of our socialist Yugoslav fatherland!"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth: "Yugoslav Rebirth"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth_desc: "With our country liberated from the fascist occupier, we are ready to set ourselves on the path of reunification with Croatia and Bosnia, and perhaps even more territories of the former Yugoslavia, to create our new socialist federation. However, the problems posed by the clash between pan-Yugoslav ideals and local identities might prove difficult to solve, especially considering all the ethnic violence that took place in collaborator regimes during and after WWII."

 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism: "Resurgent Nationalism"
 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism_desc: "At last, Serbia is finally free. Free from the bootlicking collaborators, free from the Chetniks, and free from the Marxists, who shall never corrupt our ranks again. Under Ćosić's rule, Serbia will finally be able to enter a period of national rebirth, as for the first time in decades, it is led by a person who truly believes in their nation, not just a bootlicker who will sell the country to the highest bidder."
 SER_SPS_Dominance: "SPS Dominance"
 SER_SPS_Dominance_desc: "The first elections in our young republic have resulted in an overwhelming victory of the Socialist Party of Serbia, most likely because there was basically no serious electoral opposition. As long as we are able to maintain the SPS's dominant status in Serbian politics, things will no doubt go smoothly."

 SER_Reichsfestung_Belgrad: "Reichsfestung Belgrad"
 SER_Reichsfestung_Belgrad_desc: "Due to its key strategic importance as a stronghold on the river Danube and as a vital railway junction, the city has been since World War II one of the most fortified strongholds of the Wehrmacht. The German quarters of the city especially are a proper fortress, guarded by the best troops of the garrison against both the Slavic rabble that inhabit the suburbs and the partisan bandits in the countryside. The proud Germanic fortress of Belgrade must not and will not fall, whatever the costs!"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators: "Our Useful Lapdogs"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators_desc: "As much as any proper German despises working with Slavic untermenschen, it is sadly necessary for us to rely on Serbian collaborators to keep the country under control, as neither the Wehrmacht garrison nor the German population has the sufficient numbers to do the job. Organizations such as the Serbian Volunteer Corps and the 1st Belgrade Special Combat Detachment have proven to be reliable and loyal lapdogs, and what they lack in finesse they make up in brutality and devotion to National Socialist ideals."

 SER_Banat_Deutsche_desc: "Initially organized into the Deutsche Volksgruppe in Serbien und Banat or DVSB, the ethnic German minority in Banat immediately became the main pillar of the German administration in Serbia. Their businesses providing the economic backbone of the country and their young men providing the main source of recruits for the garrison, the Banat Germans have since World War Two been organized into a proper Gau of the NSDAP answering directly to Germania."

 SER_The_Crown_In_Exile_desc: "To any outside observer, it would appear that every single Chetnik soldier is a die-hard monarchist, almost slavishly devoted to King Peter and willing to lay down their lives for him. On the ground though, this is rarely true, as two decades of exile have severed most ties between the King and his people. Most of the population concern themselves not with trivialities of the crown, but of more pressing matters such as their daily bread and other concerns."
 SER_Our_Island_Of_Freedom: "Our Island of Freedom"
 SER_Our_Island_Of_Freedom_desc: "Through the valiant efforts of our troops, we have established small liberated zones, areas free from the scourge of bolshevism and fascism. These small patches of freedom have come at a steep cost, however. To liberate even a small part of our country, we have expended the lives of thousands of our bravest soldiers, as well as the dignity of many commanders due to their collaboration. We just have to hope that these sacrifices will give us victory, for if we fail then Serbia will be in chains forevermore."

 SER_Return_Of_The_Kingdom_desc: "At its darkest hour, the nation of Serbia called upon its most loyal sons to take up arms and deliver it from the grasp of evil and so they, the blessed subjects of the most honourable king of the Serbs, rose up to answer its call for liberation from the chains of the occupying filth.\n\nThe spilt blood of cowardly traitors lines the streets and the trumpeting of victors can be heard echoing throughout Serbia, for the men of Ravna Gora have brought triumph. The mighty yet majestic nation of Serbia now stands among the ranks of the freed and the Chetniks that broke its chains now await to see the nation rise once again, under the watchful eye of its brave Suzerain: King Peter."

 SER_Thin_Facade_Of_Constitutionalism_I_desc: "In theory the Kingdom of Serbia is a constitutional monarchy and thus has a constitution. But one shouldn't take the existence of one as a sign that the kingdom is a liberal nation. On the contrary, the reality is that Serbia is ruled by a Chetniks military junta that harshly represses anyone who goes against its autocratic Serbian nationalist ideology.\n\nStudents, partisans, democratic activists have either been disappeared or outright killed.

He was there during the times of King Alexander's dictatorship, when all political movements were banned from the country, including ours. He was there when Serbia was liberated by the Germans, and rose up as a new guide for our people. And while today he is no more, Ljotić will live in the hearts of every patriotic Serbian, and it will be our duty to keep our great teacher's memory alive as we bring peace and order to Serbia."

 SER_The_Fatherland_In_Disarray_desc: "For 30 years, Serbia has seen the worst the world has to offer. First, it was the Germans, marching through Serbia and plundering everything in their wake; then, it was the Volunteer Corps, propped up by their benefactors, allowed to squeeze the populace with a brutal and vice-like grip. The land has been laid to waste, and with it, its people. After all this time, the depths of destruction and despair are familiar to the average Serb.\n\nMothers weep, watching as their children waste away and struggle before their eyes. Fathers must be absent- cleaning up the little left, or enlisted with the broken government organizations available for them to support their families by.

We will strike back, and we will do what we were supposed to do years ago, and that is to crush the very notion of bolshevism in Serbia.

 #serbia.100-104 events (for germany)
 ##serbia.100.d has a slightly different ending for when the full skeleton is added
 serbia.100.t: "Serbia Is Silent"
 serbia.100.d: "The mood of the German High Command had been stormy for the past few days. News of growing instability brewing within Serbia had gotten them riled up - military operations had intensified and the German government sought assurance from the Government of National Salvation that they had the situation under control. Such reassurance was given - although it was spoken through gritted teeth.\n\nIn a matter of days, Germany's faith would have proven to be misplaced. Communications from Belgrade shut down entirely, leaving one great black spot in the middle of the Balkans. If the military had been on edge before, then this had pushed them off entirely. Soon after, a transmission was received from Belgrade.\n\n"NAZI SWINES. SERBIA IS NOW UNDER DIRECT ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY. WE SHALL CEASE ALL CONTACT WITH YOUR REGIME. MAY YOU ALL ROT IN HELL."\n\nThe response was apoplectic. High Command has decided a response to the crisis - to launch a direct attack on this blatant display of Bolshevism." 
 serbia.100.a: "Crush it, without hesitation."
 
 serbia.101.t: "Sentimental Collaborators"
 serbia.101.d: "Following the death of our late, great Führer, many of our colonies and allies were faced with the specter of Communist rebellion. It took many forms in different nations, each one just as insidious as the last. One such rebellion was unfortunately successful in the small nation of Serbia, which under its former leader Dimitrije Ljotic was one of our most stalwart allies in the unstable Balkans.\n\nThe character of the new red regime in Belgrade has been one of utter degeneration. The Serbian people have been placed at the mercy of Jewish commissars and sadistic bandits. These raiders and apparatchiks have undertaken a program of destruction across all of Serbian society, from the churches to the family. Policies upending traditions in favor of Soviet-inspired social experimentation (collectivization, free divorce, etc) were passed with demonic speed. The people themselves are tyrannized with a propaganda apparatus so all-encompassing that many have avowed that Serbs now believe that Germany was undertaking genocide against ethnic Serbians in the Banat region.\n\nLuckily, not everyone has chosen to abide by Red tyranny. Within our territories, countless Serbian patriots have assembled to take their country back. Led by former members of the collaborator government, these detachments have been receiving training to rapidly reclaim their homeland from the Red Hydra. With our help, god willing, they may succeed."
 serbia.101.a: "Belgrade shall be ours once more!"
 
 serbia.102.t: "Enter Borivoje Jonić"
 serbia.102.d: "Fritz Hoffmann worked away in bureaucratic toil at his office while listening to the sweet sounds of Wagner. His office was far away from battle torn lands of Serbia, yet his decisions could see thousands dead, something he took a sick pride in even if he seldom saw the fruits of his labor. Today would be one of those rare days. His underlings had assembled a report on a Serb able enough to rally his compatriots into liberating their land from Judeo-Bolshevik tyranny, someone who will return Serbia to its rightful master. Hoffmann began to thumb through the report.\n\nThis Borivoje Jonić was an old soul who fought in the Balkan Wars, World War One and World War Two, first against and then for the Reich. Jonić would serve as head of the gendarmerie for all rightful Serbian governments, a testament to his value for these administrations, perhaps he would be able to rekindle the popularity of Nedić as a unifying figure for Serbdom.\n\nHoffmann turned the page to gaze at the impressive number of commendations for anti-partisan actions, comments of praise credited him for the efficient extermination of Jews, communists and other undesirables. His adjutants had noted that while Jonić lacks the ideological commitments of Ljotić and others, Serbia's red infestation and Jonić's relentless anti-communist fervor makes him a very willing ally of Germany, Hoffmann could attest to the fact that ideology was less of a factor these days in the Cold War.\n\nThe brown bureaucrat took out a small stamp and after a small moment of extra consideration, marked it as approved. He called on his secretary to have it sent onto the relevant authorities before resting in his chair. Hoffmann would not receive any special awards or commendations for his work but the satisfaction of having played his part in freeing another country from the hands of Judeo-Bolsheviks was enough for him. He thought about how Jonić might govern his country for a moment but dismissed it..."
 serbia.102.a: "...for it would be him ruling Jonić and not the other way around."
 
 serbia.103.t: "Operation Strafgericht II"
 serbia.103.d: "FOR THE FÜHRER'S EYES ONLY\n\nREPORT ON THE ONGOING INTERVENTION IN SERBIA:\n\nSo far, our intervention in Serbia has progressed well in a conventional sense. The Banat region has fallen rapidly to our arms and many oppressed Germans and Serbs have greeted our arrival with great joy. Serbian divisions were no match for us, with most of their direct fighters being easily liquidated or captured. What few standing military forces were in Serbia have been wiped out, leaving the road to Belgrade and beyond wide open.\n\nDespite this, we have noticed some worrying trends that will have to be iterated to the General staff. Firstly, armed resistance began almost immediately after our forces had taken and moved out of a territory, with the legitimate Serbian governing forces being unable to deal with the sudden uprisings effectively. Much of the Serbian countryside in the liberated areas remains in Communist hands. Contributing to this issue is the fact that the majority of the population, even those who do not agree with the Communist policy program are either apathetic or actively hostile. Thirdly, our Serbian allies are not adept at managing the populace, being more focused on personal political projects.\n\nCONTD ON NEXT PAGE"
 serbia.103.a: "Worrying."
 
 GER_invading_SER: "We will intervene in Serbia in two weeks."
 
 serbia.104.t: "Tactics of Survival"
 serbia.104.d: "The sound of cheers punctuated the night, loud and shrill and so infuriatingly genuine it made Bogdan cringe. Belgrade was but a few days from being a smoldering ruin at the hands of the Huns and these dogs were already eagerly rejoicing at their table scraps!\n\nFrom his bedside, Bogdan had been immobile, his wounds unserviceable in any hospital. They were only treated with some bandages by a visiting doctor every so often. He could feel them rotting and could smell the stench of necrosis even when he tried not to. All he could do was sit and listen, awaiting the times when the doctor would change his bedsheets and bandages and tell him the news of the day. Though, he scarcely wished for the latter anymore. All it tended to be was news of hangings, of discovery of his comrades, of yet another friend killed or disappeared.\n\nAlthough, sometimes, Bogdan could hear conversations in the streets or in the hall of his tenement. Tonight Bogdan could hear the sound of a few men jostling around outside his door. His ears perked up and tensed. Perhaps that doctor had finally had enough of him and had turned him in.\n"How was the festival?"\n"We were treated to a hanging tonight. The alcohol made it worthwhile. Someone threw a bottle at a German, he made off soundly. Everyone cheered, I don't think they liked that!" One of the men slurred out.\n"Oh, and the new mayor was going to give a speech but he was shot, I think." Another snickered.\n\nBogdan smirked."
 serbia.104.a: "It wasn't over yet."
