 #Ideas
 CRO_the_partisan_problem:0 "The Partisan Problem"
 CRO_the_partisan_problem_desc:0 "Since 1941, partisans have constantly harangued the Balkan governments set up by the victorious Axis powers. However, they refuse to die, and Tito continues to lead terrorists in a campaign against the legitimate government."
 CRO_legacy_of_the_ustase:0 "Legacy of the Ustaše"
 CRO_legacy_of_the_ustase_desc:0 "The Ustaše never went away. They remain as a powerful political movement, and even worse, they feel betrayed by their Italian masters. It is probable that they are working with our rival, Germany, to work against us."

 CRO_bosnian_autonomy:0 "Bosnian Autonomy"
 CRO_bosnian_autonomy_desc:0 "The Bosnians enjoy significant autonomy within the state. Whilst this may be necessary to keep the peace, it limits the central government's ability to control the population."

 CRO_the_sham_kingdom: "The Sham Kingdom"
 CRO_the_sham_kingdom_desc: "While forced behind Italian heels, many within Croatia; both the new King as well as the people, had hoped for some advancement from their benefactors. Instead, Croatia exists as nothing but a plaything entirely beholden to the whims of Rome, while receiving none of the benefits. We reside in a nation with a reluctant King, an embarrassing legitimacy, and an irrelevant autonomy. Something must be done to rectify this one sided relationship."

 #Leaders
 CRO_Tomislav_II:0 "Tomislav II"
 POLITICS_TOMISLAV_II_DESC:0 "Tomislav II, previously known as Aimone Roberto Margherita Maria Giuseppe Torino di Savoia-Aosta, was inaugurated against his will as the new Croatian King whilst the Second World War consumed Europe. Once a Prince of Italy's royal house, Aimone found himself at the head of a nation which he had no love for - he didn't speak a word of Croatian nor had he even ever been there, as he was picked simply because of his noble blood. Upon being forced into kingship, Aimone soon found that his title was nothing but a farce, a thin disguise for the iron fisted rule of Ante Pavelić, commander of the brutal Ustaše fascist movement.\n\nThe creation of the Kingdom brought further woe upon Croatia, already plagued by the ruthless ethnic and religious violence wrought on the population by the Ustaše, as the destruction of what little was left of the nation's industry during the turmoil caused the collapse of its already weak economy. The only thing resembling good news was that with Pavelić's death in 1959, Italy, now with Ciano at the helm, seized the chance to actively oppose the Ustaše, forcing them underground.\n\nNow, power stays firmly in the hands of a cadre of Italian advisors and military officers, with King Tomislav II being an unwilling farce of King ruling over a broken nation that hates him and the foreign oppression he represents. With dissent in the country reaching unbearable levels, Croatia might very soon reveal itself to be a powder keg sitting right next on Italy's borders - and the fuse is getting shorter by the day."

 #Events
 bosnia.4.t:0 "Bosnian Partisans Affirm Their Loyalty"
 bosnia.4.d:0 "A curious message has reached the desk of Duce Ciano in Rome this morning. It has come at priority speed from the region of Bosnia, a territory of the Kingdom of Croatia. That is to say, it was a territory of the former Kingdom of Croatia. It seems that as the latter of these two entities has fallen victim to a Communist coup, the former has taken the opportunity to declare its independence.\n\nA provisional government in Sarajevo has been established by one Alija Izetbegovic and has claimed control of roughly half of the former Kingdom's territory. Of course, the partisans are under no delusion that Tito will simply allow them to exist within his sphere like a ticking time bomb, and have therefore declared their continued loyalty to the Empire, King Umberto, and Duce Ciano. The tensions with this new Red "Yugoslavia" were already building, but this declaration seems to make war inevitable. Still, it seems better to go into battle with an ally in the enemy's camp than by oneself."
 bosnia.4.a:0 "To our new partners in Bosnia!"

 cropartisans.13.t:0 "Tensions With Croatia Have Boiled Over"
 cropartisans.13.d:0 "The situation with Yugoslavia has become untenable. Despite our best efforts at negotiations and even our most pointed threats it has become clear from the reports our agents have sent us that Yugoslavia will not only refuse to submit to Italian hegemony but is actively planning aggression against the Bosnian partisans under our protection. This cannot be allowed to stand and we have alerted the Regia Escrito along the border to mobilize at once. Our plan is simple, but hopefully effective: we shall use our overwhelming superiority to break through Yugoslavia's lines and capture their major cities, leaving them no choice but to surrender. Our only worry is that the fallout of the breakup of the Triumvirate will prove distracting, but this only hastens our attack."
 cropartisans.13.a:0 "Italy stirs once more."
