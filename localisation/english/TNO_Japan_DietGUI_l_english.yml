#Faction Descriptions

JAP_D_Kidoites_desc:0 "§sKidoites§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Marquis Kido Koichi\n§YExperience:§!\nMinister of Home Affairs, Hiranuma Cabinet\nMinister of Health and Welfare, 1st Konoe Cabinet\nKazoku Member, House of Peers\nLord Keeper of the Privy Seal\n---------------------------------\nWhile the House of Peers is where most Kazoku and Imperial Clan members advocate their interests, many ambitious nobles of the Empire have sought to plant their proxies in the House of Representatives to bypass the constraints of bicameralism.\n\nAmong them is the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Marquis Kido Kōichi. As a masterful politician who controls access to the Emperor, and a trusted confidant of many Kazoku and members of the Imperial Clan, the small marquis behind spectacles has become the chief advocator of aristocratic interest.\nDespite not being a member of the House himself, Kido has won the loyalty from dozens of diet members who wish to curry favor with the aristocrats and, of course, Kido himself."
JAP_D_Reformists_desc:0 "§QReformists§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Takagi Sōkichi\n§YExperience:§!\nCommander, IJN Combined Fleet\nMinister of the Navy, Kido Cabinet\nRepresentative, Kumamoto 1st District\n---------------------------------\nWithin the ranks of Yokusankai, reformist elements had not been prominent until now. With war hero Admiral Takagi Sōkichi's entrance into politics and his announcement to align himself with the reformists, the once lost progressives have suddenly found their champion and reliable support from the Imperial Navy.\n\nFor most prime ministers, gaining reformist support could mean much ease in passing laws, but be sure their help won't come without prices and concessions."

JAP_D_Independents_desc:0 "While Taisei Yokusankai has fortified its de facto position as the sole political party of the Empire through Yokusan Taisei and its diet endorsement system, non-YSK independents still exist among the seats of the diet. Those diet members not endorsed by YSK come from different backgrounds; some are local politicians who have won the hearts and minds of their countrymen, some are ex-YSK members expelled from the party but have not yet faced the challenge of reelection.\n\nWhile they may appear trivial before the combined might of Yokusankai, it would be foolish to overlook their role in politics when YSK is plagued by factionalism and infighting."

JAP_D_Conservatives_Ino_desc:0 "§jConservatives§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Ino Hiroya\n§YExperience:§!\nMinister of Agriculture, 2nd Konoe, 3rd Konoe, and Tojo Cabinets\nRepresentative, Mie 1st District\n---------------------------------\nConservatism has characterized post-war Yokusankai, though things remain to be seen if this shall still be the case. Evident from the faction name, the conservatives seek not to shake the boat too much while implementing piecemeal reforms to make sure the boat stays afloat.\n\nRegardless of which faction assumes control of the premiership, support from the conservatives, one of the most prominent factions of Yokusankai, is nearly a must for any policy to be passed."
JAP_D_Conservatives_Ikeda_desc:0 "§jConservatives§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Ikeda Masanosuke\n§YExperience:§!\nSecretary, Ministry of Justice\nRepresentative, Yamagata 2nd District\n---------------------------------\nConservatism has characterized post-war Yokusankai, though things remain to be seen if this shall still be the case. Evident from the faction name, the conservatives seek not to shake the boat too much while implementing piecemeal reforms to make sure the boat stays afloat.\n\nRegardless of which faction assumes control of the premiership, support from the conservatives, one of the most prominent factions of Yokusankai, is nearly a must for any policy to be passed."
JAP_D_Technocrat_desc:0 "§qTechnocrats§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Kaya Okinori\n§YExperience:§!\nMinister of Finance, Tojo Cabinet\nImperial Nominee Member, House of Peers\n---------------------------------\nTechnocrats like Kaya Okinori set their focus on running the country like a machine. Efficiency and profit in their veins and much of the bureaucracy at their hands, the technocrats are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhile their corporatist inclination is met with caution and even distaste from other factions of YSK, a wise politician must think twice before being on the wrong side of the technocrats."
JAP_D_Technocrats_fukuda_desc:0 "§sModerate Technocrats§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Fukuda Takeo\n§YExperience:§!\nDirector of the Budget Bureau, Ministry of Finance\nAdministrative Vice-Minister, Ministry of Finance\nRepresentative, Yamagata 2nd District\n---------------------------------\nThe moderate faction of the technocrats led by Fukuda Takeo is unique for their flexibility to rally both the conservatives and the reformists in passing their bills. Their liberal financial stance, combined with conservative Japanese values, and further mixed with anti-corruption and emphasis on social welfare, make the Fukudaites the most approachable faction that the Yokusankai has ever seen. However, while the moderate technocrats are much more willing to sit down and talk with other factions than its former self under Kaya, their commitment to the technocratic vision is unwavering as always."
JAP_D_Technocrats_shiina_desc:0 "§jReform Bureaucrats§!\n---------------------------------\n§YLeader:§! Shiina Etsusaburo\n§YExperience:§!\nVice Minister, Manchukuo Ministry of Industry\nDirector of the Mobilization Bureau, Ministry of Armament\nRepresentative, Iwate 2nd District\n---------------------------------\nWith Shiina and Kishi's ascension to power, the once sidelined Reform Bureaucrats have finally emerged as a prominent force within the Diet. Needless to say, their rise is perceived as a threat by both conservative and reformist factions of the Yokusankai; even some of Kaya's most loyal followers distanced themselves from the RBs.\nNow that the RBs have risen to the point where neither Ikeda nor Takagi could pass bills without RB support, unless the conservatives and the reformists are willing to set aside their differences to counter the RBs, Japan's history will change forever at the mercy of the Devil of Shōwa."
