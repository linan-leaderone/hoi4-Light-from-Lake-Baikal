###################################################### CHARACTER DESCS #########################################################

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC: "Originally only a middle-level Soviet statesman, Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky found himself as the only guarantor of democracy, flawed as he is, in a small piece of the former Soviet Union. Being remarkable among his peers for extraordinary talents in the economic science and administrative work, Voznesensky was chosen by the Red Army Stavka on the eve of the West Russian War to oversee the recovery mission in the Komi ASSR. For his service to the Soviet province, Voznesensky acquired a considerable popularity among the people of Komi, who saw him as the benevolent statesman wishing to put the benefit of a common man ahead of the bickering and intrigues between the power-hungry Soviet cliques.\n\nAs the result of endless power plays between the Front and the hardline Communist bureaucrats in Syktyvkar, the now-President of the Komi ASSR Voznesensky remained as the sole figurehead in the Republic who could boast about the public support. Disillusioned with the Orthodox Marxist dogma and remaining bitter about the incompetence and pettiness of the Soviet higher-ups that nearly brought Komi to destruction, he reshaped the political system of the Republic into a representative democracy, where the voice of every man or woman can be heard and will be heard, breaking away with the single-party dictatorship.\n\nAlthough the hard efforts of Voznesensky brought daily bread and a sense of confidence for average Komi citizens, the reputation of Syktyvkar brought many unsavory people to the city who seek nothing but to eliminate the democracy of Komi through her own institutions. But challenges to Voznesensky come not only from the extremists, but also from his fellow democratic politicians, who question the capability of Voznesenky to maintain the Republican values, citing his abrasive and inappropriate behavior for a man of his position and his embarrassing ties to various socialist groups. However, despite the political pressure, Voznesensky is not a person who wants to abandon the system he envisioned without a fight."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC: "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was one of the children of Josif Stalin, a Georgian member of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and one of Nikolai Bukharin's fiercest rivals. Although her father vanished from the historical record during the Great Patriotic War, Svetlana was able to safely survive the chaotic evacuation of Moscow and came to find refuge in Sykvytkar, capital of the fledgling Komi Republic. While her father was infamous in Party circles for being a hardliner and socialist ideologue, his parenting seems to have driven Svetlana in the opposite direction, and she quickly associated herself with Komi's rapidly growing political center. They welcomed her as a stabilizing force in a chaotic political system, and she quickly became a figurehead for the fragile center to rally around.\n\nNow that the political situation in Komi has deteriorated, Stalina has stepped up and decided to take the reins of state herself. Although she has resorted to some rather authoritarian methods to maintain order, she insists that they are temporary measures in the name of stability, and that she will soon fully restore democracy to Komi. Some are skeptical of her claims, but her actions still trend toward the center, and she is a far more pleasing candidate for many than the alternatives."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC: "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has been praised by her supporters as one of the few voices of stability or sanity in Western Russia, and by her enemies as an authoritarian in denial, an opportunist who would take any chance she could to destroy the perceived radicalism she so hates.\n\nWhatever the case, Stalina's success as a politician is as unmatched as her story tragic. Her father, Iosif Stalin, was a Soviet bureaucrat and early supporter of Bukharin, who had died in an industrial accident rumored to be orchestrated on the orders of the Soviet government. In the long period following the death of Stalin, she has lost more and more - her mother, in the Great Patriotic War, her husband, purged by the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and her eldest brother, killed by friendly fire during the collapse of the Front at the end of the West Russian War.\n\nIndeed, Stalina claims that the war is where she first tasted the bite of radicalism, and when she vowed to oppose it at all costs. Stalina's party, the Sovereign Democratic Party, or PSD, gained prominence in the Komi Republic as a big tent comprised of big tents, a place for all who valued a safe and stable Russia over all else. Though Stalina's policies often borrow from left-wing populist principles, it would be most unwise to mistake her for a Marxist, as her father was. The basis for her political stances exists in the principles of "sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism" - the construction of a strong, independent Russia through an assertive foreign policy, heavy support for public welfare, and a strong, modern military.\n\nThrough the democratic process she fought so long to protect, the people have given Stalina their mandate, and the Lady of Steel stands prepared to defend her beloved Motherland from all enemies that may assail it - even if that danger is the unchecked will of the people itself."

 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC: "Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov - a name surrounded by either love or suspicion, depending on how much one actually knows about the man. Zhdanov is one of Komi's key politicians, a proud socialist leader with experience from chairing the Leningrad Communist Party before the Great Patriotic War, Zhdanov ended up entangled with the government of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, serving as an influential figure in an attempt to encourage Russian cultural unity against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the Front fell, and with it, Zhdanov's beloved universal cultural program. When the government fled to Syktyvkar and promptly dissolved, Zhdanov stayed behind, forming ties with Mikhail Suslov in the series of coups and power struggles that preceded the formation of the Republic. Despite his more authoritarian socialist stances in the early days of the Republic, Zhdanov has recently taken to pushing for more libertarian initiatives - democratization of a Komi socialist state, encouraging growth of minority culture, and reconciliation with the center-left. Additional initiatives he has supported include a greater synthesis of universal culture, science, and ideology into a general doctrine of Zhdanovshchina, increasing prioritization towards research into scientific management within the Communist Party, and creating standards for 'revolutionary art'.\n\nStill, paranoia seems to follow him, as persistent rumors push the idea that his true nature is not truly changed, but rather lying deep below the surface, waiting for him to acquire true power."

 #POLITICS_ALEXEI_KOSIGIN_DESC: "An economic mastermind, Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin is one of the many people to have made himself part of the chaotic politics in Komi. Starting as the director of a textile mill, he was a supporter of the Bolshevik cause but only began to climb the hierarchy of the party and its nation-wide bureaucracy a few years before the war. By the time the Great Patriotic War had begun, Kosygin had been noted by the Soviet leadership as a trustworthy Party member and an overall clever individual. During the small time window between the beginning of the German invasion and the complete collapse of the motherland, he played a key role in evacuating industry to the east. His whereabouts following the dissolution of Bukharin's government remained unknown, until years later, when he emerged in the newly formed Komi Republic. There, Kosygin distinguished himself as a brilliant economist, and a vocal proponent of the Center coalition that held the country together.\n\nSoon, he would found the Union of Young Reformers, a party of his own which still allied with President Voznesensky, but clearly followed a separate agenda. Eventually, while the coalition he belonged in held out against radicals, the Young Reformers were able to usurp power from the dominant coalition leader, and now Kosygin has become the new President. Unlike Voznesensky and his absurdly close relation with certain factions of the Left, he has been clear on this issue: there will be no negotiation and no alliances with radicals on either side of the political spectrum, no matter what. The democrats must stand on their own, and create an economic power that can challenge other contenders for the reunification of Russia - Kosygin always being the designer of these ingenious plans for reform. How far these reforms will go remains to be seen."

 POLITICS_IVAN_MOROZOV_DESC: "Not actually that important, since Sakharov is replacing him. Replace this later."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC: "Despite his humble origins, having been born in a rural community near the Volga, Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov has made a name for himself in his homeland. Starting from the Communist Youth, Suslov quickly became a prominent member of the Bolsheviks in Rostov and even managed to entangle himself in the local administration of the Party.\n\nWhen the Germans attacked, Suslov was designated to orchestrate guerrillas in the Caucasus. With the arrival of Wehrmacht forces, he was nowhere to be seen. There were rumours that he continued fighting in the woods, or that he was hanged by the garrison, but these rumours were soon proved false for the people of Arkhangelsk, as the man appeared in the city so far away from his home. Soon, just like when he was young, he entered the political stage of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Climbing up the hierarchy, he became one of the most prominent WRRF politicians, and soon, was granted the prestigious position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the passage of time, Suslov was becoming even more influential and it was believed he could be the next Premier. Then, the West Russian War happened.\n\nAs the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, Suslov found himself in the city of Syktyvkar, along with economic planner Nikolai Voznesensky. Together, they carefully created the Komi Republic, but soon this uneasy pact would end as each side had a different vision for the country. Suslov quickly used his position as leader of the red paramilitaries to gain power and influence, and managed to make himself an integral part of the Republic in political and military affairs, which meant removing him from the equation would not be easy. Having remained a puppet master for a long time, Suslov has finally come out to assume leadership as the Komi Republic has become a socialist state, allowing him to carry out his plan for governing the country."

 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC: "Boris Nikolayevich Ponomaryov has long been the face of the Komi Republic's Socialists, yet he is not its true leader. A relatively unremarkable historian and party functionary in the final years of Bukharin's Soviet Union, by sheer luck, he was able to flee the German invasion. With the collapse of the united Front in West Russia, Ponomaryov had to once again abandon his comfort, and headed to the newly established Komi Republic, a safe haven for political radicals and revolutionaries like him.\n\nIn Syktyvkar, he was able to come in contact with many supporters of the Revolution, those who wanted a return to the ways of old, before the glorious Union fell. As far away as that dream seemed, it still gained the support of Ponomaryov, who was quickly entangled in the webs of the left wing of the Republic. One man who was particularly keen on including him in his machinations was Mikhail Suslov, the "Puppetmaster". By propelling him to prominence in the party, and securing him a position in the National Assembly as well as some degree of power, Suslov could ensure Ponomaryov's loyalty, who was satisfied with what he had.\n\nNow, the socialists have finally made their move, and one of their loyal members has been expectedly assigned the position of General Secretary. As nothing more but a puppet of the men pulling the strings, Ponomaryov lacks real influence, and remains merely a strong figurehead for the government and population, as well as a way for his allies to remain in the shadows. However, he is absolutely content with that."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC: "The story of Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky is as anomalous as his personality and political views. Born to a Russian merchant and Jewish seamstress, Taboritsky was nevertheless a staunch Russian monarchist and earnest anti-Semite from an early age, trying to get rid of the "Cain's seal" inherited from his mother. Becoming an exile in the Weimar Republic following the Russian Civil War, he acquitanced himself with Russian reactionary circles, reinforcing his beliefs and helping to spread the infamous 'Protocols of Zion' in Germany. Along with his long-time friend Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, he assassinated a former Russian Kadet politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov in attempt to bring revenge upon those whom he considered the main instigators of the revolution that ruined the Russian Tsardom. As the NSDAP came to power in Germany, he became one of the most enthusiastic collaborators with the Nazi regime among the White Émigrés, hoping that the German dominance would pave a road for the restoration of monarchy in Russia.\n\nLike others, Taboritsky joined Vladimir in Vyatka, but soon he became displeased with who he claimed was the 'impostor Tsar', sincerely believing that the true Emperor of Russia, Tsarevich Alexei, miraculously survived and will arrive to his subjects should they prove their loyalty to their rightful ruler. Few in Vyatka could share his eccentric beliefs, but soon he found his following in Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nA person too unhinged for his enemies and friends alike, Taboritsky, however, succeeded to outplay them all and emerge as the sole ruler of the city, claiming the title of the Imperial Regent for Tsar Alexei II for himself. Few expect Taboritsky's delusions to come true, but few doubt his rule will be anything but ferocious one, as his zeal is fueled by long-standing hatred for Bolsheviks and anyone who betrayed the Russian Tsar in his darkest hour."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC: "The mask has finally slipped, and the clock now ticks ever forward. Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky, formerly the dark horse of the Passionariyy Organization, has finally secured utter control of the state, and his plans for its future could not be any more disturbing - at least to his many detractors.\n\nOnce again harnessing the talent for oratory that ensured the relevance of his Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire even when, by all accounts, it should have been entirely subsumed by the larger Organization, he has now announced that very restoration. Claiming to rule as regent for the Tsar Alexei II, who he states escaped execution by the Bolsheviks long ago, he routinely issues thunderous appeals to those who value traditionalism and Imperial nostalgia, and couples these appeals with open and extremely virulent anti-Semitism.\n\nTo those supporters, relatively numerous as they may be, it is as if God himself descended, in the form of Taboritsky, from Heaven in order to save the Empire. To everybody else, he is an abject madman, as unstable as he is dangerous, and as opposition coalesces, both within the state and within his own mind, the question is clear:\n\nHow long until the clock strikes midnight?"

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DEAD_DESC: "A deafening silence fills the airwaves. The clock has stopped, its hands frozen in time. No new missives are sent out bearing the personal seal of the Blessed Regent.\n\nYet the brazen gears keep turning, grinding heathen corpses into mulch in the name of a lost child. Blood continues to saturate the soil as the Regent's butchers vivisect the Motherland in search of a cancer that does not exist. Ever more skulls are piled high in the ossuary once known as Russia.\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes. Every soldier and bureaucrat who chose to follow the Regent's bidding continues to do so. Numbering in their millions, each slathered from crown to heels in gore and reeking of poison, they know there is no choice. They know that the Regent and Tsarevich Alexei are watching. Justice knows each of their names and will hold them accountable for failure. Beneath the guns of fanatical overseers, their nightmarish harvest continues. In time, the Lord will reward them for the sacrifice of their humanity, and the Tsarevich himself will clothe them in golden glory.\n\nBut there is no purity left in their wake, only putrefaction and decay. There is no sanctity, only defilement. There is no peace, only the silence of a million mass graves.\n\nAbove all, there is only the cold, dead gaze of a corpse, staring out into an empty room through clouded eyes as rot sets into its withered flesh."

 POLITICS_BURGSYS_COLLAPSE_DESC: "§RRemain calm.\n\nThe Regent endures.\n\nAlexei lives.\n\nThe Holy Russian Empire shall endure.\n\nThere is much to be done.§!"

 POLITICS_LEV_GUMILYOV_DESC: "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov, the only child of famous poets Anna Akhmatova and Nikolay Gumilyov, spent most of his youth being persecuted by the Soviet power for his unreliable ancestry and unorthodox scholarly views. In the years of his exile and wandering across Russia, he thoroughly studied history and ethnography, introducing the concept of passionarity, which postulates that the rise and fall of every historical ethnos is driven by the Passionariyy, the few people who change their environment and society to their vision, driving the history of their people forward. Instead of reducing his discovery to a merely academic matter, he saw that the salvation of Russia lies in the practical application of his theory and fancied himself as the one who will bring the passionarity of the Russian super-ethnos to its maximum heat. Being rejected and ignored by Russian warlords, Gumilyov found his supporters in Komi, among those Russians who felt betrayed and disenfranchised by the Bolsheviks and democrats alike.\n\nGumilyov's deep erudition, amiable personality and impeccable charisma attracted almost every shade of the right-wing in Ust-Sysolsk under his banner, making him the patriarch of the Russian nationalism overnight. The Passionariyy initially were considered an underdog of the Komi politics, however, as Gumilyov proved himself not just as an ardent Russian patriot and charming, if slightly eccentric, ideologue, but also as a ruthless manipulator who does not shun any means to achieve his goals, the right-wing extremism became a force that prevailed over every other political group in Komi.\n\nThough Gumilyov emerged as an indisputable master of Ust-Sysolsk, his ultimate agenda remains unknown to anyone due to his chameleonic and sometimes even opportunistic nature. Whether if he wishes to appeal to the whims of his nationalistic supporters or he decides to pursue his own dream of the Eurasian civilizational empire, the whole Russia stands in waiting of his Scythian advance to bring the dying Western world down."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_BUKHARINA_DESC: "Svetlana Nikolayevna Bukharina was brought up at the very top of Soviet society, being the daughter of General Secretary Nikolai Bukharin. She spent her youth in the Union's best academies, attending galas and cultural exhibitions with the Party's uppermost echelons, and carefully observing her father's debates and political maneuvers. When the Union disintegrated and Bukharin vanished, so did Svetlana. Rumors flew that she had escaped with her father and gone into hiding, gotten "disappeared" by a political rival, or even hiding in a secret bunker complex beneath Moscow. Those rumors were quashed when she eventually resurfaced in Syktyvkar, capital of the (relatively) democratic post-Soviet Komi Republic. But her idle years had not dulled her political edge.\n\nMany in Komi's socialist movement saw that having her as a figurehead would be a massive propaganda coup, and quickly worked to gain her willing support. But they did not anticipate that she would have ambitions of her own. Through careful manipulation and backroom deals, Svetlana was able to build up a powerful support base, and ended up launching an internal coup against the ideologues who once tried to control her. Now that she sits at the top of Komi's political ladder, people wonder - or fear - what her next move will be. Few believe that her vaulting ambition has run out, and many suspect she may soon turn her eye toward the rest of her father's former domain..."

 POLITICS_IVAN_SEROV_DESC: "Ivan Alexandrovich Serov is a man to which the term 'former' has often - and correctly - been applied. Former friend and political ally of Mikhail Suslov. Former supporter of orthodox Bolshevism. And, now, former political contender. For having established firm control over the state as a whole, he is now in a position to determine its future.\n\nThat future is his own vision of the political philosophy of so-called 'Ordosocialism' - an eclectic mixture of far-left socialism and far-right nationalism, and one where Russian exceptionalism, in many fields and areas, is strongly emphasized. Although considered an inherent oxymoron by many, Serov is firmly committed, as least ostensibly, to ensuring its representation within the policies of the state.\n\nThough none can say with certainty what the positions he intends to take will be, it can be reasonably expected that, under the tenets of Ordosocialism, they will include the formation of a strong authoritarian state, a dramatic increase in military expenditures, a rise in revanchist propaganda, and aggressive approaches to territorial expansion."

 POLITICS_IGOR_SHAFAREVICH_DESC: "Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich is many things to many people. Reactionary. Democrat. Reformist. Radical. Anti-Semite. Patriot. But if there's one thing that people do not call him, it is unintelligent. Shafarevich, born to a moderately successful family living in Moscow, was from a young age gifted at mathematics. A remarkable genius for his age, he was enrolled in a university level math course, even entering his final undergraduate year at Moscow University without having finished the 9th grade. His future never seemed brighter, until the German arrived.\n\nForced to flee Moscow, he was evacuated to the east, in Komi, never to see Moscow again. As Russia was consumed in warlordism, Shafarevich became involved in politics in Komi, a rump state carved up after the failure that was the West Russian War. There, he rose up the ranks of the right wing Passionariyy organization, leading the party's moderate faction, much to the chagrin of Gumilyov and his faction.\n\nDeveloping a right wing ideology known as 'Passionate Conservatism', Shafarevich has made himself popular among more reformist rightists in the party, those favoring working within the democratic system. Despite this, he has been accused of fascism, anti-semitism, as his hatred of the 'small nation' (a group of 'anti-national elites' whose values are completely at odds with Russia) echoes that of the hatred of Jews and other minority groups. Now, as leader of Komi, he will fully implement his vision of a better, more stable, order."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC: "Known throughout the Republic as the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Fyodorovich Katushev was, originally, an engineer and industrialist in Gorky, working to administer one of the vast factory complexes there under the purview of General Averin and his brigade of armored raiders.\n\nWith their collapse, and the re-integration of the now-renamed Nizhny Novgorod into the Republic, he quickly entered politics, winning the endorsement of the Young Reformers and election as the region's Governor. A phenomenally skilled organizer, administrator, and perhaps most importantly, orator, Katushev quickly grew to dominate his party, centralizing operations in Nizhny Novgorod and shaping its policies along staunchly liberal lines. He was elected party leader in short order, and soon after stood for President.\n\nOnce again demonstrating his talent as a politician, he led the Reformers to victory, and was elected as President. Now so empowered, he intends absolutely to put his liberal policies into practice, shifting the Reformers - and the country - away from their and its socialist roots, and towards a liberal future he considers far superior."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_YAKOVLEV_DESC: "Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev's career is one marked by remarkable change and evolution. Born to a peasant family in Korolyova, Yakolev's father was a Red Cavalryman during the Civil War and an important leader in the local agricultural commune. Raised in such an environment, at a young age he became an ideological adherent to Marxist-Leninism. Under normal circumstances, he might have even become an important local politician, and maybe even beyond. But the German invasion changed all that.\n\nConscripted in the Red Army, Yakovlev saw how easily Marxist-Leninism fell to the hoards of German soldiers, crushed beneath the tire treads of Panzers, then, after it was all done, shattered into a thousand bickering generals and warlords. Such destruction forced Yakovlev to view socialism through a different, more independent lens - a view that placed human dignity above ideological purity.\n\nOriginally a member of Zhukov's clique in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has adapted well to the Russian Republic, organizing the Arkhangelsk Oblast into a DSNP stronghold. A firm member of his party's left flank, he has made himself famous as an orator of populist values. Now, as President and successor to Voznesensky, he intends to take both the party and the Republic in a different direction, and to ensure, once and for all, that all citizens are happy and free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_DESC: "One of the youngest senior figures within the Ultravisionary faction, Nikolai Semyonovich Kardashev is also perhaps one of the most prominent, inextricably linked with the movement through his development of one of its foundations - the eponymous Kardashev scale.\n\nA method of evaluating the level of technological advancement of a society he, along with everyone else within the faction, ensures that every policy acts to increase it. This, together with his natural administrative abilities and affable personality, allowed him to rapidly advance towards the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nA physicist by education and trade, Kardashev takes his goal of scientific advancement very seriously. Despite this, however, he is not a member of the so-called 'orthodox' wing of the faction, and indeed disagrees with many of their projects and pursuits. Dismissing the many pseudo-scientific pursuits of others towards a nebulous 'superculture,' he instead concentrates upon economic affairs.\n\nThis expresses itself in his tireless advocacy and pursuit of developments supporting what he considers to be true ultravisionary socialism - a fusion economy where science serves the people and permits the creation of a post-scarcity society. Though many scoff at this dream, Kardashev knows it is achievable.\n\nAnd he intends to make sure that it is so realized."

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_CHELOMEI_DESC: "A longtime member of the Ultravisionary faction, Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomei became a household name within the movement through his tireless participation - and enormous success - within the Federation's space program.\n\nTrading on this recognition, as well as his ability to muster support amongst a broad range of influential figures within the Federation, he has been able to rapidly advance his standing, ascending to fill the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nOne of the most prominent members of what could be considered the 'orthodox' wing of the Ultravisionary movement, Chelomei unsurprisingly holds true to many of the core tenets laid down by Zhdanov and other central figures. This includes strong support for initiatives relating to space exploration as well as the ideological concept of the ultravisionary superculture.\n\nIndeed, he believes this to such an extent that he holds it as a simple fact that space is the natural 'next frontier' of the terrestrial Cold War. Securing victory in space, therefore, means securing victory on Earth, and vice versa.\n\nAnd he intends to do everything possible to ensure that the Federation achieves that victory."

 POLITICS_ANDREI_ZHDANOV_ULTRAVIS_DESC: "An Ultravisionary future is within grasp, and Andrei Zhdanov has no intention of allowing it to slip through his, or the state's, fingers.\n\nHaving occupied senior positions in Bukharin's old Soviet Union, the Komi Republic's old Assembly and now, of course, in the position of highest authority within the Federation, Zhdanov is well-accustomed to power, which he has used to advance not only his own cause, but also the cause of the Ultravisionary movement in general.\n\nHe carried it to victory through the chaos of the late Republic. He presented it with a clear path forward. With well-defined objectives that he had meticulously crafted and patiently explained to lesser men. And he had thought his confederates to have supported his view entirely.\n\nBut such was not the case. The rot had set in. Compromise and deviancy had corrupted the agenda, diverting resources and attention from critical projects, scientific and otherwise. The very destiny of the Federation itself was at stake, and as a true visionary, Zhdanov could not remain idle.\n\nRoundly denouncing and taking decisive action against the libertarians and other holders of unorthodox interpretations of the Ultravisionary agenda, Zhdanov has now reasserted his authority over the movement. Now firmly in absolute control, he can turn both his attention and the resources of the state, finally and once again, outwards.\n\nTo the stars - and beyond."

 POLITICS_KPK_PRESIDIUM_DESC: "The collectively supreme body of the Soviet Republic, the Presidium represents a true socialist government as determined by the people, and is now able to exert its authority over the territory of the new state.\n\nComprising representatives from all facets of the Republic's political landscape, including reformists, leftists, pillars of orthodoxy, as well as many more marginal and esoteric factions besides, it is understood, through formal interdiction, that outright factionalism of any type is strictly prohibited. Despite this, however, internal intrigue abounds relentlessly.\n\nInformal coalitions - and the quick establishment and fragmentation of them - are constant as the Republic develops official policy and progresses forward. Though there are many figures of note to name, none can say with certainty which, if any, of them command enough support, overt or otherwise, to shape its general consensus."
 
 POLITICS_FAS_COALITION_DESC: "Hastily organized in the aftermath of radical action, the Passionariyy Society has assumed power within the state in order to protect both it and the people from the destructive forces of unchecked democracy, socialism, and subversion of all types.\n\nA loose affiliation of many rightist groups dedicated to order and progress within Komi, the Society as a whole is nevertheless dominated by the leaders of its most powerful factions - Igor Shafarevich, Lev Gumilyov, Ivan Serov, and Sergey Taboritsky - who act collectively, in committee fashion, to develop and dictate government policy.\n\nThough united in general purpose for now, it is well-understood that this power-sharing arrangement, and even the Society as a whole, is not likely to endure. Each faction possesses very different opinions on the direction of the new state following its stabilization, and it is unknown who, if any, will be able to convince their contemporaries of the superiority of that vision - or if it will need to be imposed by force."

 KOM_the_minutes_of_the_congress_desc: "Another year has passed, and our coalition's Congress has managed to run our Republic as well as they can, given our... unfortunate situation. However, the cracks are beginning to show, and factionalism within the Republic and even our coalition is growing at an incredible rate.\n\nIf we are to continue our custodianship of Komi, and prevent the radicals from taking power, we must act quickly and decisively to put our enemies down."
 KOM_the_last_years_of_the_voznesentsi_desc: "Our ruling coalition is headed by the most left-wing democratic faction - the 'Voznesentsi' under Nikolai Voznesensky. Under their guidance, Komi has seen significant improvement, rebuilding from the bombs, lowering the death toll, and attracting refugees to our towns and cities. However, all is not quite well. Voznesensky's ties to the far left, specifically Andrei Zhdanov, are quite alarming, and a source of constant discomfort among the more conservative members of the coalition.\n\nTime will only tell if the Voznesentsi will be able to keep their position at the head of the party, or if another wing will take their place."
 KOM_speak_with_stalina_desc: "Svetlana Stalina, daughter of the famous Soviet bureaucrat Iosef Stalin, is one of our most valuable assets in crafting effective means of keeping radicalism down. Her plans, though often ruthless and prioritizing effectiveness, are generally excellent, and have proven a good foil to our rivals' constant scheming.\n\nKeeping her loyalty, and opening our party up to more of her influence, is considered by many to be a critical part of keeping our hegemony. Despite several of the more principled democrats' complaints about her alleged authoritarianism, approaching her can surely only help us."
 KOM_our_paramilitaries_reports_desc: "Straight from our paramilitary commander, Petro Grigorenko, comes the latest observations of the eyes of the streets. The previous reports have not given us much confidence in our abilities to control the ever-so-important avenues and roadways of the Komi Republic, and this report is no different.\n\nMore and more, the paramilitaries under the control of Suslov and Gumilyov march onto the streets, controlling warehouses, voting stations, and even entire neighborhoods of Syktyvkar, while our forces falter and shrivel in both their control of democratic-aligned districts and the ability to defend what we have left. We must do something about this now, before the average citizen of Komi cannot turn his or her eye without seeing radicals damaging our democracy."
 KOM_the_government_in_check_desc: "Nothing in our government has been spared from danger, in one way or another. While we have essentially twiddled our thumbs, both the left and the right have plotted, calculated, and made their moves - with no counterattack from us.\n\nWe are essentially a king with two rooks flanking it. There are only a few moves we are allowed to make, and we must make the right one - lest a mistake is made, and our game is over. The plans to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi must be observed and changed with haste. The fate of the Republic depends on it."
 KOM_eyes_to_the_left_desc: "While Gumilyov is a small pest in the byzantine game of Komi politics, a far greater threat must be dealt with: the radical leftists, led by the puppetmaster Suslov and his cronies. With the streets becoming ever more occupied by his paramilitaries, and his poll numbers showing a gradual increase, the emergency to deal with is on this side of the political spectrum.\n\nTo counter this, we must become the Suslov of democracy. No minion of the Communist Party shall be spared from the watchful eyes of our government, and soon, the plotting leaders of the far left shall have to contend with our plans to take them down."
 KOM_observe_leftist_paramilitaries_desc: "In our nation, marching paramilitaries down the street may as well be our way of greeting each other. The paramilitary is the lifeblood and invisible hand of every party, including ours, and every plotter with a bit of sense knows it.\n\nBecause of the status and importance of the paramilitary in our Republic, simply watching what their thugs do and say will grant us access to valuable information regarding their plans. Through agents and citizen observations, we can figure out when and where the enemy is - from hour to hour."
 KOM_the_spreading_red_influence_desc: "From the mundane restaurant conversations to the poll booths, talks and areas begin to take on a shade of red and gold, hammer and sickle. Those who speak of them in a positive light are no longer far-leftists, but slowly, also ordinary citizens.\n\nThe dissemination of communistic and socialistic propaganda must be halted through our paramilitaries, and our own information for the citizens will replace it. Polling booths will become more guarded, and suspected citizens shall be checked for any left-wing activities. We shall stop their efforts here."
 KOM_the_strike_from_the_right_desc: "Even if they are helping us defeat the leftist threat, it seems the situation on the right has not developed to our advantage.\n\nWhile we have been dealing with the communist threat, it seems the fascists have taken advantage of this opportunity to expand their influence and scope. Much like the left, talks of new graffiti, voter intimidation, and paramilitary assaults from Gumilyov have spread throughout our political sphere, and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon. A meeting must be called, and a plan to deal with this new threat must be drafted and carried out."
 KOM_a_new_face_question_desc: "Apparently, due to our efforts to crack the left, a split in their party has developed. While this is good for us, very much so, a conundrum has appeared: we do not know who exactly is splitting from the Communists.\n\nThe person has already gained much influence in the party - that much is already known. Said person also was, reportedly, once a lieutenant of Suslov, but has broken away on his (or her) own accord. And whoever this person is now wields much power on the left. Anything about this new leader is derived from those three tidbits of information, and that is all. We must try to find out who this new contender in the political game of Komi is, and quickly - before this new splinter of the left moves to attack."
 KOM_eyes_straight_ahead_desc: "While it might seem tempting to classify one side or the other as the "greater evil", our belief is that both sides are a dangerous force to democracy, and that dealing with one side will only strengthen the other.\n\nThe true solution is not to attack others, but to defend ourselves. Democracy can, and will work - all that is needed is the will of our government to fix the problems that are afflicted on us, and the will of the people to resist radical aggression. Stimulating both of these things will help us tremendously in our survival, and allow the Republic to continue existing for the people."
 KOM_distance_from_zhdanov_desc: "A source of uneasiness among our government is regarding our leader, Comrade Voznesensky, and rumors surrounding his connections. Allegedly, Voznesensky has ties with the far-left Andrei Zhdanov, even a friendship on the personal level.\n\nEven though we believe these rumors are a Suslovite plot to divide us, they are still deeply concerning, and of course, rumors come from somewhere. Just in case, it is best to implore Comrade Voznesnesky to cut any ties with Zhdanov, and to distance ourselves from any of his parties and actions in general."
 KOM_reinforce_the_center_desc: ""Remember, comrades, that the Republic's hopes do not lie in the evil lies of the radicals. Such falsities are there to lure those of us who may not be confident in our governing, to snare them and to brainwash our citizens to serve the aims of the radicals! The solution to these lies is to hold out. No more citizens shall be lost to Suslov or Gumilyov!"\n\nStalina's speech to the legislators outlined our plan to combat the radicals. The center must hold, and to do so, we must muster every effort we can to preserve it and stop others from falling into the hands of the far-left or far-right."
 KOM_the_face_of_the_movement_desc: "Svetlana Stalina: asset, orator, fighter.\n\nStalina has in recent times become ever-more important to maintaining the flame of the Republic, and has quickly risen in publicity and fame to the citizens of Komi. An avid anti-revolutionary, her speeches and actions directly confront the threat of the enemies in Syktyvkar and beyond, driving many to our democratic ideology. Now, we will need her more than ever, to stamp the radicals out."
 KOM_let_them_burn_themselves_out_desc: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, is how the saying supposedly goes. Of course, they are not actually our friends, so to speak, but they are very useful tools for cementing our Republic.\n\nThe left wing and the right wing hate democracy, this is true, but to them, there's something even worse than that, that they declare their mortal enemy to combat at all times: each other. Even now, their paramilitaries battle in the streets, looking to obtain ideological supremacy throughout Syktyvkar and the Republic. Of course, once the 'winning' side of these battles are depleted... they won't even bother to put up a fight against us."
 KOM_eyes_to_the_right_desc: "Shadows lie in wait throughout our Republic. Their darkness hides under the surface of Syktyvkar, waiting, biding their time, plotting to strike.\n\nThese shadows belong to none other than Lev Gumilyov, united leader of Komi's right wing paramilitaries, and possibly some politicians. While the left can be negotiated with, the plots of Gumilyov will not stop until our downfall. We must focus on the right, and bring them down - starting by listening with our eyes and ears."
 KOM_armed_activities_desc: "Right-wing paramilitaries in Komi are well-known for showing little restraint in their intentions and armament. Through the streets, they march with pipes, daggers, and even pistols and rifles in order to intimidate anyone who would be willing to speak out or confront them.\n\nHowever, there is a method to Gumilyov's madness. By keeping track of patterns, noting down locations, and documenting actions, it is possible to obtain information that Gumilyov may not want us to know about - all the better for us."
 KOM_the_extent_of_the_shadow_desc: "While Gumilyov is agreed among our government to be the general leader of the far-right, we have not been able to agree on much else. Gumilyov's specialty is distorting and hiding his connections and ties, which sometimes makes it near-impossible to determine how much of his influence is present within our Republic and its institutions. To defeat Gumilyov, we must first reveal where Gumilyov hides. Through our observations and research, the puppetmaster of the right shall finally have his agents brought to light."
 KOM_the_strike_from_the_left_desc: "Crudely sprayed red stars on alleyway walls. Red and gold flags waved in the air and hung from neighborhood houses, if only for a little time. The hills have eyes, the walls have ears - and the body parts are all from Suslov.\n\nSince our campaign against Gumilyov and the right began, a surge in communist activity has been present throughout the streets of Komi. Taking the opportunity and striking our blindspots, they have begun their own campaign against the right, looking to finish them off for good. While this is ostensibly good for us, the left will have a new target when Gumilyov is gone for good: us. We must make preparations and plans for this scenario, before we are caught off guard by a powerful, and influential, red army."
 KOM_believe_in_svetlana_desc: "Perhaps one of the only politicians that may be able to crush Gumilyov, Svetlana Stalina is one of our most important assets in the battle against the radicals. Not only do her speeches inspire our politicians, but also motivates our supporters, making them even more willing to fight for their country.\n\nSvetlana is the way forward, and if we are to crush the right (and the left) and bring order to Komi, she must carry the torch of democracy and the flame of the will of the people - of which we have full confidence in her. It is up to us to follow her examples, and stabilize the Republic for good."
 KOM_the_interlude_desc: "It seems, if only for a temporary period of time, that things have finally calmed down again. The plotters have retreated out of the public eye, most likely so that they can continue plotting in the dark. The streets have become tranquil, and the legislative sessions are less and less chaotic.\n\nThere is, however, a reason for this calm. Soon, democracy will once again be tested in elections throughout the Komi Republic. Each and every faction that wishes to see their leader in power now must plan and consolidate, calculating public support and paramilitary control of areas. The time of movement has ended. The time of strategizing has begun."

However, even with the ruling coalition's dominance of the National Assembly, its passage is not entirely guaranteed. Historically, compromise has been necessary to pass budgets, as every party within the coalition has different ideas on what should be funded.\n\nThe budget, thusly, has become an exercise in pork-barrel spending, with Deputies given appropriations for pet projects to keep them loyal. With the increasing unpopularity of President Voznesensky, however, the National Assembly could, possibly, not be quelled by the usual tricks. Numerous advisors and allies to the President have hinted to him that the usual methods of getting the government on his side will be much less effective during this term, and additional means may be necessary to ensure that the Republic gets what it needs in terms of funding."
 KOM_bill_the_infrastructure_repair_bill_desc: "While the Republic has a department of transportation that handles repairs to infrastructure and replacements to damaged watercraft and transport vehicles, the department has constantly delivered complaints about how its funding is insufficient to deal with every issue that it currently faces. A new bill has been proposed to the National Assembly to pass through a special appropriation for the department of transportation, which is to be dedicated specifically to providing aid to their infrastructure repair division.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the bill are undecided, specifically, labor laws and the exact source for the funds which are to be dedicated. These matters must be decided on in the National Assembly before the bill is to pass."
 KOM_bill_the_mandated_minority_representation_bill_desc: "There lies a deeply concerning trend throughout our Republic of inequality in the National Assembly. The majority of the Deputies are Russian, with an extreme minority of the National Assembly made up of the peoples that the Republic bears the name of - the Komi. The proposed bill, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina's PSD, makes a stand for a certain quota of minority representation, with new districts drawn to ensure more minorities are sent to the National Assembly, and the rich cultures of the Komi can be protected from a lack of representation.\n\nUnusually, Stalina and the Left have aligned on this matter, with a large contingent of the Voznesentsi, the PSD, and the Communists supporting this measure. The fate of the bill seems to rest on the groups that can be rallied to support or oppose it - a more moderate bill could gain the support of more of the center, who are concerned about the political ramifications of mandated representation, and marginalize the left."
 KOM_bill_the_defense_of_the_republic_bill_desc: "The Komi Republican Army is a formidable force in the Russian wastes, but has its own set of problems - namely, its small size. Due to our small population and necessarily inefficient census system, the Army doesn't get quite as much manpower as it needs from our current conscription policies. Several solutions have been raised in the National Assembly to address this issue and defend the Republic from hostile neighbors.\n\nWhile the official line of the ruling coalition is to increase the conscription period from one to two years, the Left has proposed an addendum - a loosening of the laws that ban certain people from volunteering for military service, due to participation in certain political organizations. While this is a drastic measure, it could assist the Republic in getting the manpower it needs. The solution, as always, will be decided in the National Assembly."
 KOM_bill_the_equal_zoning_bill_desc: "Redistricting is a concern that has long affected many elements within our Republic, from the disenfranchised refugees on the peripheries of our cities, to the politicians attempting to organize their re-elections. The process is infamously arduous within Komi and Syktyvkar specifically, thanks to the bombings and high volume of population transfers thanks to refugees and our lack of resources to run accurate censuses.\n\nThis, naturally, has lead to an environment in which more or less any sort of population distribution can be constructed and made to look official, without cooking the books too much. Behind the curtain, the President has spoken to several Deputies on the redistricting board - giving a favor to certain politicians to make them unassailable in their districts could be just the 'incentive' they need to throw more of their support behind the government's initiatives."
 KOM_bill_the_municipal_pacification_bill_desc: "The paramilitary situation has been said to be getting completely uncontrollable, with a general uptick in overall violence over time. Several politicians in the National Assembly, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina and Ivan Morozov, leaders of the democratic centre, have proposed a rather drastic bill, one that has been said to increase police powers within 'problem areas' of the Republic to levels not seen since the days of Bukharin. While many politicians in the National Assembly have railed against the bill, calling it a tyrannical government overreach, and a naked attempt at shutting down political opposition to the current ruling parties, one can also argue that this opposition is just an attempt to prevent these politicians' illicit sources of assistance from being persecuted. Whether they like it or not, the bill will come up to vote, and it will all come down to the democratic process."

 KOM_the_1963_assembly_tt: "We will §Ychoose the official center candidate§! for the 1963 elections."
 
 KOM_the_1963_assembly_desc: "The time has come. Every five years, a new President is elected, and every two years, a new National Assembly. This election is no different than every other election: a high-stakes contest where each candidate for the head of the house campaigns to control the Republic, and everything valuable within.\n\nAs per tradition, it is now time to choose our candidate for figurehead of the democratic coalition. Each of the three candidates - Voznesensky, Morozov, and Stalina - will express their positions and why, exactly, they deserve to be the leader of the democrats - and the people. After, we will select a Presidential candidate, who, hopefully, will be the best choice for our nation."
 KOM_election_day_preparations_desc: "An election is not something that can be organized on the spot, even if the radicals believe otherwise. We must now begin the process of readying the poll booths, sending out fliers, organizing locations, and more of the standard procedure that bores our legislators to no end.\n\nAs usual, we will call up ready volunteers to do their duty to democracy, and do these tasks for us. And in all of this, of course, we must also be aware of the radicals, for their idea of 'preparations' is something much more sinister..."
 KOM_ensure_internal_stability_desc: "In recent days, it has been reported that our party is a "mess" in certain areas, such as the fact that debates over sometimes trivial things can run hot and wild between our Deputies, as well as growing factionalism and refusal of cooperation between party members. While, normally, this has been allowed under the perpetrator's defense of "freedom of opinion and expression", the upcoming election is one of the most critical in our history, and the democratic party cannot permit these problems any longer.\n\nThrough distinct methods, we will ensure that everyone sits down and shuts up - united as one party. No longer shall the chamber erupt into argument every other speech, and no longer shall we tolerate the cracks between our wings. We will be as one, together - we must be, for the radicals shall come as one as well."
 KOM_calculate_the_bombing_intervals_desc: "Each and every week brings hellish armageddon down upon our lands, as the Nazi bastards rain down their bombs upon the people of Russia. New orphans are created every day, and hospitals always fill to the brim for days after - especially Tuesdays, for that's when they all come.\n\nThe Germans are as predictable as they are evil. It is no coincidence that the bombs always rain down at specific times and more on certain days than others, that their Wehrmacht seeks to enjoy the coffee breaks at their designated hours and days and not any other. They will not stop our "little" democracy. All it takes is a little calculation, and any interruption of the election will no longer come from the air."
 KOM_protect_the_people_desc: "A person should always feel safe in their own home - whether from the inside or out. While they do not dare touch our cities, bandits and thugs have been known to roam the countryside, seeking to rob and maim to their heart's content. In addition, the German bombings have been a constant source of casualties, blasting apart anyone that is unfortunate enough to be near their dastardly weapons.\n\nPeople cannot vote if they are busy with other things, such as surviving. Therefore, we must embark on a program to cleanse the bandits from our countryside, guard our borders from any foreign incursions, and defend ourselves from the air raids. Only then shall democracy flourish."
 KOM_watch_the_radicals_desc: "The radicals have never believed in the democratic process, even if they say otherwise. While they have been rather quiet in the days leading up to the election, it is always possible they may come out of the shadows at any time. The chessmasters on either side still have aces up their sleeves, and there is no telling exactly what they have in store.\n\nObservation of the paramilitaries are necessary, and any left-wing or right-wing activity will be snuffed out and found. If they have any "funny tricks" they wish to play, we will know - and we will fight back."
 KOM_something_wicked_this_way_comes_desc: "Months of rigorous preparation. Days of campaigning. Enjoy it or dread it, participate in it or flee from it - the election comes all the same.\n\nNow comes the trial of democracy, and the ruling with it. Each and every preparation that we have done for this event will now either pay off or let us down. This critical election decides our fate, and the future. Some doubt our chances, and others wish us dead, but no matter what happens - democracy will always prevail in the end."

 KOM_SMR_election_the_morozov_presidency_desc: "With great relief, we have achieved victory! Our coalition has been triumphant in the turbulent recent elections and all under the Union of Young Reformers. The success in the election represents both the continued support and strength of democracy in our glorious republic, as well as a slight rightward shift as Voznesensky steps down.\n\nThe government we represent is one of progress for Russia. Liberal to its core, Komi will be a truly western country, perhaps someday possessing ties with countries like the United States. Modernization, equal opportunity, and stability are all goals of our party and will steer the direction we take Komi. Someday we may even reach socialism through these targets, although that is for the far future, past the concern of Morozov himself."
 KOM_SMR_election_democratic_redemption_desc: "As much as we praise the democratic system our dear Komi was built on, it is far from perfect. Under it, extremists circle the edges of our system, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and tear apart the state. In its place, they wish to replace it with one built on their disgusting ideologies, destroying the democratic institutions that originally brought them to power. While these flaws are tragic, they are not beyond fixing.\n\nA redemption of the system will be pursued, patching its holes and replacing them with something truly functional. No longer will parties like the KPK and RNP have the same kind of hold on politics that they do know, as the loopholes and tactics that gave them their power are destroyed in the name of justice and stability."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_stalina_commission_desc: "While we are not always proud to admit it, our current government is built on a coalition with two other parties, the DSNP and PSD. We might not agree on everything, but we are all united in the principles of democracy, and a shared disliking of extremists. The PSD is especially hostile to the fringe groups, possessing a passionate hatred for anything that could pose a threat to the republic.\n\nAs part of our efforts to stomp down on the extremist threat, we will appoint deputy Svetlana Stalina of the PSD to the position of Minister of Justice in the National Assembly. Our government will fully back her in eradicating the paramilitary units controlled by the other parties. With someone as passionate as her, we can be sure to expect nothing less than success."
 KOM_SMR_election_sever_the_crime_rings_desc: "One of the ways the radicals in Komi have gained so much power is through a system of crime and corruption. This rot infects every aspect of society. They run protection rackets, threatening good people in exchange for political support, while simultaneously rigging votes. At the same time, illegal funding fills their pockets, securing them platforms and influence they never deserved.\n\nCracking down on these unwanted hooligans is now our government's top priority. Traitorous police officers will be purged, and these violent crime outfits broke with an iron fist. Our people must be protected from the outlets of corruption. Without their sources of power, the extremists will begin to lose their power, securing our democracy from them forevermore."
 KOM_SMR_election_an_offensive_of_our_own_desc: "The government of Komi has always had an unfortunate and mostly passive position with its radical elements. Intervention only occurred if these fanatics attacked civil targets. At most extremist groups would be infiltrated and played off each other, but otherwise left to fester and mutate into the danger they are now.\n\nOur government will not be like the others of old. A more direct response will be undertaken to break the extremists once and for all. Raids and arrests will be undertaken by our government, alongside our paramilitaries to finally exterminate the radical violence once and for all. No longer will inaction be done in the name of stability, but action done to secure stability and safety."
 KOM_SMR_election_uncover_their_liabilities_desc: "Despite their wickedness, the radicals of Komi have their foothold in the National Assembly. Even if we straightened out the system, these corrupt politicians would still provide the extremists with a source of power to rebuild and spread their disgusting ideology. Limiting their government influence then becomes invaluable in defeating them.\n\nSmear campaigns to expose how truly disgusting these individuals are will help limit their public support. Likewise, exposing the connections in the KPK and RNP deputies to illegal activity would make impeaching them directly possible and justifiable. Similarly, blackmailing and harassment to get the more relatively moderate members in line would be effective."
 KOM_SMR_election_we_shall_ask_no_longer_desc: "Past governments have been far too nice in how they approach radicals. Their prior strategy has been to kindly ask anti-democratic forces to act a little more civilly and act in manners that go against what they seek to achieve, like some frail old babushka. This old strategy has been catastrophic, leaving us with a mess most republics would find fantastical.\n\nUnfortunately for these extremists, we are not like our predecessors. The SMR will not tolerate their actions anymore. We will ask no more and instead threaten them into a corner, lest they face unholy retribution by our righteous will if they get out of line. They will be crushed once and for all, and our democracy will be finally secured."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_road_forwards_desc: "Development has been a key aspect of the SMR's platform for as long as it has existed. To us, the movement towards the state's growth is vital to the future of the Republic and its values which we recognize as the most important. Whether it is economic or social, this forward evolution of society is critical.\n\nKeeping an eye directly on this issue is of immediate importance now that we are in power. Our optimism knows no bounds but looking at how some of this progress can be made immediately is of particular pragmatic value."
 KOM_SMR_election_encourage_a_qualified_citizenry_desc: "Economic development is the most important policy of any government, and ours is no exception. For too long has ignorance of crucial sectors been allowed to proliferate and our economy falters as a result.\n\nMorozov is done tolerating this industrial neglect. Funding a more innovative industry will be a key part of our economic budget for the year. Likewise, our citizenry will finally have the tools necessary to obtain and operate more complex industrial jobs, as we start up a series of job training programs. Soon Komi will be a truly economically prosperous society, sure to provide the state and its citizens with plenty of money and production capacity for what is ahead."
 KOM_SMR_election_ignorance_nevermore_desc: "While the Republic of Komi has always had an education system, its quality has been subpar for most children and citizens. A good portion of our population is still illiterate and gullible to deception. Meanwhile, the information children are taught is mixed with lies and even political propaganda more than we are comfortable with.\n\nFor our Republic to advance on a societal level then, fixing these faults is crucial. Expanding our outreach to those outside of the cities, and opening night classes for our less fortunate that are older will help tremendously. Similarly, altering the curriculum to focus on critical thinking will help create a citizenry that is both adaptable and likely to succeed later in life."
 KOM_SMR_election_streamline_public_assistance_desc: "Administrative efficiency is a desirable aspect of any state, and our glorious Republic is no exception. Unfortunately for us, we lack this highly prized characteristic in some parts of the government. One of the most atrocious examples of this is our social welfare system. In the past, the solution has been to throw more money at people, without considering the actual material situation people are in.\n\nNo longer though, as we move to streamline the process. The bureaucratic efficiency will be improved so that we waste fewer government resources on the system as we focus efforts on who needs the help."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "As time passes, it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore the danger in the air. Raiding becomes increasingly frequent and our neighbors ever so more organized. It will not be much longer before the full-out Smuta erupts and states try to reunify our region of Russia.\n\nTo make sure we do not fall behind we will pass the National Reclamation Act through the National Assembly. Through it, we will issue various funding and legal allowances to be diverted to the military and diplomatic corps in the effort to unify Russia. Given the consensus on the issue, we can expect support from the other parties, something that will be a relief for Morozov with the guaranteed difficulties ahead."
 KOM_SMR_election_a_managerial_outline_desc: "A key aspect of any war is logistics and the ability for us to keep our troops supplied and fed. With Smuta on the horizon, this is more important now than ever. The fundamental ideology of the SMR has been that a strong managerial state guiding a privately-owned economy is one that works best.\n\nThis same philosophy will guide our wartime production as we prepare. State control of industry will be expanded, with government mandates and production boards ensuring everything we need for war is produced. Some of the Republic's elites may grumble and our efficiency less than optimal, but we can take no chances when it comes to war."
 KOM_SMR_election_inspiration_for_development_desc: "The clouds of war draw ever nearer and with it the concerns of running said war. One of the most crucial ingredients of military success is a sound logistical situation. Our industry needs to be thought of to ensure the security of our material needs. While a steady control by the state would be ideal given the SMR's platform, efficiency needs to be prioritized over want.\n\nAs such, the government will cut deals and make compromises with the current elite industrial magnates to reach this efficiency. In exchange for cooperation and supplies, the state will provide generous funding to these private industries. This will have a cost on the state, but it is a fair deal."
 KOM_SMR_election_into_modernity_desc: "After much work, we have finally managed to extinguish the flames left over from the election. The threat of extremists has been eradicated, and the preparations for war made. For the first time in forever, a calm permeates our Republic. However, the fire is about to be replaced with a conflagration as a new Smuta engulfs the entirety of western Russia.\n\nIt would be better for the SMR to start this one than to get caught up in it, and as such, it is time for us to begin to re-unify Russia ourselves. Finally, the hopes of the SMR will see meaningful success. The ideas we fight for freedom, modernity, and democracy will soon be spread across the entire region by our hands."

 KOM_DSNP_election_the_voznesensky_presidency_desc: "Despite numerous scandals, waning approval ratings, and the near-collapse of our very republic, President Nikolai Voznesensky of the DSNP has emerged as the clear winner in the recent election, securing yet another term with which to advance his mandate. The status quo has survived, and with it comes many questions. Could this be a sign that the dark clouds that hang over our democracy are finally passing, or could it be a grim omen of things to come?\n\nWhichever it may be, the President will need to maneuver carefully to ensure that the chaos of the past year does not come back to haunt our democracy again..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_democratic_preservation_desc: "Our young democracy has withstood perhaps its greatest test of all. The creeping influence of extremism had worked its way into the bloodstream of Syktyvkar, igniting all manner of political violence across the streets. Yet, in spite of it all, the people remained steadfast, and their votes allowed democratic institutions to live on, if only for a bit longer.\n\nPresident Voznesensky and the DSNP have now made it their goal to enshrine the preservation of democracy at any cost, and to correct the mistakes of the past. Extremism only thrives when the people lose confidence in their leaders, and become apathetic about their votes. For the sake of lasting stability, a persistent trust in democratic ideals must be fostered; one that does not come through a cycle of violent repression."
 KOM_DSNP_election_formalize_the_unwritten_rules_desc: "In years past, the political organizations of Komi operated under a set of "unwritten rules", that, essentially, served as the terms and conditions of the great game that is our political system. Under these unspoken laws, parties were free to do whatever actions they deemed necessary, legal or not, as long as they remained within their circles and did not bring direct harm to their political rivals.\n\nThough some may criticize this system as deeply corrupt and turning a blind eye to extremism, it is the last vestige of civility our democracy truly has. In fact, the chaos of the past came only when extremist groups increasingly came to ignore the rules of the game, not because of the rules themselves! Therefore, the President has seen fit to codify these rules into law, greatly expanding the power of parties to govern their own affairs and loosening restrictions on political expression. Hopefully, with the so-called "unwritten rules" no longer a nebulous concept, our rivals can see this as a gesture of goodwill and finally learn to respect our institutions.\n\nHopefully..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_equalize_the_system_desc: "Although the Komi Republic prides itself on being one of the last vestiges of true democracy in all of Russia, its system is nothing if not flawed. In fact, you could say it is laughably corrupt beyond any measure of reason. The formerly unwritten rules are now the law of the land, and to ensure this legislation does not immediately blow up in our faces, some new boundaries will need to be set.\n\nFrom now on, each and every party, no matter their beliefs, will operate on a level playing field. Through the redrawing of districts and the measured defanging of paramilitary forces, none will be afforded more influence and power than the other. With the proper checks and balances in place, it is our belief that a more healthy, but no less diverse political environment can come into fruition."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_limits_of_tolerance_desc: "Although the Komi Republic prides itself on having a wonderfully diverse political environment, the chaos of the last election has taught us many hard lessons about what happens when extremists are given the same platforms as honest, democratic organizations. Under the so-called "unwritten rules", bad-faith actors were afforded far more influence than they reasonably should have, and it almost resulted in the collapse of democracy itself. If we have learned anything at all, this cannot be allowed to happen again.\n\nIt is time for a harsh reminder to all that our republic will not tolerate those who seek to dismantle its hard-fought freedom by cynically abusing its institutions. Political parties must be made to wholly uphold democratic values, or they can forget about being allowed to participate in the system."
 KOM_DSNP_election_divestments_and_smokescreens_desc: "Needless to say, money and politics go together like oil and water. While it's only natural that one has to grease the wheels from time to time, financial interests are where almost all the corruption that plagues the Republic is born from. Some political organizations have tied themselves to local businesses through investments, trading political favors for kickbacks from their benefactors, and compromising the integrity of their elected officials. It is time to crack down on this nonsense.\n\nWith all parties forced to divest from private businesses in the Republic, we can hopefully begin to regain stronger financial control over the political sphere, and cut down on blatant conflicts of interest within the assembly. After all, leaders in an ideal democracy are supposed to represent their people, not their business partners!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_strengthen_the_legal_system_desc: "In the ideal democratic society, laws are created to serve the interests of law and order first and foremost. The Komi Republic, however, has allowed the integrity of its legal code to atrophy and become beholden to the whims of partisan politics. A new judiciary must be rebuilt from scratch, freed from the mistakes of yesteryear and cleaned from the stain of political bias. Only then can we make any boasts of a free and fair system of justice, where the line between innocent and guilty remains a distinct and tangible thing."
 KOM_DSNP_election_restore_the_blindfold_desc: "The legal system has long been infiltrated by the creeping influence of unimpeded political warfare, and even the judges have not escaped this corruption. Even now, there are those who sit on the bench with only the interests of their political sponsors at heart, rather than the pursuit of objective justice. These stooges must be excised from the court, and replaced with individuals who can be trusted to maintain a semblance of neutrality to the political sphere. Justice, after all, is said to be blind, and so it falls to us to ensure that her eyes remain obscured to the influence of partisan squabbles."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_peace_with_honour_desc: "It seems that the worst has passed. After years of impassioned shouting matches in the assembly juxtaposed against brutal battles in the streets, the political sphere in the republic at last is entering a period of relative calm and civility. The DSNP has been seen by its detractors as a party too corrupt to achieve meaningful change, but now we have certainly proved them wrong. While lingering issues persist, we can, for now, return to a more civilized form of political maneuvering to solve our many problems: one that does not involve violent reprisals or bombings!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_resolve_the_paradox_desc: "Our republic, which loudly champions its tradition of political expression, is beholden to a most curious paradox. One of the main issues we encountered in the last year was our democracy being undermined by political organizations wholly interested in participating in electoralism with any measure of sincerity; seeing it as only a means to the eventual dismantlement of the republic in favor of a new, more authoritarian system.\n\nWhile we accept all manner of diverse ideologies, those who make it their objective to destroy democracy cannot be allowed to operate within the republican framework in good faith, for they intend to abuse our tolerance and use it as a weapon against us. Anti-electoralist parties and so-called "revolutionary" movements will be cracked down upon, to ensure the continued fostering of democratic ideals."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_fairer_course_desc: "At the end of the day, we cannot forget the core platform that every member of the DSNP has pledged to uphold. Our mission here in Komi is the realization of socialism through democratic means, and the creation of an egalitarian society in which no voice goes unheard. Despite the efforts of the far-right to halt our progress, and the efforts of the far-left to hijack socialist ideals in favor of ruinous bolshevism, the path to achieving our ideals lies unimpeded. With the dark days behind us at last, let our party once again set a renewed course for socialism, with our proud republic as the sturdy vessel to take us there!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_streamline_public_assistance_desc: "It would be an understatement to say that Komi is not exactly a shining beacon of urban sophistication. It is a cold, wooded backwater that was, at one time, sparsely populated. With the tragic result of the Great Patriotic War, however, the province has seen a huge increase in activity due to refugees and migrants alike. This surge of life has also brought a heavy cost upon the food situation, and if nothing is done to alleviate this, a famine could be on the horizon.\n\nThe DSNP will work tirelessly to ensure that this does not come to pass. With the strengthening of the Republic's social net, no mouth shall go without food or water. This, along with the construction of new poorhouses will provide sanctuary to those who have none, will allow the foundations for a robust welfare state to continue with renewed impetus. When the people have food on their plates and a warm bed to call their own, none will deny that the DSNP is a party that looks out for the little man!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_army_of_peoples_will_desc: "A ragtag collection of paramilitaries with dubious loyalties to the republic will not bring peace to Russia. Our potential enemies all have well-drilled, professional forces that would surely rip right through our own without much difficulty. A true standing army of great size will be needed if we hope to stand a chance in the wars to come, one stripped clean of disloyal elements. All civilian defense organizations are to be rolled into the military at once, while those with ties to extremist paramilitaries will be turned away at the door. We will march as one, or we will not march at all."
 KOM_DSNP_election_turn_a_blind_eye_desc: "It is clear that the Republic's rather miniscule army is woefully outclassed by its rivals. While it was sufficient enough to maintain a semblance of territorial integrity, something much larger will be necessary to bring the warlords of Russia to heel. The republic does not have the luxury of choice: we'll need every gun available to point our enemies, even if they come from less-than-ideal sources. Syktyvkar is full of former paramilitaries who now find themselves without a job due to their extremist affiliations. If they are willing to join our fight to liberate Russia, we may just be able to overlook their past crimes..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "The dire state of our beloved motherland is certainly one of the great tragedies of the modern age. Petty warlords now pick apart the carcass of a once-proud nation, and only through great military effort can these carrion birds of disorder be swept away. We must begin our journey down the arduous road to reunification at once, lest Russia slide too far into chaos to be dragged back out again.\n\nThe military will need a great deal of funding to prepare for the days of constant warfare to come, and it is for this reason that the DSNP will propose the National Reclamation Act to the Assembly. Should it pass, the Republic will have all the resources they need to bring the pacification of West Russia to a swift conclusion, be it by the pen or the sword."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_inspiration_of_our_predecessors_desc: "The great campaign to reunify all of Russia's remaining territories west of the Urals looms, and questions have already been raised on how to raise the capital to pay for the exorbitantly expensive business of war. To simplify the process, a centralized Soviet-inspired model has been selected to help manage the transition into a war economy. A specialized department for economic planning will allow the state to carefully guide national and private enterprises to uniformly aid the war effort. A "communistic" model may come across as distasteful to more conservative elements, but we do not have time to experiment with economic systems when war is on the horizon."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_supervisory_model_desc: "The uncertainty of war hangs in the air as the reunification campaign nears, but that does not mean we do not have the time to sort out an ideal economic model. Not only is war very expensive, but the new territories will require a period of financial reconfiguring, and it would be best to plan ahead now rather than later. There are some who have proposed a centralized communist-inspired model for this; some who have clearly forgotten the misrule of the Communist Party! What the Republic truly needs is a council of businessmen, bureaucrats, and workers to supervise the growth of the war economy, not a faceless government agency to retread the mistakes of Bukharin!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_for_prosperity_and_justice_desc: "Though lingering doubts remain, President Voznesensky has proven that the trust of the electorate was not unfounded. In only a short period he has breathed new life into the Republic's democratic traditions, and ensured the continued fostering of democratic socialism. The darkness of the past is well behind us thanks to his efforts and the efforts of the DSNP, but now we must face the uncertainty of the future.\n\nIt is now time to prepare for war. The Komi Republic may be a shining beacon of democracy and prosperity, but the rest of West Russia remains clouded by the choking mist of warlordism. It falls to us to spread the light of democracy to the rest of the region, no matter what it takes. Our enemies are many, but so long as we fight with the workers and citizens of the Republic in our hearts, Russia will emerge from these dark times as a united and free nation!"

 KOM_PSD_election_the_stalina_presidency_desc: "The election of Svetlana Stalina as President of the Komi Republic has brought a mixture of uncertainty, trepidation, hope - and fear - to the nation.\n\nHer election has solidified the rightward shift of the Republic, but more importantly, is viewed as an indictment of the ineffective establishment politics of the previous government - and the extremists who sought to take advantage of it. Yet instead of flocking to extremists promising lies, the people choose stability.\n\nThese extremists appraise her warily, for they know the danger she poses to them. At the same time, the rest of the nation knows Stalina as a staunchly principled democrat - one who will prevent the collapse of the state through all necessary means. She will bring an end to the chaos - and restore stability to the Republic."
 KOM_PSD_election_democratic_salvation_desc: "Democracy in Komi rests on the edge of an abyss.\n\nCriminals and paramilitaries roam the streets. Extremists spew their rhetoric with little pushback. Lies and propaganda are commonplace. The previous government oversaw the slow crumbling of democracy in Komi, and did nothing to reverse its collapse.\n\nTheir cowardice nearly doomed the Republic. Stalina and the PSD will not make the same mistakes. They will pull back the Republic from this abyss, and make their policy clear to the nation. No matter how much they must intervene, democracy will be protected from those who seek its destruction."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_line_has_been_crossed_desc: "Fascists. Nazis. Communists. Ideologies of extremism, both conventional and esoteric, have not only found a foothold in the Republic, but have been able to flourish. They have been allowed to masquerade as legitimate political movements, and this legitimacy made the previous government reluctant to crack down on them.\n\nHowever, these movements are not legitimate. They are a poison to the Republic, and their actions following the election have crossed a line. This state of insurgency, conflict, and chaos will not be allowed to continue. Stalina and the PSD will convene to determine a solution to this problem - and subsequently, take action."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_kuratov_dossier_desc: "The Kuratov District of Syktyvkar has been notoriously ungovernable since the inception of the Republic. Communist paramilitaries have maintained strict control over all that goes on, and it is the primary stronghold of Suslov and his associates. Previous governments have washed their hands of Kuratov, and were unwilling to take action - but we will directly address this problem.\n\nNo one in Kuratov is clean, and that presents an opening. A dossier will be commissioned, demonstrating the corruption and criminality of every public official that is, or has served. For now, this will serve as a consolidated collection of blackmail material and criminal evidence - but it will be crucial to our plans for the future.\n\nKuratov will be brought under control, and Suslov's machinations will be ended."
 KOM_PSD_election_a_word_in_our_ears_desc: "President Stalina is deeply conscious of the importance of security - and wise enough to not blind herself to inconvenient facts.\n\nShe is aware of the reality that the government has been infiltrated by those who are firmly anti-democratic, as well as adherents of other extremist ideologies. This risk must be mitigated, before it rots our government from within.\n\nThere are several elements of the military whose loyalty to the Republic is unquestioned. Petro Grigorenko and his staff are among our best and we will give them greater authority and trust to undertake certain measures to protect the Republic. With Petro's advice, and the intensification of military intelligence operations against extremist movements, we will keep a close watch on them - and ensure the Republic remains protected."
 KOM_PSD_election_uncap_the_dogwhistle_desc: "The Passionariyy has long been one of the greatest threats to the Republic. Headquartered within the infamous Internatsionalnaya Street, and surrounding districts, they are a haven of intolerance, nationalism, and extremism cloaked in dogwhistles and the controlled language of "moderate" media networks.\n\nIt is time to dispel this deception.\n\nWe will nationalize Radio Free Syktyvkar, the largest and most legitimate of the Passionariyy's media outlets to silence their lies. At the same time, we will conduct an investigation on Igor Shafarevich, and conduct an audit into his finances while following his movements.\n\nHis crimes will be exposed, and with his downfall, the Passionariyy will soon follow."
 KOM_PSD_election_a_final_demand_desc: "Despite their electoral defeat, the extremists were undeterred in their quest for power - And they had reason to think this. Previous governments coddled and permitted them to act against the elected government without consequences. Unwritten rules were obeyed, corruption was the norm, and violence was tolerated. We will not be so lenient, and we have not been idle.\n\nLegal measures are identified. Blackmail is collected. Military loyalty is assured. The state is controlled. We have prepared long enough. It is time to act. We will present an ultimatum to the more "legitimate" sides of these extremists, and make them force their paramilities to stand down.\n\nIn return for their cooperation, they will survive - but they will be rendered impotent. For now, this is acceptable to restore stability."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_most_dangerous_game_desc: "Despite the time that has passed since the elections, the extremists retain their ambitions of overthrowing our government. There is unfortunately only one solution remaining - to declare martial law, and solve this problem permanently.\n\nWe will deploy the military to Syktvyakar and break the forces there apart, occupy and protect the neighborhoods, and restore control over the government. While this will end the extremist issue - it is admittedly a gamble.\n\nThe military will not be united, and we will be establishing a precedent for future military intervention. This will also no doubt generate significant resentment in the Republic, and cause damage to Syktyvkar itself - but Komi can heal from this. Better we suffer a reputational blow than allow extremism to continue to fester."
 KOM_PSD_election_sovereign_reformism_desc: "The Komi Republic is fundamentally flawed, unstable, and possesses critical weaknesses - ones which even the PSD has contributed to. Ours is a party that proudly upholds the traditions of the past, and are unapologetically patriotic for our nation - however, even the most zealous among our party have realized the danger of excess, and that the need for reform is real. And it is these reforms that Stalina will implement.\n\nDespite the flaws and issues of the Republic, it does not have to be this way. We will bring the Republic to its true potential, step by step. Reformation may be slow, but we will set the nation on the path towards stability, and will ensure that the Republic can truly be a sovereign power which proudly upholds the legacy of Russia."
 KOM_PSD_election_guarantee_public_assistance_desc: "The first welfare system in Komi was first built by the DSNP as a means of providing a lifeline for citizens who needed it. The intentions were good, but unfortunately, this program is deeply flawed. It is extremely restricted, underfunded, corrupt, slow, and riddled with accusations of political favoritism, all of which has rendered the system effectively useless.\n\nWe will do this properly.\n\nThere are many people in the Republic who have been left behind, through circumstances that are no fault of their own. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people are taken care of. We will establish a true welfare system, making sure those who truly need it receive support, be it food, clothing, or housing."
 KOM_PSD_election_salvation_through_service_desc: "The unfortunate truth is that the Republic lies in a very precarious position, and is surrounded by enemies who would seek our destruction. We do not have the luxury of rectifying every previous government failure; not when we face invasion from our neighbors. Nonetheless, while we cannot provide full relief for less-fortunate citizens, we can offer something - something that will also improve our national situation.\n\nWe will reform the existing welfare programs, and tie them to public service. Be it public administration, law enforcement, or military service, we need people to fill these positions. These extra benefits will be appealing, and strengthen our state through alleviating manpower shortages. Finally, we will ensure that our veterans are fully taken care of - for what does it say of a nation who lets those who served so loyally languish when their service ends?"
 KOM_PSD_election_investigate_discrimination_allegations_desc: "It has come to our attention that there are numerous reports of systemic abuse and discrimination of minorities by the state apparatus, from law enforcement, the military, and even public services. Despite the fact that these are full and equal citizens of the Republic, we must face the uncomfortable fact that such discrimination is alive and well in the state.\n\nThis is, of course, intolerable, and Stalina and the PSD will not let it continue.\n\nA state that allows its own citizens to be treated in such a way is undisciplined, weak, and abusive - and will set us down the path of ruin. We will immediately investigate these allegations, and excise these criminals from the state body. There is no tolerance for this behavior under Stalina's administration - not now. Not ever."
 KOM_PSD_election_spare_the_rod_desc: "We are aware of reports of abuse and discrimination by state apparatuses against some of the minorities of the Republic. After internal deliberation, it was determined that the potential risks and costs of a major investigation would be too great to justify. While the allegations are disturbing, a comprehensive response would be unnecessary, and potentially destabilize the nation and party cohesion.\n\nThat does not mean we will do nothing, of course. There are several truly heinous reports we will take action against - but the claim that these criminals are representative of systemic abuse? No. Such accusations are unfounded, and we cannot discount that they are being spread by our enemies to destabilize our state.\n\nThe Republic is united, fair, and lawful - and under Stalina, it always will be."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "Russia must be reunited. Despite all of the differences between the factions of the Republic, everyone agrees on this fundamental fact. Much discussion has been had on what must be done, and now is the time to put words into action, and begin orienting our state for this monumental task.\n\nThe National Reclamation Act will be introduced into the National Assembly. This act will properly fund our production, expand our industries, codify regulations for military operation, and distribute resources, manpower, and funding to our diplomatic and integration agencies in preparation for reclaiming Russia.\n\nRussia has been broken for too long. By our efforts, she will be united once more."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_hardest_of_bargains_desc: "Much of the Republic's economy is under the control of several large industrial magnates - a situation that resulted from deals and understandings between the magnates and previous administrations. Now the magnates wield significant control over the national economy - but they are ultimately reliant on the government to maintain their stranglehold.\n\nThe magnates for a long time now have only been concerned with their own profit, and have become complacent and arrogant. It is time they be reminded of who they serve. We hold significant leverage of the magnates, and we will use this to force them to work for the Republic once more - and guide their efforts towards state projects, efforts, and solutions.\n\nThey will comply, or they will be broken apart and given to those more loyal."
 KOM_PSD_election_convince_the_magnates_desc: "Much of the Republic's economy is controlled by several large industrial magnates, who provide steady jobs, resources, and weapons for the state. While they are certainly more motivated by profit than patriotism, none can say they have failed to meet their obligations - ones the result of dealings with previous governments.\n\nThe magnates are not, nor need to be, our enemy - however, we do have our own expectations for them.\n\nWe will sit down with the magnates, and negotiate new contracts and agreements with them. We can be reasonable, and they know that it is in their interests to work with us to ensure our mission to reunify Russia is properly supplied. If we throw in a few extra incentives? Their willing support will be assured, which will make the state more stable in the long-term."
 KOM_PSD_election_towards_sovereignty_desc: "Through pressure, subtlety, negotiation, and resolve, we have successfully been able to advance every single critical policy forward, and unified the Republic under Stalina's leadership. Though difficult and intensive, our efforts have paid off, and the sovereignty of the Komi Republic is not only secure - it is stronger than ever.\n\nNow, we look beyond our borders.\n\nOur people are eager. Our military is prepared. The Komi Republic mobilizes for war. All necessary measures are in place. We are as ready as we can ever be. No more excuses or delays. The unification of Russia will begin, and we shall see it through to the end."

 KOM_KPK_election_republics_red_dawn_desc: "The Proletariat remembers. The years of hardship, of life in a starving and devastated land, came to Russia once before. Now, much like then, the devotion of the working man has had one direction. To the true party. To the Communist Party.\n\nThis is a great occasion, a shift further towards Communism from old DSNP rule. This proves the people no longer wish to commit to defeatism when the fallen Red Banner of Struggle, of the Working Man, lies ready to be taken up once more.\n\nNow will be a time of struggle, hardship, and self-sacrifice. But the KPK's election demonstrates the willingness of the population to endure this brief period, to tighten their belts for Russias survival. It has only begun."
 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_by_ballot_desc: "After the most contentious election process in Komi's history, our party stands victorious. The Communist Party candidate [KOM.GetLeader] has seized the presidency and thus reins of power. This is the vital first step in a socialist revolution that will seek to respect the rule of democracy, at least for now.\n\nAs the Communist Party attempts to empower labor and root out "reaction" in the Republic, we will have to grapple with the fact that our opponents consider us illegitimate and dangerously extremist. Some have reportedly even refused to attend sessions of the legislature. Nevertheless, our mandate is impossible to ignore; the other parties will have to learn to respect the Communist Party's wishes, whether through the easy way or the hard way."
 KOM_KPK_election_escalate_the_process_desc: "The Communist Party's quest for a socialist revolution through traditional legislative means is fraught with danger from a variety of enemies. Members of parties of the democratic center still entirely refuse to cooperate with us, and the reactionary right is naturally extremely hostile to our project. In the security apparatus, there is always the risk of military elements hostile to the revolution undermining us through force. It is for these reasons that we must hasten our transition to socialism.\n\nThe Party and its supporters need to be on a war footing. What this means in practice is a vigorous campaign against the enemies of the people, both through a propaganda offensive and through investigation of potential foes within the state. Our enemies are myriad and ferocious; if we are not on guard, we could easily be swept up in a merciless tide of reaction."
 KOM_KPK_election_collaboration_with_labour_desc: "The goal of the KPK has always been to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat in accordance with Leninist principles, and under the current circumstances this requires working with the trade unions. Unions are, of course, a temporary measure in the grand scheme of things, but for the moment they are the primary instrument of the will of the proletariat, and as such must be considered when drafting policy.\n\nWe shall begin drafting laws to delegate powers to the various trade unions, including and especially a policy of greater self-management, though the extent of this remains to be determined within the Party. By working with the unions, we will soon be able to demonstrate to the people that the bourgeois liberalism of the Republic must be abandoned if they wish to enjoy a better life."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_changing_of_the_guard_desc: "The upper echelons of any standing army are almost always in the service of reaction, as 1917 taught us. As such, we have always anticipated needing to move against the Army General Staff, but the revelation of Case October and its possible mobilization by the Republican Army has forced us to consider dealing with them sooner rather than later.\n\nDefense Minister Chelomei has been tasked with ensuring the stability of the Revolution against reactionary officers, and so far seems to have done well in this task. The chief conspirators have been isolated by firing or "neutralizing" key mid-ranking officers, and now all that remains is to remove these men from service. We will tolerate no counterrevolution from our army ever again."
 KOM_KPK_election_cast_down_the_passionarists_desc: "There remains one major threat left to deal with; the Passionariyy Organization. That collection of esoterics and crypto-fascists was left to fester by the liberals, and so, as ever, it falls to socialists to bring an end to the reactionary menace. Only we have ever had the courage, the will, and the ideological motivation to see these lunatics driven out of power, and now we have the means to do so.\n\nIf we are to save Russia, then we must remove the Passionariyy at once, by any means necessary. With our current power, we have numerous methods at our disposal; we could always ask the liberals to cooperate in removing what is clearly the larger threat, in the hope that they will see reason, or we could turn to more forceful means. One way or another, Gumilyov and his coterie are a den of vipers, and we must destroy them!"
 KOM_KPK_election_alliance_of_convenience_desc: "The left and center have an enormous number of differences on a variety of topics. We see them as complicit in the capitalist system; they see us as enemies of democracy. There is one point on which liberals and communists can always agree, however: keeping the far right from taking power is a top priority.\n\nOur makeshift anti-fascist coalition will mostly involve deputies of the DSNP, as the other parties of the center refuse to work with us under any circumstances. If we act quickly, we can cooperate to completely shut out the Passionariyy before they stand a chance of usurping the Republic."
 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_is_not_civilized_desc: "The time for restraint is over. The Passionariyy, with their extreme ideology and terroristic assaults on politicians of other parties, have proven themselves entirely incompatible with the values of the Republic or its people. For every day it exists as an independent political faction, Komi becomes less safe. The forces of reaction cannot be allowed to endanger us any longer; with our legislative majority, we have the power we need to stymie them forever.\n\nThe Communist Party and what remaining anti-fascist allies it has among the parties of the center will vote to declare the Passionariyy unconstitutional for Nazi sympathy and conspiracy against the Republic. The battle against the far-right will be far from over, but its power underground will be but a shadow of what it had before."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_popular_apportionment_act_desc: "The way we can best secure a transition from bourgeois capitalist democracy to the dictatorship of the proletariat is through a piece of legislation known as the Popular Apportionment Act, a bill that redraws the prior election districts. As these districts are designed to allow for participation in bourgeois democracy, they need to be redrawn in such a way that grants the KPK additional seats to ensure the Party is always able to maintain a plurality in the Assembly. In addition, it allows the President to dissolve the Assembly in order to allow additional time to prepare for upcoming elections.\n\nOur opponents may decry this as undemocratic, but true democracy can only occur once the bourgeoisie has been suppressed and power given to the workers, through the vanguard; we shouldn't expect them to understand. And if the Assembly refuses to pass the bill, then President [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] can use his emergency powers to implement it. One way or another, the death knell of Voznesensky's liberal perversion rings loud and clear."
 KOM_KPK_election_socialism_for_the_people_desc: "We have been tasked with the great work of seeing Soviet economics triumph. This economic revolutions victory will see the general improvement of material living conditions, after all. There are, however, those who will invariably turn out to be traitors. It is clear to all with eyes the bourgeois will never sit idly, and allow themselves to pass into history. They never do.\n\nIt must be done all the same. There are those who would extend leniency to bourgeois specialists, and afford them greater luxury, so they can help build the revolution. Once we enact the economic revolution, the upper class will show their true face, and the people will see the reason for our distrust."
 KOM_KPK_election_entrap_the_magnates_desc: "The party has employed several strategies over the decades of the struggles existence, complementing material conditions and the circumstances of the day. Once, the NEP was employed to eliminate the peasantry in favor of small capitalists. Now, our designs and works have a new target. The fat hands of the citys business magnates hold key government ties. This cannot stand.\n\nThe KPK shall pass a slew of new labor laws to squeeze these Magnates. They will be nigh impossible for the employer to fulfill. This prosecution against the monopolist-capitalist will allow the rise of worker-controlled enterprises. The Party has no choice. The private and exploitative merchant must meet its end so the Revolution can live."
 KOM_KPK_election_no_time_for_subtlety_desc: "The Revolution waits for no man. It waits for no subtlety, no quiet and seamless legislative born from the mind of a finicky bureaucrat. What place do complications have in times like these? We are not trying to confuse the upper classes.\n\nThe KPK's paramilitaries and agents, having spent years cutting their teeth against the Right-Guardists, shall begin their true campaign. Through these arms, the Party will work tirelessly to seize that which has been stolen from the worker, and directly redistribute it back to their empty hands. The people of Komi has vested the Party with power, and now we must use it in their interest, blocking any and all resistance to this redistribution campaign."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "The KPK government will send an act to the National Assembly for passage. As the Party concludes its internal campaigns, it must look outwards. The components of this National Reclamation Act will be the issuing of funding and allowances to allow for the bolstering of our military. There can only be one direction for this effort. Russia will be whole under the Red banner again.\n\nDespite how such measures would be pursued under any sane party, this will be opposed. Our actions to secure the revolution were never intended to make friends out of inextricable enemies within the National Assembly. Nevertheless, we know their obstruction will come. We must endure it if the candlelight that is our grief for Russia is to amount to anything."
 KOM_KPK_election_restore_the_highest_order_desc: "The parties of the Centre, and especially the Right, bleat endlessly about Order. About Law and Order, about an abstract ancient order, about something our Party practically by mere existence. It was not their order that held sway for 20 years. Meanwhile, the centuries that preceded that were a dark time of ignorance and petty terrorizing despots. The Party speaks to a higher order. The Highest Order.\n\nState control of the economy will be re-initialized. This entails the restoration of the Gosplan planning committee, which will implement the directives outlined by the Government of the Party. They will supervise the ebbs and flows of the economy while subordinating all state-owned enterprises to their power."
 KOM_KPK_election_free_the_modern_serfs_desc: "The history books tell us some jumped-up Tsar with delusions of benevolence freed the serfs. Our eyes tell us a different story, as do our decyphering minds. One serfdom has given way to another. The form and method have merely changed their skins. Tyrannic whims of private merchants, dancing the carrot before the common farmer, will not hold further sway.\n\nThe Party will meet out well-deserved land reform to the nations farming class. With the KPK at the head of this Republic, we shall see to it that the farmers are empowered. Of course, this allocation of greater autonomy to the farming communities will also go a great way to currying support from them. In the coming years, and the coming wars, that support will be essential."
 KOM_KPK_election_to_build_a_new_world_desc: "At last, with the opposition destroyed and our grip on power affirmed, we can move towards ending the oppressive Republic. The final step in removing the bourgeoise will commence, as reactionary elements are purged under a final communist revolution. With this, we will declare the Komi Soviet Republic in the ashes of where the old republic once stood.\n\nHowever, there still exist monarchists, revisionists, and actual fascists surrounding us. Once our grip on power is finally secured, we will have to soon protect our revolution from those outside our borders. To achieve this we will shift our attention to unifying the entirety of West Russia."

 KOM_RNP_election_the_shafarevich_presidency_desc: "Hurrah! After much difficult campaigning Igor Shaferavich has finally achieved the office of President. This momentous occasion marks a drastic shift in the trajectory of Komi's future entrusted to us by its most patriotic citizens. More importantly, it marks a rejection of the previously corrupt and Bolshevik-allied DSNP and the rest of the center.\n\nWith this election, Komi's right now has the power to pursue its agenda with full confidence. Years of being hindered by the opposition are no more, as we can enact the rightful reforms in full that we have been denied for so long. It is their turn to complain, and ours to call the shots."
 KOM_RNP_election_foundation_of_moral_republic_desc: "With the recent victory of the RNP in the elections, Shafarevich has been swept into power to destroy the corruption endemic in our Republic. The days of Komi being a corrupt and weak republic are over, and it is time everyone puts forth their work towards the foundation of a better, moral republic. A republic that doesn't have the underlying threats of socialism or insanity that hide beneath us.\n\nShafarevich and the RNP will tear down the corrupt democracy for a more pure and stable nation, one that actually cares for the security of its people. Komi must not be allowed to destroy itself, and we are the ones who can save it."
 KOM_RNP_election_strike_down_mephistopheles_desc: "With Shafarevich and the RNP coming to power, we must immediately make plans to purge the communists within the Republic. Already weakened, now is the time to strike them down. Communism must be purged from Komi for the safety of our people.\n\nOur first target will be Suslov, the puppetmaster. He is Mephistopheles, the devil who works in the background, hiding in the shadows to destroy the soul of Komi. Locating him and bringing him to justice will be difficult, but if we succeed it will be cutting the head off of the snake. Suslov's schemes must be ended quickly, lest he is allowed to gather his power back to threaten our leadership."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_bait_and_switch_desc: "To destroy the wickedness of socialism in Komi we cannot work alone. Making a deal with the center is the way forward, and if successful it would give us enough power to shut down the KPK, the communist party in Komi. Unfortunately, not all of the center is willing to work with us, mostly just the SMR under Morozov. The PSD under Stalina has even refused to accept seats in the Assembly at all, decrying us as a totalitarian government. However, it should still give us the edge if we cooperate with what remains of the center, and if the PSD is not willing to accept seats in an Assembly under Shafarevich, by all means, let them weaken themselves."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_righteous_march_desc: "Using our right-wing majority in the Assembly we can march right ahead and shut down the KPK, eliminating any legitimacy of the communist movement. Using emergency powers, we will call out the KPK as the terrorist group it is and shut it down on the basis that it is unconstitutional. In doing this, we will have completed our first task in making Komi into a more secure republic."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_limits_of_patience_desc: "Despite the deep values of patience and compassion that are included in the ideology of the RNP, there exists in Komi worrying machinations of the enemies of the people's will, the communists and the radicals. These groups are too drastic to ignore and must be dealt with accordingly. Enemies of the Republic cannot be allowed to exist, for if they continue to work in the background these terrorists will slowly destroy our values and morals until the Republic is left a decaying husk. Action must be taken to save the Republic from these internal threats, and we must destroy them first before they destroy us."
 KOM_RNP_election_contacts_in_the_republican_army_desc: "The army hides some of our most dangerous enemies, but also our most beneficial allies. Making contact with right-wing sympathizers in the Republican Army will make our rule much more stable. We know our enemies, so we must know our friends as well.\n\nSimilarly, having Vladimir Soloukhin, our new defense minister, commission some new, more sympathetic generals will be necessary to remove traitors from the ranks. These will be selected out of the best and most talented RNP-sympathetic officers and will make sure we have the loyalty of the army on our side."
 KOM_RNP_election_dismiss_the_compromised_desc: "Worrying news from the Defense Ministry has revealed that many of our generals have PSD sympathies. It has also been proven that these officers may have been planning a coup. Even Petro Grigorenko, one of our most highest-ranking commanders, has been found complicit in the act.\n\nThe loyal parts of the Defense Ministry must deal with this as soon as possible. Grigorenko, as well as other commanders such as Ivan Korolkov and Yakov Pokus, must be dismissed immediately before their treasonous acts can fester. They may be some of the most experienced generals in the Republican Army, but their PSD connections show they are not truly loyal to the Republic's morals and ideals."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_national_democracy_act_desc: "With the recent uptick in violence against the Republic, and the death of several Deputies in a terrorist attack on the National Assembly, we have no choice but to take necessary action. Shafarevich must use his position and the RNP's majority in the Assembly to enact a new law, the National Democracy Act, in order to protect the Republic from radicals and paramilitaries. With the status quo becoming untenable, we must be decisive to defeat those who wish to threaten our Republic.\n\nThis act will save democracy from the hands of barbaric, communist terrorists and secure the safety of every citizen in Komi. Some temporary restrictions must be instituted, such as on press and protest rights, but the power this gives the President and his cabinet will ensure no weakness in dealing with these threats."
 KOM_RNP_election_a_compassionate_state_desc: "A key part of the Russian National Party's platform was the idea of a compassionate state. This model envisions the state as being composed of the everyday citizen, receptive to the needs of its fellows. All of our citizens' needs will be taken care of by our benevolent government as only we know the best course for their future and all of Komi.\n\nThis will be the first reform of our agenda done. The previous government's cold and despondent approach will be replaced with our ever-caring one. It will also help further isolate the degeneracy of the Bolsheviks from the citizenry as they come to our way of thinking."
 KOM_RNP_election_end_the_bolshevik_legacies_desc: "Despite never properly controlling the republic as we or the previous government have, the communist influence in Komi is still an ever-present aspect of life. While some of this is from acts of subversion committed by the repulsive communists, it is mostly the lingering influence of the previous Bolshevik government under Bukharin.\n\nNow is the time to begin the long process of decommunization. From a physical standpoint, Soviet iconography will be removed and destroyed, from crests to statues. Similarly, we will remove its influences on everyday life, from the radical tendencies of trade unions to the simple use of the word comrade. Nothing can remain in our quest for a truly national Russia."
 KOM_RNP_election_recentered_welfare_desc: "A vile leftover of the Soviets under Bukharin and Lenin has been their deplorable policy of affirmative action. Through this, certain undeserving and ignorant groups have been stealing welfare and jobs from perfectly capable citizens. Meanwhile, those who need it in the villages starve in agony over the neglect they have received.\n\nToday this wretched practice ends! Success will be determined by hard work, except in those instances where geography and isolation create trouble. No longer will these minorities steal from us, and instead the government's money will be directed towards helping out our isolated population in the countryside. With this, everyone will be truly equal in society, regardless of their race or creed."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_labourers_reward_desc: "The careless, stingy, and aloof nature of the previous government has had dire effects on the lives of our citizens. More specifically its disregard for the old who are too weak to work has meant catastrophic things for those citizens who have given so much for the state. Our old workers and veterans live in indifferent poverty, unaware of the good our party can do for them.\n\nA slew of social programs will be enacted out of the state's compassion to help keep those who work hard stay out of the poverty they were put in by the previous underground forces of the state. Retirees can finally find some peace in programs meant to help them when out of work. Similarly, we will begin issuing pensions to our veterans, ensuring that their patriotic service does not go unrewarded."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "It is high time we move our attention to foreign affairs, at least in our immediate surroundings. The clouds of war are approaching quickly and they will soon reach our borders. Our National Reclamation Act will aid us with this issue, providing funding and legal allowances to both our glorious military and loyal diplomatic corps in the campaign to re-unify Russia.\n\nUnfortunately for us, our unpatriotic and cowardly opposition in the National Assembly are unlikely to support this bill. They have made outlandish claims about our recent actions such as being "radical", and a "danger to democracy". These assertions have dissuaded them from working with us. Their betrayal of the nation is not new but is something we will have to keep in mind when passing the bill."
 KOM_RNP_election_triumph_of_purpose_desc: "With the coming wars, we have to make key decisions about where we prioritize the economy and who has influence over it. In this course, the need for ideological consistency must win out. Mobilizing our agrarian economy will be crucial to ensure our troops are well fed and the populace does not starve. This preference aligns with the RNP's historical platform of environmentalism and focuses on rural constituents.\n\nYet, this decision comes at a cost. By focusing on agriculture we will simultaneously be curbing the power of the industrial bourgeois in our economy. Now, this does have its advantages, limiting these all-controlling magnates from political influence will strengthen the party. However, the lack of their support will cost us strength in the industrial economy."
 KOM_RNP_election_sacrifice_for_common_good_desc: "In times like these, sometimes difficult decisions must be made. The soul and standards that define our government are sacrificed for the greater good. Now is one of those times. We will begrudgingly allow the industrial magnates access to government resources. While it is a move that the other traitorous parties might make, the need for unification here makes it patriotic.\n\nStill, the decision will come at the cost of the agrarian sector and our rural base. Longer must we bear the toiling of diligent peasants being neglected by the state. Similarly, our grip on the economy as a whole will weaken, allowing for its infiltration by unsavory forces. Naturally, we will be able to regain this control in time, but in the immediate future, it will be a problem."
 KOM_RNP_election_the_dream_realized_desc: "Everything needed to secure our grip over Komi has been achieved. We have transformed the apparatus of government into a body that ensures only true and patriotic Russians from our party have access to the government. The rotting corpse of communism has been cleansed from the state, and the horrid and cowardly traitors that preceded us have been successfully removed from any position of power.\n\nWith this newfound security, we can firmly shift our focus to what is important; reunifying the entirety of western Russia. The clouds of war have finally reached our border and with it the time to strike! If we are to ever spread the reach of our compassionate state to the rest of the former Soviet Union, now is the time."

 KOM_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc: "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 KOM_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc: "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 KOM_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc: "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 KOM_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc: "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 KOM_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc: "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communists and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 KOM_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc: "Left unsaid in the communists' and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the Republic. The communists and fascists fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 KOM_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc: "As the fascists and communists plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses' secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 KOM_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc: "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's Republican Army is completely compromised; its officer corps riddled with Suslovite plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 KOM_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc: "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 KOM_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc: "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 KOM_ccoup_democrats_coup_desc: "When the Republic was founded, it was the goal of the governing parties to keep violence out of Komi's political system. Though noble, this goal was a terrible failure in practice, to the point that the defenders of democracy have had to use the same weapon as its enemies: a military coup.\n\nNow that Komi's democracy has been saved from the brink of death, it is the military's responsibility to safeguard it, lest it be lost again and irreversibly. We must be ever vigilant; never again can extremism be allowed to threaten our liberties. Only after we have weathered the storm can the Republic return to a situation approaching normal."
 KOM_ccoup_defend_democracy_desc: "It was nearly lost, but the people of Komi have retaken their democracy from the clutches of an extremist putsch. The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public.\n\nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy. Media campaigns against extremism of both the right and the left and a hunt for the anti-democratic forces in our midst are a must if we want to fully restore confidence in the liberal system."
 KOM_ccoup_expel_the_radicals_desc: "While the political leadership stakes out its course, most of the day-to-day runnings of the Republic is handled by the bureaucracy, the police and the army. We must ensure these vital institutions can't be subverted by radicals. We will thoroughly vet our institutions and get rid of everyone with dangerous radical sympathies."
 KOM_ccoup_every_last_resource_desc: "We are at a precipice. Our beloved republic is at real threat of being destroyed by subversive forces. To save it, we must be prepared to throw everything we have into the struggle. All our resources and materiel must be put to use. Every last rouble invested. Every loyal citizen must be mobilized. We can't afford to keep anything in reserve. For the good of the Republic!"
 KOM_ccoup_emergency_rule_desc: "The greatest triumph of our Republic has been to end arbitrary "frontier justice" and give its people a dependable, predictable justice system to protect their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the radicals still have sympathizers in our society, sympathizers who will abuse these freedoms to obstruct our efforts to restabilize the Republic. We are forced to suspend, for the time being, some of our most cherished rights. The radicals have given us no other option."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_order_desc: "The Republican Army failed in its duty when it allowed our Republic to fall to radical forces. While loyal officers have been vital in striking back, our forces are still scattered and demoralized. This state of affairs can't be allowed to continue. Our enemies are rallying their forces, and the struggle for our home is far from over. We need our army back.\n\nWe must rally our soldiers. We must remind them of their duty. The army will restore its honor by crushing the nascent insurgency."
 KOM_ccoup_our_loyal_sympathizers_desc: "A large majority of our citizens support the Republic and believe in its founding principles. Recent events have shown, however, that this majority is prone to inaction in the face of attacks by internal, radical forces. We must restore their confidence and teach them principles and tactics of resistance and mass action, so that they will resist attempts to subvert their rights and freedoms and do their part to defend the Republic in the future."
 KOM_ccoup_paralyze_the_paramilitaries_desc: "Several political movements have organized their membership into paramilitaries. Previously tolerated to maintain stability, it is now abundantly clear the practice needs to end. The coup-makers leaned heavily on their armed support, but even the notionally loyal groupings proved unreliable, acting more as agents of chaos than allies. We will issue a demand for all such groupings to stand down and demobilize permanently. Paramilitaries which refuse will be subject to arrests and forced disarmament. Peace in the Republic requires it."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_the_quiet_desc: "The recent instability and fighting in the Republic has wreaked havoc on the economy and the day-to-day rhythm of civilian life. While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 KOM_ccoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc: "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the Republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

 KOM_dem_smuta_the_republic_triumphant_desc: "There was a moment - a brief moment, for just a day or two, but a moment - when we all felt doomed. Flanked by authoritarian forces on each side, faced with internal debate instead of unity, the people of Komi lost their hope for their republic.\n\nThough we lived, all of us remember that feeling. Hopelessness - it must become an alien thought to the people of Komi. They need safety and security. They need institutions they can trust. They need a state they can rely on.\n\nWe have won today. We must make certain we win tomorrow."
 KOM_dem_smuta_restoring_the_foundation_desc: "In the wake of such a massive insurrection, our civil institutions, the backbone of our democracy, are shot. Whether it be problems with staffing, fear of violence, or outright chaos, most departments of the government are hampered. Despite our victory, Komi remains without order.\n\nWhile it may not be as romantic a notion as restoring democracy, restoring order is our first and utmost priority.

They amassed a horde of weapons under the protection of our open gun laws, and with them, they sabotaged our nation and brought us to the brink of collapse.\n\nIt is clear that such slack cannot remain in the system. Through a system of tight gun control, we must defang any deviant still hoping to destroy our democracy. The radicals will keep their right to free speech and free thought, but they must relinquish their right to free firepower. It is up to our government to hold its weapons tight - and its people close."
 KOM_dem_smuta_register_civilian_firearms_desc: "How do we rid our streets of violence? The obvious answer is to take away the tools of such violence, but in the whirling madness of Russia this is a fool's gambit. We are starved for manpower, starved for weapons, starved for resources to conduct such a mass confiscation. Yet there is a cleaner way.\n\nWe will make certain that all citizens register their firearms, while banning any further sales of this nature. Those with weapons will be registered automatically to the territorial defense forces - they are well-versed in arms, after all. It may not be as simple as a flat confiscation, but this subtler method may work a whole lot better."
 KOM_dem_smuta_formalize_national_claims_desc: "What is the Komi Republic? Certainly, it is for more than just the Komi people - our leadership are primarily Russian, and have never imagined themselves as a smaller national state. Yet for all this time, we have left unclear just how much land we claim.\n\nWith the Russian Civil War burning bright, the time to stake our claim has come. Though imperfect, the USSR's smaller Russian state serves as a functional boundary for a Russian state, free of imperialism. Other former imperial territories will also be allowed to join, but only at their discretion. Finally, we can sing in one voice - we are Russia, and Russia will be saved."
 KOM_dem_smuta_redefine_election_cycles_desc: "War is no time for an election. Our territories change daily with the tides of Smuta. Our people risk death if they stray too close to a polling station. For many, our lives are too chaotic, too complex, to fit in the arduous complexities of the democratic model. We need stability and strength, and for the moment, an election would provide neither.\n\nInstead, the Assembly has agreed to a delay on elections until the situation west of the Urals has stabilized, or until four years have passed, whichever comes first. It is only at that point that we will integrate our new lands into the democratic model. Until then, we await the day that the light of liberty will touch all corners of our territory."
 KOM_dem_smuta_reinforce_census_apparatus_desc: "The Komi Republic's weak civilian agencies extended to many tasks, including that of the census. Our previous censuses were confusing, arcane, and worst of all inaccurate, creating maps with little practical use to our government. We were left to work half-blind, and fix their mistakes as they come.\n\nNow, our administrative overhauls can remodel this archaic system. Our old censuses will be redone from scratch, properly reflecting the population of the Komi republic. For new territories, our ethnographers will fall in lockstep with our soldiers, charting our lands as we take them. Only through these bold methods shall we gain a true understanding of just who lives in our republic."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_priorities_of_the_assembly_desc: "The matters of state are already known to us. Our forces move to liberate a great patch of Russia. Our enemies flicker and fratter, destroying much of the nation in the process. It appears for now that we are succeeding Yet we cannot forget that there is more to our republic than simply the boons of our military victory.\n\nThe National Assembly, newly elected, must carry on in its stated mission. It cannot simply conduct a war - it must conduct a nation, one which is determined to develop the Republic into a true nation. Our democracy must now do its mission - and we will all be better for it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_king_of_cups_desc: "The news, the radicals, even many members of the DSNP, all seemed to believe that President Voznesensky might not just be the end of the party, but of democracy itself. Yet on the other side, we can see that these enemies and scandals were mere blips on a career of success. The Komi Republic sails steady, with the President firmly in the captain's quarters.\n\nNow, he must repeat the same trick with a new base - the Russians that Komi recently liberated. These citizens of Russia often lived poor and starving, oppressed by governents whose only care was for their own demented ideals. To win their hearts, they must be given the things they need."
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_end_the_hunger_desc: "Like the horsemen of the Bible, Famine rides alongside War. Western Russia has felt the wrath of war - now, it shudders in the grip of famine. Families lost their farms or their yields to marching soldiers, or key workers to the battles themselves. It comes to us, their liberators, to lend a hand.\n\nBy nationalizing food stockpiles collected across the nation, there may be a suitable amount of food to let everyone survive these harsh times. We will use our army, already stationed around the nation, to distribute rations to civilian channels, and then, the people. Finally, we will rid our lands of these hideous horsemen."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_industrial_distribution_act_desc: "Written by a cadre of the most elite DSNP lawmakers, the Industrial Distribution Act appears to be a powerful instrument in the hands of the worker. According to the law, should a workplace in the reclaimed territories employ over fifty individuals, it will immediately pass into collective ownership by the workers.\n\nBy passing such a measure, the DSNP hopes to break the economic grip that recently acquired firms might have on our democracy. If this passes, Komi will be one step closer to the socialist system which President Voznesensky has always promised."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_page_of_pentacles_desc: "President Morozov is a break from the past. A break from Smuta, from the warlords, from the decay of the old USSR that still haunts our modern lives. But it is not the past that matters now. It is the future - Morozov's future, and our own.\n\nThe President's plans call for a rising Russia, not one reformed through blood and violence but simple organization. Russia does not need the poison of extreme ideology or dead dreams, but schools, hospitals, factories, and farms. We will mechanize. We will grow. In the open arms of the future, we will find our home."
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_construct_the_future_desc: "As we reclaim this side of the Urals, we must revive it as well. Locked in the grip of dangerous warlords, these regions were often underdeveloped, unable to join the modern world. We will fix this.\n\nFactories will be built, reactivating the region with infrastructure in mind. As the military is currently in these regions, it stands that they are the appropriate mechanism to begin these projects - their men will begin what the locals will soon complete. Our goal is extreme, but very much doable - every Russian in our lands will have the right to work."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_technical_development_act_desc: "The Technical Development Act is a perfect summary of Morozov's wide-eyed vision. The plan envisions a scientific side to the republic's industrial capacity, generously funded, able to work without the red tape of excessive bureaucracy and a million watching eyes.\n\nThe private sector will have generous routes to new material in the form of newly reclaimed industry. Infrastructure that they need to create valuable materials can be provided slickly and efficiently, creating a frictionless road to a more visionary future. Someday, the Technical Development Act will be seen as the first leap towards an intelligent Russia of Tomorrow - one we will all count on."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_queen_of_swords_desc: "The people of the Republic have elected their new leader. President Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina comes to Syktyvkar as a breath of fresh air, a competent and focused woman to replace the boorish populists of old.\n\nYet a Queen is only as good as her deeds and her nation. With a plan for rapid remilitarization and reclamation, Stalina wishes to save a nation from the extremism that has so cruelly broken it. Her Russia will be stable and reformed, rebuilt from ashes into a new and better land. Russia has always held the promise of superpower status - under Stalina, Queen of Swords, it will be."
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_embolden_the_nation_desc: "The people of Russia are tired of war. Trapped in an eternal battle, they feel lorded over by armies, foreign forces who pillage their lands and give little in return. Decades of poor rule by poor rulers have drained the morale from the people of Russia.\n\nYet this is no reason to give up the fight. Instead, we must bridge the gap between our military and our people. Through recruitment campaigns, we can bring the people closer to their army. Through military reconstruction and service, we can show the people how their soldiers can come to their aid. Through improved training, we can be certain our army is loyal and just. In time, the people will come to see just how good their army truly is."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_independent_supervisory_act_desc: "One problem which rapid expansion creates is a lack of administration. Komi was, after all, only ever set up to administer a small region, not a fifth of all of Russia. Even holding votes is impossible while borders shift and surveys are unreliable. Instead, we may wish to rely on a simpler method.\n\nThe Independent Supervisory Act gives the Republican Army the ability to independently appoint local civilian officials to govern the newly reclaimed territory, as well as giving the civilian government access to reports on the frontline. Through these policies, the government and military can work harmoniously on the frontlines, without the redundancies required by attempting an unwieldy civilian administration."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_march_of_the_multitudes_desc: "From an outsider's viewpoint it might seem as though there are many individual warlords with valid claims to being the true Russia. If so, they would be strongly mistaken. Even disregarding the fact that many of these statelets are run by selfish despots or outright criminals, it is clear that it is our Republic - and only our Republic - that truly represents the will of the Russian people.\n\nWe are beset on all sides by monarchists, military governments, and Nazis. Do they represent the people who choke under their yoke? Certainly not. As the true democracy - the best representation of the will of the people - it is our duty to maintain unity as we work to restore Russia."
 KOM_dem_smuta_sowing_the_seeds_desc: "As we begin the reclamation, a long list of tasks presents itself. We need to re-integrate the rest of Russia and make use of new land, utilize the new factories and involve the new people. It has become quite clear to us that what worked when we were small is insufficient as we continue to grow.\n\nWe must begin to reorient our economy, and the sooner, the better, considering the amount of work that needs to be done. It may be thankless work now, but the people will be grateful to us for having done it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_citizen_soldier_desc: "Simply put, we do not have the population to maintain a large standing army. Fortunately, this problem is somewhat alleviated by the fact that many civilians already serve in our territorial defense forces. Some particularly enthusiastic ones have even been assisting the military in some of its operations.\n\nThis is good, and presents an opportunity for further expansion. Even if theyre not on the front, we must emphasize that it is every citizen's duty to defend their country and provide for the soldiers who protect it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_return_to_fundamentals_desc: "If we are to be successful in reclaiming West Russia - let alone all of the Motherland - we must bring the military up to modern standards, using whatever means we have. We will need to renew the army's leadership, while promoting new perspectives where we can. The army must become more professional, more disciplined, and more organized.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we will have to address the legacy of paramilitaries in our armed forces. Many of our soldiers came from quite radical backgrounds - therefore, we will need to instill discipline in them. To this end, they will be placed under the watchful eyes of our most reliable officers.\n\nSoon, they will understand who is in control here - and what is, and isn't acceptable."
 KOM_dem_smuta_foster_working_relationships_desc: "Our current manpower shortage means that we cannot be particularly choosy about who we choose to recruit. Many irregular units - primarily paramilitaries - are outside our chain of command, but will, without question, give us more mobilized manpower if integrated into our own forces.\n\nThis does not come without risk. We are integrating these men with few strings attached: many of these fighters were radicals who will bring problematic influences into our military, potentially undermining us. Nonetheless, we need men to fight, and these risks are worth the boost our armed forces will receive."
 KOM_dem_smuta_a_centered_capital_desc: "With the city of Vyatka now firmly in our hands, we can now begin the process of moving our capital there. It is in a significantly better location than Syktyvkar, and it will provide a suitable place to both organize our administration and prepare for future conflicts.\n\nVyatka has great potential: we will turn it into a proper center of government. Our most immediate task is to repair the damage from the war, but we'll also need to remove any imperial influences and fortify the city - preferably as soon as possible."
 KOM_dem_smuta_consolidate_gained_resources_desc: "West Russia has been void of productivity for the previous two decades. Not only has it been under constant aerial assault from Germany - but it has been managed improperly by fiefdoms and their masters who have had no concern for the wellbeing or will of their people. This ends now! With large swathes of land under our control, we now have the ability to make greater investments and build up what was lost. Industry, businesses, enterprise, infrastructure and all the necessities for a modern state are desperately needed.\n\nIt is the state's duty to ensure that our society provides for all of its people. Our actions and investments today and in the following years will decide whether we fulfil this promise, lest we fall again, either at the hands of other Russian pretenders who care only about power or worse - the Nazi menace."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_whatever_constitution_desc: "Our burgeoning republic has faced countless foes, many being from inside our own territory. Thus a constitution becomes increasingly important. It will maintain and secure our core values of democracy, equality and Russian sovereignty - making it more difficult for a wannabe despot to subvert the state.\n\nThis new constitution will also further legitimize our government as the legal successor to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, not because we are communists, but because this was the last legally recognized entity that held power over Russia. We have learnt many lessons from this old regime - what led to its downfall and what elements of it were successful. May this be a day remembered for centuries to become, where a new Russia finally grew its wings and began to take flight."

 KOM_stal_smuta_suspend_legal_protections_tt: "§RAnti-Republican organizations§! will no longer be permitted to stir dissent."

 KOM_stal_smuta_the_republic_militant_desc: "The struggle for Russian reunification has begun, with territory after territory falling under our control. Yet even as we fight to rebuild our country, we are hampered by the political chaos of the Komi Republic, where extremists on either side of politics seek to take power by terroristic means. Even in our new territories, unrest and radicalism simmer. Russia cries out for true leadership. Thankfully, there is a woman with the talent, vision, and strength to seize the reigns of history and restore order in our fractured nation: Svetlana Stalina."
 KOM_stal_smuta_restoring_order_desc: "The judicial process in Komi is fair, but also inefficient and slow. With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."
 KOM_stal_smuta_suspend_legal_protections_desc: "While many of the world's democracies enshrine freedoms such as the freedom of speech as sacred and untouchable constructs, they have their downsides. President Stalina does not despise freedom of speech, she merely wishes to ensure the survival of the Republic. As such, using an executive directive, the freedom of speech shall be suspended entirely, so that it may not be abused by radicals to spread hate and strife.\n\nThis is merely a temporary measure, and these legal protections shall be returned once the crisis is under control, we assure you."
 KOM_stal_smuta_seize_unregistered_firearms_desc: "As we have waged our war to reunite Russia and vanquish the warlords, we have increasingly found that many civilians in our newly acquired territories possess their own firearms. Russia has been a dangerous place in recent times, and we would not deprive our citizens of the right to arm themselves for protection and self-defence. Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."
 KOM_stal_smuta_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc: "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 KOM_stal_smuta_clear_the_streets_desc: "Street protests, violent crime, and other civil disturbances continue to plague our cities at precisely the time the campaign to restore Russia to greatness requires order and discipline. It is time to put a stop to such nonsense, by any means necessary. We will deploy the police, our greatest defence against anarchy, across the cities of Russia, and put an end to the chaos. Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."
 KOM_stal_smuta_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc: "Nothing is more sacred on this Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. There are elements within the Republic who seek to agitate amongst the people to reform democracy away, or to paralyze our Republic in the name of an end which is fundamentally against the principles of freedom for all. Whilst they fly banners that proclaim a commitment to the rights of the worker, instead they seek to strip away the agency of that very worker into an amorphous collective, and to cast down the Republic that protects the people. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_national_reconstruction_council_desc: "President Stalina needs a group of people to aid her in stabilizing Komi, and has found her solution in the form of the National Reconstruction Council. Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_queen_of_swords_desc: "President Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has come to Syktyvkar as a breath of fresh air, a competent and focused woman to replace the boorish populists of old.\n\nYet a Queen is only as good as her deeds and her nation. With a plan for rapid remilitarization and reclamation, Stalina wishes to save a nation from the extremism that has so cruelly broken it. Her Russia will be stable and reformed, rebuilt from ashes into a new and better land. Russia has always held the promise of superpower status - under Stalina, Queen of Swords, it will be."
 KOM_stal_smuta_to_embolden_the_nation_desc: "The people of Russia are tired of war. Trapped in an eternal battle, they feel lorded over by armies, foreign forces who pillage their lands and give little in return. Decades of poor rule by poor rulers have drained the morale from the people of Russia.\n\nYet this is no reason to give up the fight.

Through military reconstruction and service, we can show the people how their soldiers can come to their aid. Through improved training, we can be certain our army is loyal and just. In time, the people will come to see just how good their army truly is."
 KOM_stal_smuta_issue_the_fundamental_directives_desc: "The Komi Republic is beset on all sides by extremists, radicals and rabble-rousers who seek to undermine the stability of the nation, planning to destroy the rights of the common man in favour of building twisted "utopias" based on their ideas. This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 KOM_stal_smuta_sowing_the_seeds_desc: "As we begin the reclamation, a long list of tasks presents itself. We need to re-integrate the rest of Russia and make use of new land, utilize the new factories and involve the new people. It has become quite clear to us that what worked when we were small is insufficient as we continue to grow.\n\nWe must begin to reorient our economy, and the sooner, the better, considering the amount of work that needs to be done. It may be thankless work now, but the people will be grateful to us for having done it."

Even if theyre not on the front, we must emphasize that it is every citizen's duty to defend their country and provide for the soldiers who protect it."
 KOM_stal_smuta_guarantees_to_the_national_assembly_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. Some have even gone so far as to call President Stalina a dictator, and anti-democratic. What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."
 KOM_stal_smuta_extend_emergency_powers_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stal_smuta_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc: "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_crisis_calmed_desc: "Thankfully, due to all of our efforts to remove extremist ideas from our Republic the immediate crisis seems to have been calmed. However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our Republic is secured."

 ## These aren't used?
 KOM_stal_smuta_make_an_example_desc: "Our government has recently captured several extremist paramilitaries, whose ideologies have cost the lives of countless innocent souls. They continued to spread hate and destruction within our Republic, and are complicit in the cycle of coups that President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are attempting to end. They must be made an example, an example of the punishment reserved for spreading hate and discord, for propagating extremism and violence.\n\nTheir trials shall be quick, expedited through our new judicial policies. We shall line up these communists and fascists against a wall and eradicate their hatred from this world. May God have mercy on their souls."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc: "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

 KOM_second_election_start_desc: "With our liberation of the West, we are closer than ever to realizing the dream of the February Revolution: A truly democratic Russia. Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold the [KOM.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by Nikolai Voznesensky, the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Ivan Morozov. The [GetYear] elections are sure to be a close race, and whoever wins will decide the fate of West Russia for 4 more years. The race is on!"
 KOM_second_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc: "Voznesensky isn't perfect, but he's perfect for West Russia. The working man in Russia has no better choice than the founder of modern Russian democracy. The DSNP blends the best of old Soviet socialism with new democratic institutions to create a democratic socialist party that protects workers' lives and liberties.\n\nThe DSNP will get a head start on their election campaign. Voznesensky will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: ""West Russians, workers, countrymen, you have been liberated. Some of you have been liberated from noblemen, juntas, and collaborators who expected you to work to make them richer. Some of you have been liberated from authoritarian communists who valued you only for your output as a line item in a centrally planned budget. But now you have a true friend in your government. Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party."\n\nVoznesensky will go on a speaking tour in factories across the [KOM.GetName]. He will play to the party's industrial base and promote himself as a friend of the working class. By shoring up support from our core constituency, we should have a strong showing in the election."
 KOM_second_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "Since many of our voters are new to our party, it would be wise to teach them what we stand for. West Russia needs to know what our ideology and policies are if we are to win a mandate in the 1968 elections.\n\nThe DSNP will publish their party platform across the [KOM.GetName]. In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 KOM_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc: "The [KOM.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under the [KOM.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our Republic."
 KOM_second_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: ""While West Russians may now breathe free, the wolves lurking at our borders hunger for their blood. The DSNP and SMR may wax enthusiastic about their social 'reforms', but none of them can tell you how they'll keep you safe from an invasion. But our party has an answer: Funding the finest military in Russia."\n\nThe PSD will appeal to national defense in order to rally votes. They will unveil a plan to double defense spending and purchase state of the art equipment from overseas. Peace comes from superior firepower, and voters will know that only the PSD can keep the peace in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_second_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "The Komi Republic began with a dream; a dream that one day all Russia would be one, democratic, and free. A dream that prosperity would abound from Murmansk to Magadan, not because it was planned by party bureaucrats, but because Russia's leaders trusted its people to build it themselves. Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by the [KOM.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Ivan Morozov and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign. Morozov will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his beautiful vision of liberty and prosperity. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: ""You Russian students are the builders of the new tomorrow. The DSNP only cares for men who swing a wrench and the PSD chide you to 'follow your elders,' the same elders who let our nation fall to the Germans. I have a different message, dear youth: Russia needs you. It needs your creativity. It needs the diligence you show in your studies. It needs your mastery of the arts and sciences. Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture."\n\nMorozov will launch a speaking tour across the [KOM.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Morozov is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the [GetYear] elections."
 KOM_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Morozov is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save the [KOM.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across the [KOM.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 KOM_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc: "Campaigning season is over and the [KOM.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: Voznesensky's democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Morozov's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in the [KOM.GetName]."

 KOM_morozov_springtime_in_russia_desc: "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Morozov has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_democracy_desc: "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 KOM_morozov_freedom_and_fairness_desc: "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that Western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Morozov has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 KOM_morozov_survey_republic_elections_desc: "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our Republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 KOM_morozov_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc: "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 KOM_morozov_towards_a_shining_future_desc: "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_unity_desc: "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed, and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic elements of the PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 KOM_morozov_the_violet_platform_desc: "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 KOM_morozov_for_the_worker_desc: "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 KOM_morozov_the_sovereign_coalition_desc: "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently anti-communist, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereigntists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 KOM_morozov_for_the_people_desc: "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 KOM_morozov_a_show_of_cooperation_desc: "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_reform_desc: "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 KOM_morozov_assist_the_republics_desc: "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 KOM_morozov_cultural_exhibits_desc: "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Morozov has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 KOM_morozov_protect_natural_beauty_desc: "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 KOM_morozov_uplift_minority_rights_desc: "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 KOM_morozov_the_march_of_progress_desc: "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."

 KOM_morozov_the_russian_economy_desc: "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down, or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Morozov is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 KOM_morozov_establish_the_economic_zones_desc: "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 KOM_morozov_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc: "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 KOM_morozov_aid_for_the_farmers_desc: "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 KOM_morozov_open_the_republic_desc: "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 KOM_morozov_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc: "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 KOM_morozov_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc: "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals, and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 KOM_morozov_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc: "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 KOM_morozov_foreign_investment_incentives_desc: "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 KOM_morozov_project_kibersin_desc: "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Morozov is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project KiberSin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology."
 KOM_morozov_managerial_socialism_desc: "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 KOM_morozov_for_our_prosperity_desc: "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."
 KOM_morozov_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers, and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_morozov_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_morozov_unity_in_science_desc: "Science is the way to the future, but our progress in that direction has been halted. The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 KOM_morozov_a_bright_generation_desc: "President Morozov is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started. Russia's future lives and dies in the hearts of these future workers and intellectuals - in the generation that will shine brightest of all."

 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc_tt: "The §gPSD§!'s support base will §Roppose this measure§!."
 
 KOM_voznesensky_a_socialist_mandate_desc: "As Russia roils and bleeds around us, we must cling to the principles which have brought us this far: to the ideals of our Constitution. Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc: "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc: "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringes never again regain a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc: "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 KOM_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc: "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 KOM_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc: "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc: "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 KOM_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc: "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 KOM_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc: "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as "Democratic Hegemony", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc: "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the Republic would fall to extremism."
 KOM_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc: "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the Republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party its ruling place or even the permanent stability of the Republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc: "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc: "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October Revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our Republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, 'The Autonomy Question' as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as 'soft separatism' and 'subversion of ethnic equality', many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 KOM_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc: "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our Republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as "eroding the principle of universal equality the Republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 KOM_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc: "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 KOM_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc: "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia, it robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc: "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our Republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"

 KOM_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 KOM_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc: "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Western Russian Free Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 KOM_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc: "Several of our economic advisors believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the [ROOT.Getname], we have decided to try the 'capitalist turning into socialist' economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 KOM_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc: "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 KOM_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc: "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Western Russian Free Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the DSNP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 KOM_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc: "Here in the Free Republic we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 KOM_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc: "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 KOM_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc: "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc: "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc: "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 KOM_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc: "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 KOM_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc: "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 KOM_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunately, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings!"

 KOM_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc: "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 KOM_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc: "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 KOM_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc: "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 KOM_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc: "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our Republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 KOM_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc: "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 KOM_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc: "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 KOM_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc: "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers. But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."
 KOM_stalina_accept_the_big_tent_model_desc: "The PSD has been a "big-tent" party for the entire span of its existence, accepting a wide variety of policy positions, ideologies, and approaches towards getting things done within its membership. This unique structure has been instrumental in bringing us to power - it ensures that the entirety of the acceptable political spectrum is represented within our party. To work with other parties, therefore, is unnecessary. If the opposition wishes to achieve positions of power within the Republic, it will be through PSD institutions. There are plenty of opportunities to side with our party - to not accede to them is simply the choice of the opposition to weaken themselves."
 KOM_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc: "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 KOM_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc: "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 KOM_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc: "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 KOM_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc: "It is time for the signature policy of the PSD to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our Republic. If one wishes to gain access to our bountiful resources, one must make an arrangement with us to assist our military development. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 KOM_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc: "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say "enough!"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 KOM_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc: "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 KOM_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc: "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 KOM_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc: "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 KOM_stalina_a_united_russia_desc: "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 KOM_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc: "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."
 KOM_stalina_honor_the_republics_heroes_desc: "Due to our history as a unifier of Western Russia, our Republic is a Republic of heroes. Innumerable men and women fought to make our Republic whole and put down the tyrannical extremists and warlords that once blighted Russia from Arkhangelsk to Samara. After such service to our Republic, we, too, deserve to provide a service to our veterans and heroic soldiers. Veterans of the West Russian War and Unification Wars shall be taken care of, provided with a generous stipident as a reward for their service.\n\nAdditionally, this action presents a wonderful opportunity for the image of our party. Regardless of one's alignment within the PSD, all of our Deputies and regional politicians can at least agree on the fact that Russia's heroes deserve recognition. Let us assist them, and in doing so, assist the longevity of our party's administration."
 KOM_stalina_emphasize_shared_identity_desc: "Regardless of our heritage, be we Great Russian, Tatar, Jewish, German, or Ukrainian, we are all united in our participation within our democracy, and our residence within the Republic. Whilst the politicians of the left and right may call out to silence peoples solely for their faith or ethnicities, we have the position above all of them, atop the pinnacle of democracy. Our policy regardign ethnicity, thusly, shall focus on the fact that all of us are citizens of the Republic - participants in the grand democratic experiment that has already liberated so much of our Motherland.\n\nWe may call ourselves Great Russians, or Tatars, or Ukrainians - but, in heart, we are all equal in patriotic humanity."
 KOM_stalina_redeeming_our_history_desc: "The streets of the Republic were no longer a battleground for feuding radicals, nor were political assassinations a viable way to mark the passing of the days. The leadership of Svetlana Stalina had cleaned up the behaviour of the people, but it could not wipe away their opinions. The debate of how the history of our Republic should be discussed has become a contentious subject in the halls of legislature, with many calling for a focus on the "Glory of Russia". They say that leftism and division has diluted the common identity of the Russian people, and desire for that to be rectified. The Left has mobilised their political capital against this, but it's the Right who holds the keys to power that are needed for the unification of Russia."
 
 KOM_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 KOM_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "Our state exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 KOM_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc: "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 KOM_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc: "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 KOM_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc: "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 KOM_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc: "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 KOM_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc: "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 KOM_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc: "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 KOM_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc: "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 KOM_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc: "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 KOM_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc: "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 KOM_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc: "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 KOM_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 KOM_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 KOM_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."

 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc: "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 KOM_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc: "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 KOM_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc: "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the Republic in its moment of weakness."
 KOM_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc: "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 KOM_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc: "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the Republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 KOM_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc: "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the President being formally codified."
 KOM_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc: "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the two-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 KOM_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc: "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 KOM_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc: "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 KOM_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc: "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stalina_empower_the_party_desc: "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 KOM_stalina_public_concessions_desc: "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 KOM_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc: "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the Republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstruction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 KOM_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc: "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 KOM_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc: "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 KOM_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc: "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our Republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 KOM_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc: "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the Republic will choose between a new President and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the Republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."

 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc: "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc: "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 KOM_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc: "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 KOM_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc: "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 KOM_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc: "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 KOM_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_navy_desc: "Many years have passed since Russia had a navy she could be proud of. Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc: "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 KOM_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc: "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 KOM_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc: "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 KOM_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc: "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 KOM_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc: "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 
 KOM_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc: "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_open_the_gates_desc: "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 KOM_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc: "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like fascism and National Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of authoritarian regimes."
 KOM_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc: "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as "just another warlord state". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, Britain, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 KOM_democratic_embassy_funding_desc: "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_call_for_investment_desc: "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 KOM_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc: "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the western side of the Atlantic."
 KOM_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc: "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [KOM.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 KOM_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc: "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

 KOM_third_election_start_tt: "The §Yelection season§! shall reach its most intense phase.\n"

 KOM_third_election_start_desc: "It is time for a new election! The usual suspects are running fierce campaigns to make their way to the top, and as always, only one will become Russia's helmsman for the next few years.\n\nOf course, considering our current position as master of Western Russia, whoever wins the presidency is likely to go down in history as the one who finally made the nation whole again after nearly thirty years of strife. Such a fact is not lost on the contenders, who each have their own ideas of how the reunification should play out..."
 KOM_third_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc: "The People's Democratic Socialist Republic has always been a powerful force in the Republic's politics, ever since the party stood beside Nikolai Voznesensky when he founded it. However, the party has also been a consistently divisive topic, as Voznesensky has proven to be a problematic figure at even the best of times.\n\nA newcomer, Alexander Yakovlev, wishes to change the party's troubled reputation. He is now running a campaign based on ideals of democratic socialism, free from the mistakes made by the party in years past. Only time will tell if his bold promises will pay off."
 KOM_third_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: "The DSNP, above all, serves the working class of the Republic. This is no reason to grow complacent, however, as the other parties are already seeking to encroach upon our most important base of support.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev already has plans to tour the industrial centers of the nation, and to publicly shake hands with the most influential workers' councils of our cities. With the councils on our side, we may have an easier time organizing future campaigns. Most importantly, however, this show of good faith will restore the workers' confidence in our party, and once again solidify our voter base."
 KOM_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "The DSNP has long been an advocate of democratic socialism, even during the days of the Voznesentsiy. However, certain compromises in these ideals had to be made to ensure better cooperation with the coalition to stem the tide of radicalism. Now that the storm has passed, the time has come for a new platform to reaffirm our commitment to socialism.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev has given the party the green light to make public this new platform, which is far more radical than anything we have seen before. It calls for a renewed push towards a democratic transition towards socialism, as well as a strict adherence to radical workers' rights policies. Women's rights, which were always present but never really the main focus, have been reemphasized as part of the party's goals. These policies may be seen as a bold shift towards the far left, but Yakovlev is confident that this new direction will revitalize the party for years to come."
 KOM_third_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc: ""Citizens of the Republic, listen to me!"\n\n"Long has our nation been broken by the Germans, forced to cower beneath the shadow of the Kaiser and the Führer! Well, I say on this day, no more!"\n\n"No more will we cower beneath the German, no more will we suffer from its wrath! No, today we stand against the German and those who seek Russia to remain fractured!"\n\n"We fight to make sure no son or daughter of Russia will ever watch the Luftwaffe reign hellfire from the skies! No more, for I swear that if the PSD is elected, we will unify Russia and take Moscow back from the German scum!"\n\n"So who will stand with me? Will you fight for your nation and make sure our flag is known on the world stage?""
 KOM_third_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "The Sovereign Democratic Party was founded at a time when Komi faced threats largely from within. It was a call by those who would see democracy preserved from the radicals, by any means necessary. Some in our party argue that our purpose has been served. No longer do radicals threaten to steal our freedoms. Instead, the officials of the PSD argue that we must look outward. Effective immediately, the party's platform for the upcoming election will incorporate a strong, pro-unification message. How the nature of Russian legislation will be left largely in the hands of local politicians. The focus of the national government will be on a massive rearmament program, which will improve industry, infrastructure, and provide employment to hundreds of thousands of Russians. Who can compete with that?"
 KOM_third_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: "Just across the A-A line lies our occupied homeland. Long ago, Bukharin's Soviet Union fell to the Germans and occupied the heartland of our country. Later, Vorishilov's West Russian Revolutionary Front tried to take it back, but the West Russian War and the Republic's independence led to the war's eventual failure.\n\nHowever, now we have an opportunity. While we can not invade the remnants of Moskowien right now, we can start to press the issue of the border to the general public. Troops will be sent to ensure the warlords who have emerged do not invade the Republic and Russian refugees are taken care of. We can not take back what is rightfully ours so long as our flank is exposed, but we certainly can make our case known that all of Russia, including Moskowien, is rightfully ours."
 KOM_third_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "It's election time once again in the Republic, and the Union of Young Reformers has a serious chance of achieving victory. Naturally, a winning strategy will require a winning campaign, emphasizing issues that Russia's voters see as relevant to their own lives and choosing popular policies in response to them. But, as the question always is, what to choose?\n\nRussia as it stands is backwards, uneducated, and globally isolated. It has been so for decades, and voters no doubt want things to change. Here is where the SMR can present its recipe for the nation's recovery: expanded investment in education, free trade policy so capital can flow into Russia once again, and the construction of robust ties to the Free World. May Russia's rise to global prominence mirror our rise in the polls."
 KOM_third_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: "The SMR's philosophy emphasizes the values of openness, humanism, and intellectual achievement. Unsurprisingly, this makes the middle classes and the intellectual elite natural bases for the party. Any successful campaign will involve mobilizing voters of higher status, whether material or educational, to the polls in order to beat the other parties' rabble, and voters don't simply turn out because of similar social class.\n\nThe SMR needs an effective infrastructure that can mobilize this base, and the best way of doing so is by meeting them where they are. Sending campaign officials to donors and universities will allow us to build the party's connections to voters just in time to shepherd them to the polls."
 KOM_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Ivan Morozov was a very principled leader, and he helped raise Russia's new democracy from infancy. However, he still held onto obsolete ideals, elements of Russia's Soviet past; while his methods were liberal and democratic, his ends were socialist, even if they were less so than Voznesensky or the extreme left. This element of the SMR was already vestigial when Morozov was in office, and it is now time to move on.\n\nThe new platform will invoke our earlier ideals of freedom, both in speech and in markets, and of sensible international cooperation, while quietly abandoning Morozov's leftist sympathies. While some voters may be upset by the transition, others previously hostile to voting for a socialist should more than make up the difference."
 KOM_third_election_let_the_race_begin_desc: "As election is upon us, hordes of citizens can be seen rushing schools, public offices and other polling places in order to let their voices be heard by the high instances of power. While they place their trust and hopes of a better future by voting for their preferred parties and candidates, the countdown starts as Russia's future is decided by its people."

 KOM_smr_reforms_for_russia_desc: "West Siberia has fallen to the Free Republic. With the task our generals had accomplished, it is time for our economists to do their jobs bringing the Republic's bounty to the region.\n\nKonstantin Katushev lived through the Soviet Union's downfall, and then survived the political machinations of one of its many successors, fully believing in one fundamental truth: that reform once elevated old Russia into a superpower.\n\nAnd reform shall soon restore new Russia as one."
 KOM_smr_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Katushev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with [Root.Capital.GetName]'s finest."
 KOM_smr_reorient_kibersin_desc: "Project KiberSin has been bearing fruit in Western Russia. The data received from the computers has proven invaluable in advancing our economy onto the world stage. However, currently our KiberSin infrastructure is limited to Western Russia, and we now have annexed a large amount of territory that is in desperate need of economic recovery programs.\n\nIn order to make the Western Siberian economy more efficient and more effective, our President has proposed for increased funding to be allocated to Project KiberSin, and for additional KiberSin offices to be constructed in key locations across Western Siberia. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated territories, but they will serve as a prime opportunity to re-orient some of KiberSin's priorities in a more modern and consumer-oriented direction. With additional capital investments in the program, Project KiberSin may, instead of adhering to outmoded etatist principles, serve as a means of developing our domestic technology market and increasing domestic communications capacity."
 KOM_smr_subsidize_energy_concerns_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. With the inheritance of these regions, however, we have nationalized many concerns on a provisional basis. In order to ensure an efficiently managed energy sector, these provisionally state-run energy concerns shall be privatized and placed in the hands of firms which demonstrate responsible practices and a commitment to effective management. Creating private-sector jobs in the energy industry will do wonders for the economies of the newly-integrated Western Siberian region, and ensure significant growth potential in the years to come. In addition, generous subsidies shall be provided to these concerns whilst this process is underway, to prevent shocks to the market causing a disruption in our energy supplies. Whilst costs may be higher short-term, the long-term potential present shall make this investment pay off in time."
 KOM_smr_invite_international_capital_desc: "As a developing nation, despite its size, the Free Republic has much to offer prospective foreign investors. Specifically, our abundance of natural resources and ongoing projects to allow for market-oriented development and investment opportunity in the energy-sector.\n\nTo build capital and ensure a timely development of our nation's economy, selling resources on the international market at fair rates and entering domestically-produced products into the international market via eliminating needless trade barriers should be carried out without delay. Additionally, foreign investors shall be invited to Russia, to tour our cities, resource deposits, and growing native industries. An influx of foreign capital shall invariably follow, lifting our people out of poverty, developing national infrastructure, and improving quality of life en masse."
 KOM_smr_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states, and ensure that opportunities are offered for all people to achieve a standard of living once unheard of in those blighted days."
 KOM_smr_approach_the_siberian_liberals_desc: "Despite the recent integration of Western Siberia, the various administrations of the region have not disappeared. While some of the politicians are far too dangerous to allow into our democracy, especially considering the tumultuous history our Republic shares with extremists. However, some of these administrations are filled with sensible enough people.\n\nBoris Yeltsin, a politician from [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk], has been a democratic advocate for some time now, and we welcome him and his colleagues with open arms. Similarly, the liberals of Zlatoust can be relied upon for political support. We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 KOM_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc: "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 KOM_smr_crafting_our_future_desc: "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 KOM_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc: "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 KOM_smr_new_conservationism_desc: "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."
 KOM_smr_a_hand_to_the_west_desc: "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 KOM_smr_flying_together_desc: "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Katushev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 KOM_smr_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "Once upon a time, Konstantin Katushev's erstwhile allies would have scoffed at his vision opposite the Assembly's aisle. Their opinions no longer matter now - but for posterity's sake, he has had the last laugh.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Katushev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 KOM_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc: "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today [Root.Capital.GetName] and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 KOM_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods.

Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 KOM_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 KOM_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 KOM_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 KOM_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc: "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying [Root.Capital.GetName]'s ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adversaries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 KOM_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc: "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 KOM_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc: "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 KOM_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc: "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberian Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc: "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_tt: "§YInvestments§! shall be made across §Rdisadvantaged regions§! to increase §Geconomic parity§!."
 KOM_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc: "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 KOM_dsnp_flying_together_desc: "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Yakovlev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 KOM_dsnp_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "Four times have our fellow socialists derided the methods we abide. Four again have results bade them peace.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Yakovlev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 KOM_psd_the_sovereign_mandate_desc: "We just secured a new mandate spanning the entirety of Russia. We must use it to spread our fair democracy to our brethren in West Russia as well as our new residents in West Siberia. Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 KOM_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 KOM_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population. Our citizens often criticize our military expansion, which leads to conflict between civilians and the government. A new welfare program should both strengthen the Republic and quell the many disputes arising between our people and the administration."
 KOM_psd_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Through our military conquests we have captured many sources of oil. We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens. It would be beneficial for us to create our very own oil and gas administration to manage the energy resources we have gathered. Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 KOM_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia. We need to establish a central bank that can invest in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, anything to enhance our public finance. Having this kind of investment fund will pull us closer to the economic prosperity we need to produce a strong Russia and help our citizens live wealthy lives."
 KOM_psd_siberian_security_desc: "Our conquests in West Siberia not only gave us more resources to work with, but we also have more potential threats to handle. Political opponents still remain throughout the deserted region. We must make sure the residents of Siberia are held to the same nationwide standards as everyone else, while getting rid of the dreaded Tyumen and Black League terrorists. It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."
 KOM_psd_the_association_registry_act_desc: "With an ever-growing population of Russians from across Eurasia, there is bound to be a few political dissenters here and there. We must make it clear that some of these ideologies will not be tolerated, as they are against the principles of human liberty. We should pass an act that requires all former members of the Communist Party and Black League to disclose their membership so that we know who these dissenters are. Any person who was once affiliated with either party and refused to disclose it will be arrested."
 KOM_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_desc: "We look to the East and find our newly acquired West Siberian region, a place where trade once reigned as Yevgeny Dragunov made a fortune selling his guns to the long-extinguished warlords. We could learn a few lessons from his government's former administration. We need to partner up with Zlatoust's former bureaucrats and businessmen to solidify our control of the region, while also scouting for people who are experienced in administrative positions."
 KOM_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_tt: "The Zlatoust magnates may §Ypolitically align§! in a §Mdifferent direction§!."
 KOM_psd_extending_democracy_desc: "We have been growing powerful in our little corner of the world, and some in our administration even say we're approaching World Power status. It seems like our mission of spreading democracy to all of Russia is finally starting to pay dividends. Our people could always use a morale boost to get them working harder, encouraging them to go beyond the imaginary limits that once confined us to our portion of Russia. We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 KOM_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc: "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 KOM_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc: "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections. We will establish a framework for regional referendums to ensure that the public majority still supports our cause even if we somehow lose the next vote. That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."
 KOM_psd_further_ofn_ties_desc: "Many members of our government watched the rise of fascist and communist regimes with their own eyes, and we all watched chaos ravage what was left of the Soviet Union. Even today, we often witness the brutal oppression set forth by the Nazi Party and the Empire of Japan. Our democratic brothers in North America and Australia work to defend the fledgeling democracies around the world, and we want to join their ranks one day. To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions."
 KOM_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc: "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 KOM_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc: "The Reconstruction Government now controls all of Western Russia, with the recent annexation of Western Siberia. However, Western Siberia is marred by terrorism and the aftermath of extremist regimes. Tyumen's Communist Party and the Black League need to be hunted down and exterminated. Once that is done, we can build a decent administration in the region, that will facilitate our eastern expansion. It will be hard work, but President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are used to hard work at this point."
 KOM_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc: "The people of Russia need something to trust, something to keep them safe, something to support. We need to show them that we are the party of strength, stability, and national pride. We need to secure the people's support, because without it Russia will surely fall to extremism. Therefore, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved increased production of propaganda, and bribing off every semi-important public figure we can find. Once the people are surrounded on all sides by praise, they will have no choice but to support the Reconstruction Government."
 KOM_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 KOM_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc: "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 KOM_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 KOM_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 KOM_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western Siberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerrilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 KOM_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc: "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 KOM_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc: "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 KOM_stalina_redefining_politics_desc: "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side."
 KOM_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc: "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 KOM_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc: "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 KOM_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc: "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee. To acquire this guarantee, the National Sovereignty Act can be used as leverage, since the United States is always willing to work with those who provide them the economic incentives to do so. With America's guarantee, the Motherland's bright and prosperous future will be ensured."
 KOM_stalina_look_to_challenges_ahead_desc: "The Reconstruction has accomplished a great deal, and now Western Siberia is fully integrated into our Republic, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead that we must face. However, with the combined power of our strength and our principles, we can move forward. We can unite the Motherland. We can bring stability to her people. We can turn the Motherland into a titan, ready to avenge her humiliation, and liberate Moscow and her citizens. We can achieve all of this, and the Motherland will finally be free from the shackles that extremists placed upon her."

In order to maintain her popularity, and continue her administration, §gPresident Stalina§! must find a way to keep the §gPSD§! in line - or be willing to face the consequences of a split.\n\nThe §gPartiya Suverennoy Demokratii§! is currently [GetPSDStatus]([?KOM_PSD_unity]) and is [GetPSDLeaning].\n\nThe §WProgressive§! wing of the party is [GetPSDProStatus]([?KOM_PSD_left_power]).\nThe §BNationalist§! wing of the party is [GetPSDNatStatus]([?KOM_PSD_right_power])."

While extremism in the Komi Republic will be crushed soon, we have created a dangerous precedent by repressing organized political movements with force, and no one knows how this development will impact the future of our nation."

 KOM_unrestricted_arsenal_desc: "Beneath the city of Syktyvkar lies a practical treasure trove of Soviet technology and weaponry. Vats and canisters of lethal 'revenge weapons' were stored here before the Front collapsed, and they have found new usage amongst the defenders of the Republic. The gas is potent, and the ability to scorch the lands of our enemies is an effective tool.\n\n§RAnd Hell shall follow in its wake.§!"

Their sympathisers clash with the most gentle of our comrades in vicious brawls that engulf the pubs and coffeehouses of Syktyvkar. As more of our brethren bleed from these puny militia's increasingly frequent and violent thrashes with our soldiers, they become an increasingly problematic nuisance, that aggravates against the very foundations of our republic, and threatens to completely upend our precious way of life-a nuisance that must end, no matter the cost."

A clique of military tyrants that have abandoned any pretences of civilian and soviet rule, a force of reaction and stagnation scheming to end our revolution and subvert us to their militant desires.

 komiintro.0.t: "The Republic"
 komiintro.0.d: "The Komi Republic - a rare democracy within the Russian Anarchy. Almost unique for a statelet in the bomb-ravaged west, the Republic functions as an independent nation-state, with a formalized economy, political system, and the closest thing to free elections that one is likely to get in West Russia.\n\nEver since the foundation of the Republic in the wake of the West Russian War, putting an end to the political violence that plagued Syktyvkar beforehand, the Republic has stood strong, its borders spanning from the Vychegda to the Vyatka Rivers, and its economy managing to grow slowly and steadily.\n\nHowever, the foundation of the Republic did not end the woes of Syktyvkar and the Komi region in general. The city of Syktyvkar, during the West Russian War, gained a reputation as a cutthroat and critical node of the Front's governing apparatus. Former political prisoners and ideologues were set free to ply their trades in the city, as the authority that ran their former prisons dissolved. Political refugees from all corners of West Russia fled into the Republic - socialists and republicans from Vyatka and right-wingers from Arkhangelsk mingled freely in the teeming capital of the Republic.\n\nKomi is known for its democracy, indeed, but the results of this reputation as a place of freedom has acquired an ugly side - the paramilitaries.\n\nThe streets of Syktyvkar are infamous for their bouts of political paramilitary violence, protests and riots. With the second national-level election approaching in late 1963, this violence has only been growing, and many of the citizens of the Republic wonder - can democracy survive in Komi, or is it doomed to fall to despotism like the rest of the Russian anarchy?"
 komiintro.0.a: "We shall bear the torch forevermore."

 komiintro.1.t: "The Custodian"
 komiintro.1.d: "The workday of Nikolai Voznesensky passed in an unbearable, soul-crushing yet in no way carefree routine. Only having reached the threshold of the presidential residence with his leisurely step, the President was immediately caught in the intrigues and schemes of the Komi politics, dealing with the chaos that engulfed the newborn Republic. The chaos to which he no less than the radicals he despised.\n\nIn a short moment of distraction, Voznesensky could not help but indulge himself in reminiscences about the early days of the Republic, the time when everything seemed so easy, so achievable. The applauding crowd in the speech hall, the lowered Soviet flag, the cheering demonstrations for the new era in the Russian democracy - it looked so vivid and yet so dissonant with his new reality.\n\nThe idealistic memories of the birth of the Republic were darkened by the image of Zhdanov, a Janus-faced and smug creature accompanied by Suslov, the Mephistopheles in flesh, all sitting next to him on the round table and waiting for their share in the newly founded state. He held nothing but contempt for them, but even being charitable to his past actions, he was honest at least to himself about his own role in enabling the Communists, in their corruption of the young democracy.\n\nPerhaps, all of it could be done differently. The Republic didn't have to surrender to the Communist demands in exchange for the false sense of security. It didn't have to be a welcoming haven for the pitiable scum who found no place for themselves but in Syktyvkar. Whether what could be done, it is much too late. The past was the past. All that mattered was that Voznesensky had to carry his unenviable burden alone, clumsily maneuvering in the web that enveloped Komi.\n\nThe sound of gunfire behind the window helped to sober his reflections. Sighing in response to the habitual barbarity he grew used to a long time ago, Voznesensky took a folder in the bosom and put on his coat. Leaving the residence, he took a long way to his house, to the opposite side of the road where another street fight occurred."
 komiintro.1.a: "It is still worth it. It has to be."
 
 komiintro.2.t: "The Peacemaker"
 komiintro.2.d: "The meeting was mostly going as planned. Ivan Morozov was discussing various topics with several of the more right-wing members of the democratic coalition. The discussions of future cabinet positions went fine, with Morozov mostly satisfied with the various compromises made. He had managed to squeeze in a few more candidates from his own party, the Union of Young Reformers. He discussed upcoming campaign strategies, seeing which districts would have more or less funding from which parties, and working to discuss ways to penetrate some of the more radical districts. However, Morozov was not surprised when the mention of political radicals derailed the meeting.\n\n"Those communists are going to tear down all of the progress we've made in the name of their so-called 'people's revolution!' Popular my ass, our democratic coalition is the only thing keeping Komi from falling to wanna-be despots!" exclaimed one politician, and it seemed many of those present agreed with him. He continued on, "And what is Voznesensky doing, huh?! He's cuddling with them! The DSNP are destroying this coalition, and I won't stand for it!" This could get out of hand, a fracture in the coalition could seriously damage their performance in the elections, allowing the radicals to gain power. Morozov had to do something.\n\n"Friends, colleagues, I understand your fears, truly, I do. I myself am wary of Voznesensky's weak stance towards extremism. However, endangering the coalition's unity is not what the Republic needs, we must instead look at our alternatives," Morozov paused briefly, "Voznesensky has led our Republic for some time, and Komi has grown considerably under his leadership despite the bombings. However, Komi, I feel, may need someone new in charge. Someone who can truly heal Komi of its most infectious disease. Elections are soon, friends, and we stand for democracy, do we not?" Morozov had been thinking about the elections a lot recently, and the idea of becoming President was becoming more and more seductive. Either way, it seems his colleagues were pleased by his little speech, and it seems disaster had been averted for now."
 komiintro.2.a: "If we wish to see the sun, we must weather the coming storm."

 komiintro.3.t: "The Defender"
 komiintro.3.d: "Svetlana Stalina looked down at the shuffled papers on her desk, as the lights flickered once more. She barely noticed, instead running a finger along a neatly-written note in one of the margins.\n\n'Future Mayoral Candidate?', it said, next to a grainy photo of a smiling woman.\n\nShe nodded to herself. She would be perfect. Another name went down on the list she was assembling - another person to contact, to fund, and align. One more for the endless lists of personnel that the governing coalition employed to keep the Republic running.\n\nA thought flickered through her mind - an image of her combined proposals for appointments. What a government that would be! Free of radicals and subversives, free of corruption, and dedicated to the Republic over all else. Men and women who knew, above all, that there was a greater good to work towards.\n\nAs she placed the list to the side, and looked absently at the now cold cup of tea that was sitting forgotten on the other side of her desk, she wondered just how her personal path had ended here. Her transformation from the young decadent party-goer that she resented so much, to a dedicated public servant.\n\nIt did not matter, she decided. It was merely a matter for a record, to be consigned to distant memory.\n\nAs always, in personal development and politics, the true important thing to think about was the ends - the now, and the future."
 komiintro.3.a: "It will all pay off, someday."

 komiintro.5.t: "The Paragon"
 komiintro.5.d: "The door swung smoothly to the side as Anatoly crept into the house, slowly letting out a terrified breath. Clutching the pistol at his side, he advanced down the hall, ignoring the quiet chatter of the bodyguards in the other rooms. They wouldn't dare disturb their master while he slept, he hoped, prayed, even. As he reached the last door, a plain, wooden thing, and wrapped his shaking hand around the knob, Anatoly felt a small smile creep onto his face. This was much easier than expected, wasn't it? All he had to do was shoot an old, sleeping man in the head, and it would be done. The Republic would be free of a devil.\n\nAnatoly entered the small bedroom, squinting in the dark as he raised his pistol at the dark mass on the bed -\n\nThe first shot hit Anatoly in the hand. The next in the knee. He squealed in pain as he snapped his gaze towards the darkened corner the shots had come from, nausea rocking his stomach as he met the gaze of his target, sitting comfortably on a leather chair.\n\n"Come now," Mikhail Suslov intoned, barely above a whisper. "Surely you didn't think no one's ever attempted to kill me before?" Anatoly opened his mouth to speak, to jeer the famed shadow master of Komi; all that exited his throat was a whimper. Suslov shook his head. "A shame. Usually Gumilyov's lambs are made of sterner stuff."\n\nHe pulled the trigger again, and Anatoly saw no more.\n\nSuslov stood from his chair, sliding the still-smoking pistol back into his jacket, gaze fixed on his bodyguard as he burst into the room. "Leave him on the steps of the National Assembly. Gumilyov hasn't gotten the message yet, it seems.""
 komiintro.5.a: "Perhaps another demonstration is in order."

 komiintro.6.t: "The Visionary"
 komiintro.6.d: "The winds blew cold through the Komi night, as the shadow tramped through the field. The snow crunched beneath his feet until he reached the ideal spot. The night was clear and silent, perfect for his surreptitious observations. He placed the long case in the field, withdrawing the tripod, deftly expanding it, and attaching the telescope to the top.\n\nHis nighttime adventures were a risk, of course. Suslov had expressed concern for his safety, fearing assassination attempts from the Passionariyy. But if even Comrade Suslov's men did not know of his excursions, how dangerous could it be?\n\nGlancing into the telescope, Andrei Zhdanov's mind wandered. Far away from the lights of Syktyvkar, that snake pit of intrigue and violence, he found serenity in the gentle movements of the stars. Perhaps out there, lay hope. Other beings who overcame their petty infighting and defeated their worst qualities, an example for humanity to follow into a new age. Freedom from want, freedom from conflict, and freedom from ignorance lay within the grasp of humanity. It was such a shame that it had been squandered for so long, on the petty conflicts of the last decade and the great battle with the backwards, regressive Germany.\n\nBut soon, the time would come. His vision would guide Russia, and the world, into a brave new era. And mankind would be free."
 komiintro.6.a: "The way forward lies in our hands."

 komiintro.7.t: "The Seeker"
 komiintro.7.d: "Svetlana Bukharina smiled cordially for the fifth time at the fifth representative; shook his hand, promised a bright future working together, and stepped away for the fifth time. They never asked her anything about herself, she noticed, only her father. "Your father would be so proud," They'd say, "If only he could see you now," to which she'd smile and agree, promising to follow in dear old Nikolai's footsteps.\n\nShe wasn't so ignorant. This meeting was a productive one, though not for the reasons the rest of the Communist Party thought. It wasn't a mere get-together for her, no, this was a valuable opportunity to learn who the true threats in Komi were, and more importantly, how they could be taken down. The man who had just spoken to her, she noticed with some grim satisfaction, was a coward. The second she'd disagreed with him on a minor dispute, he'd backed down and apologized thoroughly. Someone like that was a follower, not a leader.\n\nSerov had watched her carefully, as expected. A fearsome man, for sure, but he hadn't considered that his prey would be watching him just as carefully. What she took the most interest in was the man's apparent disregard for common Communist Theory - the way he spoke reminded Svetlana of what little Nazi propaganda she had suffered through in the past.\n\nThe Party was nearing a breaking point, she concluded at the end of the night. Zhdanov and Suslov, for all of their attempts to enforce unity, could not control everyone. Serov would be the first to go, she reasoned, but certainly not the last. A new rising star in the party would be a welcome sight for many, a reassurance that the glory days of the Union were not all lost.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina would be that, but unlike her dear father, she wouldn't let Russia slip through her fingers."
 komiintro.7.a: "A new player enters the game."

 komiintro.8.t: "The Trailblazer"
 komiintro.8.d: "Ivan Serov watched the streets of Komi from his apartment, a frown creasing his face as he watched the sheep mill about below. He hadn't slept well in weeks, and so he had developed this habit of watching the city below, pondering his existence. He was a socialist, he reasoned, always among the most loyal in the entirety of the NKVD, so why did he have so many doubts of late?\n\nHe was always proud of Russia, nationalistically so, even, but surely that was merely because of their former status as a great socialist power? And certainly not in the same way as the Italians, or even the Germans? He shook his head. No, he was better than them, wasn't he?\n\nBut why shouldn't one be devoted to their home above all else? Perhaps the Union wouldn't have fallen if they had fought with the same brutal pride that the Nazis did? Serov felt a churning of doubt within his gut, one that had only intensified over the past weeks. Perhaps he wasn't wrong? Maybe, just maybe, it was Suslov and Zhdanov were misguided about such questions?\n\nMaybe Serov could teach them his new ideas?\n\nA smile crossed his face as he considered, and for the first time in what seemed like years, the churning in his guts lessened. He would lead the Communist Party, and Komi with it, to greatness.\n\nHe stormed to his desk, placed a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter, and began.\n\nWith this, he would change socialism forever."
 komiintro.8.a: "An innovator, or a madman?"

 komiintro.9.t: "The Crusader"
 komiintro.9.d: "The speaker atop the stage smiled warmly at his audience. They had been so leery, so unreceptive when he was first introduced. Eurasianism had never quite caught on in the Komi Republic, apart from in his own clique. It wasn't that he or his ideas were an unknown quantity in the Republic - quite the opposite. His infamy was likely the reason that the evening of lectures had been boycotted by Komi's leftists and democrats. And yet, despite everything, he still stood facing a packed theater - one that was conspicuously devoid of hecklers.\n\n"Often," he said, moving into the end of his lecture, "I am thus interrogated: 'Lev Nikolayevich, you call yourself a rightist, yet you advocate against the very things that all true rightists stand for! You do not stand for the church, for the supremacy of Russia, for the glory of the Tsars! What, then, can you possibly offer the people of Russia?'"\n\nThe audience remained silent - but it was a silence of rapt attention. The speaker continued. "People of Syktyvkar, you have heard me speak at length tonight of concepts that I do not expect any of you to grasp: Eurasia, Passionariyy, the will to change. You came here expecting to hear an alternative to the corrupt and inefficient democracy imposed upon us. I will confess that I am more comfortable explaining myself through the written word, but for the benefit of those not similarly inclined, allow me to elucidate my message as clearly as I can..."\n\nThe room remained silent, and the speaker knew he had them. "I envision a power to eclipse any that has preceded it. A continent-spanning project wherein the greatest strains of the motherland's ethnicities are forged into an indivisible whole, capitulating only to the singular authority of the state. Not a weary old empire, where a single ethnos seizes power only to stagnate and fall before a mightier foe, but a supra-national entity - the summation of all that has come before it. It will not merely be the Russians and their strengths, but the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs, the Mongols, the Buryats, and so many more! All of us, inheritors of a combined legacy, standing together under a single banner: the Eurasian State!"\n\nAs the audience exploded into applause that was more than merely respectful, someone leaned over to his friend and asked innocently: "Pavel, what was that guy's name again?""
 komiintro.9.a: ""Gumilyov. Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov.""

 komiintro.10.t: "The Organizer"
 komiintro.10.d: "Igor Shafarevich looked at the window, as the sun slowly crept into the room, an uninvited intruder. Candlelight spilled over to his drafting table, as its glow lost luster. Shafarevich puffed his lips to blow it out, then stopped. Now was not the time for that. Not when he was approaching completion. He took up his pencil and leaned closer to the drawing board. This particular street was difficult to optimize, and it might be better to remove it entirely. Eraser at hand, he wiped it off the map. Much better.\n\nHe adjusted his glasses, discarding his pencil for a pen. He took a step back, seeing his work in its entirety for the first time since last night. To Shafarevich, it was beautiful. Ordered roads, with its sidewalks and pavements, made precisely to accommodate not only the people of Syktyvkar but also to compensate for its population growth. Everyone in Syktyvkar could get from one point to another in less than an hour's travel time. He put the tip of his pen onto the drawing board.\n\nOthers in the National Assembly had mocked him before. The lines on two streets intersected. He reached out to his eraser, finding it in his pocket after a few moments of frantic searching. He erased the obstacle, rearranging them to bear each other's weight, one incoming, one oncoming. This proposal might not get anywhere, considering the political nature of the Republic, but the work was its own reward. Now onto this sidewalk, and unto this pavement, as he drew in his lines and dotted in points along with them: streetlights.\n\nAll of this done, Shafarevich decided to test his creation. The walk from his home to the National Assembly was fifteen minutes. He picked up his pencil again, tracing it along the new route. In his head, his mind ticked. Two meters a second, average walking speed. Nine, ten. Ten minutes! Now for the next step. Much property destruction would be involved in the realization of this plan, and he laid the original design on top of his. Taking out his notebook, he began to count."
 komiintro.10.a: "Sufficient measures..."
 
 komiintro.11.t: "The Regent"
 komiintro.11.d: "A cold wind blew through the creaking old church, sending candlelight dancing across the face of the Theotokos set high upon the altar. Her eyes and those of her child stared down at the supplicant kneeling before them, his lips constantly moving in quiet prayer.\n\n"O Heavenly King, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, Who art everywhere and fillest all things; Treasury of Blessings, and Giver of Life - come and abide in us, and cleanse us from every impurity, and save our souls, O Good One."\n\nSergey Taboritsky paused and shivered as a frigid draft swept over him, its bite sending chills through his old bones. "Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us. Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us. Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us..."\n\nThe cold pressed in, piercing the immaculate old Tsarist uniform he wore. Its golden collar felt like a manacle of frozen iron around his neck, and the fine silk lining did nothing to shield him from winter's bite. He grimaced, gritted his teeth and opened his eyes, lifting his head to stare directly into the eyes of the Blessed Virgin. In response, he felt the flame of faith roar to life inside him again, driving the cold from his body. He gasped at the sudden intensity of its heat, but stayed perfectly still. There was a presence behind him, a pair of reassuring hands on his shoulders, gentle whispers in his ears. Moisture gathered in his eyes, and he closed them again, recognizing the familiar sensation for what it was.\n\n"Keep him safe, O Lord," he uttered, speaking directly to the presence. "Watch over our blessed sovereign. Return the Tsarevich to us, when the time comes. Give me the strength to carry out my sacred task, to defeat your enemies, to restore this land to what it should be. I beg you - stand with me, O Lord, and help me save Holy Russia.""
 komiintro.11.a: "God save Russia."

 KOM.1.t: "A Free Agent"
 KOM.1.d: ""Glorious people of the Komi Republic, the time for movement is now! In this world, and even in this Republic, the boot of so-called revolutionary action haunts the people with their lies. They are in our homes, our streets, and they are ready to take action. We must move first, for this Republic must not falter."\n\nConcluding her speech, silence fills the room for but a brief moment before thunderous applause reaches her ears. It seems her message has gotten through.\n\nSvetlana Stalina, a devoted new politician, has quite quickly climbed the byzantine ladder of influence in the Komi Republic, and her messages of anti-revolutionary zeal and revenge against the German menace that plagues the fields of Russia has resonated with at least a sizable portion of the masses. Now, she has become a major political asset in the ever-so complicated political field of Komi, and even opponents of her have come to concede it."
 KOM.1.a: "A most magnificent showing."
 KOM.1.b: "I sense a darkness within her..."

 KOM.2.t: "Stalina Advocates for Stronger Measures"
 KOM.2.d: ""My fellow Deputies, the enemies of our Republic lie around us. They lurk in the darkness, awaiting their opportunity to strike at our foundations and collapse the structure that has held this nation together. We cannot wait! We cannot wait for them to enact this evil plan! We must make the first move - and battle them through any means necessary."\n\nAlthough the sounds of applause filled the chamber almost immediately from Stalina's portion, hushed whispers and glances dominate the rest of the group. The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation. Whether that is true or not, however, does not matter. Svetlana has already made her move."
 KOM.2.a: "Could it be necessary?"

 KOM.3.t: "Disorder from the Left?"
 KOM.3.d: "A malaise hangs in the air for the leftist bloc. Since Stalina's proclamation of destruction of the enemies of Komi, activity has become different than usual. Impromptu, emergency meetings between legislators and paramilitary members. The politicians move unlike anyone has seen them before - with haste and alarm. The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior. Their movements are further mixed up, the graffiti on walls becoming less and less prevalent, and the members themselves encrypting their communications however they can. The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."
 KOM.3.a: "The cracks show."

 KOM.4.t: "Morozov Endorses Stalina's Plan"
 KOM.4.d: "The legislation chamber was tense. Stalina's measures had generated plenty of unease within the lawmakers, and all in the room awaited the next person to speak, hoping for some sort of resolution or agreement - anything to break the mold. The next person to speak, the economical genius Ivan Pavlovich Morozov, highly respected within the democratic Deputies, only intensified the feeling of tenseness.\n\n"Friends and gentlemen, action is necessary. Miss Stalina's plan is necessary. We cannot let the enemies of our beautiful republic destroy our resolve, nor can we let them extinguish our flame. For the security of our democracy, this must happen. Miss Stalina, in fact, should become a critical asset to the party in this matter, and we should all appreciate her guidance as well as her plan of action."\n\nAlthough there was a decent amount of applause, especially from those allied to Morozov, other members, specifically Voznesensky's wing, were more doubtful. After all, wasn't Stalina with them?"
 KOM.4.a: "Let them associate freely."
 KOM.4.b: "Could this be a violation of party unity?"

 KOM.5.t: "A Pact in Secret"
 KOM.5.d: "Following Morozov's speech, the legislation chamber took a five minute rest and discussion period. To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n"Morozov, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all."\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Morozov stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the Republic - through whatever means necessary."
 KOM.5.a: "Let's hope it isn't needed."

 KOM.6.t: "Unity, for Now"
 KOM.6.d: "After the session and Morozov's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber. The two most influential democrats, the economical masterminds of Komi, the fire and saviours of the Republic must meet.\n\nAlthough the purpose was a brief negotiation, both men proceeded to lose track of time. By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Morozov retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."
 KOM.6.a: "We must stand together!"

 KOM.7.t: "The Thorn in Our Eye"
 KOM.7.d: "Voznesensky shifted his gaze around. It was another meeting of the Voznesentsi, and it was a centrist politician's turn to speak. As he spoke, Voznesensky became interested, and as the wheels in his head turned and turned, became perturbed. Although the politician's words were not important, his affiliation was. His mind raced, and his eyes began to take on a knowing glow. One name appeared in his consciousness, again and again.\n\nZhdanov.\n\nIt was a secret. For now. Confined only to a group of a few people. But if it ever got out - Voznesensky shuddered. Just imagining Morozov's reaction was enough. Then again, Zhdanov was an immeasurably precious asset to him, and if he needed his help, he would get dead air in response.\n\nThe politician finished his words. But he was not focused on the next generic speaker. Voznesensky had to choose..."
 KOM.7.a: "Speaking to him was a mistake in the first place."
 KOM.7.b: "He is too valuable to cut ties with."

 KOM.8.t: "Cutting Ties"
 KOM.8.d: "As Voznesensky penned "Sincerely, Nikolai Voznesensky" to his paper, he let out a sigh of relief. The weight of his burden would forever be lifted, and he could rest. No more connections, no more ties, no more association. Voznesensky would be free.\n\nCalling a trusted courier into his office, he ordered the young man to send the letter straight away - his purpose would be official state business, and the contents classified. He placed faith in the deliverer to complete his task timely - for Voznesensky did not know how long these ties could last before being thrust, in an intrusive display, to the unaware public.\n\nThe young courier nodded his head at the command, and was dismissed straight away. His duties were evident to both men, and it was best for him to start accomplishing it. As he left, Voznesensky smiled. Relaxed now, he sat back into his chair and muttered."
 KOM.8.a: "Severance, at last."

 KOM.9.t: "Our Connections Leaked!"
 KOM.9.d: "A crisis has engulfed Komi! Although this headline is not a new one, the details of this particular story have interested both the public and the politicians alike.\n\nAn unknown 'associate' of Nikolai Voznesensky has come forward with damaging information about him - in particular, his connections with a certain radical socialist named Andrei Zhdanov. The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken. Voznesensky now must face the consequences of his actions, and has already come to a solution regarding how this mess will be handled."
 KOM.9.b: "This never happened."

 KOM.10.t: "Admitting Fault"
 KOM.10.d: ""Friends of the party and of the Republic. I am aware that you all now know of the allegations regarding my ties to Zhdanov. I must say, with complete truth, that these ties have existed, and-"\n\nShocked exclamations and murmurs filled the chamber as the depths of the situation sunk in to the politicians in attendance. For a solid minute, anarchy ruled over the chamber as arguments began over Voznesenky's true loyalty, only ending when the head of the session declared order be held in the Assembly.\n\n"These ties have existed, yes. But these ties are now cut. And they will remain cut for good. My loyalty is not to Zhdanov, but to this Republic we preside over. I implore you all to consider this. Thank you."\n\nThe politicians look over at him, all eyes boring down upon Voznesenky. The fate of his leadership relies on them. And now, they must vote on it."
 KOM.10.a: "The Party will decide your fate."
 KOM.10.b: "The Party will decide your fate."

 KOM.11.t: "Finding Forgiveness"
 KOM.11.d: ""Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nAnticipation rocked the air as the first hands went up to mark him innocent. After taking the census, the hands now went up to mark him in contempt. Somewhere in Voznesensky's eyes, a glitter showed up.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky, the votes have been counted... by a margin of one hundred and twenty two to seventy eight, you have been found absolved of any crime revealed by these documents presented before us." Voznesensky couldn't help but crack a smile. A closer margin than he would have liked? Sure. Yet, despite the turmoil, he was free."
 KOM.11.a: "Lenient, perhaps."

 KOM.12.t: "There Will Be No Forgiveness"
 KOM.12.d: ""Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nThe result was quick to arrive. By a margin of one hundred and sixty to forty, Voznesenky was found guilty of his crimes against the Komi Republic, and will be held in contempt of the legislation chamber. Voznesensky's expression was neutral throughout the vote, revealing nothing of his inner mind or plans. But his expression did not matter anymore. His fate has been sealed, for the talks of removing Voznesensky from power have already begun in the room - and they show no signs of letting up."
 KOM.12.a: "No peace. No respite. No mercy."

 KOM.13.t: "Covering the Evidence"
 KOM.13.d: "The sounds of whitewashing broadcasted itself to an almost empty woods. As the shovel dug on, and the briefcase stood firm in the slight moonlight breeze, the man couldn't help think of the circumstances that led to this point. He had obtained the documents, yes - he sent loyal assistants to take care of that. Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake. It was for the good of the Republic, he imagined, as the shovel did the last shoveling of its dirt."
 KOM.13.a: "Bury it deep."

 KOM.14.t: "A Leak into a Downpour"
 KOM.14.d: "Voznesensky placed his head down on his desk. An unfortunate courier had delivered news of another set of documents revealed to the public. Not the first time the news was brought to him, Voznesensky simply sighed and dismissed the messenger, muttering a curse word to him under his breath.\n\nEver since the evidence was disposed of, the Republic, and the Voznesentsi in particular, have been wracked by yet another political crisis. This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."
 KOM.14.a: "Could it be unstoppable?"

 KOM.15.t: "Hunting the Source"
 KOM.15.d: ""Gentlemen and ladies of the party. The accusations that befall me are quite obviously untrue. Yet despite this, these rumors continue to flow, and damage our wonderful republic. Due to this..."\n\n"This man is a traitor!" outbursts a Deputy, and the entire chamber erupts into chaos. The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. "Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors. Whoever it is, we will find them, and justice will be served."\n\nThe members, coincidentally Voznesenky's most trusted advisors, have already been selected, and the investigation now begins."
 KOM.15.a: "Come out, come out..."

 KOM.16.t: "The Party Compromised!"
 KOM.16.d: "Voznesensky and his investigative committee glanced at each other with suspense. Progress has been minimal so far into the investigation, and no leads produced conclusive results.\n\nThe tension was shattered with the bursting of a door, and the rushing of a committee member into the room. "The damned Soviet bastards! They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 KOM.16.a: "Drop the hammer!"
 KOM.16.b: "There will be no hasty moves."

 KOM.17.t: "The Democrats' Purge"
 KOM.17.d: ""The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov" began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the Republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 KOM.17.a: "How many could there be?"

 KOM.18.t: "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 KOM.18.d: "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies were in a state of hysteria. Accusations flew like never before, hostility was palpable, and all worried about the ties of even those persons sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with all eyes weighing up Stalina in disquiet. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually ceased, and some token applause was offered. Most, however, were worried by Stalina admission that a conspiracy as they feared was not beyond her means. Perhaps it would be best not to think on it too deeply."
 KOM.18.a: "Ironic."
 KOM.18.b: "She isn't wrong."

 KOM.19.t: "A Plot!"
 KOM.19.d: "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 KOM.19.a: "Can we stop it in time?"

 KOM.20.t: "A Smoking Gun"
 KOM.20.d: ""Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the Republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 KOM.20.a: "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 KOM.20.b: "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 KOM.21.t: "Blackmailing the Problem"
 KOM.21.d: "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita. "With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..." Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife - "Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 KOM.21.a: "Just what he deserves."

 KOM.22.t: "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 KOM.22.d: "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our Republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 KOM.22.a: "He will not be missed."

 KOM.23.t: "The Innocent Verdict"
 KOM.23.d: ""He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 KOM.23.a: "An innocent on our conscience."
 KOM.23.b: "Retract the story!"

 KOM.24.t: "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 KOM.24.d: "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Ivan Morozov and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Morozov and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 KOM.24.a: "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 KOM.25.t: "The Vote of No Confidence"
 KOM.25.d: "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Komi Republic. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 KOM.25.a: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.b: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.c: "Out with the old?"

 KOM.26.t: "Deprecated"
 KOM.26.d: "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Morozov or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Morozov blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the Republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 KOM.26.a: "A new name to learn..."

 KOM.27.t: "Morozov Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.27.d: "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Ivan Pavlovich Morozov, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Komi Republic. Vowing to steer the Republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Komi Republic."
 KOM.27.a: "A change for the better?"

 KOM.28.t: "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.28.d: "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Komi Republic. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 KOM.28.a: "Let's see how she does."
 
 KOM.2800.t: "Voznesensky Endures!"
 KOM.2800.d: "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now." As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands." The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..." Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 KOM.2800.a: "How does he survive?"

 KOM.29.t: "Discrediting the Leakers"
 KOM.29.d: ""Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 KOM.29.a: "Truth? It does not matter."

 KOM.30.t: "The Party Fades"
 KOM.30.d: "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."\n\nThe meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back.\n\n"These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 KOM.30.a: "A small price to pay."

 KOM.31.t: "The Popularity Debate"
 KOM.31.d: "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic parties among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the coalition has become full of worriers and defeatists," the DSNP candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is virtuous - but it is fragile, when faced with extremism and growing disregard for the very foundation of our Republic." Stalina comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our Republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists, in the name of preserving our homeland from hatred and tyranny. That is all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Morozov to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Stalina is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists - the uncommitted citizens who have been unfortunately waylaid by impossible promises - we may be able to draw them into support for democracy. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 KOM.31.a: "Voznesensky is correct."
 KOM.31.b: "Morozov has the best argument."
 KOM.31.e: "Stalina presents the optimal solution."

 KOM.32.t: "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 KOM.32.d: "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan... or rather, the lack of one," he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 KOM.32.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.33.t: "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 KOM.33.d: "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic parties from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."\n\nWhile the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Morozov's plan will be put into motion."\n\nIvan Morozov is a rational man. While he believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, he also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic parties. Morozov's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Stalina's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under his hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 KOM.33.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.34.t: "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 KOM.34.d: "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 KOM.34.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.35.t: "Stalina's Compromise"
 KOM.35.d: "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers.\n\n"Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes."\n\nAfter a moment, the moderator looked at the box. It wasn't even close.\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Stalina's plan has been passed."\n\nStalina is a woman who was determined to defend democracy. In her view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the Republic. Anti-extremist measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media" will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And, with this, in her eyes - the Republic would be saved."
 KOM.35.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.36.t: "A Message from Zhdanov"
 KOM.36.d: "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short. "I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these." He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 KOM.36.a: "You're welcome... comrade?"

 KOM.37.t: "Taking the Internal Files"
 KOM.37.d: "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 KOM.37.a: "What could go wrong?"
 KOM.37.b: "We've seen this one before..."

 KOM.38.t: "The Informational Arsenal"
 KOM.38.d: "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 KOM.38.a: "Perfection!"

 KOM.39.t: "Better than the Others"
 KOM.39.d: "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration." He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 KOM.39.a: "Thanks, but no thanks."

 KOM.40.t: "Suslov's Secrets"
 KOM.40.d: "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his Chief of the General Staff, and Yegor Ligachev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to police around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Comrades Ligachev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile." The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Yuri Andropov, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist Party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union.\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Arvids Pelshe, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 KOM.40.a: "A treasure worth any price."

 KOM.41.t: "A Plan Foiled?"
 KOM.41.d: "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 KOM.41.a: "Perhaps we'll never know."

 KOM.42.t: "Zhdanov's Favor"
 KOM.42.d: "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely." Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-" He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai." Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 KOM.42.a: "Do we have a choice?"

 KOM.421.t: "Reporting for Duty"
 KOM.421.d: ""Comrade Oplesnin-..." The phone call failed, a common occurrence in Syktyvkar that the Deputy who once dispatched from the Halls of the Kremlin never quite grew used. Pestered, Zhdanov made another attempt: "Comra-..." This second call ended up sooner than the last one. Zhdanov would rather not make a call in the afternoon when all the few lines available are busy with bureaucrats trying to request papers from their managers. Still, the issue was too important to be postponed, so he dialed again. "Comrade Oplesnin..."\n\n"Comrade Zhdanov, is that you, my old friend?"\n\nOn the other side of the line, there stood a tired old man who seldom left his dacha these days, yet who, throughout the decades, saw more battles than half the Republic's military. General Oplesnin knew what Zhdanov wanted with that call. However, he didn't see himself as fit for action anymore; he had led his life like he led his battalions to the frontlines, marching forward with pride and effort only to be torn apart by enemy artillery. No one could be more tired of combat, pain, and glory. But then his eyes caught sight of his Order of Lenin at the wall, awarded by Zhdanov's hand, and set his mind remembering...\n\nThe triumph of the Revolution would be the only thing great enough to justify it. All that fighting would be a vain waste of many lives, including his own, if not redeemed by putting Russia at the hands of the workers. After some more dialectical confabulation, the general gave his caller what he wanted "Comrade Zhdanov, my life is at the hands of the Party."\n\nNikolai Oplesnin took his old uniform out of the closet and got himself properly dressed. If he would be a soldier again, he should make himself feel like one. His first battle would be against the General Staff's telephone.\n\n"General Nikolai Oplesnin, presenting himself for duty.""
 KOM.421.a: ""I am ready for any assignment.""
 KOM.421.a.tt: "§YNikolai Oplesnin§! becomes a general."

 KOM.422.t: "Nighttime Suspicions"
 KOM.422.d: "It was the dark of night when Pyotr Grigorenko, the Republican military's Chief of Staff, telephoned Svetlana Stalina. He had deliberated about the call for some time, worried that she would be disturbed from sleep, and thus unreceptive to his imperative.\n\nHe need not have been. Barely one ring had passed when the call was answered, and the voice all in the Republic knew well answered him decisively. Like himself, Stalina was most active during the nighttime hours, finding them free of distraction and an optimal time to accomplish work. Equally aware of her disdain for wasting time, he got right to the point.\n\nNikolai Oplesnin had been appointed to the Republic's General Staff. His General Staff. And he was most concerned. The man was both qualified and proficient, true, but that was not his worry. Oplesnin's past was. It was impossible to overlook his activities under Bukharin's regime and, thus, his potential ties with the WRRF.\n\nGrigorenko was both surprised and heartened by Stalina's immediate agreement. She shared his concerns, particularly those concerning the absolute necessity of preventing communist infiltration of Republican state organs. Oplesnin had to be watched, closely. They, therefore, quickly came to an agreement of coordination.\n\nIf only the Republic as a whole could be so decisive as Stalina was, Grigorenko thought as he replaced the receiver."
 KOM.422.a: "Keep a close watch."

 KOM.43.t: "The Chaos Increases"
 KOM.43.d: "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!" Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!" "Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?" Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything." "You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 KOM.43.a: "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 KOM.43.b: "Send them in, mop them up."
 KOM.43.c: "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 KOM.44.t: "No Need to Panic"
 KOM.44.d: "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the Republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 KOM.44.a: "The problem solves itself."

 KOM.45.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.45.d: "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 KOM.45.a: "Concerning..."

 KOM.46.t: "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 KOM.46.d: "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 KOM.46.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"

 KOM.47.t: "Embracing the Moderates"
 KOM.47.d: ""The poll numbers are up, for once." Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 KOM.47.a: "Something good comes out of this."

 KOM.48.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.48.d: "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 KOM.48.a: "Concerning..."

 KOM.49.t: "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 KOM.49.d: "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the Republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 KOM.49.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"

 KOM.50.t: "Peace Through Superior Firepower"
 KOM.50.d: "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 KOM.50.a: "Do us proud."

 KOM.51.t: "A Cordial Request"
 KOM.51.d: "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov" was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the President of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldiers gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 KOM.51.a: "Why would we?"
 KOM.51.b: "Let's try it, at least."
 
 KOM.52.t: "A Propaganda Surge!"
 KOM.52.d: "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. "Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the workers' revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots!"\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 KOM.52.a: "Damnation!"
 
 KOM.53.t: "Suspicions within the Party"
 KOM.53.d: "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 KOM.53.a: "Another trap!"
 
 KOM.54.t: "Silver Bullet Holes"
 KOM.54.d: "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 KOM.54.a: "The only upside..."
 
 KOM.55.t: "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 KOM.55.d: "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 KOM.55.a: "Could it even work?"
 
 KOM.56.t: "A Bloodless Victory"
 KOM.56.d: "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshares is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."
 KOM.56.a: "A surprise, but a welcome one."
 
 KOM.57.t: "Silent Contemplation"
 KOM.57.d: "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 KOM.57.a: "Useful, someday."
 
 KOM.58.t: "Svetlana's Theories"
 KOM.58.d: "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the President of the Republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Morozov. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."
 KOM.58.a: "We need her more than ever."
 KOM.58.b: "We can't afford to need her this much."
 
 KOM.59.t: "A Victory for Publicity"
 KOM.59.d: "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door.\n\n"Yes, you can enter."\n\nThe President did so.\n\n"Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."\n\nThe older politician smiled.\n\n"Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food."\n\n"Only if you pay, Comrade President.""
 KOM.59.a: "Let's hope there's no backlash."
 
 KOM.60.t: "A Victory for Internal Affairs"
 KOM.60.d: "The President continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."
 KOM.60.a: "We should calm her down some."
 
 KOM.61.t: "Suslov Rampant"
 KOM.61.d: "As the conflict between the centrist government and the far right militia escalates, troubling news are spreading from several areas of Syktyvkar. As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."
 KOM.61.a: "Damnation!"
 
 KOM.62.t: "A Reconstruction Government?"
 KOM.62.d: "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Chairman Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."
 KOM.62.a: "Perhaps we can do it... if needed."
 KOM.62.b: "This is too far."
 
 KOM.63.t: "Considerations"
 KOM.63.d: "The heads of the DSNP and SMR, as well as the Chairman of the National Assembly, have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the three men's heads. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Chairman Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 KOM.63.a: "Placated, for now."
 
 KOM.64.t: "A Meeting on the Side"
 KOM.64.d: "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Morozov's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the Republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Morozov would support the young politician's proposal."
 KOM.64.a: "Perhaps a new approach is feasible after all."
 
 KOM.65.t: "Zhdanovite Connections Revealed!"
 KOM.65.d: "Morozov often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nMorozov folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Morozov break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 KOM.65.a: "A traitor at the very top...?"
 
 KOM.66.t: "Beginning the Investigation"
 KOM.66.d: "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Morozov's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the President of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the President would deny everything. Stalina and Morozov's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 KOM.66.a: "Ask him for answers. Now."
 KOM.66.b: "There's no need for confrontation."
 
 KOM.67.t: "The Confrontation"
 KOM.67.d: "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Morozov sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 KOM.67.a: "Oh?"
 
 KOM.68.t: "A Stable Partnership"
 KOM.68.d: "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Morozov. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Morozov slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the President to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize." The President shook her hand."
 KOM.68.a: "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 KOM.69.t: "The Conspiracy"
 KOM.69.d: "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Morozov and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Morozov on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 KOM.69.a: "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 KOM.70.t: "Approaching the Left"
 KOM.70.d: "Stalina's affinity with the social democratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Chairman Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the DSNP to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the President spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 KOM.70.a: "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 KOM.71.t: "Our Cover Blown!"
 KOM.71.d: "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe President casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Morozov. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Morozov first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the SMR's leader. Morozov was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the President and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Chairman Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe President didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 KOM.71.a: "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 KOM.71.b: "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 
 KOM.72.t: "Burying the Dirt"
 KOM.72.d: "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Morozov's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\nIt was all they could do... But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Morozov of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Morozov and Stalina."
 KOM.72.a: "May it never again arise."
 
 KOM.73.t: "Traitors to Democracy?"
 KOM.73.d: "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Morozov had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 KOM.73.a: "Can Komi be saved?"
 
 KOM.74.t: "A Successful Ploy"
 KOM.74.d: "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 KOM.74.a: "Make it so."
 
 KOM.75.t: "The Confession"
 KOM.75.d: "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Morozov decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Morozov's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of SMR, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?" once both were alone. Morozov sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Morozov began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 KOM.75.a: "Is it enough?"
 
 KOM.76.t: "The Leak Revealed"
 KOM.76.d: "The thought could initially be put aside by Morozov. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the President and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Morozov's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the President figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Morozov didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nMorozov called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 KOM.76.a: "How is this possible?"
 
 KOM.77.t: "The Eye of the Enemy"
 KOM.77.d: "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Morozov or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Morozov's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Morozov's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Morozov's theory.\n\nMorozov was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the President of being a Zhdanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the President that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the President, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or President Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."
 KOM.77.a: "Plots and maleficence, everywhere!"
 
 KOM.78.t: "Reigning in the Party"
 KOM.78.d: "Suslov walked a little easier these days. Even with his legion of spies in the government, it was never simple to determine why exactly the democratic parties did anything they did. Their leaders, although allies and mostly friendly to one another, jealousy hoarded their considerable personal influence. As a result it was a rare event for anyone to claim ownership of an unpopular policy such as ending the pressure on the far left.\n\nNo matter the cause, the end of the war on the far left let Suslov move more easily. Aggressive and ambitious underlings had pressured their boss to move violently against the government and far-right. Now that the bloodshed and propaganda war was over, a lot of Suslov's loyalists were free to crack some skulls and twist some arms to re-establish order. The fact he had calmly weathered the storm gave Suslov a lot of credibility, for now the left stood strong and the government appeared weak."
 KOM.78.a: "They will not fall to revisionism."
 
 KOM.79.t: "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 KOM.79.d: "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the President. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe President listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 KOM.79.a: "He's gone too far."
 KOM.79.b: "Let's keep this between us..."
 
 KOM.80.t: "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 KOM.80.d: "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The President watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 KOM.80.a: "There will be blood."
 
 KOM.81.t: "The Split Front"
 KOM.81.d: "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 KOM.81.a: "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 
 KOM.82.t: "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 KOM.82.d: "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 KOM.82.a: "Allies across the lines."
 
 KOM.83.t: "A Traitor?"
 KOM.83.d: "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Morozov was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the President managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the President must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky. The President was proving himself to be a liability to the democratic cause, and some sense needed to be talked into him... Or imposed at gunpoint, if necessary."
 KOM.83.a: "Peace must come first."
 KOM.83.b: "We are done with talk."
 
 KOM.84.t: "The Militarists' Confrontation"
 KOM.84.d: "Voznesensky looked at them benevolently, his eyes rising above a pile of paperwork. "I was told Rodionov would be present, yes?"\n\nMorozov shrugged. "He has a cold today. Voznesensky, we came here today about the ceasefire with the left. This shit can't go on." The President cocked an eyebrow. "The left is rising in power every day. I can't take an evening walk without bumping into Suslov informants. We've had their paramilitary on the ropes with the campaign against them, and now you let them escape? If we don't destroy them now they'll relieve us of our jobs."\n\nThe President closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, his reply was confident..."
 KOM.84.a: ""There will be no compromise!""
 KOM.84.b: ""You see, this was the plan all along...""
 
 KOM.85.t: "No Compromise!"
 KOM.85.d: ""I understand your concerns. But I'm not budging on this. During our campaign on the communist we began hemorrhaging territory to the far right. We need to crush the fascists if this republic is to last the year. If you have other concerns, feel free to bring them up to me now. Otherwise, this lovely pile of paper requires presidential signatures."\n\nMorozov and Stalina were taken aback. Voznesensky waited expectantly for another round of argument. However, his colleagues stiffly offered him goodbye and left. The President sighed and returned to the task at hand."
 KOM.85.a: "What is he hiding?"
 
 KOM.86.t: "Voznesensky Folds"
 KOM.86.d: ""I understand your concerns. But this has just been a temporary plan. Our men are waiting for the communist to surge out against the fascist before we turn on them. From the start I didn't trust the communist to uphold any bargain made. Thus, this method of finishing them off while also repulsing the far right's attack."\n\n"I see." Morozov said. Stalina's expression remained difficult to interpret. Was she buying his excuses? "We'll let you to it, Voznesensky. Sorry for bothering you. I might drop by later when the time comes to send the orders to turn on the reds, yes?"\n\n"It would be my pleasure. We'll send the encrypted orders over the radio to our commanders." Said the President, his eyes already back to his tax forms. Morozov and Stalina left without any further word."
 KOM.86.a: "We can all get along, no?"
 
 KOM.87.t: "The Leak"
 KOM.87.d: "Commander names, streets, positions, hours. The radio broadcast over public frequencies didn't arouse much more than curiosity from the average civilian. But to anyone invested in Komi's great game, the communication was crystal clear. The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."
 KOM.87.a: "How could this be?!"
 
 KOM.88.t: "The Infiltrators"
 KOM.88.d: "The scale of the leak was titanic. To betray the deployment order of every democratic paramilitary, one would need men inside every brigade. This was the only way to break every secret cipher in a single twenty-four hour period.\n\nNot only had Suslov infiltrated the highest level of the democratic parties, the democratic paramilitaries were deeply compromised as well. The government had no secret left to fight back against the far left's puppet master."
 KOM.88.a: "A nest of traitors and spies!"
 
 KOM.89.t: "All Quiet from Zhdanov"
 KOM.89.d: "Voznesensky removed the brick from the wall and rummaged inside the hole. Nothing but his original message attempt.\n\nSince the disastrous radio leak, it had been impossible to reach Zhdanov. None of the usual dead drop locations had seen any activity. Voznesensky was tempted to use the emergency channel they had reserved for immediate communication. But Zhdanov's continued silence communicated a message in itself. The President burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick. Instead of closing up the dead drop, the politician threw the brick as far as he could. The projectile hit a distant lamppost with a loud "thunk". "When has everything gone so goddamn wrong?" Voznesensky thought bitterly."
 KOM.89.a: "The final betrayal."
 
 KOM.90.t: "Rumors of a Rising Star"
 KOM.90.d: "Komi's great game of politics has always ran on a steady diet of rumors. Knowing what one's opponents are doing is crucial if one desires to remain in the game. Of course, filtering out signal from noise is a skill all by itself. Tall tales, baseless speculation and hearsay are common fodder for the various intelligence agencies, and it takes time to sift through everything.\n\nThe latest craze is a rumor that an influential politician from Gorky has travelled the wastes to reach Komi. Depicted as a natural political genius and charismatic orator by the rumor mill, few agree as to what this arrival means. The most popular conclusion is that Suslov, the far left's mastermind, is likely behind it."
 KOM.90.a: "Another communist power-player?"
 
 KOM.91.t: "The Rise of Ponomaryov"
 KOM.91.d: "As it turned out, the man from Gorky was not from Gorky after all! Boris Ponomaryov, as the man's name turned out to be, was born in Shakhovskoye. The small village in what was once Ulyanovsk Oblast, nowadays the KONR controlled Samara government, has another famous child in the form of Mikhail Suslov. An interesting coincidence, perhaps? Few in Komi's shaky democracy would believe this.\n\nWhatever his origins are, the charismatic Ponomaryov has been making the rounds. His speech lambasting the democratic coalition's unwillingness to deal with the far right have been popular through large swathes of the population. This newcomer rides on a wave of discontent, and is likely to be one of the prime communist candidates in the next elections."
 KOM.91.a: "Now, what do you hide...?"
 
 KOM.92.t: "The Veil"
 KOM.92.d: "A charismatic new communist candidate from Suslov's old stomping ground is too much of a coincidence for the democratic coalition's higher ups to swallow. Suslov's command of Komi's far left is ambiguous and hard to measure. Perhaps the slippery shadow might have made a pact with a charismatic front-man to enhance his control of the party?\n\nThe young Republic's policemen would of course never stoop so low as to run private investigations on the enemies of the current government. But monitoring the coming and going of new political figures definitely falls somewhere in their priority list. Better, then, to run some background checks on this new figure."
 KOM.92.a: "We must pierce it!"
 KOM.92.b: "There is no point."
 
 KOM.93.t: "A Revelation"
 KOM.93.d: "The detectives were dismayed to find that in the end Ponomaryov was... terribly dull.\n\nA paper pusher in Suslov's foreign ministry during the West Russian War, Ponomaryov fell of the face of the earth during the ensuing collapse and anarchy. Not too surprising, as the front's disintegration had seen tons of people claim authority in those first few years of the anarchy.\n\nThe man reappeared a few year laters when the situation had stabilized. Through fragmented communication Ponomaryov had managed to reach out to his old boss Suslov. As the man still resided in the WRRF's territory, it seems that Komi's communist had told him to stay there as a liaison agent with the WRRF's officer clique. A few years passed before Suslov recalled him back home. Upon arrival in Komi's capital, Ponomaryov had begun his political efforts.\n\nOutside of his speeches, Ponomaryov was a terminally boring man. Nothing more than another Suslovite automaton it seemed.\n\nThe police continued their investigation. Perhaps a few more scraps of dirt could be gathered on him. For matters of state security, of course."
 KOM.93.a: "Just another puppet..."
 
 KOM.94.t: "The Trail Fades"
 KOM.94.d: "Ponomaryov's private life was filled with scandals, as it turned out. When drinking with his friends, he often skipped paying for his round of drinks. Last year, a terrible cold had left him stuck at home for a week, and rumor had it that a local young woman with pretty clothes had brought him soup for the week.\n\nWell, not terribly important scandals. The police investigators were running out of leads on him. And in Syktyvkar, being too nosy could always carry an unexpected price. The far left's counter-intelligence agencies had likely expected the police to come sniffing around their man. Pushing too hard would not be a good look for the supposedly impartial governmental officers.\n\nThe police thus ended its inquiry. Boris Ponomaryov was just another communist politician hopeful. The government had other business to tend to. Hopefully the newcomer was not dangerous."
 KOM.94.a: "This must be Suslov's doing!"
 
 KOM.95.t: "Increased Fascist Activity"
 KOM.95.d: "Komi's far right had always been a force to be reckoned with. Not as big as the government's democratic militias, nor as big as Suslov's web of far-left nogoodniks, the fascist militias had still maintained a respectable fighting strength. Drilling their men frequently and accumulating as many weapons as possible, the far right had earned their place as the third pillar of Komi's defense forces.\n\nFrom there, the fascist paramilitaries had adapted themselves well to the stalemate. They acquired a few quarters of the capital for their own purposes, and often clashed with democrats or communists. Their big break had been given to them by the government's recent battles with Suslov's forces. Under garrisoned communist or democratic districts had been taken over by the far right. Weapon convoys rolled between various fascist sectors as every area the far right got its hands on was reinforced by fresh militiamen.\n\nIn parallel to the military offensive had come a propaganda offensive. The democrat's pathetic attempt at crushing the decadent far left would come back to haunt Komi, the radio announcer claimed. Had the communist not squandered two opportunities to defeat the Germans already? The democratic coalition was impotent to stop the spread of the communist blight. Only hard men could manage these difficult times. The take over of new areas by fascist militias was only preventive, meant to save citizens from the communist menace. So went the far right's propaganda campaign."
 KOM.95.a: "Where one falls, another rises."
 
 KOM.96.t: "Left-Voznesentsi Threaten to Split!"
 KOM.96.d: ""This is an outrage! Even as a rising tide of fascism threatens to drown the Republic, the government insists on fighting the communist? Has President Voznesensky gone mad? Or is he merely capitulating to the fear mongers of the liberal and conservative party?"\n\nThe speech was booed by the majority of the democratic party. But a worrying percentage of the social democratic representatives cheered the speech. The majority of the social democrats' left wing had been grumbling for weeks now that the fascists were left free to rampage. Now the grumbling had ended and an openly mutinous feeling had swept through the left of the Voznesensti. Rumors of a motion to end the campaign on the far left had spread through the assembly. Worryingly, rumors of mass defections to the communists had also begun spreading. The social democrats were the biggest party of the ruling coalition. Yet the loss of the party's left wing would not be good for Voznesensky's party. A loss of the majority that allowed the coalition to rule the nation would likely follow, and with that the specter of a paralyzed government unable to deal with any crisis."
 KOM.96.a: "An absurd demand!"
 
 KOM.97.t: "A Hanging Thread?"
 KOM.97.d: "Voznesensky's party whips had been working overtime to put the fear of God into the mutineers. As it turned out, all this effort risked being for naught.\n\nAlarms were first raised when the social democrats' left wingers refused any attempt at compromise. Several representatives that had once been open to compromise with the center and center right had now turned into hardliners. No amount of threats, negotiations or bribes could coerce them back into line. The increasingly suspicious party whips turned to less official channels. The party members' phone lines were tapped, just as paramilitary agents tracked the mutineers every moves. Eventually a pattern began to emerge: almost half of the mutineers were receiving instructions directly from Suslov and his communists!\n\nThis development has turned the mutiny crisis into a looming catastrophe. The communists had planted a hard kernel of dissenters within the social democrats for just such an eventuality. As the social democrat's left wing is riddled with Suslovite agents and those gullible enough to follow them, it is impossible to negotiate with them. The government's loss of its majority has now become imminent."
 KOM.97.a: "Everyone is compromised!"
 
 KOM.98.t: "The Olive Branch"
 KOM.98.d: "Zhdanov felt a little apprehensive, writing his letter. There was always a thrill, a slight pang of fear upon jumping into the unknown. His partnership with Voznesensky had been friendly all these years. It had been comfortable to slowly build up the Republic as well as develop its communist party. But now the movements of Gumilyov, Suslov and the democratic war hawks required Zhdanov to step up his own game. Thus, his declaration of war as a request for peace.\n\nPresident Voznesensky would receive a humble proposal of peace. Would it not be better if the enemies of reaction united their forces to smash the fascist paramilitaries? The end of the government's assault on the communist paramilitaries would prevent the fascist from gaining strength. It would also safeguard the left's own manpower, for Zhdanov enjoyed knowing the communists held significant firepower. One day, perhaps Suslov's grip would be wrenched away from the paramilitaries, and their ownership would transfer to Zhdanov? This development would have to wait, however. Before that would come the division of the democratic party, as the liberals and conservatives would lash out against the social democrats for letting the communists go free. Voznesensky would be a victim of his attempt to broker peace with the left.\n\nIn this regard, the President might choose to reject peace. It would be a clever move, and the President was a clever man. Voznesensky would never suspect that his old mentor and long time associate would dare burn up their partnership and reveal the President's ties to the left. Such a revelation would of course immensely hurt the President. But Zhdanov suspected he wouldn't even have to go this far. After all, that wily snake Suslov had many trump cards of his own. Better let Suslov engineer a collapse of the government. This way, Zhdanov would keep his very best cards for a few more turns. The winner of the game, after all, might very well be the last man to make a move."
 KOM.98.a: "There is no option but to obey."
 KOM.98.b: "On the other hand..."
 
 KOM.99.t: "The Big Switch"
 KOM.99.d: "Boris was not big on introspection. After all, the effete intellectuals and bookish pansies didn't last long in the battlefields of Komi. The man imagined he had some level of functional cleverness if nothing else, for leading men on the battlefield required the ability to outthink the opponent as well as outfight him. Sure, Boris would never be a published author, but as the commander of one of the largest democratic paramilitaries he spent his days trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition in tactics and strategies.\n\nAfter days spent hammering communist positions and wracking his brain on how best to outflank various pockets of resistance, the commander couldn't understand where his new orders were coming from. The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities. "We were on the brink of ending the communists. " the commander informed the messenger. Not as a reproach, but rather as a statement of facts. The messenger, a young man with a scraggly beard, nodded. Boris could see that his interlocutor, too, was confused by the switch of priorities. But orders were orders. 'twas not for Boris and his ilk to question them. The commander hoped his men would understand, lest things become mutinous."
 KOM.99.a: "Once more we take the upper hand."
 
 KOM.100.t: "Silence"
 KOM.100.d: "No news from the President. Zhdanov was not surprised. Perhaps a little disappointed to see his old partner choose to do this the hard way. But the communist politician knew that the easy days were over.\n\nThe first order of business was to sever some more... problematic ties with the President. Zhdanov had long exchanged information and other goodies with his partner as continuous proofs of good will. Now this trade would have to be cut back, to keep the pressure on. The usual methods of communication would also be adjusted, aside from a few emergency channels. Voznesensky would soon see that the old days of continuous access to one another were a thing of the past.\n\nThese few acts of housekeeping done, all Zhdanov could do was wait. He was fairly certain Suslov would come up with a solution to the current fruitless battle between the communists. Voznesensky was a fool if he thought the status quo could continue endlessly, in Komi's endless games of political espionage. The President might one day be shocked to learn that his democratic coalition is not as secure as he'd like."
 KOM.100.a: "Good riddance."
 
 KOM.101.t: "Empty Seats in the Congress"
 KOM.101.d: "Komi's legislative Assembly began its meeting today barely above quorum. A vast numbers of deputies of the leading democratic coalition failed to show up. Worryingly, almost all were members of the left wing of Voznesensky's social democrats. Party whips were also conspicuously absent the entire morning. In the back corridors of the legislative Assembly, the democratic faction's insiders exchanged urgent whispers about the situation.\n\nIn the afternoon the missing deputies came in after the lunch break. Without a word, the men and women of the assembly picked up their chairs and offices and dragged them to the communist side of the Assembly. The rain of jeers and boos from their former democratic colleagues did nothing to hinder their progress. The far right and far left observed the situation carefully. A few communists exchanged written memos, but none spoke publicly. Once the commotion was dealt with and order was restored to the Assembly, the democratic coalition's majority no longer existed. While neither the communists nor the fascists made a big case of it, the government now lived on borrowed time. At any moment a vote of no confidence could go through to bring down the previously impervious democratic coalition."
 KOM.101.a: "We need help, immediately. Call up Shafarevich."
 KOM.101.b: "We can wait for the next election"
 
 KOM.102.t: "Some Light Blackmail?"
 KOM.102.d: "Zhdanov watched the kettle heat up. The office's samovar had run out of water for the tea. Hence, the politician had left his office to fetch some more. The gas flames licked the kettle, rendering it red hot in the badly lit communal kitchen. Inside the steel kettle, pressure was rising to a fevered pitch.\n\nThe abandon of the Social Democratic Party by its left wing had brought Komi's fragile status quo to the brink. Now pressure was welling up within the legislative assembly as the democratic coalition desperately searched for a pathway to a new majority. Zhdanov had not heard of Voznesensky since the sudden betrayal. It was not difficult to imagine where the President's mind was at the moment. Rage at being undercut by the communists. Anguish at the thought of his ties with Zhdanov coming to light. Now might be the best moment for Zhdanov to push against the President, to weaken him further before the left could bring a final breakdown of the coalition. By threatening a full reveal of their connection, Zhdanov could try to extract some concession or another, such as a tax free communist district. This would further weaken the President and estrange him from his allies. But the communist politician knew that Voznesensky was a proud man, and was equally likely to resist any further attempt at blackmail. That might prove another worthwhile scenario, for if the President refused further cooperation with Zhdanov he might not live the week politically. Zhdanov surmised that the social democrat's allies would not remain allies for long of a President that had brought their government to the abyss.\n\nThe kettle's whistle brought Zhdanov out of his reverie. Yes, his former protege was stuck in a pressure chamber of his own making. The least that Zhdanov could do was to bring him out of it at the first opportunity... Or at least, do so when it would be most profitable to Zhdanov's own ascension to the top."
 KOM.102.a: "Absolutely not!"
 KOM.102.b: "We have to do it."
 
 KOM.103.t: "The Final Straw"
 KOM.103.d: "The logs arrived in neat packages to various areas of the city. Transcript of recorded conversation, pictures, suspicious bank account details... Any interested party would be able to follow the friendship and business partnership of one Nikolai Voznesensky with one Andrei Zhdanov, of Komi's communist party.\n\nThis unusual set of literature was soon shared by both the media and Komi's political caste as the truth about President Voznesensky's communist dealings came out to the public. Most enraged of all were his allies in the democratic coalition: the remaining social democrats, suddenly realizing the cause of their party's downfall; Shafarevich's conservatives, our erstwhile allies, unnerved by the idea of communists worming their way into the government; and most of all Morozov's liberals, livid at the betrayal. The chief of the SMR has gone on the warpath upon hearing of the leaks, promising a vote of no-confidence to oust the traitor President. Any protest that doing so would hand a significant amount of power to the communist have been brushed aside by Morozov and his allies. "The Republic cannot trust executive power to a communist stooge", after all."
 KOM.103.a: "Can the Republic take any more of this?"
 
 KOM.104.t: "Morozov Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.104.d: "Ivan Pavlovich Morozov was sworn in officially today as Komi's second President. A dutiful partner of the democratic coalition as well as a loyal associate of President Voznesensky, few bookmakers would have put cash on the leader of the Liberal leading a democratic putsch against the President.\n\nThe vote of no-confidence saw Voznesensky, unpopular both with the left and the right be crushed under a super majority of members of parliament. In disgrace, Voznesensky saw his presidency revoked and was forced to cede power to Morozov, his former second in command. Komi's constitution is quite clear about the chain of succession for executive power. The downfall of Voznesensky means the ascension of Morozov.\n\nIf book makers weren't sure about betting on the downfall of the former President, money is already being put on the lifespan of the new presidency. For all his energetic speech urging the removal of Voznesensky, Morozov has not given any response to those who worry about the fragility of the democratic coalition. Shorn of the social democrat's left wing, and with his contempt of the communists on display, the new President must quickly find a way of stabilizing his political backing, lest the same fate befalls him.\n\nhis political reputation as a neutral leader of order and stability destroyed, and his political party collapsing, Voznesensky's political career is finished. Whatever new project he turns to, the former President will no longer play a part of the Republic's politics."
 KOM.104.a: "A new way forward?"
 
 KOM.105.t: "Voznesensky Endures as President"
 KOM.105.d: "It was difficult to tell which of the two men between Voznesensky and Morozov was most disappointed in how the vote of no confidence turned out. A last minute surge of support by the far right brought in support for President Voznesensky. This support has added to the surprising amount of support the far left has given the President. Yes, Voznesensky has proven to be an enemy of the common worker... But Morozov has done nothing but encourage the democratic coalition to ramp up the war against the left. The communist leaders thus left individual members of parliament free to vote. As such a surprising grouping of deputies have let Voznesensky cling to power.\n\nThe leader of the SMR has answered with a speech about the ignominy of staying in power through fascist and communist votes. Morozov has urged vigilance to all members of the democratic coalition, lest radical agenda slip through Voznesensky's presidential orders. In a speech of his own, a visibly shaken Voznesensky has thanked the Republic for its continued confidence in him. The President went on to urge cooperation in these difficult time. The President's speech was bereft of its usual crisp and decisive flavor, much as Voznesensky's government itself has been hollowed out of any real base of support."
 KOM.105.a: "Was it worth it?"
 
 KOM.106.t: "Lips Sealed"
 KOM.106.d: "The reply came through a chain of intermediaries. Voznesensky received the letter one evening, eating a late dinner after a day of work.\n\nThe brief memo didn't say much. "Your cooperation on the tax exemption deal is much appreciated. I will uphold my end of the bargain."\n\nVoznesensky tossed the crumpled memo into the fireplace. His old mentor had now turned into a merciless jailor. What choice did the President have but collaboration with Zhdanov? Without the social democrat's majority in the chamber, Voznesensky had entered a very precarious position. Any hint to the rest of the democratic coalition that he was compromised by communist deals would see them throw him out into the streets.\n\nThe President pushed the food away. The reminder of his situation had turned his appetite away."
 KOM.106.a: "Ominous."
 
 KOM.107.t: "The Militiamen's Strike"
 KOM.107.d: "The army of the Republic has always been, in theory at least, an apolitical organism. Soldiers swear an oath to uphold the constitution and defend the Republic from outside threats.\n\nYet in practice there is a revolving door between political paramilitaries and army garrisons. Many politicized youths join the army to learn the art of violence, only to seek further employment in the militias after their tour of service. Others join the army in between stints in the streets of the capital, often to let the heat die down after a recent militia clash.\n\nToday a group of communist leaning soldiers have announced an unlimited strike to protest the government's violence against the far left. "Why has the government gone back on its words and broken the truce with the communist parties? Why are noble men of the Republican Army sent to die for political bickerings?" asked the speakers to assembled soldiers. A chorus of indignation lifted up the question, as policemen observed the public protest.\n\nNumbers are still coming in, but it seems that our initial guess that one third of the army has communist leanings has proven accurate. Down to sixty-six percent of its usual strength, and with all of its tank corps joining the strike, our army has been badly hit by this strike."
 KOM.107.a: "We will not have truck with traitors."
 KOM.107.b: "Bring in the reserves."
 
 KOM.108.t: "A Farewell to Arms"
 KOM.108.d: "In a shocking turn of events, negotiation between the government and the striking military units have broken down. Police battalions, helped by loyal army troops and a smattering of governmental goons, have managed to beat down the protesting soldiers. Attempts by communist paramilitaries to support the strikers were fought off violently. After a day of bloody battles, the strikers were dishonorably discharged and sent home without pay.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this has hurt the communist in any real way, as the soldiers have simply flooded into their old paramilitary units. The tanks themselves have rolled away from the army bases and into their storage depots near the communist headquarters. No attempt was made to prevent this, the government fearing rampaging tankers turning their guns on Syktyvkar's buildings. Having lost some of its most important regiments, the government is now looking for new source of recruits and materiel."
 KOM.108.a: "Pray we won't need it."
 
 KOM.109.t: "The Replacements"
 KOM.109.d: "The barracks did not remain empty for long. Drill sergeants oversee pushups and rifle drills as government bureaucrats monitor the inclusion of former right wing paramilitaries into the army.\n\nThe far left has inevitably protested the recruitment of "reactionary thugs" into the army, depicting this as "the latest example of the inevitable alliance between spineless capitalist liberals and reactionary fascists." These protests have been drowned out in turn by a tidal wave of outrage from parties ranging from social democrats to the far right. "The communists thugs have deserted their posts in this hour of need" pointed out a fascist deputy, to a mixture of applause and jeers.\n\nThe fascist paramilitaries are known to maintain their own strict standards of training and obedience. The new recruits are generally of excellent quality. Yet many observers worry that by switching the government's reliance on one set of political extremists to another, the Republic's safety has not been improved. How long until the new recruits agitate for their own purposes?"
 KOM.109.a: "They get what they get."
 KOM.109.b: "They're better than Suslov."
 
 KOM.110.t: "Reports of Gumilyovite Machinations"
 KOM.110.d: "For all their criticism of the communist leaving their posts, our new paramilitary recruits are heading toward a strike of their own.\n\nThe recruits demand an increase in pay, and less central oversight from the government. They point out that the old majority communists regiments were permitted to serve under officers with known communist leanings. The government's protest that this has proven out to be an unworkable deal in the long run has fallen on deaf ears. These new soldiers insist they are loyal to the government, and consider their demands for more autonomy as a proof of trust of the government in them.\n\nGovernmental intelligence sources have tried to decipher the far right's communication. Many higher-ups of the democratic coalition suspect Lev Gumilyov, shadow master of the far right to be behind this recent agitation. While his endgame is difficult to deduce, it is clear that Gumilyov is using the government's position of weakness to extract political gains."
 KOM.110.a: "Oh, of course."
 
 KOM.111.t: "Gumilyov's Men in the Army?"
 KOM.111.d: "As quickly as it appeared, the former fascist paramilitaries ended their agitation. All was thought to be good, initially. But spies in the army reported clean new uniforms in the affected units. The former protesters were seen out on the town, racking up magnificent drinking bills. And through all this, the regiment's officers were slowly being shuffled around. An apolitical colonel decided on an early retirement. His replacement was a well known ultra-nationalist. Little by little, the grievances of the former paramilitaries simply went away, solved on their own by the military command's bureaucracy.\n\nDemocratic politicians are now pouring resources into the issue. Has the far right penetrated the military's high command? Or as it simply been a case of Gumilyov spreading bribes to get things to go his way? Either situation are deeply unsettling to the democratic parties. Perhaps the government has traded Suslov's Charibdis for Gumilyov's Scylla."
 KOM.111.a: "We're no better off than we started!"
 
 KOM.112.t: "Shafarevich's Surge"
 KOM.112.d: "Not all of the new recruits were far right radicals. A good quantity of conservative affiliated militias have joined the army. This has been good news for Shafarevich, member of the conservative party on the left of the Passionariyy, and occasional ally of the government. Now that his supporters hold a non trivial position in the Republican Army, Shafarevich's political star, as tainted as it is by his associated to Gumilyov, has risen sharply.\n\nHis temporary associates in the democratic coalition have not reacted much to this new reality, as the military is, supposedly, a politically neutral organization. However, in Komi a ministerial reshuffle is never far away, and a new conservative ministry might go a long way toward reaching out to the government's new partner.\n\nCommunist politicians, on the other hand, have not been happy to see the rightists gain new supporters. Rumors on the left is that the so-called 'traditional democratic' militias are secretly filled with fascist and Gumilyovites. If true, the conservative soldiers would not be any significant obstacle to a far right take over of the army."
 KOM.112.a: "Surely it won't go anywhere."
 
 KOM.113.t: "The Daughter of the Soviet Union"
 KOM.113.d: ""Welcome back, comrades, to Radio Pravda! My name is Roy Medvedev, your humbly elected Deputy of the Communist Party and your host for today. This occasion is special indeed, for I am joined by my fellow Deputy and comrade Svetlana Bukharina, who has graciously allowed us to conduct an interview!"\n\n"Thank you, Comrade Medvedev. It is an honor to be here."\n\n"Now, Comrade Bukharina, what exactly brought the esteemed daughter of Nikolai Bukharin himself to a place like Komi?"\n\n"Well, for the longest time, all I did was drift with the breeze. I had lost track of everyone I had known in the collapse, even my own father. I had nowhere to go."\n\n"What did you see out there?"\n\n"Horrible things. Desperate people willing to do anything for a bite to eat, fascist bombers grounding entire communities into dust, not to mention banditry and barbarism of the highest degree."\n\n"Sounds like what we're dealing with now, almost."\n\n"Indeed. I had arrived in Komi just as Operation Suvorov kicked off, and I was there to witness the collapse of the Front. Despite my efforts, the horrors I witnessed back east had managed to follow me here. I decided at that moment that I was going to do something about it, rather than continue to flee."\n\n"Do you think you've achieved that goal, comrade?""
 KOM.113.a: ""Not yet.""
 
 KOM.114.t: "The Shadow Opens"
 KOM.114.d: "There was no more time for doing nothing. Enough suspicion and political will has moved us to investigate Suslov and the organizations he has under his influence. Though some may see the surface of his charitable organizations devoted to the cause of socialism with nothing more than a thought of praise, we would not be satisfied with such a shallow judgement.\n\nEven his other organizations shall not be free from the scrutiny we wish to employ. Just like the man himself, these still reek of rumors and reports which we must confirm. Turning over the stones upon which these all rest shall be instrumental to the smooth sailing of our own plans.\n\nLet our focus be on the people who act under his thumb. While we may be wise to see what places he may have extended his influence into, or learn about whatever resources he may exploit through his organizations, it pays to study them.\n\nThe more we learn about these people, the more we learn about Suslov.

 KOM.115.d: "Mikhail Suslov browsed the various poll results in front of him. The subject of the polls was Svetlana Bukharina, who was quickly becoming the new face of the Communist Party. Voters continued to love her, proving that her landslide victory from when she was first elected was not just a fluke. Ever since Suslov had decided to start promoting her more, the Communist Party continued to grow. Svetlana Bukharina was beginning to become a major political figure in Komi.\n\nHowever, her popularity was not just limited to the citizens of Komi. Her competence, her as daughter of Premier Bukharin, and her friendly, polite demeanor all made her popular within the Communist Party itself. She had become most popular amongst the younger politicians and the reformists, but she also lacked any major opponents within the Party. This was good news for the party, and more importantly, good news for Suslov. Svetlana Bukharina appeared to be exactly what the Communist Party needed. Especially with the elections just around the corner."
 KOM.115.a: "Congratulations, Svetlana Bukharina."
 
 KOM.116.t: "A Power Play?"
 KOM.116.d: ""Valentin Ivanovich, I want you to be frank with me," Suslov began, staring across his office desk at his visitor. "Is it doable?"\n\n"Yes," Varennikov answered. A brief, loaded silence followed.\n\n"Assuming our intel is correct and Gumilyov does, in fact, have no more than twenty or so men guarding his printing presses at night." He paused again. "Not to imply that our boys couldn't handle being outnumbered, especially with surprise on our side. It's just that, you know, there is a limit."\n\nSuslov sighed. "Has the plan changed at all since you talked to Oplesnin regarding transportation?"\n\n"Yes, we've procured a truck. The plan is now to break in via the Kuratov Street loading dock. Our armed men will deal with any resistance, and then those two arsonists who were paroled last month with soak the place with gasoline and light it. With any luck, the building will be gutted before the fire brigade can arrive, and we'll be long gone."\n\nVarennikov nodded deferentially to his boss.

"Comrade General Secretary, last night's events were the result of an intelligence failure that betrayed our plan to Gumilyov's forces." The paramilitary leader sighed. "Those arsonists, as it turned out, were right-wing sympathizers, and promptly sang like canaries the instant they were brought onboard. As a result, there were thirty men and a Maxim gun waiting behind the door when our people arrived."\n\n"Survivors?"\n\n"None, except for the arsonists. They ran off with Gumilyov's men.

Of course, Suslov's job was not merely to do administrative work, but to support those in the party whomst he saw fit so that the party as a whole could grow.\n\nTo his expectations, Bukharina had made quite a splash in the party. Being the daughter of the old General Secretary tended to do that, after all. Suslov had also expected Bukharina to push her more reformist ideas. However, what he did not expect was just how popular Bukharina's ideas would be. Not only did it appeal to those in the Communist Party, but to a surprising amount of those outside the party as well. She leveraged her influence very well, it seemed. Despite the flagrant revisionism that he suspected to lie within her, such an opportunity could not be wasted, as the party always needed more influence in its struggle against the fascists and the liberals. More resources would have to be moved to the "legitimate" side of electoral politics, which meant more could be invested towards supporting Bukharina's popular movement.\n\nSuslov leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea. Of course, he would keep a careful eye on her and her efforts. It would not do any good for him to overly invest into what could turn out to be a foolish endeavour, and if she proved to be a threat, he could hopefully eliminate her before her ideological deviations grew out of hand."

 KOM.119.t: "A Hand Behind the Veil"
 KOM.119.d: "Svetlana Bukharina had all the qualities of a leader: charismatic, competent, and calculating. However, as it seemed, Mikhail Suslov simply couldn't justify choosing to back her as the Party's future candidate. She was becoming too popular, too influential, and she was becoming a threat to the balance of power within the Communist Party. She was quickly becoming a leading figure of the reformists within the Communist Party, closet-revisionists whose influence Suslov had attempted to limit in the past. Bukharina was ambitious, and Suslov had determined long ago, in the offices of the Front, that such people were not reliable.\n\nPandering to electorialist tendencies, an eternal thorn in the side of Suslov, was not the correct path - regardless of the talents of Bukharina and her associates - or the connections of Zhdanov and his "visionary" social club. To bend to bourgeois democracy to resolve a crisis that had been brought to the party by revolutionary methods was non-viable.\n\nSatisfied, Suslov reached for the dull grey phone on the desk, calling the number he had long memorized. Police would be bribed, newspapers would be stolen, and Radio Pravda would release a new spin on the crisis by nightfall. Whereas it may bring some legal trouble, the environment of the Republic had taught Suslov and his fixers a valuable lesson."

 KOM.120.t: "A Calcuated Risk"
 KOM.120.d: ""Comrade,\nI write you this letter to express my most sincere gratitude for the warm welcome to both the Komi Republic and Syktyvkar, and for the warm welcomes to the Party. I have never felt so welcomed in a political sense before.\nIt is with great happiness that I announced my candidacy for Deputy in our National Assembly, and it was with great happiness that I accepted my seat both on the Central Committee of the Party and that most illustrious chamber. I am pleased to work besides such noble comrades as yourselves, and under the gentle guiding of General Secretary Suslov.\nIt is thus that I inform you of the other purpose of this letter - I see in my heart of hearts a most prosperous future for us in the socialist Republic yet to come, and I believe that, in the inevitable case of the realization of our ambitions towards the Republic, and the establishment of a new, socialist cabinet, we could find a most reasonable accord.\n- Svetlana N. Bukharina."\n\nBukharina looked over the letter once more, tapping her silver fountain pen against the desk. It was composed with sufficient subtlety, of course - the sort of composition that would not get her dragged in front of a disciplinary board. However, the unspoken message was still clear - and hinted at her ambitions. A choice faced her, one that she would have to abide by for the foreseeable future - that of its recipient.\n\nTwo obvious candidates ran through her mind - Andropov and Zhdanov - a Suslovite and a reformist - of sorts. Andropov was a stretch and a risk - but a very valuable ally, provided the cooperation that he had carried out earlier held evidence towards his true leanings. Zhdanov was an obvious choice, but he was notoriously erratic and populist - and, in a way, Bukharina simply didn't trust him as much as she could.\n\nWith a moment's contemplation, and a look at the notes on her desk, she began to fill in the address line."

 KOM.121.t: "The Spider's Web"
 KOM.121.d: "A political party was like a spider's web. In some strange way; every thread - every member - had its place. Mikhail Suslov was more familiar than most with this philosophy - he supposed he was like the spider of sorts. He built the web, he maintained the web, and if any outsiders were trapped within the web, he would see them destroyed.\n\nOf late, his carefully maintained and orderly web, however, had tremored on the winds of fate, and he had a growing suspicion that he was not the only spider that claimed it as their own. Andropov, ever the loyal - if enigmatic - agent, had reported to him as he had on all other nights one stormy evening; but when Suslov asked him about Svetlana Bukharina, the hesitation before he spoke, his pre-made file on her, dismissing her as a threat and suggesting Suslov should turn his eyes elsewhere?\n\nThat was alarming.\n\nSomething told Suslov that the man was compromised, likely accepting some bribe or promise of power by Bukharina. The thought of such a betrayal made Suslov's blood curl - this wasn't Bukharin's runt's party - it was Suslov's.\n\nThe worst part was the lack of material evidence. Andropov seemed as loyal as ever, on the surface - the papers arrived on time, and the reports remained meticulous - but something felt wrong, and Suslov was rarely wrong about these things. He expected some sort of a test or a power play soon. He made a vow to himself - if Bukharina attempted to goad him into a trap, if she presented a test... she wouldn't even see his counterstroke coming."

Even though he knew every person on his desk, he'd gone to the trouble of paperclipping a photo of each individual to the front of their respective file. As much as he hated to admit it, it indulged a certain feeling of power to manipulate the two-dimensional surrogates of his colleagues and subordinates as he wove his plans together.\n\nWith all of his contacts, personal relationships, and...other leverage, he could fairly easily determine who would be the next Communist Party candidate for President of the Komi Republic. He skimmed through the assemblage, intermittently striking some figures off the list outright as being too ambitious. Others were, in Suslov's estimation, too powerful in their own right. And then, of course, there were those who had certain... deviant ideas regarding the party's direction.\n\nIn ordinary times, he would not have resorted to this - but the recent crisis had caused too chaos within the Party to be ignored. The final two photographs lay on his desk in front of him, with meticulously marked notes below each one - a man and a woman, both altogether too-powerful Party members that he could not afford to lose.\n\nChecking the notes, he lifted hs pen once more, and made his final decision. He could only hope that this small act of trust would not be his downfall."

Because of this, the place was almost universally assumed to be bugged. Of course, no one wanted to actually admit this, since any party's leveling of this allegation would be immediately met by a litany of their own misdeeds, so it was generally in everyone's interest to handle all public matters in the ballroom and do all the actual negotiating in the vacant lot behind the hotel.\n\nThe sharp clap of a worn gavel brought the room to order as Mikhail Suslov walked onstage, taking his place at a podium in the center of a long table of allegedly important party figures. Of course, Suslov had put almost every single one of them there, and had a means to keep them in line. Which is precisely what made his current task so irritating.\n\n"Comrades, I am pleased to announce that the Komi Communist Party's Presidential candidate for the upcoming elections is Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov."\n\nStilted applause, the flashes of cameras, and cheers rippled across the crowd as the Andropov strode up the aisle, with what Suslov knew was a very pained smile. Suslov exchanged a quick handshake with him onstage, and, with an almost fearful feeling in the back of his mind, went on for a few minutes about how bright the Republic's future would be following the victory of their new candidate.\n\nInside, of course, Suslov's feelings were quite different. He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. As he stepped back and watched Andropov stoically address the designated associates in the crowd, Suslov knew this was a risk. Andropov did not want the Presidency, but the fact that nearly no loyalists remained who could take the position was a point of great concern. There was simply no alternative - and Suslov wondered if this would eventually prove to be a fatal misstep."

 KOM.125.d: "The lighting in Mikhail Suslov's office flickered a few times before going out entirely, a side effect of Syktyvkar's often-unreliable power grid. Suslov barely took notice, dispensing two cups' worth of tea from the samovar in the corner and lighting a practically-ancient oil lamp. "Svetlana Nikolaevna," he intoned to the woman sitting on the other side of his neatly organized desk, "Your name carries a great deal of importance in this party. Your father, for all his flaws -"\n\n"Mikhail, while I appreciate the flattery," Bukharina said coolly. "I know you haven't called me here to talk about my family name."\n\nSuslov smiled, as if his guest had lived up to his expectations. "Of course. Comrade Bukharina," he began. "Zhdanov has his sights on me and the political order I have created. What I am asking of you is to work with me to keep him in line." Bukharina eyed him warily, not reacting. "I shall not speak in terms of personal loyalty - I know you, and you know me. We are both above such posturing. I would not be surprised if Zhdanov has already made some sort of proposal to you, and if he has not, I envision he shall soon."\n\n"And, comrade General Secretary?"\n\n"I would simply like to reiterate what should be a self-evident truth: Zhdanov will dispose of you and your associates the instant I am gone. The man desires-"\n\n"You dare to suggest that you're any different?"\n\n"Svetlana Nikolaevna, you know how I operate." Suslov paused, sipping tea. "I am not one for leading from the front. Why do you think you have advanced this far in a party with this much anti-Bukharinite sentiment? Goodwill alone? Your family name? I need people at my side."\n\nInternally, Bukharina had to acknowledge he was right, at least in part. She had been the recipient of Suslov's patronage time and time again. "So what would be saying is that I have a choice between being a puppet under you - and dead under Zhdanov."\n\n"Cruder terminology than I would have used, but directionally correct, Comrade Bukharina. You have a simple choice." Suslov put the teacup down. "Stay the course and continue your meteoric and unexpected rise to power, or throw away everything that has gotten you this far for the privilege of being executed by our dear friend Andrei the moment he sees no more use for you.""

Come in, sit down."\n\n"Then you're a very smart woman indeed," Zhdanov noted with obvious insincerity, declining to take a seat but closing the door behind him. "I've come to talk to you about the snake in our midst. The serpent wrapped around the heart of this Party-"\n\n"I get it. What exactly do you want?" Svetlana responded.\n\n"It's nothing personal against Suslov," Zhdanov continued, his tone now emphatic and frank. "It's just that this party could be run much more efficiently without that rat's lackeys clogging up the machinery. We could do something great, Svetlana. You and I, together, at the helm. Without him breathing down our necks."\n\nBukharina looked back, unconvinced.\n\n"Specifics, Andrei. When, where, and what?"\n\n"There are no specifics yet. Things are... still up in the air. Keep your ear to the ground. You'll hear from me when it's time."\n\n"What the hell am I supposed to do with that?"\n\n"Think, Svetlana, think. You can't live as Suslov's pawn forever-"\n\n"That's an awfully bold statement from someone asking for help," Svetlana noted with a not-so-subtle hint of tactically-induced irritation.\n\n"I can hear it in your voice, Bukharina. You know it's true."\n\n"Our relationship is hardly one of dependence and subordination," Bukharina countered calmly, her voice suddenly placid and professional. "Nonetheless, your offer will be taken under consideration."\n\n"A solid choice. We'll be in touch." With that, Zhdanov was gone."

 KOM.127.d: "Compared to the austere headquarters of his own party, Zhdanov noted, the Voznesentsy's nerve-center was a roiling pit of barely-ordered chaos. Even Voznesensky's office was something of a wreck, with countless economic charts and graphs pinned to the wall with a variegated array of metal pushpins and other sharp objects.\n\nYet Voznesensky's demeanor could not have been more to the contrary. Although he scarcely cut an authoritative figure in his plaid sport-coat and bow tie, he nonetheless carried the serene, softly dominant aura of a Persian satrap, watching his numerous aides and underlings with a dispassionate eye.\n\n"Nikolai, I thought we would be speaking privately," Zhdanov said with slight irritation.\n\n"My apologies for the dust, Andrei. The upcoming elections have our headquarters in... disarray," Voznesensky explained. "Only physically, of course," he quickly added. Zhdanov's host motioned to an adjacent, empty, conference room. Voznesensky waited until his guest was seated to direct the conversation to the nebulous 'business' Zhdanov was so keen to discuss in private.\n\n"To put it simply, Nikolai," Zhdanov said, "I'm asking for your backing in the settling of a political score." These words alone didn't take Voznesensky by surprise, it was the name that came next that did. Mikhail goddamned Suslov.\n\n"With all due respect, Andrei... I don't see how this concerns our party. All concerns of practicality or wisdom aside, this is an internal matter for your party. Suslov's goons are a non-entity for us."\n\n"You're very quick to deny the existence of half of your own party's membership," Zhdanov shot back in a retort he'd been practicing in his head for longer than he really wanted to admit. A half-second later, his host acknowledged him with an eye-roll.\n\n"Do I really need to list the reasons your party would benefit from taking Suslov out of the equation?"\n\nVoznesensky was much too self-conscious to respond verbally, but nodded with understanding.\n\n"What kind of support are you looking for?""

Svetlana felt like something out of a cartoon - an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, each stridently pleading their case into her ears. Except in this case, neither was an angel, and both were probably lying.\n\nThe phone rang a second time.\n\nSuslov, on the one hand, was arguably the safe bet. He was, after all, the puppetmaster of the whole Republic. But the red maestro's sickeningly self-assured words gnawed at her.\n\n"Directionally correct."\n\nAs much as she hated to acknowledge it, Zhdanov was not entirely wrong, and, despite her better impulses, his words had gotten to her. The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger. Making up her mind, she picked up the phone as it rang a fourth time."

And, as the actors launched into a rousing chorus with a crescendo of the theater's antique organ, the creaking of steps announced the presence of a visitor for Suslov, the Red Eminence of Komi.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a world-class performance of Boris Godunov that was being put on, Svetlana Bukharina mused as she climbed the rickety stairs to the Komi Grand Theater's lone luxury box parting a thin miasma of bluish cigarette smoke\n\n"To what do I owe the honor, Svetlana Nikolaevna?" Suslov intoned, his voice barely audible over the opera's musical clamor.\n\nBukharina did not respond, letting the tramp of further footsteps on the stairs and a stern look do the talking for her. Six hard-faced paramilitaries filed in behind her as the orchestra below unknowingly sounded a requiem for Komi's puppetmaster.\n\nAnd as his bodyguards shot him a look of sad resignation and holstered their weapons, Suslov knew that this time, he'd been outmaneuvered.\n\n"Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina began curtly, "I think it's time we have a talk." Suslov thought for a moment, running through possible scenarios, and forced a chuckle, regaining a bit of his confidence. He gestured to the militiamen. "I will be honest, Svetlana, I expected better of you."\n\nSvetlana looked right back at him. There was no mercy in those eyes. "As did I. Now, I think we should step out for a moment."\n\n"And for what reason would I do that?"\n\n"Because," hissed a voice from the stairwell. Andrei Zhdanov stepped into the box, flanked by Chelomei and Voytukevich. "I don't think you have a choice."\n\n"My, you people are quite efficient," remarked Suslov, verbally backtracking as he tried to buy time. But age had taken its toll. He had nowhere to run, no backup plan. His bodyguards had been paid off. He fumbled at his pants, trying to draw the pistol he barely knew how to use, but the advancing militiamen were faster, tackling him to the ground and sending his gun clattering across the floor.\n\nSvetlana let a slight smile cross her face.

Suslov grunted as his hands were pulled behind his back by one of the paramilitaries.\n\n"No. It's yours," replied Bukharina. "They can't tell the difference."\n\n"You're a fool, Bukharina. Putting a bullet in my skull only means Zhdanov will put one in yours," Suslov said, a snarl creeping its way into his voice.\n\n"That's none of your concern, Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina shot back, pulling a silk dress glove out of her pocket and slipping it on her right hand.\n\nAt the same time, the militiamen pulled the handcuffed Suslov upright. Despite the blood running from his nose and the newly-acquired grime on his suit, Svetlana had to admit that Suslov still cut a striking figure as he examined his captor with disdain.\n\n"So what exactly shall I be forced to agree to?" Suslov sneered. "Surrendering my position? Declaring you Tsarina?"\n\n"Don't you even start with that," Bukharina scolded. "You've known me for long enough to know exactly what I want you to know."\n\n"A naked power grab, then. I shouldn't have expected much from the product of Nikolai's affair with his own secretary," Suslov hissed.\n\nBukharina bent over and slid her prisoner's gun into her gloved hand, screwing on a suppressor. Suslov's eyes widened with fear as she raised it, racking the slide. Pandemonium erupted in the box as Suslov writhed at his handcuffs, shouting breathlessly while Bukharina's men grabbed Zhdanov, and pulled him back towards the railing. The lead soloist launched into an aria, the orchestral accompaniment resounding throughout the hall. Chelomei shouted something, holding his boss back, both helplessly adrift in the ruins of their own plan.\n\nWithout so much as a word, Svetlana glanced over her shoulder at Zhdanov and put a bullet in her co-conspirator's head."

The pen in his hand twitched as he read through the list again, a cold feeling churning in his gut.\n\nLimitations on the power of General Secretary, an election for the position within three years, a freeze on party purges, an end to interference in local soviets' affairs. All unthinkable on their own - but combined, they formed a crushing, black wall that he could barely tolerate to look at.\n\nHe looked up at his former allies, who sat on the opposite side of the van. Bukharina's stare seemed to penetrate through him as if he wasn't there. He tried to send a glare back, but he couldn't muster it. There was something within him that he had not felt in a long time - resigned defeat. He opened his mouth to speak, the words as ash in his mouth. He knew that he sounded hurt. He couldn't help it.\n\n"I am... surprised that you allowed me to keep my membership within the Party, despite your commitment to stripping me of every ability that I have to keep this organization coherent," he managed. "Do you wish for a puppet, then? A reminder of your triumph?" He practically spat out the words, as he signed the paper.\n\nBukharina's gaze met his, utterly unsympathetic, as she spoke a single sentence.

She didn't want to be seen like this - not even by her pet.\n\nThe vision flickered through her mind again, and again, and again. An impulsive shot - the red mist exiting her old coworker's head, the light vanishing from his eyes in an instant. The sound of his dropping, Suslov staring at her impassively, the mad dash to the van through hidden corridors as sirens rang out in the distance. It repeated like the wail of the air-raid sirens that rang out whenever a German bomber decided to take a risk and go for the city's suburbs.\n\nShe looked down at the black blazer that she was wearing, accentuated by a crimson scarf. Blood-red - the same color that had escaped into the air after she pulled the trigger. The color of the people's flag. As she lay there on her back, staring at the crack in the ceiling that she wasn't home enough to patch, she tried to collect her thoughts. Regroup, refocus, repress the memory. Think of something else, anything else.\n\nHer stream of conscience was interrupted by a slight weight on her chest, and the feeling of tiny claws. The red-feathered, black-beaked countenance of her bird, perched atop the breast pocket of her blazer, looked right into her eyes, his head cocked to the side.

 KOM.133.d: "After a prayer, he crossed himself and turned on the lights. He sat at his desk and opened up a letter which he just received an hour ago. Taboritsky wanted to attend to other affairs, but he believed it important to read this first.\n\n"Dear Taboritsky, I hope I find you well. I wish you a good morning and hope your men are doing well. I hope that we both, despite our differences, are able to set these aside and come together as friends. I say this with interest in the success of your endeavors as well as my own."\n\n"If it does not give you too much reason to object, I hope that you may consider my request for the assistance of some of your men. Additional hands would be beneficial. And in return, I extend my own men and their services to you. A fair exchange, I hope, but this is up to you. For I only anticipate that we look out for our own interests. I will not put too much weight in expectations, but if you do approve of my request, then you may have good reason to place some faith in me. I pray you have a good day."\n\n"Sincerely, L. Gumilyov" At the end of it, Taboritsky gave it thought. He did not have close ties with Gumilyov and his supporters, but if this man was reaching out to him with this letter, there is opportunity to consider. Although there were real differences of opinion and purpose, he didn't want to waste any assistance extended to his own cause. If successful, the coming tsarevich would be delighted at the results. But if Gumilyov betrayed him, then not only would there be displeasure but retribution from God himself for his treachery.\n\nHe thought over his options carefully, then he offered it up in prayer, and waited for a sign."
 KOM.133.a: "A worthy cause, perhaps."
 
 KOM.134.t: "Keeping to Our Roots"
 KOM.134.d: "Gumilyov began slowly ascending the steps of the hastily constructed stage, taking one last view of the cramped audience. Made up of a collection of interested bystanders, dedicated Passionariyy members, and some who wish simply to watch the ramblings of a "Madman". Stepping up to the podium, Gumilyov silenced the room with a glare and tap of the microphone.\n\n"Comrades and countrymen, I'd like to begin this gathering with a question. What is the nature of Russia?" Hearing not a single answer from the audience, and perhaps expecting it, Gumilyov would continue. "Russia's nature is one not of Bolshevik or Tsar, but one of a diverse collection of pieces that fit together into a larger puzzle. What the Tsar couldn't do, and what the Bolsheviks refused to do is transform Russia into something greater than what it was and has ever been."\n\nAfter taking a moment to gauge how positive the audience reaction had been, he continued, "The future of Russia lay not with the red demagogues or tsarist nobility, but with unity between all Russians, including those who have been wrongfully denied their place as proper Russians, the Turks, the Tatars and Mongols." One of his aides would signal that it was time to end his speech, which he would reluctantly oblige.\n\n"God bless you all, I'm sure we will all meet again very soon." Stepping off the stage, Gumilyov felt the effects of his speech immediately, with the crowd descending into a flurry of cheers and claps. Shortly afterwards, Passionariyy militia would report a surge of new recruits, inspired by the words of their leader and ready to dedicate themselves to the cause of the new Russia."
 KOM.134.a: "Reason is a virtue."
 
 KOM.142.t: "Appealing to the Komi"
 KOM.142.d: ""All in favor?" Stalina asked. All the leaders in the room raised their hands, except for President Voznesensky himself. From when it was suggested in the meeting, he was hesitant about the native Komi cultural program, not because it would waste crucial time and effort, but due to his personal beliefs regarding the natives in the lands he governed. Once again, his allies desperately tried to convince him. In the end, he reluctantly accepted, if only to help the image of him and the coalition in general.\n\nIn the next days, the government spread the news: a program to showcase Komi culture, preserve their traditions and support them in solving their communal problems will be initiated by the governing coalition. Of course, behind the scenes, most politicians have realized that this is merely a ploy to gather the support of the native voters. Despite that, its actual success remains to be seen."
 KOM.142.a: "It is time the government approached the natives."
 
 KOM.143.t: "Voznesensky's Troubled History"
 KOM.143.d: "Sergei approached Morozov, who was hastily leaving the government building, as if he had somewhere he had to urgently go. As always, he was in formal clothing even in a normal day in office. Initially, Sergei went unnoticed, but Morozov eventually realized he was running behind him.\n\nThe bureaucrat was looking worried when he began speaking to the leader of the liberal movement. "Sir, have you thought this Komi program through? Specifically, I am quite worried about including Voznesensky in this. You must have heard of what he's said in the past! He is not known for his kindness and respect to minorities. Hell, he has even called them traitors!" Morozov seemed to be not particularly worried about this, almost as if he didn't care. "If you let him organize this, our public image could take a hit: imagine when our political opponents hear that the enemy of the native Komi has decided to respect their culture. It would be a scandal!"\n\nMorozov barely raised an eyebrow, and calmly replied: "Don't worry, everything is under control. You are overreacting, that's all." Before Sergei could reply, Morozov had already left the building."
 KOM.143.a: "We need to be careful with this program."
 
 KOM.144.t: "Moving the Department?"
 KOM.144.d: "Morozov sat quietly in his office, looking at the view from the window and going over documents regarding the upcoming events in the capital. Nothing was scheduled for the next few hours, so it was just him and the work he had to do. But as much as he tried to focus on it, one topic kept coming up in his mind: Voznesensky and his... racist tendencies. On the one hand, cooperating with the social democrats would be useful in general: he could appease the President, continuing to usurp power from his faction while keeping good terms. On the other hand, his knowledge of the President's beliefs was worrying. The public relations of the Center Coalition, and his own party by extension, could hang in the balance if a scandal appeared. Would he risk such a thing for power?"
 KOM.144.a: "Cooperate with Voznesenky on the program."
 KOM.144.b: "Quietly keep Voznesenky out of organizing the program."
 
 KOM.145.t: "Voznesensky on the Radio!"
 KOM.145.d: ""Good morning, Syktyvkar! We are back today for our daily Round Table, where we discuss the latest developments in our country's political stage. And today, we have... quite the interesting story, from our own President Voznesensky! My friend Igor is here to explain what has happened."\n\n"Thank you. Last night, we received tape recordings from a source that would like to remain anonymous, and contain excerpts of private dialogues made between the President and some of his party associates, even including prominent faces of the Center Coalition we are all familiar with. Why don't we hear them?"\n\nVoznesensky's voice was heard, slightly corrupted: "... the Komi, the damn Komi! Do you have any idea how much this messes up our plans? We can't (corrupted), and that is all because of the damn natives. They're communists, I tell you, traitors to the country, all of them! One day we'll deal with the problem they are for our Republic!"\n\n"And that's what I call a damn interesting recording! In light of the recent developments, it makes Voznesensky all the more hypocritical: publicly supporting a program to help the natives, yet insulting them indiscriminately behind closed doors? Let us hear your thoughts, listeners!""
 KOM.145.a: "This is Radio Free Syktyvkar, signing off!"
 
 KOM.146.t: "The Paradox"
 KOM.146.d: "Reports from our government officials and associates talk regarding the program to gain the support of the native voting base, while mostly positive, show it has not been a clear success. As for the program itself, it was pulled off almost perfectly, going without a hitch. Many Komi welcomed the opportunity to receive help by the government and seem supportive of the new policy.\n\nIn general, some seem convinced by this, but despite this small boost in the popularity of the Social Democrats and the Coalition, it would be a lie to say we are fully satisfied with the results. The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy. It seems that this was not the help we are looking for to gain support in our struggle against the left and right."
 KOM.146.a: "We need to look elsewhere."
 
 KOM.147.t: "The Syktyvkar Cultural Festival"
 KOM.147.d: "Throughout this week, one event has dominated the cultural life of Syktyvkar and the capital as a whole, and that is the Syktyvkar Cultural Festival. Organized by the groups aimed at the preservation of Komi culture and tradition, some endorsed by the government, it has been a massive success.\n\nThe festival is located in one of the capital's major parks, in one of the safest neighborhoods, which has helped it avoid any paramilitary clashes. Many Komi took the opportunity to help in the festival, by participating in the exhibitions of anything from traditional clothes, to customs and music. The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers. Many Russian citizens of Syktyvkar were actually ignorant of the Komi lifestyle and culture, and found this as a fascinating opportunity to educate themselves on it. Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."
 KOM.147.a: "We have finally embraced multiculturalism."
 
 KOM.148.t: "A History of Our Republic"
 KOM.148.d: "One of the most well-known authors in the Komi Republic, Viktor Smirnov, who is in fact an ethnic Komi, has recently released one of his most popular books, "A History of Our Republic". The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. "The History of Our Republic" has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Russians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."
 KOM.148.a: "We must know where we come from."
 
 KOM.149.t: "The Party's Composition"
 KOM.149.d: "One inevitability of Komi's politics is that the status quo will change radically, at a moment's notice. The sadness of this factor, however, is that, at the moment, the status quo seems to be shifting radically away from the ruling Voznesensti faction.\n\nLike it or not, by simple virtue of being the public face of the democratic factions in the Republic, public support has been eroded by scandal after scandal, be they real or constructed by our political enemies. Public support, ever fleeting and ephemeral, has, as of late, been shifting either to the Suslovite extreme left, or the more moderate liberal and conservative factions - those of our coalition partners.\n\nAs our coalition seems to undergo a period of self-restructuring, it is critical to ensure that political capital is more or less maintained by the ruling party, and that the current President isn't challenged too heavily by our own allies. Whether the solution to this is limiting our most credible coalition partner, or simply standing by and letting our power shrivel away, is entirely up to the whims of the President."
 KOM.149.b: "We need to accept the other factions."
 KOM.149.a: "Sorry, Ivan."
 
 KOM.150.t: "A Conversation with Stalina"
 KOM.150.d: "Vosnesensky sips at his tea. It's a little sweet for his taste, but he keeps the smile hanging as he faces the cool-faced Stalina. It's always good to keep a little contrast with conversational partners, in any case. Helps with the banter. Not that there's much to talk about these days, besides the endless politics of the Republic. Teacup arrangements as the storm of Russia rages on around them.\n\n"Do you miss the old days, then? Svetlana?" Before he's quite ready the words leave his mouth, to his mild regret.\n\nStalina's face stays closed. She looks at her tea, a twitch flicking across her otherwise controlled features.\n\n"I wouldn't say so, no. The past is a different time."\n\n"Different, but rosier than the present. I certainly won't miss the days of fighting over bills when this is all over."\n\n"Oh, Nikolai. This isn't fighting, this is just... my father used to call it war without war. And look where we've gotten this Republic, by fighting this hard. How far we've come. If this is how democracy works, I'll stick by it."\n\nStalina smiles, almost wolfish. "And I know you, you old fox - you like it here as much as I do. You'd die without the next bill to argue down or to push up."\n\nVosnesensky laughs back at her. "You truly do know me. Perhaps I have still underestimated you, hm, Stalina? Yes, perhaps there is health left in this place - even if this old fox dies, Komi will struggle to breathe.""
 KOM.150.a: "Hot tea, warm words."

 KOM.151.t: "Direct Action"
 KOM.151.d: "The house burns behind them, as all houses do in time. Screams are cut short by the bark of gunfire, mercifully swift. A gunman retches to the side of the acrid smokestack that pours from the gaping hole in the house's remains. Those with a little more composure hold the sobbing townsfolk and the screaming widow away from the scene. (If she wasn't a widow before, she is certainly a widow now.)\n\nOfficer Popov takes a whiff of his cigarette, hacking as his fingers tremble. He's waiting for someone, and that someone is late. Lateness is not a quality the Vosnesensky Brigade (Irregular) appreciates. As the distant screams recede, his acquaintance swims into view. Grabbing irritably at the dust on his lapels, Commander Koslov makes his way to the burning frontage. He kicks aside a brick, nods briskly, and the two are down to business.\n\n"There is little to discuss, Popov." The Commander glares into the distance, pointing southeast of the duo's position. "You shoot two men here, we kill a couple more. We'll do the same this time next week."\n\n"Not what I was talking about. We're hitting those fucking Bolshies in our own neighbourhoods, so what about the others?" Popov is venomous, his searing gaze directed towards all of Communism, or perhaps it is focused on Koslov. "We need to spread out. This does nothing for the health of the Republic."\n\nKoslov brushes his ragged beard. His men will gladly go where there is game to be had, but control is thin enough in this district as it is. Is it worth the expenditure? Will their paymasters in the Parliament be happy? He shrugs. It will, in the end, be him who decides, not some waistsuited corpse. Democracy is built on the ground in Komi, even when it is built bullet by bullet."
 KOM.151.a: "Expand operations."
 KOM.151.b: "Stay where we are."

 KOM.152.t: "Opening of the 1963 Assembly"
 KOM.152.d: "The annual assembly of the democratic coalition for 1963 took place in Syktyvkar's one good hotel. Perhaps by virtue of its lack of competition, the hotel's quality left something to be desired. But it was indoor, it wasn't in ruins, and the staff mostly kept the attending guests fed with a steady stream of passable food and piping hot tea.\n\nDelegates from all of the coalition's parties could be seen. Chief among them were Voznesensky's colleagues in the social democrat party and Morozov's social liberals, the twin pillar of the democratic coalition. Present less in a political quality, and more in their role as important bureaucrats and power brokers of the coalition were members of the democratic government, such as police officers, bureaucrats and paramilitary bosses. These institutions member tended to gather around Stalina and her increasingly influential PSD party. The rising star of the democratic coalition drew much attention and courtesy visits from both other democratic parties. If this situation bothered any of the other party chiefs, no clear evidence could be seen in their warm reception of the woman and her closest associates."
 KOM.152.a: "Let it begin."

 KOM.153.t: "Stalina's Speech"
 KOM.153.d: "Stalina spoke first, unattached as she was to any political organization. Her message was previsible, yet not unwelcome in these times before the electoral madness visited Syktyvkar.\n\n"It is a great pleasure as always to speak to this honorable assembly. I will not bore the esteemed member of the ruling coalition with my life story once more, if only to underline again how this free republic took me in in these difficult times for Russia. This gift of freedom and peace, of a place where we can help one another to rebuild our fractured nation, this gift of democracy enduring and untarnished, this gift is one I ardently wish to protect. As this assembly proceeds with the election of a candidate for the presidential elections, I stress to all gathered today: debate the merits of each presidential hopeful. But once a candidate for our coalition is chosen, I implore you to follow them without hesitation. The unity of our coalition is one of our strongest weapons against the radicals that seek to bring our Republic to an early end. The dogs of the Communist Party, the animals found in Komi's far right fringes... they care not one whit for our institutions. The Republic must treat this contempt with her own contempt, for democracy must defend itself at any cost.""

 KOM.153.b: "Magnificently said."
 KOM.153.c: "She plants the seeds of civil war."

 KOM.154.t: "Morozov's Speech"
 KOM.154.d: "The leader of the SMR, Morozov was next. His own rhetoric was not warm and passionate like Stalina. Rather, the former economist made a clear, concise case, his words, stripped from needless extravagance. After the customary round of thanks to the assembly, and the congratulations given to Voznesensky and Stalina for their efforts in the coalition, Morozov reached the heart of his speech.\n\n"The Germans have squandered the wealth of their nation in fuel and bombs for a terror bombing campaign that has accomplished very little. Now, the frequency of bombings dwindles by the day. Rumors coming from Moskowien detail the upcoming collapse of the Reich. My friends, once the German planes are gone we shall be free to rebuild. We've kept hope all these years. Our childrens were taught as best as possible. Our homes were cleaned of debris where possible. Now that the terror bombing campaign is ending, the reconstruction of Russia can begin. New factories, new schools, new courthouses, new churches. The Republic's citizens are strong and hardworking. A new republic is within reach." Morozov paused. "It is my belief that this republic can re-unite Russia. Chosen as candidate for our esteemed coalition, and elected President of the Republic, I vow to dedicate all my energy to a new Russian nation able to house generations upon generations. Our cause is just, and it shall take us to the Pacific sea in the east... And to Moscow and St. Petersburg in the west. Thank you.""

 KOM.155.d: "After Morozov's speech came President Voznesensky's turn. The President was a popular man in the Assembly as ever, even if his star had dimmed somewhat as new politicians such as Morozov and Stalina had risen. His energetic and driven way of approaching any topic had helped him lead his nation throughout a range of issues, and his particular way of speaking had its usual effect on the Assembly of making everyone in the audience captivated.\n\n"Honorable members of the Assembly, thank you for your presence. Thank you a million times for your support, for it was by your help that I could become President, and it was through your continued support that our coalition government has safeguarded Komi's citizens these past few years. I call once again upon your support for my nomination as presidential candidate. The Republic stands at a crossroad, as shadowy figures emerge to the forefront of Komi's politics. Several sets of long planned intrigues are reaching their conclusion, and their impact on the Republic promises to be an unmitigated disaster. I request a new mandate to continue the struggle against the snakes that wish to usurp our institutions. Stalina was right in denouncing the group of rabble rousers that spread their poison into the veins of our parliamentary system. The time to strike is almost upon us; in a new mandate I would bring down the might of the legal system upon those who scheme the nation's destruction. Our institutions can, and must, be reinforced so that no matter the amount of muck thrown by our opponents into its working, our Republic will live on to bring our people to a bright future.""

Was it true that Morozov's speech had been a dig at Stalina's expense? There were indeed persistent allegations that the rising star of Komi's politics valued the safety of the nation more than its democratic institutions.

We must ensure the election day goes as planned.\n\nOf course, we are presented with a few options to make sure the election goes through how we want it to. We could make it easier for our voters by easing up on registration and making sure we have enough polling places. This would make sure everyone ends up with a chance to vote. However, that could come with the cost of giving the opposition and radicals too much power. It could be safer to invest in some voter suppression in the pillarized neighborhoods. That means we wouldn't need to worry about some undesirable people starting to meddle with our democracy.\n\nWe need to make a choice, our democracy very well could hang in the balance."
 KOM.169.a: "We're a democracy, and we need people to vote."
 KOM.169.b: "What harm could a little bit of suppression do?"

 KOM.170.t: "Preparing for the Bombings"
 KOM.170.d: "Now comes the time to decide the location of where the polling places should be. There are many safe locations where polling booths would fit right in. Places that are safe from German bombers and political extremists. While we will definitely make use of these locations, we do have some more, less safe choices.\n\nWe could make some strategic mistakes and place polling places in 'disagreeable' neighborhoods in more exposed, dangerous locations. That way we could discourage some people who we might not want to vote, and assure the safety of our power in the elections."
 KOM.170.a: "No, every voter deserves to be able to vote safely."
 KOM.170.b: "Our power must remain secure!"

 KOM.171.t: "Taking Note"
 KOM.171.d: "We need to keep an eye on the radicals and ensure they don't subvert the election process for their own goals. They can't be given the chance to sabotage our entire democracy! Their every move will need to be closely scrutinized to ensure the safety of our elections. Who knows what the communists or fascists would do if given the chance. They very well could corrupt the process and take power themselves through manipulation and intimidation!\n\nTo keep a close watch on the radicals, more informers will need to be placed within their organizations. Perhaps a few bugs in their telephones could also do the trick. We must know of their plans before they can take any action on them."
 KOM.171.a: "Perhaps a bug in Shafarevich's home..."
 KOM.171.b: "Communists should not expect privacy."

 KOM.17801.t: "The Third Inauguration of President Voznesensky"
 KOM.17801.d: "Despite it all, Voznesensky stood before the National Assembly as President once more. Was it because of a desire to not disturb Komi's fragile peace? Or, was it because of some hidden quality Voznesensky possessed that made him stand above the other candidates? Either way, Voznesensky was now President once again, giving an inaugural speech before the National Assembly once more. Within his speech, Voznesensky laid out his plans for Komi's future:\n\n"My fellow citizens of the Republic, we must seek unity, not strife. Our Republic must stand strong and united against those who would seek to destroy it, whether these threats come from without or within. We must stand united and strong under the banner of democracy. We must stand strong under the banner of Marx! The DSNP and myself seek the establishment of socialism within our Republic, and under my second term we will continue to prepare Komi for its transition towards socialism. Under the DSNP, Komi has seen remarkable progress, and continuation of our programs can only further improve Komi, in order to make it truly great. We must stand against factionalism, stand against those who seek to divide us! We must stand against subversion and bloodshed! We must stand together, together for Komi! We must stand for the Republic!"\n\nWhile certainly a passionate speech, some critics are worried that this means that President Voznesensky wishes to simply stay his previous path, and are worried that Komi is destined for yet more scandals and yet more corruption. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Voznesensky was the right choice for Komi."

 KOM.17802.t: "The Inauguration of President Stalina"
 KOM.17802.d: "The results are in, and it appears that Svetlana Stalina has been elected as President. Was it simply a dissatisfaction with the status quo? Or, was it something about Stalina personally that elevated her above the other candidates? Either way, Stalina now stood before the National Assembly, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. Within her inaugural speech, Stalina laid out her plans for Komi:\n\n"Dear citizens of the Republic, dear friends, radicalism is a dangerous thing. In the war, I felt the bite of radicalism for the first time. It has cost me my father, my mother, my husband, and my brother. We must oppose radicalism at all costs, before it costs us that which is most precious: our democracy. We must stand together under the principles of sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism! We must construct a strong, united Republic; we must construct a strong, united Russia! Our Republic must be assertive, our brave soldiers must be strong, and our people must be fed! We shall not fall to radicalism, which weakens our democracy and divides our people! Radicalism divided our Motherland, and continues to divide our Motherland! We must ensure the safety of our democracy, so that we may ensure the safety of all of Russia! I vow to you that we shall have stability, and that we shall have unity! Our Republic shall stand strong and united! All of Russia shall stand strong and united!"\n\nStalina's speech was certainly passionate and idealistic. Stalina's critics nevertheless still call her an authoritarian, and voice many concerns over her calls to expand the military and police. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Stalina was the right choice for Komi."

Or, was it something about Morozov personally that elevated him above the other candidates? Either way, Morozov now stood before the National Assembly, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. In his inaugural speech, Morozov laid out his plans for Komi:\n\n"Deputies of the Republic, we can surely all agree that Komi has seen incredible progress in recent years. We have made great progress in recovering from the bombings, lowering the death toll, and attracting people to live in our great Republic. I do not wish to harm any of those advances. However, I believe a new course of action is the right choice for Komi's future. We must not be satisfied with the current status quo, which brings such inequality and chaos to our Republic. We must also not adhere blindly to an economic system that creates such inequality within our people and places such heavy restrictions upon the common man. If we are to develop our Republic, we must introduce: Stable democracy, sweeping market reforms, and a greater openness to the outside world. Komi must see greater liberalization in its economy in order to bring about a truly equal society. I call upon the National Assembly to stand for democracy and reform, so that our Republic may be the shining beacon to all of Russia's peoples."\n\nMorozov's speech fit such a prominent and experienced politician. However, Morozov's critics asked how exactly his reforms would bring equality to the common man, and if Morozov's speech was too optimistic and betrayed his tendency to focus too much upon urbanites and intellectualism. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Morozov was the right choice for Komi."

Or, was it something about Andropov personally that elevated him above the other candidates? Either way, Andropov now stood before the new, much more left-leaning National Assembly, not as a Deputy, or as a mere Communist Party operative, but as President of the Republic. In his inaugural speech, facing packed observer boxes and a nervous Assembly, the stoic Communist laid out his plant for the Republic.\n\n"Friends, comrades, peoples of the Republic. I stand before all of you today with the utmost pride. Through our victory, the workers of the Republic have decried injustice, and carried out a Revolution by ballot - a Revolution not unlike that which liberated Russia decades ago. However, we must not be satisfied by our current victories. There is much to do, and much to strive for: a democracy that serves the people foremost, an economy which no longer places the needs of the bourgeoisie above those of the worker, and a vision for a future in which all peoples may truly be called equal. I call upon the peoples of the Republic, upon the workers in our factories, upon the peasants in our fields, upon the illustrious members of the National Assembly, to recognize that the dawn is only just beginning."\n\nAndropov's speech, as the most openly radical ever delivered by a President of the Republic, immediately drew cheers from the KPK's base - but his critics have decried his "extremist tendencies", "lack of true belief in democracy", and "concerning connections".

Or, was it something about Shafarevich personally that elevated him above the other candidates? Either way, Shafarevich now stood before the National Assembly, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. In his inaugural speech, facing packed observer boxes and a nervous Assembly, the victorious Shafarevich laid out his plans for Komi:\n\n"People of the Republic, we can surely all agree that the people have spoken in electing the Russian National Party. We have made great progress in recovering from the bombings, lowering the death toll, and attracting people to live in our great Republic. I do not wish to harm any of those advances. However, we must not forget what we have been - and what we must not leave behind. We must not forget the tenets of compassion, of faith, of love for our Motherland. In addition, we should not strive to fall to the enemies of our Republic and people - the threats of Communism, of German influence, and of the Russophobia that agents of foreign nations seek to subvert our great Republic with. We must not adhere blindly to a system that has allowed for these threats to rise - in fact, it is our duty to fight against these menaces where they arise! I call upon the proud Russians of the Republic, and for our illustrious National Assembly to stand for the best that we can be, for the best elements of our culture and nation, and against the enemies that face us."\n\nShafarevich's speech fit such a suave and skilled politician - however, left-wing critics of Shafarevich's election have pointed to the accusations of anti-Semitism and veiled hatred within his words, along with his continued connections to right-wing extremist groups. With a member of the RNP in the highest office in the Republic, only time will tell if President Shafarevich was the right choice for Komi."

This has started to discourage many other voters, and some of our polling places are even closing down!\n\nIt is not known if it was communist or fascist paramilitaries that carried out the attacks, and it very well could be both of them. If their goal was to scare voters, it is definitely working. Although, this does not mean they are only scaring away our voters.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not bode well for our election process, and we may see much less voting than we expected. Paramilitary threats combined with the fears of German bombers, even after all the efforts we took to keep polling places safe, have influenced many in their decision not to participate."

This is a great day for our Republic and for our democracy!\n\nWhile the radicals of the far right and far left may contend the results, these elections prove to have greatly weakened their chances at power. No extremist has any chance to be elected peacefully and democratically. But our government must tread carefully, the leftists and their rightist counterparts now only have a stronger reason to pursue power with more violent means.\n\nStill, with our majority, we are free to pursue our agenda much more easily than if we had to cooperate with any radicals.

While the death toll was relatively low from all of this infighting, the Democratic Coalition fear things may escalate, leading to coups and the possible collapse of the Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears nobody can decide upon a plan of attack in regards to these fears. A number of representatives believe that the coalition should focus on the left and their dangerous revolutionary rhetoric. Others disagreed, citing the increasing violence from the right as the largest concern. A third camp within the coalition believes that all of this is unnecessary, and that we should simply focus on campaigning and winning the next election.\n\nThe debate eventually completely derailed into ad hominems and shouting matches, and it was clear to the leaders of the coalition that no progress was being made. By the end of the meeting, everyone was equally unhappy, as it was decided that the coalition will simply agree to disagree.

 KOM_coups.1.d: "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in "proletarian expropriations". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."

 KOM_coups.2.t: "Leftists Attack Police Station!"
 KOM_coups.2.d: "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical 'lone wolves'."

 KOM_coups.3.d: "Driving in Syktyvkar, with its poorly kept roads and tendency towards street violence, has never been easy. Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."

 KOM_coups.4.d: "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

 KOM_coups.5.d: "The breakdown of Komi's political system is now accompanied by the shattering of order on the streets. As paramilitaries rage and the police desperately try to restore stability to the city, less scrupulous citizens have resorted to simply stealing what they need from shops and businesses.\n\nSome of these new brigands are political radicals, forcibly expropriating goods from what they see as either bourgeois thieves or plotters against the nation. Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."

Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state. These days, it seems as though the government is but a sheep surrounded by slavering wolves, with no way to escape or punish these vicious enemies."
 KOM_coups.6.a: "Is Komi doomed to have its throat torn out?"

 KOM_coups.7.t: "Protests Against the Government!"
 KOM_coups.7.d: "Komi's population has never been content to bottle up its discontent in silence. Rallies, strikes, and mass gatherings are a common sight on the streets of Syktyvkar. There are many in the city who feel as though the Republic's leaders have failed them, and in this political moment that number has steadily grown.\n\nProtests that once numbered in the hundreds now number in the thousands. A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system. Among the nervous ranks of the elite, one thought predominates: if this continues, the Republic's very future may be at risk."
 KOM_coups.7.a: "How much more can the people take?"

 KOM_coups.8.t: "Public Discontent Rises!"
 KOM_coups.8.d: "What are the law, justice, or government other than products of a mass popular consensus? All it takes to destroy even those institutions that seem immense and all-encompassing is a gradual loss of people's faith in them. Komi's institutions are new and brittle, and in the face of a crisis of legitimacy they are starting to shatter.\n\nThe public attitude towards authority has changed noticeably for the worse, much to the chagrin of Komi's police and elected officials. Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them. As the slow collapse of police authority in much of Syktyvkar confirms, the Republic is a long way off from earning back the public's trust."
 KOM_coups.8.a: "We must maintain their confidence!"

 KOM_coups.9.t: "Paramilitaries Ambushed!"
 KOM_coups.9.d: "Komi's myriad feuding political organizations have often come to blows. Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."
 KOM_coups.9.a: "The Red Menace grows ever stronger..."

 KOM_coups.10.t: "Church Burnt to the Ground!"
 KOM_coups.10.d: "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."
 KOM_coups.10.a: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

 KOM_coups.11.t: "Communist Attack on the Government!"
 KOM_coups.11.d: "Despite the breakdown in order on the streets of Syktyvkar, many politicians believed government buildings would be spared. The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."
 KOM_coups.11.a: "Code Red!"

 KOM_coups.12.t: "Anti-Government Riots in Syktyvkar!"
 KOM_coups.12.d: "The Capital of the Komi Republic: shiny, stinking. A rotten salmon in the moonlight. Cool air flows through buildings like hands through unkempt dollar-bills, into public spaces dripping neon-white confusion on street signs and protest slogans. Crowds melt and ebb and gather, viscous, ephemeral: the new youth hang on street corners, their tongues echoing all variants of political thought. Tense times. Tense city. Komi fears.\n\nTonight: hooded gazes, coming in packs, like hyenas stalking prey. Everyone sees the storm, the hail-like rain falling in the distance. They come anyway. Wordless is their engine - heart-stirrings from the crushing and cracking city. Komi is a machine, endless vistas of flesh, working like gears. They are spanners. Their time has come.\n\nPolice guards, eyes held like pistols, steady, unyielding, quietly lethal. Barriers, flesh and plywood, holding back the street. Whispers turn to talk, then to yells. Thuds echo - not thunder. Wood on flesh, unmistakable. Points, screams, then all at once, as an orchestra slamming into a new note, a sea breaking on undiscovered tides -\n\nAction.\n\nOne, two, three shots, and the crowd overwhelms the pistoleer. As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen. Street-sweepers arrive to clear the flaming wreckage. Dirt-smeared signs are cleared by noon. Everyone, of course, says nothing."
 KOM_coups.12.a: "This will not be the last. We know this."

 KOM_coups.13.t: "General Strike Declared!"
 KOM_coups.13.d: "Valentina fiddled with his pens, as he usually did at times of strife like these. There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - "no surveillance agents nearby" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt. The workers' tide rose, a wave of garish red, and the government stood helpless to stop it."

 KOM_coups.14.t: "Republican Bandits Raid City Outskirts!"
 KOM_coups.14.d: "We've been receiving scattered, but consistent reports all morning about a raid upon the outskirts of the city of Syktyvkar by an army of Republican holdouts!\n\nTruthfully, 'army' is being quite generous. We're being attacked by men with makeshift weapons and small arms.\n\nNo one we've interviewed has been able to give us a straight answer on what they're after, but witnesses report that they were focusing more on our defences than upon the populace, additionally, a few were spotted scribbling in notebooks, suggesting that this might be the probing force before a much larger operation."
 KOM_coups.14.a: "Fortify everything!"
 
 KOM_coups.15.t: "Conflict in the Police!"
 KOM_coups.15.d: "Our regime has many opponents, and these opponents have managed to organize the civilian population of Komi into misguided protests. These protests have steadily escalated against our regime, and with the appearance of armed individuals within these crowds, it is clear that our government's survival is at stake. Therefore, our government has decided to send in the police, and forcefully disperse the protestors. It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size. As they grow, our government can't help but notice that more and more weapons are appearing amongs the crowds. We need a new plan, since we clearly can't rely on law enforcement."
 KOM_coups.15.a: "Who are they supposed to serve?!"

 KOM_coups.16.t: "Shots Fired Near Internatsionalnaya Street!"
 KOM_coups.16.d: "Despite the fall of their government, the Republican Army has refused to surrender. Now resistance cells dot the countryside, engaging in guerrilla campaigns against our government and our forces. They aren't a direct threat to our government, but they are keeping us from securing our hold over Komi, and it is clear that we should have been more thorough during our coup. The most recent news to reach our government only helps to confirm such a perspective.\n\nApparently, one of our Army patrols travelling between cities has been attacked. The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties. They were forced to return to Syktyvkar, and apparently our soldiers failed to eliminate the rebels that attacked them. We need to send a more prepared force to snuff out this holdout, and we will need to discuss the Republican problem further."
 KOM_coups.16.a: "They may be a nuisance, but they are not a threat."
 
 KOM_coups.17.t: "Rightists Seize Community House!"
 KOM_coups.17.d: "Komi's far-right may not speak directly of the need for Lebensraum, but it clearly feels as though the seizure of more territory is an imperative for its survival. As the Republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergey Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come. The state cannot afford to ignore them for even a moment."
 KOM_coups.17.a: "Not very neighborly of them, to say the least."

 KOM_coups.18.t: "Fascists Seize Arms Stockpile!"
 KOM_coups.18.d: "As the weeks go by, Komi's fragile order seems on its deathbed, and the vultures are circling only closer overhead. The far-right and far-left's attacks on democracy have only increased in severity and frequency, and without clear leadership or the ability to preserve order the state is unable to mount an effective response. The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."
 KOM_coups.18.a: "Do the fascists have any humanity at all?"

 KOM_coups.19.t: "Fascist Sabotage Attempt!"
 KOM_coups.19.d: "As Komi's populace has had to learn quickly, no one is safe from political violence. The police and the politicians are the greatest targets, but ordinary people can find themselves the victims of terror and madness without any notice. The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."
 KOM_coups.19.a: "An incredible stroke of luck. One that cannot be relied upon again."

 KOM_coups.20.d: "Excerpt from Internal Security Bureau, Kotlas Working Group Report To Central Committee, XX-XX-19XX\n\n...causes for the present uptick in virulent sentiments towards the Republic are unknown, although some fairly quick ideas can be surmised. There is the matter of our recent occupation, which has been neither gentle nor accepted in the eyes of the occupied, and there is also the matter of our perceived political weakness. Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause. Strategic options limited, perhaps non-existent, given present circumstances."

 KOM_coups.21.t: "Reactionaries Assail Communist Headquarters!"
 KOM_coups.21.d: "It is hard even to name the disparate groups that are gathered to the fascist movements of Komi, so scattered are their organizations: even so, it is hard to argue with numbers, the most certain metric of threat. By this metric the crowd that has gathered around the Communist Party Headquarters of Syktyvkar have become more than a mere threat: they have become an organized danger to the Headquarters' occupants.\n\nYelling the names of Gumilyov and Shafarevich, the mob holds aloft posters declaring their unabashed love for Passionariyy and their equal hatred of the State. Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionariyy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation. In a sense, it is immaterial - the enraged mob reacts precisely the way one would expect an enraged mob to behave. Residents throw themselves against the walls, attempting to crawl up, and several are injured by barbed wire before the crowd succeeds in pushing a barricade aside.\n\nThe doors are locked, and the doors long since barricaded (standard Party policy), but one inventive protestor manages a parting shot. A Zhdanov cocktail is thrown through the windows, and the conflagration consumes a room of documents before it is put out in the morning."

 KOM_coups.22.t: "Fascist Bandits Strike Patrol!"
 KOM_coups.22.d: "Increased reports have been filtered through local police departments of brutal thuggish attacks by groups of armed men on minority citizens. Rightist bandits, in their filthy radical pleasures, are reported to gang-up on vulnerable jews and other ethnic minorities in back alleys and darkened streets, beating them senseless. Indeed, their presence is known even by passers-by who recognise them as villains.\n\nThey cause a general chaos in our Republic, and although these events are limited and victims often survive, they are becoming more frequent and more deadly in nature. In fact, the attacks are telling of the bigotry that has plunged so deep into the hearts of Russia's criminals; a reflection of the vile and cruel state our once great nation has sunk into."
 KOM_coups.22.a: "Disaster!"

 KOM_coups.23.t: "Reactionary Paramilitary Activity Spikes!"
 KOM_coups.23.d: "Marching in the eastern frontiers of our Republic, the Red Army's steps crunched in the snow. Their strides were orderly, making their way to the nearest village from an encampment. Our men were tired and bitter from the cold, the only thing keeping them going was the thought of food and warmth as they approached civilization.\n\nSuddenly a piercing ring shot through the valley and our men were fired upon from battlements hidden in the wilderness' icy hills. The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government. Their 'noble' resistance took the form of these pitiful clashes, only resulting in violence and misery. Once the skirmish was over and blood had spilled red into the winter's snow, the Red Army men counted the lifeless bodies in the snow - now aware of political violence proliferating in our frontiers."

 KOM_coups.24.t: "Vehicles Sabotaged in Slobodskoy!"
 KOM_coups.24.d: "Much to our shock, it seems a fleet of government trucks have been sabotaged today in Slobodskoy! While the trucks seemed fine from a cursory glance, the engines were sabotaged so that they couldn't even start. Due to the internal nature of this, no one realized that the trucks were broken until a soldier tried to start them this morning. After panicking, the soldiers realized that every truck in the fleet was sabotaged.\n\nAs this is where a solid amount of our trucks are located, this deals a heavy blow to our ability to move around troops. While an investigation has started to figure out who did this, it will certainly be difficult to find any evidence, as it seems likely that this sabotage occurred at least a few days ago."

Another faction he could ally with was the supporters of Zhdanov; he seemed to be aiming for a socialist alternative, and had a significant following. He could, of course, stay far from both and trust in Suslov - but allying either one could give him the influence he needed.

If you think about it, they do most of the actual, practical work, and are the ones who manage and run much of the smaller parts of the country, like gears in a large machine. However, deep down, they are all workers. Workers who must be awarded by the socialist system that works for their benefit. Thus, we need to show them how beneficial the new state can be. If we make them promises of increased pay, better work conditions, and everything else we stride for, then surely they will show their support for our side, and stabilizing our control will be much easier."\n\nInitially, many of Ponomaryov's allies were skeptical about the idea, as in their minds the bureaucracy was a remnant of the bourgeoisie that had to go away with it. However, it was an intriguing option to secure their rule. With some more convincing, the project was given the green light."

With most organizations and institutions throughout Komi under the influence of the government, we can use them to further our goals and expand our influence. Additionally, we have secured the support of another fraction of the population by delivering on our original promises to help the working people of the country. While it may have hurt the situation of the government, which will have to increase the payments and give some bonuses to the bureaucrats, in the end, it will be beneficial."

We are desperately trying to salvage the situation as best as we can, but any success is unlikely.

 KOM_left_coups.9.t: "Locking Down the City"
 KOM_left_coups.9.d: "The capital of Komi was in complete lockdown ever since the first tanks left their positions to take control of the city in the name of the Left. No one could get in, and no one could get out. It was that simple, but the arrival of a small wave of refugees would complicate the situation. It was not just one large caravan, but many different ones, each coming from elsewhere. Some were coming from the north, some from the south, and some from Moskowien. Initially, they met the loyal garrisons of the Left, situated in the periphery of Syktyvkar to guard it from any possible incursions or threats. Of course, being in the middle of a coup, they were denied access. But some have resorted to more extreme means.\n\nWith only the key points around the city guarded, there have been "holes" in the security of the lockdown, and the refugees have used this to their advantage. Sneaking under forest cover or jumping over fences and barriers, many have entered the capital, desperately seeking to find shelter. The military does not seem to have this under control. What will our course of action be?"
 KOM_left_coups.9.a: "Lock them in!"
 KOM_left_coups.9.b: "Let them out!"

 KOM_left_coups.10.t: "The Trojan Horse"
 KOM_left_coups.10.d: "Perhaps our lack of action regarding the latest refugees to ask for shelter in Syktyvkar has been a mistake. Several reports from the city outskirts have shown that, in the end, these were not innocent civilians. Apparently, many of them are affiliated with Centrist and Rightist paramilitaries and insurgency groups, and have begun to aid them in the effort to overthrow the recently established socialist government.\n\nWe had believed that our forces had managed to secure the capital, by defeating the vast majority of the enemy troops in battle or disarming them. However, some holdouts continue their operations, and these refugees have immediately moved to help them in their mission. This has evolved into a major crisis, as we are currently in risk of completely losing control to the resurging militias. The socialist government is considering the options it has right now."
 KOM_left_coups.10.a: "We shouldn't have been so merciful."

 KOM_left_coups.11.t: "Intensifying the Crackdowns"
 KOM_left_coups.11.d: "One could sense the tension in the air as General Secretary Ponomaryov appeared to deliver a speech to the army barracks near Syktyvkar, as he had gathered some of the most prominent officers and paramilitary commanders. Of course, not one of them was loyal to the Center or the Right.\n\nThe speech, ignoring the socialist rhetoric and vague promises for progress and reform made, focused on one thing: all loyal units, regular and irregular, would be united under one command, and create the Red Army of the Komi Republic. Closely modelled after all such formations in the history of communist nations, its purpose would be to defend the Republic from any threats that appear, internal or external. At the end of his speech, Ponomaryov received thundering applause, and was cheered by all his allies.\n\nHowever, despite the idealistic remarks made by the General Secretary, the Red Army's goal right now is one, and it is simple: restore order to this chaotic state and ensure the proper establishment of the new regime. The question now is who to focus on eliminating first from the two major movements operating in Komi: the democratic Center, or the Passionariyy right?"
 KOM_left_coups.11.a: "Target the right!"
 KOM_left_coups.11.b: "Target the center!"

 KOM_left_coups.12.t: "Militant Propaganda"
 KOM_left_coups.12.d: "Our grand military is currently in need of more loyal bodies willing to shed blood for the Communist government. One of the most effective ways to gather more troops is to flood the national airwaves with our militarist propaganda in order to invoke loyalty in our subjects. Though much of our messages to the public are loud and threatening, it is necessary to instill courage and toughness into anyone willing to take up a rifle.\n\nUnfortunately, the broadcast of such propaganda may also deter citizens from their faith in the Communist system. Shall we continue with the broadcasting, risking the people's opinion of us?"
 KOM_left_coups.12.a: "An excellent investment."
 KOM_left_coups.12.b: "The wrong choice for the situation."

 KOM_left_coups.13.t: "A Pre-Empetive Purge"
 KOM_left_coups.13.d: "There are many doubters within the Komi Communist Party.\n\nFew men pledge their whole faith in Andrei Zhdanov. Even his allies are unconvinced in regards to his main objectives. These party members may prove to be quite dangerous later on, obstructions to Komi's (and Zhdanov's) success. They may rat him out for being too much of an idealist, with no realism to back his cause.\n\nWhat hangs in the balance is the decision: should he eliminate these "allies" now, nipping the problem in the bud, or should he let them live and keep his support within the party?"
 KOM_left_coups.13.a: "Hold off on this."
 KOM_left_coups.13.b: "They're everywhere, as predicted."

 KOM_left_coups.14.t: "Aiding the Party?"
 KOM_left_coups.14.d: "Bukharina leaned back in her chair, contemplative. Komi was in chaos. Everyone knew it, from the peasants all the way up to Bukharina herself. Furthermore, it was clear that she needed to stabilize quickly, or else she'd likely be overthrown by some other faction. The Republic itself had a fair amount of resources, and proper application of said resources would probably be enough to stabilize Komi, given time. Time that she may not have.\n\nBukharina paused her musings and drank from her cup of tea. It was sweet, but not sweet enough, leaving a bitter aftertaste in her mouth. Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or his rivals. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."
 KOM_left_coups.14.a: "We can rely on the Republic's resources."
 KOM_left_coups.14.b: "Let us ask our comrades for help."

 KOM_278_zhdanov_alive: "Like everything in Komi, choosing who to align with was not easy. While Bukharina theoretically had the total support of the Communist Party, the reality was much more complex. The various factions all had their own goals, and while they supported her to an extent, it was obvious that they withheld a certain amount of their resources for their own purposes. This left Bukharina with a tough choice: who?\n\nShe could align with Suslov, gaining support from the orthodox communists. However, such a move would only boost Suslov's already powerful control of the party. On the other hand, she could align with Zhdanov, but that would risk his influence growing greater as well, albeit allowing the two of them to check Suslov's power. Theoretically, she could lean on only her own people in the party for aid, but that would likely signal a huge blow to the party unity. It seemed she'd have to make yet another tough choice."

 KOM_left_coups.15.t: "Raiding the Radios"
 KOM_left_coups.15.d: "Dimitri sat down at the table along with his comrades, trying to calm his uneasy breathing. While he supposed it was natural for him to be nervous, seeing as how Bukharina herself assigned them this mission, it wouldn't be good to be openly anxious. Dimitri took a deep breath.\n\n"Alright comrades, Bukharina herself has assigned us to conduct a raid. I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. "Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it." Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"
 KOM_left_coups.15.a: "A moderate amount of resources is all we need."
 KOM_left_coups.15.b: "If we don't plan this out and muster more resources, we are doomed to fail!"

 KOM_left_coups.16.t: "Successful Media Blackout"
 KOM_left_coups.16.d: ""While we were able to successfully raid the radio station, we sadly were unable to find the radio operator or any traces of where they might have gone. We restaffed the station with our own people, and it now plays classical music." Dimitri said. Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy. Maybe he'd relax tonight and listen to some music on the radio? There was a new station to listen to, after all."
 KOM_left_coups.16.a: "The airwaves fall under our control."

 KOM_left_coups.17.t: "A Complete Silence"
 KOM_left_coups.17.d: ""During our raid of the radio station, we were able to capture someone. The information acquired from him let us launch secondary raids, allowing for the group coordinating the broadcasts to be captured. They are now under our custody." Dimitri said, proud. Bukharina smiled, very pleased.\n\n"Well done, comrade! I am very impressed with your efforts, and am happy to see that I have good, competent people in the army. Give your men my congratulations and thanks for their hard work." Bukharina shook Dimitri's hand. "I hope you can keep up the good work, comrade.""
 KOM_left_coups.17.a: "Nothing feels better than success."
 
 KOM_left_coups.18.t: "The Airwaves, Alive!"
 KOM_left_coups.18.d: ""Our apologies for a delayed broadcast tonight, some of Bukharina's lot thought they'd actually try to shut us down!" The radio broadcaster said, before drinking some alcohol. "Thankfully, the legitimate army, in the Republican Guard, came and helped us out! They even managed to bring a tank and dealt heavy casualties to the communists."\n\n"You'd think the so-called government has better things to do than raid our little quaint radio station, eh?" The other broadcaster said, chuckling. "Maybe they're not as powerful as they seem, if they can't manage to knock us out? In any case, let's get to our program tonight: how Bukharina's government is doomed to fail!""
 KOM_left_coups.18.a: "What a disaster."

 KOM_left_coups.19.t: "Fascists Raid Supply Caches!"
 KOM_left_coups.19.d: "Bukharina stared at the messenger, growing more and more angry. "You mean to tell me that not only have the fascist militias raided supply caches, but they raided the supply caches meant for wounded civilians?"\n\n"Y-yes Comrade." The messenger fidgeted, unsure of what to do as Bukharina scowled at him. She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else, or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"
 KOM_left_coups.19.a: "The people shall be protected!"

 # Right Coup Tree

 KOM_right_coups.1.t: "A Message to the Democrats"
 KOM_right_coups.1.d: "For all of his failings, Voznesensky had the right idea to cut the ties with the Bolshevism of old, an ideology and legacy that failed Russia not once, but twice. Above petty grievances and ideologies, Komi was built on the simple foundation that the Soviet Union was inherently flawed, and a new way of thinking had to be born. The potential of the worker, of Russia, is boundless, and what keeps us apart is not only petty grievances but our insistence on repeating the same mistakes.\n\nSimply put, this cycle of repetition and damnation is something that cannot stand, if we wish to guide Russia to a glorious future.\n\nAs it stands, you're at a crossroad, which is why this letter comes to you. Right now, Suslov and his pawns plan behind closed curtains, to tread Komi back to the same failing tune that led us to disgrace, and he and his yolk must be stamped into nothing but the annals of the shameful past of Russia. It's your choice if you will be with us, to write the chapter, or but another name to add to this closed book. I trust you will make the right call.\nSincerely,\n\nIvan Serov."
 KOM_right_coups.1.a: "History is written by the winners. Make sure you're at their side."
 
 KOM_right_coups.2.t: "The Democratic Right Submits!"
 KOM_right_coups.2.d: "Ivan Serov wears a simple, stern look on the exterior, but inner he can't help but pat himself in the back as he reads the latest report. Beyond everything, people are creatures of instict, and every prey is wary of a predator after their blood. The nature of state, of Ordosocialism, is a prey to the weaker, frailer ideologies around them, and it is not surprising that many conservatives, that so gleeful claimed to be for the foundations of the Republic, would quickly change their tune to the wonders of the true Workers' state once being given a chance to not be run over by it. Of course, that also means many amongst them aren't really truthful to his ideology, but simply desiring to save their own skin; opportunistics will be dealt with time, once their biggest, common threat is done with. Raising from his chair, he walked over for a familiar cabinet, and picked a bottle of spirits. Any good news were deserving of a good drink, after all."
 KOM_right_coups.2.a: "Za zdorovye!"

 KOM_right_coups.3.t: "Disappearances"
 KOM_right_coups.3.d: "Yekaterina's husband was a very predictable man. Not in any negative manner, but a man that put very much value in the importance of routine. He woke up at the same time and came home at the same time, which gave her plenty of leeways to plan their meals accordingly. He would always come home to a hearty meal, and a clean house.\n\nWhich made his disappearance, in her mind quite odd.\n\nAs she stared at the wooden seat, the steaming bowl of radish soup sitting in front of her, she pondered what could be so important happening right now. Syktyvkar has always been turbulent, but he always assured her that they would be fine. He even recently hired a bodyguard recently! She kept staring at a clock, and as the minutes sunk into hours, as she went into bed, she prayed, for it to be just her neurosis, that Georgiy would wake at her side, the next day and apologize profusely for not letting her know in advance he was going to be held."
 KOM_right_coups.3.a: "The sun rose, and Yekaterina became a widow."

 KOM_right_coups.4.t: "Mobilizing the National Army"
 KOM_right_coups.4.d: "Serov's newly-established Komi National Army, reformed from the ashes of the inefficient Republican armed forces, have been mobilized and are already acting to secure the streets around the national assembly in Syktyvkar. As trucks enter the city limits and shots are fired, we are currently in limbo as Serov's loyalists attempt to extend their authority throughout the city - with no Syktyvkar, there is no control throughout the rest of the Republic, and if not handled carefully, everything could come crashing down.\n\nThe protestors that are staring down the barrels of our guns are just as adamant about removing Serov as Serov is about removing them. However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests. When the time is right, the infiltrators will wreak havoc and collapse their organization. What should we do?"
 KOM_right_coups.4.a: "Deploy the army; no mercy for dissenters."
 KOM_right_coups.4.b: "Let's try a more nuanced approach."

 KOM_right_coups.5.t: "Surprise Assassinations"
 KOM_right_coups.5.d: "Sergey Taboritsky stood before his Court and his commanders. Sergey Taboritsky was formulating a plan from within his bunker. The Republic was weak, and the Judeo-Bolshevik menace and the perverted, decadent republicans were too busy fighting each other to notice Taboritsky plotting his first moves. If there was ever a time to strike and usurp the Republic in the name of the rightful Emperor of Russia, it was now.\n\nHe instructed his Court and commanders to grab the guns, the bombs, and the gas. No punches would be pulled in this crucial hour. The only question remaining for the Regent to answer was how to deploy these weapons. Taboritsky could target that cursed Bolshevik traitor Suslov, who has been directing the communists from the shadows. No doubt killing Suslov would be a wise decision, and he was most likely planning some foul operation to corrupt Syktyvkar even further. Alternatively, Taboritsky could target the centrists' 'emergency headquarters,' considering that Taboritsky's informants have located the building. Such a strike could decapitate the often irritating republican forces. Taboritsky was quite tempted to put the final nail in the Republic's coffin.\n\nWhile both factions would have to be purged so that Taboritsky could prepare Russia for the return of its rightful Emperor, there could be only one first strike. Once Taboritsky chose who to strike, the other would most likely prepare for such an attack, making the Regent's position less certain. However, he could simply choose to strike both at the same time. A comprehensive, decapitating strike that would leave little opposition in Regent's way. That would be a risky maneuver, almost too risky, but if it succeeded..."
 KOM_right_coups.5.a: "Target Suslov, the Bolshevik menace must be stopped."
 KOM_right_coups.5.b: "Target the Republicans, their foul experiment ends here."
 KOM_right_coups.5.c: "Destroy them both, leave no survivors. That is an order."

 KOM_right_coups.6.t: "The Death of Suslov"
 KOM_right_coups.6.d: "Suslov was tense, sitting within his saferoom. Suslov, Andropov, and several of Suslov's men were waiting for Suslov's forces to gather. Suslov's watch continued to tick, over and over, mocking him. He glanced at the watch again, and it was still early, his forces weren't ready yet. Suslov didn't know why he was getting so tense over this matter, and Suslov continually kept his watch despite time not moving any faster.\n\nSuslov took off his watch and stuck it in his pocket, so that he could better focus on regaining his composure. He closed his eyes and exhaled, the saferoom silent aside from a muffled ticking. Suddenly, a metallic scraping sound rang out through the room, putting everyone on edge. That was the sound of a grate being moved. Then, the scraping sound ceased, and a new sound began. A terrible sound, the sound of hissing gas. Someone was attempting to gas Suslov, and Suslov guessed who it could be. Andropov attempted to open the door, but it was blocked. Suslov's men threw their weight against the door, but it wouldn't budge from its position.\n\nThe stormtrooper on the other side of the door stood at attention, rifle raised. His makeshift barricade was working, and now all that was left to do was confirm the kills. Slowly, the shouting and coughing grew quieter, and the loud thuds grew weaker and weaker. The stormtrooper heard the shouting become replaced with a barely audible sobbing, and a few muffled coughs later, it was silent. The stormtrooper waited two more minutes, and then left, to report Suslov's death to the Regent."

 KOM_right_coups.7.d: "Suslov was tense, sitting within his saferoom. Suslov, Andropov, and several of Suslov's men were waiting for Suslov's forces to gather. Suslov's watch continued to tick, over and over, mocking him. Suslov checked his watch, and Suslov had reason to worry - his men were supposed to have gathered here five minutes ago. Something had gone wrong. He told a guard to open the door, who came face-to-face with a very surprised gas-masked soldier, busy barricading the door. The guard panicked and shot him, putting a hole right through the soldier's mask. Taboritsky, he was the one behind this. They had to move quickly.\n\nA brief but intense firefight ensued. Andropov and his men all scored several kills against the surprising number of stormtroopers that had entered the building. Suslov was escorted by two guards out the door, all the while under heavy fire, making their way to an unmarked van across the street. Suslov was the first to enter, followed by plenty of weapons and grenades carried out of the saferoom. Taboritsky's plot had failed, and Suslov's fight was not over yet."

Her days of wearing white were behind her now that bands of stormtroopers roamed the streets, it would make her too recognizable. She was escorted by a bodyguard in plain clothing, bearing an AK in case anything happened. Stalina was late for her meeting, and she began to quicken her pace as the safehouse appeared down the street. The Republican forces had been using the small tailor as their emergency headquarters, and Morozov, Voznesensky, and Morozov had surely already arrived. Stalina would have already been there if that patrol hadn't forced her onto that detour.\n\nAs Stalina drew closer and closer to the building, something felt off. She slowed gradually to a halt, trying to figure out why she felt off. Suddenly, a shockwave knocked Stalina and her bodyguard to the ground, even though they were a block away from the explosion. Stalina lied there on the pavement, rattled but alive. The realization slammed into her as she watched the flaming husk of rubble in front of her: Stalina was the last democratic leader left in Komi. Stalina was all that remained of the Republic."

She was escorted by a bodyguard in plain clothing, bearing an AK in case anything happened. As the building appeared before her, Stalina began to quicken her pace. Then Stalina heard gunfire, although she couldn't locate where it was coming from. A stormtrooper burst out of an alley nearby, but her bodyguard opened fire, shattering the man's gas mask. Stalina and her bodyguard took cover behind a nearby burnt-out car, what destroyed it, she had no idea.\n\nSuddenly, a truck burst out of the safe-house's garage, with nobody in the driver's seat. There must have been a brick on the accelerator, as it took off down the street and plowed into a nearby store-front, and the short silence afterwards was ended by an enormous explosion.\n\nStalina stared at the smoke and flames, before she heard a voice from behind, the voice of Ivan Morozov. He was wearing a cheap beige suit, standing next to Ivan Korolkov, who had a few more men behind him. Morozov was beckoning Stalina into the alley. Stalina stepped over the stromtrooper's corpse, and she was gone."

 KOM_right_coups.10.t: "Reconciliation with the Monarchists"
 KOM_right_coups.10.d: "Gumilyov sat in his office, reviewing the letter in his hands. It was addressed to Sergey Taboritsky, leader of the Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire, a minor right-wing faction. However, Taboritsky also had his elite stormtroopers, fanatics who would gladly die for their leader and his cause. Taboritsky was fanatic in his loyalty to Tsar Alexei II, who he believed escaped execution by the Bolsheviks. This posed a number of problems for Gumilyov. Firstly, Tsar Alexei II was almost certainly dead, so Taboritsky's mental health could be called into question. This meant he could be unreliable. Secondly, Gumilyov was not a monarchist, he doesn't care for the Tsars, and he honestly just doesn't like Taboritsky.\n\nIn his letter, Gumilyov worked around their differences, appealing to Taboritsky's desire to see Russia's borders expanded to their peak under the Empire. Some of these claims were natural: Retaking Moscow, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, among others. Gumilyov also made some more extravagant claims, including hinting at the possible annexation of Alaska. Gumilyov felt ridiculous proposing such a thing, but Taboritsky seemed like the kind of man who would make such extravagant claims.\n\nWas all of this really worth it? Taboritsky possessed some very elite paramilitaries, but were they necessary in order to overthrow the Republic? Taboritsky was also a strong orator, with a decent support base. Including the monarchists in Gumilyov's coup could lead to a power struggle if he failed to keep them in check. Gumilyov still held the letter in his hand, he could just tell his assistant to burn the thing, and just do without Taboritsky's monarchists. Alternatively, he could send this ridiculous letter to Taboritsky, and hope he accepted the offer."

 #Unstable Victory

 KOM_unstable_victory.233.t: "For the Survival of the Republic"
 KOM_unstable_victory.233.d: "Ivan Morozov stares unenthusiastically at the meeting table. It is not the nice warm bed with a glass of warm water he was hoping for, especially after the chaos of the evening. The dossier on his desk covers an expected topic, blanketed on the cover like an obscene joke - RADICALISM IN KOMI. He flicks through the pages, his frown intensifying at the red names and cancellations on some of the pages - evidently taken from the Democratic Coalition's own census rolls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of cancellations.\n\nVoznesensky has the smile drip off his face, and he faces the assemblymen with little more than a ghost of a facial tic. He has at least the courage to be honest, even if what he is saying will make their jobs far harder than before.\n\n"Morozov spoke to me this evening, after the end of debate. He says some of his men have lost confidence in the Coalition. They're writing the letters as we speak, and after tomorrow we will lose about 30 men. These men are - were - our majority in the Parliament. We will move to formalize relations with the Communists and the Passionariyy Party in tomorrow's session."\n\n"There are still options. We are, after all, the incumbent - and our policies, while leaning on majority rule, are not entirely dependent on it. And after that-"\n\nHe stops, but the meaning in his silence is clear. It is unthinkable, the democrats of Komi plotting the arrests of their opposition. And yet - perhaps it is the necessary option.\n\nMorozov rides the tide of opinion. He clears his throat."

Time to amp it up a little.\n\n"And who among us does not remember the old years? The arguments we used to have, before Vosenevsky brought us into Coalition and Opposition, about how this Republic would be. Who would stay in Parliament when a thousand dreams clashed at once? How would we solve the problems of the citizen when our castles in the sky waited to be built?"\n\nA little laughter, rueful almost. It's working. Stalina turns back to the main topic. Easy does it - like riding a horse.\n\n"My point is this: it was not because of the beauty of our dreams that we have kept our Republic, as the Union fractured and the old world died around us. It was not ideals that kept us fed, or clothed, or safe. Many assemblymen deny it even now - but it was the common belief we are sworn to uphold, the dream of a Congress for and of all, working not towards paradise, but upwards from the present."\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do.

And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly-"\n\nShe barely hears the dull thud of the shot before a guard slams into her bulk, throwing her into the stage as the audience erupts into chaos. The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."
 KOM_unstable_victory.235.a: "The bastard behind this will pay."

 KOM_unstable_victory.236.t: "Calming the Storm"
 KOM_unstable_victory.236.d: "Old Volkova listens to the chatter of the radio. It's a nice distraction from the constant thrumming hum of the wheat-thresher, and sometimes the stations even play good music. It's about as much as she can ask for these days, and it's not a bad life, all things considered.\n\nAt least this Stalina fellow who's yammering on the radio is a good orator. She tunes the rusty dial up a little, strains her ears:\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nShe nods unconsciously. She remembers the old Union, one where the flutter of the flags belied the dark hollows of its rule. Nowadays the only government functionaries who stop by are the ones who do census-taking, which is a breath of fresh air, really. Things have changed, and mostly for the better, haven't they?\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nVolkova finds herself clapping, for some strange reason, as the speech concludes in a roar of applause - and her thoughts stray to the old passport she still keeps in her closet, signed by Voznesensky himself in the old days.\n\nPerhaps she'll think about voting again, the next time elections come around - and she knows where the future, and her confidence, truly lies."
 KOM_unstable_victory.236.a: "A small victory for democracy."

 KOM_unstable_victory.237.t: "A Bitter Silence"
 KOM_unstable_victory.237.d: "Petro Grigorenko watches as the crowds gather around the Vosnesentsi-sponsored speaker. Factory workers and middle-managers, dressed in the slim-fit waistcoats and suited shirts that pass for Komi haute couture fashion - they seem like the kind of people to gravitate to his friend. In any case, Stalina asked for help in surveying popular reaction, and Grigorenko has never been one to refuse a friend.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nThere are whispers here and there, like a rustling of the wind upon slowly dying branches, but otherwise there is nothing.\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nThere is emptiness on both ends of the radio this time. The crowd continues to whisper, but there is no hint of celebration, agreement or even vague positivity. It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave. Svetlana really isn't going to like what he has to say at the next meeting. Perhaps a little alcohol will help the message go smoother."
 KOM_unstable_victory.237.a: "I'm sorry, Stalina. They just weren't feeling it."

 KOM_unstable_victory.238.t: "Against the Unrest"
 KOM_unstable_victory.238.d: "If we're to survive this avalanche of dissent that's flooded our streets, we need a plan. Currently, we control very little, and the dissidents control a great deal. With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."
 KOM_unstable_victory.238.a: "Fortify everything we can and prepare combat teams for the ensuing riots!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.238.b: "Send troops into the dissident neighborhoods. We can stop this before it starts."

 KOM_unstable_victory.239.t: "Direct Action"
 KOM_unstable_victory.239.d: "The radicals and extremists hold a majority in our legislature, and threaten to destroy our democracy. Radical paramilitaries have been militarizing and arming themselves at unprecedented levels. The chances of a faction ousting our government are too great for us to remain passive. We must strike against the radicals, and remove their fangs.\n\nThe question is, which faction do we target? Both the left and the right pose a threat to the Republic, but our resources are stretched too thin to shut down both factions. We must choose carefully, and determine who is the true enemy of the Republic."
 KOM_unstable_victory.239.a: "We must crack down on the left."
 KOM_unstable_victory.239.b: "We must crack down on the right."

 KOM_unstable_victory.240.t: "Effective Strikes Against the Left!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.240.d: "Our strikes against the left have been a great success. Our forces have arrested several members of the Communist Party, and seized weapons from leftist paramilitaries. During our raids, several arms caches and safehouses were discovered and secured. The left seemed to have been unprepared for such an attack, and our forces have significantly limited their ability to perform a coup. The leftists and their revolutionary rhetoric no longer shall threaten our government, and our minority government is at least a little more secure."
 KOM_unstable_victory.240.a: "Our democracy is now more secure."

 KOM_unstable_victory.241.t: "Effective Strikes Against the Right!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.241.d: "Our strikes against the right have been a great success. Our forces have arrested several members of the Passionariyy, and seized weapons from rightist paramilitaries. During our raids, several arms caches and safehouses were discovered and secured. The right seemed to have been unprepared for such an attack, and our forces have significantly limited their ability to perform a coup. The rightists and their dangerous rhetoric no longer shall threaten our government, and our minority government is at least a little more secure."
 KOM_unstable_victory.241.a: "Our democracy is now more secure."
 
 KOM_unstable_victory.242.t: "Failures Against the Left!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.242.d: "The strike against the left has been severely blunted. Our forces failed to discover the Communist Party's primary safehouses, and our forces have failed to discover any significant arms caches.\n\nIt seems the left had been prepared for our raids, and our attempts to shut them down have failed. It appears our raids, despite their ineffectiveness, have nonetheless incensed several leftist politicians, and the left continue to arm and militarize. It appears our democracy's position has grown even less secure, despite our best efforts."
 KOM_unstable_victory.242.a: "That can't be good."

 KOM_unstable_victory.243.t: "Failures Against the Right!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.243.d: "The strike against the right has been severely blunted. Our forces failed to discover the Passionariyy's primary safehouses, and our forces have failed to discover any significant arms caches.\n\nIt seems the right had been prepared for our raids, and our attempts to shut them down have failed.

 KOM_unstable_victory.243.a: "That can't be good."

 KOM_unstable_victory.244.t: "Into the Files"
 KOM_unstable_victory.244.d: "In order to curb the influence of radicals within our Republic, we need information to act upon. The locations of arms caches, incriminating documents, and the positions of paramilitary commanders. In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"
 KOM_unstable_victory.244.a: "Grab only what our spies can verify, so we can trust what we find."
 KOM_unstable_victory.244.b: "Grab as much as you can, we can't afford to waste time."

 KOM_unstable_victory.245.t: "A Perfect Find"
 KOM_unstable_victory.245.d: "It seems we have stumbled across the perfect intel. Document after document, detailing the locations of weapons caches, paramilitary commanders, and safehouses. All of the information was recent enough to act upon, and barely any of the information had been encrypted. However, somewhat disturbing were the size of the weapons caches. If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time. Luckily, it seems the radicals weren't expecting a raid upon their headquarters, so we should have enough time to strike before they can act."
 KOM_unstable_victory.245.a: "Finally, some good news!"

 KOM_unstable_victory.246.t: "A Perfect Find"
 KOM_unstable_victory.246.d: "It seems we have stumbled across some highly valuable intel. Several documents were discovered, detailing the locations of weapons caches, wanted paramilitary commanders, and safehouses throughout the city. The information appears to be up to date, and it seems the radicals didn't expect these documents to be discovered. If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time. Luckily, if we act smart, we can strike the majority of these locations before the radicals can relocate."
 KOM_unstable_victory.246.a: "Finally, some good news!"

 KOM_unstable_victory.247.t: "Too Much Information"
 KOM_unstable_victory.247.d: "Sergei opened yet another drawer of yet another filing cabinet. Sergei hated patrolling the city, what with all of the violent paramilitaries roaming the streets, but this assignment was a truly special kind of hell. It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."
 KOM_unstable_victory.247.a: "What a waste of time."

 KOM_unstable_victory.248.t: "The Decisive Blow"
 KOM_unstable_victory.248.d: "The Republican Army forces were mobilizing. The information gained from the radicals would be the decisive blow needed in order to stabilize Komi's democracy. The locations of arms caches and wanted paramilitary commanders would be stormed within just a few hours, hopefully before the enemy could mobilize. The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time. If this operation failed... then Komi's republic would likely not last much longer. It was now or never."
 KOM_unstable_victory.248.a: "For democracy! For the Republic!"

 KOM_unstable_victory.249.t: "Counter-Struck!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.249.d: "The Republican Army forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. These forces were expecting to surprise the enemy, and were not expecting much resistance at the various arms caches they had located. If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."
 KOM_unstable_victory.249.a: "Democracy's end draws near."

 KOM_unstable_victory.250.t: "Successful Raids!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.250.d: "The Republican forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. If the intel was correct, a heavy blow should be dealt to the radicals, and the government's position would be made more secure.\n\nThe operation was a great success. Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."
 KOM_unstable_victory.250.a: "Democracy stands strong!"

 KOM_unstable_victory.251.t: "Their Forces Diverted!"
 KOM_unstable_victory.251.d: "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our Republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."
 KOM_unstable_victory.251.a: "This is merely the end of the beginning."

 KOM_coups.284.t: "Further Escalation?"
 KOM_coups.284.d: "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 KOM_coups.284.a: "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."
 KOM_coups.284.b: "Go after the leaders."
 KOM_coups.284.c: "We need to do both to secure the regime."

 KOM_coups.285.t: "Morozov Survives!"
 KOM_coups.285.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Ivan Morozov has survived our attempt to assassinate him! While we were able to begin the process of poisoning him, Morozov quickly realized something was amiss and was able to seek medical attention, leaving him with no lasting effects. Morozov has also managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with the method of assassination, in poison, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 KOM_coups.285.a: "Maybe we should've been more direct?"

 KOM_coups.286.t: "The Assassination of Ivan Morozov"
 KOM_coups.286.d: "It was only noon, but Morozov already felt tired. Attempting to restore democratic rule in Komi was no easy feat, but it only seemed to grow more and more stressful. He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nMorozov greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Morozov stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nMorozov all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."
 KOM_coups.286.a: "A peaceful end."

 KOM_coups.287.t: "Voznesensky Survives!"
 KOM_coups.287.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Nikolai Voznesensky has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The soldiers sent to deal with Voznesensky were successful in their attempt to capture him, but he managed to escape when they were en route to the location where he was to be hanged, escaping into the streets. Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 KOM_coups.287.a: "How the hell did he escape that easily?"

 KOM_coups.288.t: "The Assassination of Nikolai Voznesensky"
 KOM_coups.288.d: "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."
 KOM_coups.288.a: "A roundabout manner, but it worked."

 KOM_coups.289.t: "Stalina Survives!"
 KOM_coups.289.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Svetlana Stalina has survived our attempt to assassinate her! Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism may become more desperate..."
 KOM_coups.289.a: "We must prevail!"

 KOM_coups.290.t: "The Death of Stalina"
 KOM_coups.290.d: "Stalina stepped outside, only to be met by communist militiamen. They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."
 KOM_coups.290.a: "She died with dignity, at least."

 KOM_coups.291.t: "Gumilyov Survives!"
 KOM_coups.291.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Lev Gumilyov has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The bomb meant to ignite when his getaway car started ended up failing to activate, and he managed to escape the soldiers raiding his compound, later finding the bomb. We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the fascists decrying our underhanded methods as hypocritical as it may seem, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 KOM_coups.292.t: "The Assassination of Lev Gumilyov"
 KOM_coups.292.d: "Gumilyov awoke, disoriented. He felt one of his guards shake him yet again, shouting something about a raid. Wait, a raid? He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."
 KOM_coups.292.a: "Only ash remained."

 KOM_centre_coups.293.t: "Expelling the Radicals"
 KOM_centre_coups.293.d: "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 KOM_centre_coups.293.a: "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 KOM_centre_coups.293.b: "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."

 KOM_centre_coups.294.t: "A Compromise Candidate"
 KOM_centre_coups.294.d: "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Chairman of the National Assembly with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Chairman, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 KOM_centre_coups.294.a: "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 KOM_centre_coups.294.b: "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 KOM_centre_coups.294.c: "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Morozov."

 KOM_centre_coups.295.t: "Locking Down the Government"
 KOM_centre_coups.295.d: "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."

 KOM_centre_coups.296.t: "Outside Assistance?"
 KOM_centre_coups.296.d: "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."

 KOM_centre_coups.297.t: "Traitors Among Us!"
 KOM_centre_coups.297.d: "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 KOM_centre_coups.297.a: "A military fiasco."

 KOM_centre_coups.298.t: "The Curfew"
 KOM_centre_coups.298.d: "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:0 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 KOM_centre_coups.298.a: "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."

 KOM_centre_coups.299.t: "Night Raids"
 KOM_centre_coups.299.d: "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."

Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour.

All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."

The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement.

Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 KOM_stalina_coups.303.a: "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 KOM_stalina_coups.304.t: "A Successful Reorganization"
 KOM_stalina_coups.304.d: "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."

However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with.

Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."

 KOM_stalina_coups.309.t: "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 KOM_stalina_coups.309.d: "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Komi Republic. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""

 KOM_stalina_coups.310.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."

No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating.

A muffled yelp sounded out from beneath the burlap sack tied over the prisoner's head.

How much further?"\n\nDaniil nodded and tried to point ahead with his right shoulder. "Just past the treeline. There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again.

Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared.

You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov." Someone gave him a shove, and suddenly Zhdanov felt himself falling. He screamed in sheer terror - and continued to do so all the way to the bottom of the cliff."

There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks.

It echoes in formerly busy market-square, stilling the lively tongues of the merchants who have come from all over Syktyvkar's environs. The rumors have begun to spread, and they cannot be suppressed. Vologda has refused, it is said. On all sides Ust-Sysolsk is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes. A mother, watching them, fingers the pistol in her own handbag. Perhaps, one day, she will take her child to the range, and should he ask why she will merely whisper into his ear, with the grace of someone who can no longer protect her love:"

"You all want to know if it's in the union's best interests to support me. Well, I will ensure that you have a right to strike, firstly. Secondly, the unions will have power in the Congress of Soviets, and the Congress of Soviets will have more authority and power than it has before, so I am not giving them a ceremonial position."

Revolutions, after all, do not wait for the homesick. Even so, Bukharina remains in a distinct mood as she retrieves it from the Party functionary, who salutes stiffly as she cosigns the documentation. She waves it aside, tosses the boy a dollar for his efforts and walks back into her house. The wind is chill tonight - perhaps a little movement of the blinds will be in order. As she enters the room the familiar clang of the ringing phone begins, but upon answering Bukharina hears nothing but dead air. After ten uncomfortable seconds the connection is cut. Confused and worried, she makes a note to dial up Medvedev and the rest to check if harassment against politicians is ongoing. Perhaps a reactionary Passionariyy cell? In any event, she has more pressing matters to deal with than a few agitators. She opens the envelope sealed with Party wax-seal, leafing through the brief dossier.

He's in the middle of describing the terribly convoluted process when the Party pageboy arrives.\n\nA couple of whispers and Zhdanov excuses himself with an apologetic shrug. As he cosigns the Party documents he asks if the boy's heard anything from Central - that snake Suslov has been suspiciously quiet these couple of weeks, and snakes rarely stay quiet unless they're planning on an expedient dinner. The boy only casts him a confused stare in reply. He sighs and returns the form, slipping the boy a little sugar-sweet from a well-meaning guest. (He doesn't take his tea sweet these days, more's the pity.)\n\nWhen the guests have left, Zhdanov toys with his teacup as he thinks about the guests' political potential. Perhaps they have little on their mind besides the usual concerns of the semi-involved unionists, but with a little training, who knows what they could be capable of? On that optimistic note, he opens the letter.\n\nDisbelief gives way to anger, and then to cold understanding. Zhdanov picks up the phone to call the Party headquarters, but on their end there is nothing, not even a respondent to field calls. In a huff, he marches to the door, to be met by the measured tones of Suslov himself.\n\nSuslov stares through his misted glasses, his eyes cold, his face closeted."

Here and there what appeared to be the angular form of planes - rockets, perhaps? - arose from the scintillating mist around them, nestled in the ocean of red font like Venus of Botticelli.\n\nAnd at the bottom of it all a slogan: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW WITH TODAY'S SOCIALISM - FOLLOW THE VISIONARY LINE.\n\nEvanoff sniffed. They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened. ZHDANOV TODAY - THE STARS TOMORROW!\n\nMs Evanoff stared and stared, and then she began to giggle. It was so bold, it was almost endearing.

When Serov had presented his theories to him before, Suslov was optimistic. Though Serov was inarguably a brute, he was a loyal one, and wasn't ignorant of Marxism. Though Suslov didn't quite expect the second coming of Lenin, he hoped that the ex-NKVD chief would at least demonstrate some knowledge of socialism.\n\nInstead, he found horror. Suslov sighed and shuffled through the papers once again, the churning in his gut only intensifying. Nothing about the Manifesto was inherently wrong or reactionary, but Serov's wording, particularly in regard to what he referred to as "Hereditary Reactionaries," suggested something far more sinister than simple theory laid under the surface of the manifesto.\n\nSuslov pushed himself away from his desk, stood quickly, hands quivering, and called for a messenger."

"This... theory of yours." He paused.\n\nSerov saw an opportunity - perhaps if he spoke fast enough, he could explain the revelations he had come to. "I -"\n\n"You." Suslov spoke sharply, losing all pretense of neutrality. Again, Serov felt a dagger in his stomach. "These musings of yours, Comrade Serov, they suggest you are dreadfully misinformed about several things. You have been called here not for punishment - not yet -, but so we may correct this error."\n\nIf it was anyone else before him, Serov would sharply challenge the notion that he wasn't being censured - but as he gazed into the cold steel of Suslov's eyes, words seemed to fail.\n\nFor what seemed like hours, Suslov tore apart Serov's beloved Manifesto, and in the end calmly banned him from spreading it under threat of party expulsion.\n\nAnother, weaker man would take this lying down, but Serov was not a weak man. He didn't sleep that night or the next, like a weak man would.\n\nInstead he wrote, feverishly, almost maniacally. In the end, it would be worth it. Suslov would see soon just how wrong he was."

No traces of blank white paper remained on the letter he held, only the erratic ravings of a man scorned. If the Manifesto of Ordosocialism flirted with revisionism, this new monstrosity was practically wed to reaction. He read with horror at first as Serov detailed the valuable lessons to be learned from 'the thus-far superior ideology of the German,' and how the Communist Party would do well to 'adapt the tactics of victory,' which, as far as Serov seemed concerned, referred mostly to the extermination of 'Hereditary Reactionaries', state-sponsored corporations, and a promotion of German racial theory.\n\nSuslov nearly slammed the paper onto his desk, hand quivering, not with horror, but now with rage as visions of German tanks and camps flashed through his mind. A snarl snaked across his lips as he pushed himself to his feet. Serov had gone too far. This was not the questions of an uneducated socialist, but the deranged lunacy of a fascist.\n\nSuslov barely noticed his surroundings as he stormed through his office and punched a number into his telephone. A cancer had infected his party, he now knew, and he would see it excised at any cost."

Zhdanov, to his credit, had nearly immediately arrived at headquarters and agreed to sign the letter of expulsion, something Suslov took precious satisfaction with. Though he could feel the growing distance between his old mentor and himself every day, at least they stood united tonight against reaction.\n\nZhdanov placed the pen on the table and gestured towards Suslov as he approached.

 KOM.362.t: "Serov Defects!"
 KOM.362.d: "On the eastern side of Syktyvkar, there stood a short, two-storied building which was completely insignificant for outsiders but was not unknown to a particular lot. Written down in the documentation as a residency for a local typography, the purpose of which is unknown even to their editors, the place served as a meeting hub for supporters and members of the Passionariyy and Gumilyov's circle, being an occasional headquarters and even a recruitment ground. The low profile and formal legality of their work allowed to keep their work going without disruptions, without any need to fear the eyes of overly suspicious people.\n\nThe arrival of figures in Soviet uniforms at the doorstep caught the personnel off guard. The leader, a balding, pudgy, middle-aged man, was not an unfamiliar face to many of them, but no one could place him with the names they knew, and his cold and severe look suggested that he knew exactly why he was here. The presence of the intruders would be instantly alarming, if that wasn't for the lack of weapons on their hands and a small detail of the torn off Communist badges on their clothes, an unacceptable violation for the people of their service. After a short, awkward moment of silence, the leader of the Soviet militants took the initiative:\n\n"Ivan Alexandrovich Serov, ex-NKVD and fierce patriot of the Motherland. I have a very favorable offer for your boss, Gumilyov.""
 KOM.362.a: "A pleasure to meet you, comrade."

 KOM.363.t: "Making an Example"
 KOM.363.d: "Suslov drummed his fingers against the mahogany table, gaze sweeping from official to official as they entered the chamber. The meeting itself was unimportant, a simple discussion of maintenance within Party neighborhoods. The true reason Suslov had called the meeting, and the actual object of his attention, was to discover the full extent of Serov's cancerous web within the party.\n\nThose who attended the meeting were loyal, and those that supported Serov would boycott it in protest, he knew. The news of Serov's expulsion had spread like wildfire, and his ears within the lower echelons of the party had given him a list of those who were less than pleased about that development. The most vocal of which had already been removed. What remained of Serov's powerbase would be too afraid to show their faces today, and Suslov would use that to formally purge them once and for all.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, twelve seats sat unfilled. More than he had expected, but not damning. Suslov quietly turned to his assistant and ordered their names purged from the roster. A curious situation had developed, however. One of Serov's supporters, out of stupidity or bravery, Suslov wasn't sure, had attended the meeting, all the while feigning innocence. An example had to be made, then.\n\n"There is one last matter we must turn our attention to, Comrades," Suslov pronounced as two large men approached the traitor from behind. "It would seem that not all of us present today are here in good faith. Some, it seems, harbor the evils of fascism within their hearts." His bodyguards grabbed the man's arms, twisting them above his head as they forced him onto the table. He screamed for help. None answered.\n\n"As I'm sure you all know, this will not be tolerated within the Party." One of the men drew his pistol and pressed it against the now sobbing traitor's head.\n\n"I urge you all to ensure that your hearts remain steadfast and loyal, for socialist justice meets all in the end, regardless of their pasts. Alexei, if you will - ?"\n\nA gunshot rang throughout the building."

 KOM.366.t: "A New Capital?"
 KOM.366.d: "Even in our most turbulent and uncertain times, it is unlikely that someone could imagine that Syktyvkar, a mid-sized city at the entrance to the rear of Russia, could become a centre of the Russian Republican statehood and a small, if shining, gleam in the devastated country. Surviving its troubled transition to democracy and the attacks from radicals of all sides, Syktyvkar provided itself a special spot in the Russian history.\n\nAs some political workers of the Republic developed sentimentality towards the city with which they went through the hardest challenges in their lives, it is time to admit, however, that in the light of our current strategy, Syktyvkar no longer fits as a centre of the democratic Russian advancement. It is too far from the core of communications in West Russia, and too close to hostile forces.\n\nIt has therefore been proposed to move the capital to Vyatka, the former residence of the short-lived rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor, in order to address these issues. However, many within the government hold that the capital should, despite all of the known problems, remain in Syktyvkar. This is both for reasons of administrative continuity as well as to honor its new history, and to further cement the unique identity of our nation.\n\nBoth options have merit. It is however, in the end, the President's decision whether to move the seat of government or not."
 KOM.366.a: "Syktyvkar is perfectly acceptable."

 KOM.368.t: "The New National Army"
 KOM.368.d: "Fyodor clutched the gun, his fingers numb. He'd trained himself to tremble less, and at the right spots to keep his gunsights level and his aim clear, but the price he paid for it was that shooting felt less like an action and more like a twitch. The target seemed so very far away, and he thought of his home, now further still.\n\nLoud and clear the old voices rang in his mind: "Only a man can fight for his home. Only a man can do this. And if the rebuilding of Russia needs anyone, Fyodor, it needs you." His parents, his brother. The Army had long been his second home, but he'd never forgotten his duty to the first.\n\nThe crucifix around his neck shuddered as the shots rang out - one, two, three, then silence. Fyodor lowered his gun. It seemed he'd been mostly on point for today's rounds. The stained hammer-and-sickle icon that passed for a target had been shot into oblivion, its white scraps hanging on the wire-lattice base. The Sergeant nodded, wrote chicken-scribble numbers into a book, and dismissed him. As Fyodor left, he smiled wanly. Perhaps rifle inspection would be late today - well, it invariably ended later than anyone could predict, and far later than anyone was ever comfortable with. At least the meals were better now that they'd ousted that damned Bolshevik in the canteen...\n\nDmitri nodded to him as he passed into the cramped bunk-quarters. Little talk was necessary, and little talk was offered. Two men cleaning their weapons together - a pastime as old as time itself, and as the two traded rifle oil and cleaning-brushes there was an air of near-amity.\n\nDmitri finished, reassembled the bulky mess of parts into its gleaming whole. Then he knelt, taking well-worn beads from his left pocket, and began to mumble as the beads slipped between his fingers. A prayer for enemies, and for Sytkyvkar, and for the men who would lay their lives betwixt the two."

 KOM.369.t: "Their Oaths of Loyalty"
 KOM.369.d: "[KOM.GetLeader] had never seen a priest quite so agitated as the one before him now. It was almost amusing, like a cat stripped of its favourite toy and left to mew in its own frustrations. Unlike a cat, however, he had no real option to leave this priest by the roadside: no, the God-botherer would follow and nag at the man until one or the other expired of exhaustion, irritation, or both. He sighed, rubbed his sore temples, and turned his mind to the matter at hand.\n\n" - acknowledgement of the role of the Church in the Oath of Service is not some trivial matter! This is a matter of eternal life, for if these men do not die with God in their hearts, they will lack the resolve to carry on." The priest nodded animatedly. "Naturally the Church would like all fighting-men to pray for the health of their leader as well -"\n\n[KOM.GetLeader] gestured for the priest to take a seat. He looked around his office for a tea-sachet. Surely the man would have his tongue stilled, if nothing else. "Thank you for your attention, Father. In truth, I was thinking of adopting oaths from the ones most familiar to us. We are, as you know, a Christian nation, but not all our subjects have had the privilege of baptism. My advisors have suggested a modified version of the Soviet oath -"\n\nHe raised his hands against the already-spluttering priest. "And yes, we are well aware the Church would not be pleased with this, to put it lightly. Which is why I was thinking of a simple oath to the Russian State, until the spiritual health and loyalty of our subjects are ready for a full oath to God's appointed trustee. It is a compromise, and I assure you we will think of something better - but it will do for now."\n\nTime to chase the cat away. He had the affairs of men to settle. "Have a good day, Father.

This aspect of their operational doctrine had been unchanged even as the politics of the State tumbled like a loose clump of dirt in a strong breeze. No one, however, had anticipated a situation quite like this.\n\nThe so-called "chaplains" in front of them - self-appointed, of course - had barred the doors of a barracks after being expelled, calling down the old Fire from Heaven in their own defense. Apparently these renegade priests had taken upon themselves the solemn duty of trying to evangelize to the infantrymen, beseeching them to convert for the health of the Nation and [KOM.GetLeader]. They had made the fatal error of approaching a company whose ranks were dominated by old Soviet veterans, and for that mistake they were set upon by the irritated and godless. It had taken the intervention of the Military Police to set them apart.\n\nA priest, lip still bleeding but head unbowed, rose to speak. "This is a travesty - that the David of Russia, the bearer of the Mantle of God, shall have the Godless as his servants and his conquerors? This is a spiritual crisis. We demand the right to administer His medicine."\n\nA general rose to speak, still trembling slightly from his age. "My men would follow the orders of our State anywhere, but to impose upon them a Church they reject is a sure path to disaster! I ask for the moderation we have always seen in you. There must be a better way to build Russia anew than to hang the Cross upon the necks of all its subjects.""

 KOM.371.d: "The territory once owned by the Order of Saint George has fallen under our control, and our forces have begun to restore order to the area. As with all conquests that we succeed in, different regional questions must be addressed for different areas, and Gayny is no exception. The Order, as the name implies, was highly religious, and much of their funds were poured into monasteries and churches. Over time, however, many of these houses of worship have decayed, whether from natural elements, stray bullets and shells, or German bombs- the constant among them being that most are in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe Right in Komi is predominantly religious, excluding Serov's clique, but the topic of funding to repair the churches has struck a nerve. Arguments fly back and forth between each side- those for it claim that, even ignoring the obvious religious reasons, such a move would undoubtedly win favor from the local populace. Those against it argue that such funding would be better spent on state matters, such as the military. In the end, a decision must be made- who matters more, God or the State?"

It is the only place where such a perverse, backwards symbol should lie. Many things will come of this new development, but one of the most important is the trial of the Red Army, as it should have been a half-century ago. However, an interesting situation has cropped up- one that requires our attention.\n\nIt has always been a habit of the Bolshevik to betray their nation, and it seems that this phenomenon has cropped up yet again. Numerous Red officers, when told of what they would be tried for, seem to have had a sudden ideological change of heart. These rats in uniform seem to be more than willing to switch sides, betraying their old friends for a new job and a shot at survival.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that these men- if they can be called such- will be any more loyal to our army than their old haunts, the Army can always use experienced officers. Letting those who repent collaborate may be a controversial move, but it would certainly be a boost for our relatively green soldiers. The choice comes down to our leadership."

 KOM.373.t: "The Governorship of Vyatka"
 KOM.373.d: "Vyatka, after a long struggle, is under our domain. Years of animosity between us and them have come to a head in a climactic struggle- one that, thankfully, we have won. However, the years of monarchist rule in the region has left its culture decidedly Tsarist- something that part of our faction has decided to use to their advantage.\n\nTaboritsky's clique has begun a push to have him nominated as the Grand Duke of Vyatka. While there's no real harm done by granting him his request- outside of some extra legitimacy for his way of viewing things- some within our faction have pushed against this move, claiming it's merely a waste of time and tying ourselves to the Tsarist days. The decision must be made."

However, Vyatka is gone, and the territory of Berezniki is under our command. The question that has plagued multiple warlords over the years now falls to us- what do we do about the Mladorossi?\n\nOn the one hand, their beliefs- as unorthodox as they may be- do mostly fall in with at least some of the Komi Right. They could make good political partners in the region. On the other hand, some of their other beliefs directly clash with some of the closest held beliefs of our own- some even whisper that they are Bolsheviks under a coat of white paint. Though such allegations are certainly exaggerations, they must be taken into account.\n\nIn the end, this decision may not change the face of Russia forever, but it will certainly play a helping role for one faction or another, depending on what the fate of the Mladorossi is."

 KOM.375.t: "Casting Down Tatar Nationalism"
 KOM.375.d: "Viktor's truck slid to a halt at the gate of the villages, and his men leapt from the back. In a moment, they stomped over to the gate, testing it. When they found it was locked, a short burst from a PPSh split the lock apart, and the soldiers marched in, followed by truck after truck.\n\nViktor watched as his men pulled the villagers from their homes, dragging them to the village square. Soldiers swept the dirt roads, looking for anyone foolish enough to hide or fight. If they hid, they'd catch an extra kick in the ribs before being dragged to the square. If they fought, a sharp staccato of fire would be all they received. Eventually, once Viktor was satisfied with the number of citizens gathered, he left his truck and marched in front of the local mosque, surrounded by his soldiers.\n\n"Citizens!" He began. "From this day forth, you are no longer Tatars. You are Russians! You will speak Russian, you will read Russian, and you will discard your old culture immediately or face punishment! We shall personally see to it that not a single trace of this 'Tatar' culture is shown in this region again! Is that understood?"\n\nBefore the crowd had a chance to respond, Viktor waved his arm, and a hail of Zhdanov cocktails crashed through the mosque's windows and lit the floor on fire. As smoke began to rise behind him, Viktor smiled. His job was complete."
 KOM.375.a: "We are all Russians, like it or not."

 KOM.376.t: "The Conversion of Bashkiria"
 KOM.376.d: "Our efforts to secure Bashkiria have begun in earnest. The roads are filled with trucks driving from village to village, tearing down the old Bashkir flags and symbols and replacing them with our flag. All seems to be well so far, but an issue has cropped up- the issue of religion.\n\nThe Bashkir people are Muslims, and our soldiers are overwhelmingly not. This has led to much friction- both in the region itself and at home. Three distinct wings have broken apart on the issue. The first pushes for an immediate focus on converting the Bashkirs to Christianity. After all, they claimed, it is our duty as honest Christians to bring non-believers back into the fold. This would be costly and take much time to complete, but could be worth it in the end. The second wing pushes for simply crushing Islam altogether- burning mosques, prosecuting imams, and destroying the religious presence in the area as a whole. This is a controversial idea, but would be easier than conversion- though the Bashkirs would certainly be unhappy. Finally, some have proposed simply leaving religion untouched- the simplest, easiest option. Of course, with much of the Right being religious themselves, this is a controversial position to take. In any case, we must act, and act swiftly."

 KOM.377.d: "Shafarevich dropped his pen with a sigh, regarding his latest letter. It was, quite possibly, the most important letter of his political career- a make or break moment for him. Enclosed inside would be what would crack the Right in half. Shafarevich was splitting- forming his own group inside the Passionariyy.\n\nShafaverich and Gumilyov had never seen eye to eye on everything, of course, and perhaps this split was inevitable. The main force binding them together beforehand had been a mutual distrust of the Center and Left, after all. Without either of those posing a serious challenge, the cracks had widened into chasms, and it was no longer expedient- or really even tenable- to maintain the alliance. Across the right, the pieces fall, as Passionariyy members proclaim their loyalty to one side or the other.\n\nMost importantly, however, was which way Serov and Taboritsky would fall. Though neither commanded nearly as much influence as Shafaverich or Gumilyov, their support could be the push that would make or break one side's plan. These thoughts all rushed through Shafarevich's mind as he handed the letter to his secretary- now was the hour where Russia's future would be decided."
 KOM.377.a: "The real game begins."

 KOM.378.t: "The New Vows"
 KOM.378.d: "An interesting question has risen through the ranks of the Passionariyy once again- who do we swear our allegiance to? It's never been much of a problem before, when the Komi right was just that- a political allegiance, confined only to the Komi Republic- but now that our realm is beginning to dominate Western Russia, it's becoming much more of a hot topic among the various factions that make up our power base.\n\nTaboritsky's group, as is common with them, are pushing for a decidedly monarchist vow- one that swears allegiance to the Tsar. Shafaverich, ever the populist, is pushing for the vow to be for the people. Serov himself is pushing for the oath to be to the state. Finally, Gumilyov has used his influence to try and get the oath to not be to the people, nor the state, nor the Tsar, but rather Eurasia as a whole. Each of these groups are using this moment to try and gain influence- an annoying habit of theirs, but in such a tense political environment, it's only expected.

Taboritsky, for his own part, held himself quite well in the face of such an intimidating figure. Both seemed to almost study the other, attempting to find what the ulterior motive of such a meeting must be. Finally, Taboritsky spoke.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke, Serov?" He questioned quietly, his gaze unmoving. Serov looked right back at him, unwavering. His voice sliced through the air like a sword- cold, swift, and deadly.\n\n"No, Sergey. This is no joke. I am entirely serious." Taboritsky cocked an eyebrow.\n\n"What do you mean? There's nothing in common between us. Ideologically, we-"\n\n"I know all about our ideological differences." Serov leaned in. "But we do have one thing in common. We're on the outside looking in. Those bastards Gumilyov and Shafarevich think that it's a two horse race. Why don't we work together, get rid of them, and then sort it out between us?"\n\nTaboritsky didn't expect the brutal honesty, but he couldn't say he disagreed. He smiled- it almost looked more like a grimace- and offered his hand for a shake. Serov looked down, and a smile slowly crept along his mouth."

 KOM.380.d: ""Ivan Serov. A pleasure to see you, as always." Shafarevich smiled, relaxing in his chair. Serov was nowhere near as loose, instead standing rigidly in front of the desk. "So." Shafarevich continued. "What is it you wish to see me about?"\n\n"Igor, you know as well as I do that the fate of the party is soon at hand. Gumilyov, Taboritsky, you and I are all competing for leadership. However, the prospect of a Gumilyov or Taboritsky-led Passionariyy...worries me. Gumilyov is a lunatic, and Taboritsky- I cannot tell if Taboritsky is high half of the time."\n\n"My god, you really are quite blunt, are you?" Shafarevich chuckled. "And what about me, Serov? I know that we disagree on many points. What makes you so receptive to me, rather than the others?"\n\n"I don't particularly like you, Igor." Serov leaned forward. "I just don't want to see my head on a pike, you understand?"\n\nShafaverich nodded. "I understand. It's a deal.""

 KOM.381.t: "The Re-United Passionariyy"
 KOM.381.d: "Shafaverich's posture, though he maintained a poker face worthy of Vegas, betrayed him. Gumilyov noticed the nervous hands clasped together, the slight slump, the tapping foot. His eyes flickered up and down before he began. "What are you doing in my office, Igor?"\n\n"Lev, I know we're not on the best of terms-" Gumilyov cocked an eyebrow. "But you're the best option we have."\n\n"I thought you split from my party for a reason, Igor." Lev stated. "Why would you come back to me now?"\n\n"Serov and Taboritsky are lunatics, Lev. They're insane. They'll drive the whole country off a cliff, and they'll kill us all while they're at it. You see that, right? We don't agree on much, but for the sake of our country, can we not come together, just this once?"\n\nLev looked him over again. Did he really need Shafarevich? He could win alone just as well as with Igor. However, the chance of Taboritsky or Serov winning, small as it may be, was simply too much of a risk to leave up to fate. Perhaps it wouldn't last too long after the conference, but it worked before. Perhaps it could work again."

A truck was waiting outside in the unlikely case he lost- and he did not expect to lose. If he won, the plans to dispose of Taboritsky and Serov were clear in his mind, to be executed almost immediately- before they could escape. Shafarevich was a different story, but he would get around to him soon enough.\n\nShafarevich hid his face behind his papers to hide his growing fear. Plans swirled through his head, mixing and mashing- an escape plan here, an execution plan there.

He would win, or he would leave, and he suspected the rest of the room felt the same way, as much as they tried to hide their emotions.\n\nTaboritsky drummed his fingers against the table. Could he do it? Could he win? If not, what then? He hadn't thought that part of this all the way through- his half-formed plan ending at leaving the city in a car as quickly as possible. Whatever he did after this vote, he knew it would decide his fate.\n\nAs the votes were counted, the tension increased. As it was about to burst, a man stepped up to the podium and began to read."
 KOM.383.a: "The winner is..."

 KOM.384.t: "Taboritsky Triumphant!"
 KOM.384.d: "A stunned silence enveloped the National Assembly as the final result was read. Gumilyov rose from his seat, shocked. Shafarevich's eyes widened in astonishment. Serov's face broke for a moment, showing his absolutely confounded expression. For a moment, there was silence in the room.\n\nAnd then everything began to move.\n\nMen exploded from their seats, shouting unintelligibly about a rigged vote. Some began shaking down those around them, searching for the traitors to the party, to their leader, to the nation. Others made a beeline for the door- their hand was played and lost, and the only thing they could do was leave. Still others rushed towards Taboritsky's joyous men, stopped only by a line of policemen and guards separating the groups from each other. The noise echoed off the walls, only escalating into a cacophony of chaos.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Taboritsky's smile spread across his face. He had always known he was in the right. He knew he would win, no matter what the others thought. Once again, he was correct. Now, the rest of the Right would see what Sergey Taboritsky really was."
 KOM.384.a: "It can't be true!"

 KOM.385.t: "Serov Triumphant!"
 KOM.385.d: "Serov did not smile often. He prided himself on his calm, cold exterior. After all, "Friendly" and "NKVD officer" were not mixable traits. The last time he could remember himself smiling- genuinely smiling, not just the crocodile smile he gave to those he needed for his plans- was at his desk long ago, writing out his masterpiece. He could remember the ecstasy of the final tap of the typewriter, and he could remember the crushing blow of Suslov, rather than even taking a moment to truly think about his writings, casting it aside out of hand. If only old Mikhail could see him now!\n\nHe had worked hard in the last years. Going from the Left to the Right was nearly unheard of, and it took much time for them to trust him as one of their own. He was no fascist, not at all. At heart, he was still a socialist- just not one of those doddering fools or naive idealists who seemed to think that slapping the same red coat of paint on Russia would be enough to win. He knew better. Maybe Russia hadn't wanted to accept it then, but they were going to accept it now. He would make them.\n\nAnd so, as chaos swept the floor of the National Assembly, and men leapt from their seats in astonishment at what was thought to be impossible, Serov allowed himself a genuine smile."
 KOM.385.a: "How'd he pull it off?"

 KOM.386.t: "Shafarevich Triumphant!"
 KOM.386.d: "The Assembly had expected two outcomes to the meeting. The expected outcome was that Gumilyov would enter as head of state and emerge as head of state. After all, was he not the driving force of the Right? The underdog story was Igor Shafaverich- the compassionate conservative, as he styled himself. Shafarevich had been the young face of the Passionariyy, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of Komi. This was not a position he particularly wanted, and his split from Gumilyov's wing drew much attention. Most analysts agreed, however- Shafarevich had made his move too early. His bid for power would come up short, and then he'd surely be in for it.\n\nWhen the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was named the new head of state, the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many. As the men and women of the Assembly filed out, Shafarevich took a moment to savor his victory. Soon, he could really get to work."
 KOM.386.a: "An unexpected outcome."

 KOM.387.t: "Gumilyov Triumphant!"
 KOM.387.d: "It was always expected that Lev Gumilyov would win. It was the outcome most thought would occur- Lev Gumilyov would enter as head of state and exit as head of state. So when it actually happened, the most chaotic the Assembly got was a small murmur of affirmation and clapping from his own wing. What was much more interesting was the events immediately afterwards.\n\nSerov and Taboritsky both rose from their chairs and made their exits- Taboritsky nearly dashing to the exit, while Serov at least had the brains to keep his mask of calm up as he left. No doubt, Gumilyov thought as he watched them go, they were going to try and cause trouble. He sighed- just another thing to hang them for. His eyes flicked to Shafaverich, who had not left. What was he to do with him? It would take longer to get rid of a man as popular as Igor, but it would be done, eventually. Soon enough, Gumilyov would be alone at the top, and the Eurasianist dream could finally be realized.\n\nAs truck engines outside roared into the distance, Gumilyov's joyous demeanor finally returned, and his heart stopped beating so hard. He would never admit it to anyone, but he was a little worried there."
 KOM.387.a: "As expected."

 KOM.388.t: "The Anti-Establishment Coalition Triumphant!"
 KOM.388.d: ""What?"\n\nThere was a single word spoken when the results came in, and all eyes turned to it. Gumilyov had fled from his seat, and Shafaverich had done the same. Both men were the only two standing, facing down the Assembly, to the center. The rest of the Assembly was stunned into silence- not even able to voice their shock and disbelief.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke?" Gumilyov asked, the color draining from his face. The man at the center shook his head. Shafeverich and Gumilyov shared a look- terror, perhaps, or disbelief- and turned back to the man. It couldn't be true.\n\nAnd then, they began to leave.\n\nIt started as a trickle of shell-shocked representatives before the dam broke, a cacophony of footsteps desperate to get out of the way of the hell that was soon to come. Serov and Taboritsky watched the fleeing masses before their eyes locked onto each other. Gumilyov and Shafaverich were gone, thrown into the trashcan of history- the question now was whether Taboritsky or Serov would follow them. The little goodwill built between the two would soon fall to pieces, and then the final battle over Komi's future would begin."
 KOM.388.a: "The two madmen face each other."

 KOM.389.t: "The Reformist Coalition Triumphant!"
 KOM.389.d: "Ivan Serov glares at Igor Shafarevich, or perhaps he's smiling. On the face of a man like Serov, it can be hard to tell between the two. Then they reach out to each other and shake hands. The Convergence is over, and the Impossible Duo has, against all odds, beaten back their opposition amongst the Rightists of Komi.\n\nThe effect is instantaneous: Gumilyov, upon hearing of his defeat, has the cheer crumble off his face, along with his confidence. His hands trembling, he points to the Coalition and snaps, "It was - it was the Romano-Germanics that did this! They have usurped the will of the People, putting impostors in my - our place!" As his own followers stare at this sudden lurch into idiocy, the spell is broken. Gumilyov finds himself the centre of a gradually widening circle, and as he is dragged out of the hall for disorderly conduct no one follows him, or bats an eye.\n\nTaboritsky, conversely, chuckles. He bows his head and he begins to laugh, in uproarious bursts that heave the breath from him, and when he is finished he wipes the tears from his eyes. His eyes shining, he points towards the ceiling in rapturous wonder and proclaims only this:\n\n"I have been wrong. All this time. Perhaps the King I seek shall not be found through me - perhaps I am not a worthy vessel. But as for YOU!" He points to the increasingly confused duo. "Promise me you will follow the will of the Skein. Promise me!" He falls silent, and his own entourage applaud politely, while the rest of the Passionariyy stare in mute horror.\n\nSerov glances at Shafarevich, and there is no warmth shared in the glance, only the cold taste of victory and the colder calculus running through the minds of both. For while two can win -"
 KOM.389.a: "Only one can rule."

 KOM.390.t: "Triumph of the Old Guard!"
 KOM.390.d: "Igor Shafarevich looked over to his ally-turned-rival-turned-ally. The outcome was out of their hands now, all the votes had been collected, and all they had left to do was wait. If Lev Gumilyov had any doubts about the outcome, he was doing a good job of hiding it. Igor was less assured. The rise of Taboritsky and Serov to become real contenders for the Convergence had left him thoroughly rattled, and he felt more anxious than he'd ever expected to. He drew some calm from his ally, however, and kept his composure. A few minutes later, it was finally time to announce the results of the vote.\n\n"The winners of the vote and leaders of the Passionariyy are Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich." The Assembly erupted into cheers, their supporters expressing the relief also washing over him. As Igor got out of his seat, he was pulled into a big hug by Gumilyov, the force of which betrayed that his ally, too, had carried doubts of their success. It didn't matter anymore. Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course. While no doubt weakened by their defeat here, both men had the potential to make a real nuisance of themselves. But that was a problem for another day. Today they would celebrate."
 KOM.390.a: "The Passionariyy stand strong."

 KOM.391.t: "The Collapse of the Anti-Establishment Coalition"
 KOM.391.d: "Ivan Serov and Sergey Taboritsky have never really seen eye to eye on political issues, and their alliance was built on their common opposition to the mainstream candidates for the Convergence, and nothing else. Their gambit proved successful, and the two now share leadership of the organization. With their common foes overcome, few expected the alliance to last very long, an expectation which has now proven accurate.\n\nOnly hours after the end of the Convergence, the two men have already renounced one another. Their respective supporters are already on the move, and life is once again brought to a terrified stop as a fierce power struggle plays out on its streets. While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee. Enigmatic tsarist or NKVD-turned-nationalist, whoever wins this most recent contest will be the master of Komi, whoever loses will be dead in a ditch. For now, the people lock their doors as the battle rages in the streets."
 KOM.391.a: "Pray no one comes knocking."
 
 KOM.392.t: "Serov Enduring"
 KOM.392.d: "The stability of the coalition between Monarchists and Ordosocialists was always in question. Many assumed it would break inevitably - and that to bet on Ivan Serov would be the obvious choice. With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."
 KOM.392.a: "Long live the new Chairman!"

 KOM.393.t: "Taboritsky Seizes Power"
 KOM.393.d: "Few were surprised when the alliance between Monarchists and Ordosocialists only took days to break down. Fewer are surprised that the resulting power struggle has proven to be brutal.\n\nWhile vicious, at least it's also proving to be brief, as a decisive blow seems to have been struck in the small hours this morning when paramilitaries loyal to Taboritsky were observed taking action in several locations across the Republic. Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished. Whether he can keep the power he's secured remains to be seen."
 KOM.393.a: "A Tsarist in the President's seat."

 KOM.394.t: "Reaping the Remnants"
 KOM.394.d: "Ivan Serov is no man of Suslov. That much is clear to everyone who's ever met either of the two, or bothered to sit down with them. However, the fact remains that he was once a member of the Left in the past. Perhaps it is this that comforts him, or guides him to the choice that he takes.\n\nDinner parties. Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. "I will protect the proletariat." "I will restore socialism." "I will keep the traditions of the past alive." Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them. Or - perhaps he's simply opportunistic, willing to bend whatever way will get him power. No one knows but Serov.\n\nWhat is known to all however, is that this is a risky gamble."

 KOM.396.d: "Taboritsky had spared no expense when he'd put together the assembly, and it showed. He didn't like making full use of his money and connections publicly, but for this rare occasion he thought the display of wealth and opulence was worth a little exposure. The Imperial decorations and luxurious refreshments would reinforce his message of Imperial Greatness. He gave the invited guests ample time to enjoy both and waited until a little over two hours into the party before judging that the time had come, and taking the stage.\n\n"My dear friends, fellow Russians. We have taken an important step towards unifying our great Tsardom. It is, however, but the first step of many. Since the loss of the Holy Tsar, Russia has fallen far. Our motherland lies broken and shattered - her people divided, fearful, and in need. That unrighteous betrayal, and our failure to prevent it, set us on this path to destruction, and now, the only path back is through righteousness. A righteous Tsar to lead a righteous people. A righteous people to march away from the humiliations of today and yesterday, away from the spectres of fear, want, and division, towards a future where the greatness of Russia is restored."\n\n"That Tsar lives! Alexei II survived the Bolshevik terror and waits, in hiding, for his throne to be restored. Only then will it be safe for him to return. Only then will righteousness rule the land once more. Until that time, strong leadership is needed to prepare Russia for his arrival. As Regent, I will provide that leadership. I will lead us on the path of righteousness and I welcome all of you to walk it with me. Together, we will restore Russia to greatness! Together, we will destroy the Bolsheviks, traitors and parasites that let her fall to ruin and who will surely now oppose us!"\n\nAnd with that, he led a toast. First to the assembled guests, then to Russia and finally to the Holy Tsar, and punctuated the toast and his speech by forcefully hurling his glass to the floor. He left the stage to the sound of a hundred glasses smashing as his guests repeated the gesture."

"Only by eradicating the tide of liberalism that threatens our institutions can we as Russians prosper, and grow as a people!" Cheers rang out, as the rally entered its third hour.\n\nTo say the rally was a success was an understatement. His supporters were inflamed despite the lateness of the evening, and the fires of Eurasianism burnt bright. But the purpose of the rally was not yet determinable to those he had called in.\n\nIndeed, his final statement would lead to the goal of the rally itself. While several parts of his speech had alluded to "war with the other nations", some had alluded to "unity at home." But between these two concepts, no middle ground could be found for the hardliners at the rally...\n\nIt was time to choose one, instead of flipping between both concepts.

Several Russians have called it hopeful, though many of the native people of Komi are nervous about the 21 points's specification of Russians.

For the others; while there were many more public meetings to come, the first discussion on the new constitution was here. Private, secure, and away from prying eyes.\n\nShafarevich was the first to arrive, a polite grin on his face as he passed into the room like a peacock, strolling with an elegant yet leisurely gait. Gumilyov nearly rolled his eyes at the display, for there were no crowds at this hour for him to woo with his honeyed words and silver tongue. Greetings were exchanged, then patience.\n\nNext came Serov, entering slowly and intently as his eyes swept across the room, like a wolf eying the landscape... or its next meal. Ambition was something all of his guests had, but the former leftist had history they did not.\n\nFinally, the final guest slithered in silently, his eyes slits and his smile unnervingly fixed. A reaction Sergey Taboritsky commonly got from those he spoke with was befuddlement at best - terror at worst.\n\nAll of his guests would have a say in the paper resting between the four men to garner legitimacy for the new state, and all of his guests eyed his position of power eagerly. All would have to be dealt with - but who to marginalize first?"

 KOM.403.t: "The Matter of Economic Structure"
 KOM.403.d: "A crucial facet of any state is the structure of the economy, and our constitution needs to lay out how we will approach ours. The breadth of thought in our alliance means there are many competing ideas for how to address this. There is a general agreement that the government needs to be in control of several important sectors in the economy, but beyond that, there is little common ground to be found.\n\nA large faction contend that we must allow market forces to operate in non-strategic spheres of the economy. They say private enterprises will complement their state-run counterparts to provide greater welfare for all. The best way to achieve both would be to provision for private property rights in our constitution while also specifying that it can be overruled and under what conditions.\n\nThere are many, however, who believe we can only realize our plans under a total command economy. Everything in the Republic belongs to the whole nation, and it is only right that the nation be empowered to mobilize every farmer, worker and clerk to achieve its aims. Private businesses will always, by their very nature, undermine this aim. The constitution should, according to this faction, define all property as belonging to the state.\n\nTaboritsky's faction advocates a third approach. They say that it is these modern economic theories and structures that got Russia to this sorry state. We must cast away these foreign theories and look back to the heyday of Russia. The traditional way of life is what will restore Russia to greatness, and that starts with the economy. The constitution must empower the state to take any measures necessary to return Russians to where they belong."

One such debate has recently come into view of our leadership: the role of the central government in relation to various regions. Taboritsky, of course, proposes that regional administrations hold no power, and only the central government would rule with an iron fist. Shafarevich, instead, proposes a lighter alternative: Federalism, leaving some power in the hands of regional administrations while the central government still rules strongly. Lastly, Gumilyov fights strongly for self-determination among the regions, instead forming a sort of confederacy. Tensions increase, but ultimately one side wins the day:"

 KOM.405.t: "Means to an End"
 KOM.405.d: "Shafarevich poured himself another drink. Gumilyov erased another line he didn't like. Taboritsky accidentally tore another clump of hair from his scalp. Each of the men sat in their own homes, dwelling on thoughts of the past and the future as they shamelessly tried to throw themselves into projects to distract from or alleviate these.\n\nShafarevich knew he had to both make some sacrifices and some compromises to get where he was, at the cusp of power. Yet, as he set the bottle down, he couldn't help but worry. He felt what he was doing was for the good of Russia, he swore to himself, and yet he felt himself drifting further from his principles as he climbed into the echelons of the party. But damn was it a long climb.\n\nGumilyov, as he always did, was polishing one of his rough theories, scribbling on an old sheet of paper at his desk. The time was coming when these would be fact, and he had worked hard to near that occasion. He didn't have the same way with words as his father, the poor bastard, but he was having an easy enough time getting an idea out. Shame they wouldn't stay on the page, as he scratched out each halfway decent sentence he wrote. Determination and, for lack of a better term, passion had brought him to this point, but as evidenced by his writer's block: would it bring him any further than this?\n\nTaboritsky, meanwhile, was on a roll. While passion had brought Gumilyov to the top and Shafarevich had planned his way there, Taboritsky rose in a frenzy. That was his constant state. He had to be planning, moving, seething. Thus, while the rest of those in household were asleep, he was tearing through maps ranging from 1600 all the way to 1962. Most of them were wrong, but he continued to look through them one after the other over and over in search of the true monarch of Russia. That was his goal, after all. To rebuild. To grow. Russia, like him, was a controlled frenzy."

With most of the men in the room stubbornly decided on who they supported, some still stood in the middle. Thus, while others dozed in waiting for another speech to ignore or affirm their beliefs, some sat on the edge of their seats as they waited for someone to take the stage.

He stops for a while in whatever passes for stupefaction in the youth, makes a face and walks away. The Deputy calls after him, "Have a good day! The Government is here for you if you need anything!"\n\nThe next few villagers arrive all at once, in a station-wagon almost falling apart with rust and disuse. The Deputy calls out to them too, shouting, "Have a good day! The Government of Komi works only for you!" Muted laughter resounds from the car's cabin and a face reaches out from what must once have been a window. "Have a good day, Deputy! Must be a lonely day in the office, yes?"\n\nThe Deputy, beaming, turns to reply, but the station-wagon's low growl cuts him off before he can say anything. He looks into the massive cloud of smoke, still smiling, and carries on. So it continues through the morning, the sweeping of stray leaves and the urban garbage of Komi's 57th District into giant piles - and the disposal of these piles into burlap sacks. People stare curiously - once or twice visitors ask for signatures, something which the Deputy is only too happy to provide. Always he reminds the people he meets to vote and keep the Government accountable - something which they can also fulfill by writing to himself.\n\nAs noon towers over Komi the Deputy stumbles into his office, nearly tripping over the carpet. The smile disappears from his face. Glowering, he begins to laboriously type a transcript of his day's endeavors - starting with the number of people he has greeted, and the number of We Believe In The Komi Republic! badges he has given out.\n\nNearly breaking the typewriter with his hammy fingers, he writes:"

Dissidents, once arrested and put through due process, began to simply disappear. The faces of Taboritsky's soldiers hardened, taking on a cruel aspect. Instructions to the citizenry became increasingly terse and cold. People whispered fearful wisdom to one another, spreading tales of arbitrary punishments delivered without mercy or hesitation. Change came gradually, but the day on which a protest was met with phosgene gas and the deadly rattle of machine-guns was the final turning of the key.\n\nThe clock chimed a hollow note, hailing the dawn of a new day.

Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nVologda's generals are characterized, much as their regime was, by a lack of ideological rigor. This quality led them to lay down their arms in the face of the German onslaught, suggesting that they may simply not be reliable for our future moves against the Reich. However, it could be that their decisions were simply made in the face of a collapsing WRRF, and their pragmatism is a worthy quality when serving under a government perpetually vexed by ideological radicalism.

Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nVyatka's generals fought on behalf of a self-proclaimed successor to the Tsar and sought to install a Russian regime that shares the most commonalities with far-right elements within the Republic. Entrusting their ideological fellow travelers with our army may therefore prove a poor idea. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Vyatka was not an ideological monolith much as its White predecessors weren't, and that many of its ideologues, including some of the army, desired something akin to our own democracy. Should their fight for the Tsar be considered treasonous, or should certain, more moderate, generals be entrusted with the defense of our democracy?"

We could put their skills on our side, or we could release them solely to let them live their retirements out as civilians. On the other hand, they gladly fought against us. Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nThe Bashkirs fought for the defense of an Islamist, separatist state incompatible with the ideal of a united Russia. One could very easily argue from a nationalistic or pragmatic point of view that empowering resitive minorities would only lead to instability in their home regions. From a humanistic perspective perhaps more in line with republican values, giving the Bashkirs concessions in the form of letting their generals serve may provide a very small smoothing of our relations with them.

However, some have argued that pardoning their generals and possibly even integrating them within our armed forces would provide an olive branch to the Tatar people.

However, they are questionably skilled at their craft, which has led some to implore our government to integrate them within our armed forces, despite the public fury it would entail.

 ### Coup Events ###
 komicoup.1.t: "Leftist Elements Overthrow the Government!"
 komicoup.1.d: "The relatively calm day in the city of Syktyvkar and the Republic's government was suddenly interrupted, as the supporters of the Left gathered around Suslov, and turned Komi's political landscape upside down by launching a coup.\n\nEarly in the morning, increased activity of leftist paramilitary units was reported, but no one could expect what happened next. Receiving orders from the puppet master of the Left, hundreds of fully equipped and well-trained troops converged on the capital of our Republic, heading for government buildings and the National Assembly itself. They met almost no resistance. Many were arrested, from prominent political opponents to right-wing sympathizers or even normal civilians. In the end, the troops all reached their final destination: the legislative building of the Republic.\n\nAt gunpoint, all members of parliament bar the most loyal Suslovites were swiftly arrested by the military, and the government body, effectively under the control of the putschists, was forced to obey their orders. The Constitution of the Komi Republic has been declared no longer effective, and a new constitution has been hastily drafted, marking the official creation of the Komi Socialist Republic. As for its leader, it is not the puppet master, Suslov himself. Instead, Boris Ponomaryov, well-known as his most trusted ally, has been appointed General Secretary. Suslov himself is merely the Premier of the Republic, preferring to control the new regime from behind the scenes.\n\nWhether the socialist experiment will succeed in Komi remains to be seen, but first, the Suslovite clique that has now seized control will need to properly assert it over the country. Resistance from the center and right will be at a disadvantage, as they now have to become insurgents against the authoritarian government. The next few days will be crucial for the Komi state."
 komicoup.1.a: "More instability is to be expected here."
 
 komicoup.2.t: "Rightist Elements Overthrow the Government!"
 komicoup.2.d: "The rising shocked the current government, beginning with attacks on police officers and loyal civilians. In Syktyvkar, reports of violence streamed to the city hall all too quickly as gunshots and screams became louder, drawing close. Loyalists met the paramilitaries in the streets and alleys. But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."
 komicoup.2.a: "Our Guide shall lead us through!"

 komicoup.3.t: "Government of National Reconstruction Declared!"
 komicoup.3.d: "Dawn always brought Syktyvkar each new day of its uncertain future.\n\nIn the early hours, long before the first of those lucky enough to have cars could head to work, convoys of trucks converged into Syktyvkar's streets. Armed troopers secured each bridge over the Vychegda River, disarming surprised garrisons without violence. WRRF soldiers on the far side looked on as one group of soldiers tried to make a stand, only to see its position shelled by mortar fire. Soon after, the trickle of soldiers turned into a flood. The paramilitaries that the extremists had brought to bear were brushed aside by the full force of the armed forces of the Republic under General Petro Grigorenko. The Republican Guard's IFVs had cordoned off the legislative assembly by the second hour of the invasion. No politicians were in the assembly at that time of the day, of course; they were hiding somewhere in Syktyvkar. Not that it mattered, for the streets were now littered with checkpoints. There would be time enough for the extremists to be found.\n\nThe Republican Guards's technical experts swiftly overtook every strong radio station in town. The same message was put on loop, as Grigorenko took to the airwaves, informing citizens that the state of the National Assembly had been an illegal affront to the democratic ideals that every man and woman of Komi should adhere to. The Republic would be restored by a government of national reconstruction, the message informed them, with the Army replacing the extremists in the National Assembly, installing PSD Deputy Svetlana Stalina as President, and granting her emergency powers. Thus equipped, the President, and the military, would be able to quash any extremist threatening the Republic's most cherished ideals of democracy and progress. The Reconstruction Government, the message concluded, would not rest until Komi had stabilized enough to see its constitution restored."
 komicoup.3.a: "An iron democracy falls upon Syktyvkar."

 komicoup.4.t: "Democratic Elements Restore Control!"
 komicoup.4.d: "Fresh detachments of the Republican Guard arrived in Syktyvkar in trucks, blocking the streets and taking over the bridges. They crossed over the river, quickly asserting control over parts of the city. The paths leading in and out of the capital were sealed, placed under guard by advance patrols. Even the river was taken over, as men on boats prevented anyone from taking to their vessels. From there, they too came to assist their comrades.\n\nThe swiftness of their arrival and of their advances caught the forces of the current government off guard. Police were neutralized. And any response by the city's own garrison was met with a greater one. In no time, they were turned.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes. And now, the whole city was secured. Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term. Komi is now in good hands, to be devoted to a proper republic, one freed of what no longer can be relied upon."

After countless cycles of coups, and after such tremendous civil unrest, the Republic has triumphed. The Republic has risen from the ashes and flames dropped by the Luftwaffe, and it has survived the many knives pointed at its back by its very own people. The rightists and leftists no longer can pose a threat against us, and we did not have to abandon our ideals to do so. The people have made their voices heard, and have embraced democracy as their future. For once, our government may rest, no longer dancing upon a knife's edge. It almost feels like a dream.\n\nHowever, our rest is only temporary, and many external threats wish to see our Republic destroyed once and for all. Western Russia is not kind to democracy's ideals, and we have made our fair share of enemies during our short history. We shall prove them wrong. With the Republic finally secured, we may now prepare to rebuild our forces, rebuild our industry, and prepare to go to war. We shall not go softly into the night, we shall bring democracy's light to all of Western Russia.

However, this world has not been kind to the revolution, and much of the Motherland has abandoned Marx's teachings. However, with the success of our coup, we have taken the first step towards reigniting communism's torch. Through the countless cycles of coups and civil unrest, the revolution has finally been secured, and the Party is now the sole authority left in Syktyvkar. We may breathe easy, knowing that we no longer need to fear the revolution's destruction at the hands of Komi's liberals and rightists.\n\nHowever, the revolution still has many enemies left to face. Western Russia may be home to our ideological allies in Arkhangelsk, but many of our neighbours seek to destroy the revolution once and for all. Tsarists, fascist collaborators, and whatever abomination the Aryan Brotherhood have become, they all wish to see us and our cause dead. We must rebuild. We must equip the people of Komi, and we must go to war. If the rest of Russia will not embrace the revolution, it must be spread by force. The reactionaries cling to a doomed cause, and we shall prove this to them through the strengths of our bonds, and the strength of our arms."

The leftists, liberals, and cosmopolitan influences within Ust-Sysolsk have been destroyed, and now only our cause remains. The failing Komi Republic has once and for all been put out of its misery, along with much of its leadership. The communists have been rounded up and purged, as revenge for what their twisted ideology has put our nation through. With no opposition to oppose us, we no longer have to fear the overthrow of our regime. We have much work left to do.\n\nWith communists to our north, an expansionist tsarist pretender to our south, and... whatever is going on in Perm, our regime still has plenty of external threats to deal with. We must prepare our people for war. This means rebuilding industry, equipping our armies, reorganizing our depleted military, and ensuring that our soldiers are willing to die for our cause. Once we are prepared, we shall wage war against all who seek to threaten us. In the end, Western Russia will surely be ours. The Motherland has long been shackled by the weak, and we shall finally set her free."
 komicoup.12.a: "Our enemies shall tremble against our might!"

 komicoup.13.t: "Stability at Last"
 komicoup.13.d: "It has been done, stability has finally been brought to Komi. Under Stalina's leadership, the Government for National Reconstruction has finally secured the Republic against the constant threat of extremism. Stability came at a heavy price, however. So many coups, counter-coups, and such tremendous civil unrest. Our people have suffered, but we shall heal them. While the Constitution may be suspended, the Republic survives, and the leftists and rightists who wished to see it fall have fallen themselves. Stalina has long known the bite of radicalism, and while she has defeated its presence in Komi, her crusade is not over yet.\n\nRadicalism has consumed much of Mother Russia. So much hate, so much suffering, so much destruction. Radicals surround the Republic, and will inevitably seek to destroy it, as radicalism knows only how to destroy. The Republic shall not fall, however. The people of Komi shall arm themselves, they shall rebuild, and they shall prepare to liberate the Motherland from the clutches of extremism. First, all of Western Russia must be liberated, the communists, collaborators, and Nazis have oppressed this land for too long. Then, the Republic shall reclaim Siberia. Then, the Republic shall look to the west, and allow all of Russia to know the sweet taste of freedom. Then, and only then, will Stalina's crusade be complete."

As per your Communist Party membership, we have come to collect any donations you wish to make to the KPK Election Fund."\n\nVanya nodded, defeated, and handed over the envelope. He knew damn well that it wasn't a donation. It was barely-disguised protection money.\n\n"Wonderful. I trust that you are well? There has been no trouble with the law?"\n\n"No, comrade. Your units have protected us- well. There- there has been no trouble."\n\nThe Party man smiled an innocent smile.\n\n"The Communist Party provides for all peoples. Do not forget this."\n\nHe nods at Alexei's unconscious form, and Vanya feels mildly violated. He can see a glint of malice in the Party man's eye - or is that the light? Regardless, it was all over soon. The uniformed man exited the apartment, a fourth of their paychecks in hand. Vanya locked the door after him, sitting down at the table.\n\nGod, why did he end up in this mess? Why him? He walked over to hug Alexei.\n\nSurely, this isn't what equality meant."

An older man wearing a brown suit sat down next to Sergey, and it was none other than Ivan Morozov himself. Morozov was Sergey's Deputy in the National Assembly, and he was surprised to see a politician taking the tram. Even more surprising to Sergey was when Morozov turned to talk to him, "Hello, the name's Ivan Morozov. Do you know when the tram will be here?"\n\nSergey chuckled briefly at the question, "Some time between late and never, Deputy. I thought you politicians had cars or something, no?"\n\n"Flat tire. At least I get to meet my constituents this way."\n\n"About that. I feel that the President's getting too buddy-buddy with that Zhdanov fella, is the coalition going to address that?"\n\n"Yes, that is a problem a growing number of people are beginning to notice. I would love to bring it up, but the coalition needs unity in these times, not division. If it becomes too much of a problem to tolerate, I will make sure he hears of it."\n\n"Thanks, good to know that you're doing something about it," said Sergey.

He remembered when he was younger, and the stories of Dirlewanger were used to terrify him. Now these children were playing him like he was some sort of villain and not a monster.\n\nKoltsov thought about how his son would react to such games. Would he know the Dirlewanger of stereotypical evil, where he stole young girls so a brave man could save her?

Nobody really remembered who had been the first to call over to the other side and ask if they wanted to take a break for the day. Nobody really cared. They were all just tired- of conflict, of loss, of living in fear. It was all that some of them had ever known in their lives. "Shit," One of the Vyatka guards said, taking a long drag from a cigarette. "You soldiers of Syktyvkar were just good people trying to do their best like us, aren't you? We should've done something like this sooner."\n\nAnother boat passed under the bridge, the crew looking perplexed at the soldiers together atop it. One of the guards from Komi chuckled and then sighed. "Yeah... it really is a nice, peaceful sight, and I have you Tsarists to thank for it, at least partially."\n\nHowever, even as the soldiers of both sides joked and laughed and enjoyed the peaceful moment, heavy questions hung over them all.\n\nIf it was this easy to get along, why couldn't their governments work something out?

Life in the Russian Anarchy was one of struggle and heartbreak, of constant worry and stress. The once-proud people of Russia had been bent to their breaking point. Still, the indomitable Russian spirit could still be seen and felt by those who knew to look. As he looked out at the people of Syktyvkar from his place outside of the Democratic offices, he could see that spirit all around him.\n\nMany in Russia had found causes to rally around. Some of these causes had proven themselves to be righteous, but others were of a darker nature. The wretched Aryan Brotherhood was the ur-example of evil in West Russia, and it had been because of this evil that he had joined the Order of St. George. He did not regret his time in the Order, he had been able to help many of the downtrodden of Russia, the faithful that suffered under the eyes of bandits and marauders. But as time went on, he began to see the faults of his order. More than that, he saw the faults of their leader. Grandmaster Antipin was a good man, he knew that, but the Anarchy bred hard men, even out of good men.\n\nBefore he left, he had seen the Grandmaster grow ever more wrathful. The Order itself was beginning to be molded by that wrath and, in the end, he could not stand it anymore. He had found a new purpose, to protect the people of the Republic. It was a difficult road he had opted to go down, the political violence of the Republic was an unfortunate and dangerous fact of life, but he was prepared for what may come."

It was a single thought, but it was a thought that constantly plagued him as he grew older, and the anger within him burned ever dimmer.\n\nOnce, a long time ago, he was Fritz Schmenkel, a young German boy. He was born in Stettin. His father, a communist, and murdered by Stormtroopers in '32. That, the old man thought, was when the hatred began. The hatred only got brighter when he was conscripted in '38, and forced to work for the very men who murdered his father. A humiliation if there ever was one. They took him from his wife and children.\n\nThen the war with the Soviets began, and he saw an opportunity to help defeat the fascists who took so much from him and his home. He volunteered, and quickly deserted, joining a communist partisan group. To avoid being known, he was rechristened that day as Ivan Ivanovich.\n\nIvan Ivanovich was angry. Deeply angry. He was one of the best partisans out there. He must have helped destroy at least a full division's worth of men. That made the old man smile. But no matter how much he helped, no matter how much he killed, the fascists just kept pressing further and further and further until Moscow itself was in their hands. And the passion for destroying fascism decayed within the partisans.\n\nBut not to Ivan. He spent at least a decade, making the fascist pigs pay for destroying his home and raping his adoptive one. Blowing up trains. Assassinating important generals and leaders. But no matter what he did, they just kept coming. Now, the hatred was missed by something deeper: loneliness.\n\nHe wondered what happened to his family. Was his wife killed? His children? Or were they brainwashed, just like the rest on his block? And the wondering wandered until fantasies played in his mind.\n\nAnd he continued to think his thought, the thought that plagued him day in and day out.\n\nAnd that thought was: 'I want to go home.'"

The streets were empty aside from Suslov himself, and as he turned a corner, he found a similarly empty street. Understandably, not many people liked to take strolls when a German bomber could turn you into dust.\n\nSuslov was so relaxed he didn't notice the sound of faint footsteps, as a man stepped out of a nearby alley, and pressed a knife into Suslov's back. Suslov wondered who would be so bold as to try and take down the General-Secretary of the Communist Party and asked, "Do you really think you can take me down?"\n\n"What are you talking about? Just give me your fucking wallet, smart guy, and I won't stab you."\n\n"Do you know who I am?"\n\n"Yeah, a rich, old man who's going to be in desperate need of a wallet soon," Suslov was stalling, but he didn't see a way out. This man was robbing Mikhail Suslov, the most powerful man in Syktyvkar, and he didn't know it! He would have reached for his pistol, but he didn't bring it. His heartbeat was racing, he had expended all of his options, and the knife was being pressed harder the longer Suslov stalled. With shaking hands, he reached into his pocket and handed over his wallet.\n\n"Thank you for your charitable donation," said the mugger, who then shoved Suslov to the ground, scraping his elbows and knees, and causing Suslov's glasses to fall off of his face.

It was hard to imagine that kid grew up to become this.\n\n"No, Ivan. You're not. You're never sorry for the things you say."\n\nShe wondered when it all went wrong.

"That is not my company's issue, and not relevant to this discussion. Now, leave my office or I will call security."\n\nThose words struck like a bullet in his heart. In that moment, desperation and fear boiled into anger. He couldn't continue the lies anymore. Who did this stuffy bureaucrat think he was? Just another pencil pusher from Syktyvkar? He was a warrior of the Black League, drilled, trained and crafted to be the perfect Russian soldier, the perfect specimen to purge the German horde! The Great Trial awaited them all and none of them even realized it! He had a destiny, a fucking destiny! And that bitch Stalina ripped it from him!\n\n...But he had to calm down.

The Karomivos paused to admire the craftsmanship of the two, Timer being unable to do anything but stare at the bogatyr armor as he looked at the label below.\n\nBOTH RUSSIAN AND TATAR ARMOR OF THE MIDDLE AGES REFLECT THEIR COMMON EURASIAN HERITAGE. THE WORD 'BOGATYR' IS BELIEVED TO DERIVE FROM A TURKIC WORD MEANING WARRIOR.\n\nThe cafeteria served bäleş dumplings and qoymaq pancakes washed down with äyrän, yoghurt mixed with cold, refreshing water. The couple talked about their favourite exhibitions, the favorite thing they learned from it, and all the similarities the "Eurasian" Tatars and Russians shared that they never noticed. But something was amiss, Timer thought to himself. For centuries, the Russians had persecuted the Tatar people: forced them to abandon their faith and ways.

The soldiers winced, not realizing how over-the-top the aristocrats were grabbing food from the table and eating with their mouths wide open where before it switched to an image of Peter the Great.\n\n"It was Peter the so-called 'Great' who led Russia's descent into degeneracy. Believing the decadence of the Romano-Germanics to be strength, he introduced their ways into Russia, beginning centuries of decay. Then the Bolsheviks who introduced egalitarianism into Russia, spoiling a once-proud people with promises of comfort.

There had been a time, she reminisced, when she would have considered that a personal failing - one that she would need to rectify through whatever means she could pull out of her repertoire of learned and tested stratagems.\n\nBut it was no matter. It was difficult to make use of her previous tricks in this grey Hell.\n\nHer objective had been sighted in just the sort of circumstance she expected. Down the hall from her cell was the blocks they used for solitary confinement - blocks that she occasionally heard faint screams from. Screams that made her grit her teeth, and pace across the few square meters of space that she had been permitted by the Government's mercy. In the time she had spent to stare through the bars at the corridor, she had seen two guards dragging a short woman between them, away from solitary - a woman who still extruded an aura of ashen defiance and faded passion. A woman who she had known all too well.\n\nIn the distant past, she had considered eventually breaking her will as a sad inevitability, something that had to be done to realize her vision. But looking into her eyes whilst she had been dragged down the corridor betrayed a different outcome than the one she had expected. Whilst her infamous stark white suits had long been replaced by prison orange, whilst her formerly disciplined and tightly bound hair hung loose and unkempt, Svetlana Stalina was unbowed and unbroken. The Lady of Steel, it seemed, had merely been tempered, and not shattered.\n\nAs she passed on down the corridor, and out of view, Bukharina felt a thin smile cross her face. They may have been bitter foes - opponents that both recognized the other would have to go in order to build the future they desired. But, in the end, in the shadows of both of their defeats, she felt nothing but pride at her former enemy's defiance, and a resolve to adhere to the same standard."

Yekatarina Furtseva: Ultravisionary in disguise, or a true believer in Bukharina's ideals? She had recently renounced Zhdanov and thrown her support behind Bukharina, but was she genuine? This question had stumped the Chairwoman for a few minutes now.\n\nLooking into her past, Furtseva had first gained the Communist Party's attention by writing a scathing critique of a film displayed in a Syktyvkar theater and its satire of the former Soviet Union's leadership. She called for the Communist Party to boycott the theater until it cut all ties with the film's director and stopped displaying the film. It had worked, and she was elected to the former Republic's National Assembly later that year. Furtseva had arrived before Bukharina's popularity surged, and had already allied with Zhdanov when Bukharina arrived in Syktyvkar. This past could mean that she was a reformist, and renounced Zhdanov when it became clear that Bukharina was the real force for reform within Syktyvkar. Alternatively, she was always an Ultravisionary, and was working with them to undermine Bukharina.\n\nFurtseva clearly cared about cultural matters, and clearly wanted to ensure that revolutionary ideals properly reached the public. The question was: what ideals? The position was fairly limited as well, a mere administrative manager, but it was the principle that mattered. Bukharina needed not necessarily trust, but at least a guarantee that members of her government didn't seek to undermine her authority."
 komi.22.a: "We can trust Furtseva, let her have the position."
 komi.22.b: "Furtseva clearly still holds Ultravisionary sympathies, we can't trust her."

 komi.23.t: "The Brawl" #Early-Game
 komi.23.d: ""Another vodka, comrade barman, I don't think I've had enough to drink." Moods were high at The Red Star, Syktyvkar's premier communist bar. The Party-controlled Metalworkers' Union had won their biggest strike in years, and the whole factory was celebrating by getting absolutely hammered.\n\n"Comrade Nikolayech, are you sure? You can hardly walk."\n\n"We don't win every day now, do we? I plan on abusing my liver at least a few times before the fascists have me up against a wall."\n\nAnother man, clearly drunk, shouted, "The Passionarists aren't too bad. Comrade Serov is right, it's the liberals who need to be shot." Mention of Serov was de facto forbidden.\n\n"What the fuck did you just say, you reactionary prick?" slurred Nikolayevich. "Comrade Suslov would kick your ass for that, and so will I." With that, he threw a punch at the ordosocialist, who responded by tackling him off his feet and into a table. A heavyset metalworker tried to tear the man off of Nikolayevich, but mostly managed to knock chairs over as he clung on tightly, throwing punches all the while. Nikolayevich, for his part, was too drunk to feel or counter the hits, and he cursed out his assailant.\n\nA noise complaint brought the police, and the barman went out to greet them. The cops here were in deep with the Party. "It's a fight over revisionism, officers. Nothing to worry about."\n\n"I completely understand, comrade, just try to keep it inside." With that they left, and the patrons indoors eventually succeeded in chasing the Serovite out of the establishment, celebrating with a toast to Lenin."
 komi.23.a: "Hammered and sickled."

 komi.24.t: "Not Up to Standards" #Early-Game
 komi.24.d: ""Mr. Sorokin, I've got another letter from a concerned parent for you. It's about-"\n\n"Let me guess, Nadya," Arman Sorokin said to his secretary, "It's about the curriculum."\n\nSorokin hoped that as a school administrator he would be one of the few public employees in Syktyvkar to not have to worry about the obnoxious politicization of every facet of life that pervaded the city. Evidently he had been sorely mistaken. While political status shouldn't determine employment, he felt that teachers should have standards about their biases. Whichever teacher was the subject of all these angry letters to his office evidently did not.\n\nHere was the problem. A number of parents were noticing that their children came home with... skewed understandings of Russian history. One letter described a seven year old who, upon being asked what she had learned in History that day replied that Russia had been a land of opportunity before Lenin had the tsar shot and brought women into the workplace. Another described a writing assignment apparently requesting that students "write about what the nation means to you, and what should be done to those who don't respect it." There were eight similar letters, and as the school was legally required to be politically impartial, something had to be done about it.\n\nSorokin started by requesting that Nadya look into the teachers' backgrounds, and she quickly came back with a likely suspect. Viktor Bugakov, a history teacher for six months, had both a criminal record and an OVRI membership card. He was fired immediately, but Sorokin could only wonder how such an individual could be hired at all."
 komi.24.a: "There aren't dangerous extremists in administration, are there?"

 komi.25.t: "Timur Alone" #DemKomi
 komi.25.d: "A freezing wind blew in Arkhangelsk as a man in an admiral's uniform walked through its currently mostly empty streets. Between nightfall and the relatively new occupiers of the city, most people wanted to remain indoors for the time being. The man couldn't blame them much; Russia was certainly going through a scary time, and it was hard to trust any government after what some of them had been said to treat the people they ruled. Still, the people aside, it was nice to have an actual port for a change, and he'd put it to good use, or his name wasn't Timur Gaidar.\n\nSomething in the corner of his eye caught his attention, and he turned to get a better look at it. It was a book somebody had abandoned on the ground, and Timur picked it up to read the title. He barely avoided dropping the book when he did.\n\nIt was the book Timur and His Squad, the last written work his father, Arkady, had ever made. It had become a widely cherished children's book in areas of Russia still controlled by communists, and even among the communists in Syktyvkar. It was a story of a young communist boy named Timur and his friends helping the public and furthering the revolution in any way he could... and it was all based on him. Timur Gaidar had once been the very boy that Arkady Gaidar had modeled the Timur of the book off of.\n\nIt was incredible to think of how long ago it had been published. 1940, a year before the invasion. He had been a young boy then, an eager Bolshevik, following in his father's footsteps. Now he served people his father would angrily declare traitors to the revolution. Ah, revolution. What a joke. The revolution, the war, what had they been worth? They'd just made his father waste his life and die needlessly. If the path Timur took now was a betrayal of that revolution, if it made his father turn over in his grave, then so be it."
 komi.25.a: "Let the past bury the past, and look ahead to the future."

 komi.26.t: "Russland" #ComKomi
 komi.26.d: "Many people remarked that a German served as a general in the military of a Russian state so close to Moskowien, especially a communist one. People who spoke to Fritz Schmenkel at length, however, did not remain surprised for long. A deserter from the Wehrmacht, he despised the Nazis with every fiber of his being, had ever since they had murdered his father when Fritz was just 16 years old, had ever since they had imprisoned him for daring to think differently, had ever since they had killed the partisans he had deserted to join after years of fighting, and forced him to flee deep into Russia. His German grew rusty, these days, for when he spoke it people looked at him with a mixture of fear, suspicion, and disgust. He could not blame them, not a single one of them. Every Nazi he had killed, every part of Russia he helped bring into the Soviet fold once more, scarcely compared to the countless sins committed by his people. Schmenkel wondered if he would go to heaven, as the Christians claimed people did, when he died. If not, at the very least he would make sure a mountain of dead Nazis awaited him in fear at the deepest pit of hell."
 komi.26.a: "Peace is impossible until justice is obtained."

 komi.27.t: "Hatred Surrounds" #DemKomi
 komi.27.d: "In a pub in Syktyvkar, two seemingly unremarkable men sat at a table, drinks in hand. With undistinguished appearances and relatively plain clothes, one would never suspect that either was a prominent politician. Nevertheless, they were exactly that, being Leonid Kantorovich and Yevsei Liberman. Though they favored different factions, both men had remained friends for over a decade, and small differences in politics weren't about to change that now.\n\nThey had little left besides each other, after all.\n\n"A toast!" Kantorovich declared joyously. "To the freedom of Russia, and the salvation of the Jewish people."\n\nLooking around in alarm, Liberman let out a breath when he realized the pub was empty except for themselves and the staff. "Careful, Leonid." He hissed. "Much as we've worked to heal Russia of its bigotry, many remain who would hate us for who we are. The brainless goons of people like Shafarevich and Gumilyov still want our heads, to say nothing of the Reich and their jackbooted dogs. Hatred surrounds us, my friend, and it will take a long time for it to cool."\n\nA small, sad, smile on his face, Kantorovich shook his head. "That is precisely why we must celebrate! We have saved at least part of Russia from itself, and in doing so brought the hated Reich a step closer to its demise. If we do not celebrate who we are in a situation like this, we may as well be as dead as so many of our people."\n\nHis brow furrowing in worry, Liberman locked eyes with Kantorovich, catching his attention. "Maybe that's so." He admitted, his expression troubled. "Even still, I need you to promise me one thing.""
 komi.27.a: ""Don't get yourself killed.""

 komi.28.t: "Moving Out" #DemKomi
 komi.28.d: "The sun had just begun to set when he arrived at the Vychedga's banks. Its golden rays illuminating the water in a warm glow. It felt appropriate, an end of an era. Lighting a cigarette, the man turned to look at the city behind him.\n\nSyktyvkar had served the Republic well enough during its time as capital. But, now it was too small and too remote, and then there were the memories. The legacy of paramilitary violence, of government corruption, fascists, and communists lurking in shadows all working to subvert the democracy that had been painstakingly forged in the Russian anarchy.\n\nIt was good that all it was being left in the past, a fresh start for a new Russia, but he couldn't help but wonder if the corruption and backstabbing that had festered in Syktyvkar wouldn't simply find another residence in the new capital. He supposed only time would tell.\n\nPutting out his smoke, he walked back towards the city, the sun setting over the horizon."
 komi.28.a: "A fresh start."

 komi.29.t: "Staying Put" #DemKomi
 komi.29.d: "The sunrise had just begun when he arrived at the Vychedga's banks. Its golden rays illuminating the water in a warm glow. It felt appropriate, a new beginning of sorts. Lighting a cigarette, the man turned to look at the city behind him.\n\nSyktyvkar had served the Republic well during its time as capital, and it appeared that it would continue to do so for many more years to come. The legacy of paramilitary violence, of government corruption, fascists, and communists lurking in shadows, overcome and replaced with democratic governance and effective leadership, for the time being at least.\n\nThe man couldn't help but wonder if staying in Syktyvkar was the right choice, a lost opportunity. Perhaps it would have been better to have made a clean break from the cutthroat politics and corruption that were once a staple of the capital. Taking a drag from his cigarette, he supposed only time would tell.\n\nPutting out his smoke, the man walked back towards the city, as the dawning sun rose over the horizon."
 komi.29.a: "A new beginning."

 komi.30.t: "The Burnside Problem" #Shabby
 komi.30.d: "His old teacher had not had much time of late for mathematics. Evgeny Golod returned to the living room with the new kettle of tea. Igor Shafarevich sat hunched over the table, observing neatly arrayed piles of papers. Outside, the bustle of daily activity was winding down, at this hour between lunch and late afternoon.\n\nThe pair had spent most of the day exploring the Burnside problem, and others like it in group theory. Would a finitely generated group in which elements have finite order would be a finite group? Intuition seemed to say yes. How could finite elements of limited scope generate that which is boundless? Yet, naive intuition was dangerous to any mathematician. Now, the algebraists had an angle of attack toward building a counter-example. For a given field, an infinite dimensional quotient group could be built under certain conditions. From there, solving Burnside's problem was much simplified; all one had to do was create such a quotient group generated by finitely many elements of finite order. This would warrant at least some interest in Russia's dwindling mathematical community. Perhaps in the outer world, someday?\n\nVerifications were moving ahead rapidly. Golod leaned back into his chair, the warmness of the tea mixing with the satisfaction of work well done. In this instant it was so easy to imagine a path not travelled, a Russia not ravaged by war, not divided by scheming generals and politicians. A nation where his friend and mentor had a career as a distinguished academic, instead of his current occupation within the pack of jackals of the Passionary organization. These past few years, Golod had lost himself in his mathematics, to try to blot out the outside world. Perhaps his friend would live to come out on top of Komi's politics. Perhaps he'd be murdered, or exiled. In the meantime, could Golod blame himself for seeking some friendship, some memories of a better past, of an impossible future, with his old colleague?"
 komi.30.a: "Pure ideas, far from unclean reality"

 komi.31.t: "The Tate-Lang-Shafarevich Group?" #Shabby
 komi.31.d: "Evgeny had sent him a pile of translated algebra papers. Americans had not stopped working on algebraic number theory despite everything else going in the world. Shafarevich was excited to read about their findings. A bit melancholy, perhaps, that war ravaged Russia had not kept up. All disappointments were soon forgotten as he read the papers, sipping tea every now and then.\n\nA few developments caught the politician's eyes. It seems that the Americans Serge Lang and John Tate had centered some of their work around what come to be known as the Tate-Lang group. This group consisted of the elements of the Weil-Châtelet group of a number field K that are trivial within all completions of K. This notion had equally emerged from Shafarevich's work in the fifties with collaborators. Intriguingly, the Americans had not been able to determine if such a group was finite. This had been one of the open questions in the Russian Algebra community as well. Shafaverich had no idea if the question was entertained in Germany; early translations of Japanese papers did not seem to indicate much interest in the question from the far east.\n\n"John Tate", Shafaverich spoke to himself. His methods were good. His papers were written elegantly, precisely. In another world where America and Russia had not been separated by catastrophe, perhaps both men could have collaborated. Shafaverich shook his head again, smiling. He wasted so much time dreaming of useless dreams."
 komi.31.a: "Time for the President to write a few letters."
 
 komi.32.t: "Such Little Time" #Early-Game
 komi.32.d: "Mikhail Suslov entered the room, placing flowers at the foot of the bed. He grabbed a chair and pulled it up to Yelizaveta's bed. She still looked like the woman he fell in love with all those years ago. She turned her head to face him, and began to speak, "The news, how long do I have left?" Her voice was shaky and quiet.\n\n"The doctors say that you have a few months left," Suslov did his best to keep his voice steady as he spoke, "It's progressed, they say there's nothing they can do. But-"\n\nYelizaveta interrupted him, "Shhh... It's alright. We both knew this was bound to happen. Dear, you can't get worked up over this. I know I'm dying."\n\n"But I think-"\n\n"You need to think about your people. They need you to be strong..."\n\n"I love you, Yelizaveta."\n\n"I love you too, Mikhail.""
 komi.32.a: "Treasure what time we have left."

 komi.33.t: "Flowers" #Early-Game
 komi.33.d: "Like all of Syktyvkar, the cemetery had been struck by the terror bombings. Just a few meters away stood a crater, the headstones and bodies that once lay there turned to dust. The clouds overhead were gray and it seemed that rain was likely. The Germans wouldn't fly in this weather, not if they valued their lives.\n\nUnlike most days, Mikhail Suslov had no entourage of bodyguards. The only weapon was being held by the men guarding his car, firmly out of sight. No man could see the General Secretary of the Communist Party standing before a single grave under the oak tree.\n\nYelizaveta had been the greatest thing to happen to Suslov, and she was gone. Mikhail Suslov had not been surprised, but that didn't make it hurt any less. He had been forced to watch his wife grow feebler and weaker as her illness progressed, powerless to intervene. Try as hard as he might, Suslov was no match against Death itself.\n\nAs the first drops began to fall upon the grass around him, Suslov wiped his eyes and placed his flowers down next to her headstone. As the drizzle turned into a downpour, Mikhail Suslov left the cemetery in silence."
 komi.33.a: "Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while we live."

 komi.34.t: "At the Center of It All" #Early-Game
 komi.34.d: "Leonid Volkov sighed as he read the endless pile of papers on his desk. The polling data was looking shaky, and the RNP had lost two seats to the PSD over the past month, as their poll numbers tanked due to local scandals. As Igor Shafarevich's campaign manager, it was his job to ensure that his party's candidates could actually be elected, but the Passionariyy-affiliated parties didn't make that easy.\n\nVoters didn't tend to respond well to overt racism. It was as simple as that. He would tell candidates this. Then, they would go on stage... and start ranting about Jews and small nations, and Volkov would have to just sit there and watch the ship sink before his very eyes. He originally had worked with the entirety of the Passionariyy Society, but recently he had decided to focus on the mainstream wing of the party - Shafarevich's Russian National Party. They could at least hide their intentions, and Volkov was at least skilled enough to get people to listen to Shafarevich.\n\nGetting the Passionariyy into the Assembly was not an easy task, but Leonid Volkov wouldn't let that stop him. People responded well to anti-communist rhetoric, they responded well to their economic policies, and they responded well to Russian nationalism. If he could keep Shafarevich and his peers to continue walking the narrow line, Volkov could work miracles.\n\nVolkov then had a realization. Volkov was crucial to getting Shafarevich elected. Shafarevich was crucial to the rest of the Passionariyy. Therefore, Volkov could probably get himself a raise."

 komi.35.t: "Damage Control" #Early-Game
 komi.35.d: "He had gone and truly done it now. It was supposed to be a simple debate between Shafarevich and Deputy Morozov, the only native Komi in the Assembly. He had told Shafarevich to focus on the failures of the Coalition and the economy, but Morozov had brought up Shafarevich's small nation concept. Shafarevich then decided to explain the concept, and it wasn't exactly flattering for the RNP. Volkov had thought that Morozov was just an empty suit, but it appears the Komi politician was more skilled than he had thought.\n\nThis was not the apocalypse however. Sure, data looked poor after the debate, but Volkov had a procedure for these types of situations.\n\nFirst, Radio Free Syktyvkar. Ivanov and Ivanov were the best free advertising money couldn't buy, but if he slipped them a few "donations" he could certainly get them to weave a new narrative. Voznesensky never failed to deliver a new scandal, and Ivan Ivanov could give Shafarevich a flattering, friendly interview, where Shafarevich could moderate his message for the public. Secondly, send out some press statements to the newspapers, and convince them that Shafarevich's words were taken out of context.\n\nOnce all of that had been done, get the public's attention onto someone else. One of his militias had found a KPK weapons stash near a Deputy's home, he could twist that into a proper scandal. As Volkov went over his plan, he knew this was salvageable. He started writing the first letters, and his new narrative began to take form."
 komi.35.a: "The truth belongs to those who weave it better."

 komi.36.t: "The District" #Early-Game
 komi.36.d: "Leonid Volkov was stumped. There was a district that the RNP wanted in their hands. The district's elections were a while away, but to steal this district things needed to be set in motion as soon as possible. The district's former deputy, a DSNP candidate, was not planning to run for re-election. His successor was sufficiently milquetoast, and Volkov could certainly find a more charismatic candidate. That wasn't the issue here. The real problem was that the district had a large minority demographic, mostly Jewish. The RNP wanted to marginalize this demographic, and ensure that the National Assembly was serving the Russian nation's best interests. To Volkov it was a noble goal, but a difficult one to get into the Assembly.\n\nObviously none of Gumilyov's Eurasianists would do. He found his man in the form of a Passionariyy Society member who owned a successful business in the district. He was a gregarious guy, and had even appeared on the radio once. That was the candidate settled. Next was the issue of demographics.\n\nVolkov wasn't sure how to get a majority in the district. Then, he realized that he didn't need a majority, just a plurality. Volkov just needed to make the district apathetic enough to lower turnout, all the while drumming up support behind his candidate. A smear campaign against the DSNP and their upcoming candidate would ensure that they were no threat, and soon the RNP would have that seat. Volkov pushed up his glasses. If he started now, this election could have effects even beyond this single district."
 komi.36.a: "Every election is determined by the people who show up."

 komi.37.t: "Certainly Creative" #Shabby
 komi.37.d: "Igor Shafarevich watched intently as his second-in-command, Apollon Kuzmin, gleefully took the stage and prepared to address the nation. The Chairman of the National Assembly had little opportunity to share his thoughts on the ongoing restoration of Russia, and Igor wondered just what insight Kuzmin had locked away in his mind.\n\n"Greetings, my fellow Russians! I would like to thank President Shafarevich for giving me the opportunity to speak today..." Igor smiled as Kuzmin glanced at him. The Chairman was nothing if not an eager soul. "It is he, after all, that holds the sacred traditions of Russian culture to be among the most important aspects of our state. In this task, I have faithfully worked with him to build a better future for all Russians, while making sure to keep our past safe from dilution. Bad faith actors with no regard for our people who have infiltrated Russia have worked hard to build a certain narrative about our origins..."\n\nShafarevich felt his smile begin to fade ever so slightly. He didn't remember seeing this tangent in the script. Perhaps he forgot? "Indeed, a certain small nation would have you believe that the Russian people share blood with that of our adversaries, but what if I told you that these were nothing but disingenuous lies by the charlatans of the clergy? Our ancestors' roots grew deep, tempered by the blood of ancient Celts since time immemorial. If not for President Shafarevich..."\n\nShafarevich's mouth hung agape as the Chairman continued. His expression had gone from cautious pride to that of sheer horror. He gestured across his neck as Kuzmin looked his way once more, clearly indicating his wish for the speech to come to an end."
 komi.37.a: "Someone get that lunatic off the stage!"

 komi.38.t: "The Aftermath"
 komi.38.d: "Many in Orenburg were not too knowledgeable on who Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky was; nor of any of his several flaws. However, what was known was that he led a democracy with social aspirations, and this mollified some of the people...at first.\n\nThen, Voznesensky's personality and his scandals made their way into the limelight. Tabloids, radio talk shows, and word of mouth spread like wildfire as Orenburg was brought into the fold and to the surprise of no one, divided the people. However, despite the arguments for and against him, the general reaction seemed to be largely...muted. Indeed, despite the occasional group of workers or farmers voicing mild complaints, for the most part they were content with how he was running things. Burba didn't seem too aggravated by him, nor did he seem to be too much for him. If anything, the main reaction to his new hold over the Urals was- apathy."
 komi.38.a: "Apathy is preferable to revolt."

 komi.39.t: "The Aftermath"
 komi.39.d: "Many in Orenburg were not too knowledgeable on who Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky was, but they were not fond of him from the start. Chairman Malenkov himself was none too pleased at being "deposed", even if the government had simply placed him under temporary house arrest and under investigation. The streets were taken to on occasion by protests, and though some welcomed the end of what they saw a tyrant, others- loyal to Malenkov's ideals, or loyal to the wealth and power they had had under him clashed and bickered.\n\nTo the credit of the new ruling government, they had done their best to slowly, carefully enter the region with an open hand and a welcome voice- but Orenburg was nowhere near as open to their thoughts as any optimist could have claimed."
 komi.39.a: "Orenburg stands divided, to the surprise of none."

 komi.40.t: "The Aftermath"
 komi.40.d: "The most hated man in Orenburg right now is Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. A drunkard, a scandal-monger, and worst of all, a statist, this brutal authoritarian has shown the people of Orenburg the terrors of corruption, the terrors of racial hatred, and has attempted to force his statist views upon the communes. His ideals of "social democracy" appear to be solely dedicated to ending the anarchist cause, and decimating Orenburg's proud institutions as a whole. At least, that's what Orenburg says.\n\nWhile most in Syktyvkar have reacted to the newspaper headlines of riots and Zhdanov cocktails being tossed at policemen with a raised eyebrow and sigh, anti-anarchist sentiment is at its peak. Thankfully, the President's latest scandals have managed to be overlooked thanks to a few communal riots, and Nikolai is certain that in time, Orenburg will calm down."

With that, the two briefly go back to silence at their posting. "Boring day again." Andrei finally chimes, as Dimitry turns.\n\n"Honestly, I kind of like it; it's pretty peaceful, and the President didn't do anything to the guard; he simply asked that we become a...club."\n\n"Organization is the proper term. The Guard is so much more than a club, no matter how everyone may see us- we fought against the bandits. The ghosts of the Black Mountain. And now people see us as a glorified police department, heroes from a 'comic book'." Andrei spat, as Dimitry turned. "I didn't know you read those."\n\n"Anything from Syktyvkar is either raunchy, or cluttered with talk about 'symbolism, symbolism, symbolism!'" He lifted his arms, sighing as Dimitry nodded.\n\nFor minutes, it was quiet once again, besides a small bit of wind, and a peaceful horizon, as the two guardsmen of an older age watched the sun set.

Some said he was paraded back to Syktyvkar in chains, only to die on the journey there. Others however, told many stories of how he died, ranging from the mundane to the outlandishly bizarre- but all had one thing in common, and that was his death.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the Bandit King began to slowly fade as life returned to Orsk, championed by a President who was more than content to help people get over the horrors of the past, and remove the stain of the great terror of the Urals.\n\nIn the end, Oskar Dirlewanger would become a small historical footnote, or on occasion the villain of a story, or tale. Within decades, he would become nothing to most people at all."

The nights were cold, and outside of his cot and bedpan, the only company he had in the room was his notebook.\n\nTo say a large number of people hated Trofim Lysenko was an understatement, but he survived their glares, and their rage, and took his life sentence calmly. After all these were lesser men, and lesser men did not understand great works. Lesser men did not understand sacrifice. All they understood was how to crave power, and how to make lengthy promises. They had no love for science and no concept of strife. So, he simply sketched in his notebook and kept planning; kept designing.\n\nAfter all, once the Germans came they would finally realize they needed his experiments and beg like lesser men tended to."

At least in name - we all know who's really in charge."\n\n"This one has potential for sure, which we can explain after the break- remember, this show is brought to you today by the Internatsionalnaya Street Cinema, the best viewing in town. Onto the music.""
 radiosyktyvkar.44.a: "Nothing but another right wing propaganda parrot."

 radiosyktyvkar.45.d: ""We welcome you back to another special segment - today we have a very special guest, please give a warm welcome to John Ryan - that's right, an American!"\n\n"Thanks, Sergey. Glad to be on the show."\n\n"The pleasure is ours, John. Now, our listeners are very interested in how you got to our very fine Republic, care to share?"\n\n"Well, I was actually with the CIA as far back as the War - what was that, six years ago? Anyway, I decided to stay when they pulled the rest of us out of the Front - I quite liked this girl named Svetlana-"\n\n"Not one of our Svetlanas, I hope."\n\n"Oh, no, god no- entirely different girl. If you're listening, babe, I love you! Say hi to Anastas for me!"\n\n"Back on track, now, you said you were with the CIA, did anything surprise you about the way the Front operated? How was life under the Red Giant?"\n\n"You know, for all the credit we give 'Comrade' Suslov for being some sort of genius, the Front was certainly a mess - we had all the makings of a tragic tale, generals infighting, shoddy equipment - we backed the wrong horse in that fight, let me tell you. We should have been there for the Siberians back in the day, instead we chose the Reds and suffered for it."\n\n"An excellent analysis by John Ryan, ex-CIA agent and proud citizen of our Republic. We'll be back in a moment, after the break.""
 radiosyktyvkar.45.a: "An interesting perspective."

 radiosyktyvkar.46.d: ""Another day in our fine Republic - that's Alina with today's weather. Now, something has come to my attention that I think deserves some dialogue-"\n\n"And this is really serious, don't get us wrong."\n\n"Thanks, Igor. Now, we have scattered reports - and photographs, actually, someone dropped a packet off in our anonymous tips box - that the government has actually re-activated the Gulags in Ust-Kulom, to house 'excess political prisoners'. Now, for our listeners, as we investigate this story further - you may want to stay on the lookout, and make sure your house is free of microphones. Since if the government really is going back to Bukharin, who knows what's up next?"\n\n"Now, for those skeptical, Sergey, how do we know this - what does our investigatory process look like, how do we determine what to cover?"\n\n"Always a good question, Radio Free Syktyvkar believes in transparency, which is more than most can say. Now, what we do to start off is we mostly rely on anonymous tips - the box for that is 205 Internatsionalnaya, look for the red box with our logo. Photos included are always a plus, especially clear ones where we can see what's happening - that's how we exposed the thing with Voznesensky and that young lady last month."\n\n"Which lady was this? I've lost track."\n\n"Ah, so have I! Anyway, we get photos, and we send our own guy around to do some investigative journalism. Thanks to Mister Poremsky and his Petersburg Engineers, by the way, without him providing security, we wouldn't be able to keep our reporters safe. Now, onto how evidence is recovered, and how we look for photo editing...""

 radiosyktyvkar.47.d: ""People of the Republic.\n\nWe deeply regret the following message. Following the 'democratic' government's vote to nationalize our station, and shut us down, we are mandated by law to announce that-\n\nWe're not going anywhere!"\n\n"That's right, our lovely listeners, Radio Free Syktyvkar is not going anywhere. The vote has failed by an impressive margin - our thanks to Mr. Igor Shafarevich, and the Passionariyy, who are always there to protect our right to broadcast freely, whenever we wish to."\n\n"To celebrate, we're going to be doing a charity drive at the station - come on down with your best self-portrait, for a 'Citizens Of The Republic' exhibition next week, and enjoy local catering brought to us by our partners at Alexandrovich Fine Dining And Grocers'. All proceeds will go to local bombing relief efforts. Here at Radio Free Syktyvkar, we all pitch in when the government is unable to help the average citizen out."\n\n"Now, back to you, Igor, with your quality taste in music - this situation calls for celebration, doesn't it?"\n\n"Indeed it does, Sergey, which is why I've arranged a lovely collection of records donated by the OVRI - tell your friends to tune in to Radio Free Syktyvkar, where we play music of a better time - a time that keeps our very own Red devils up at night. Give it up for - the national collection of the Russian Empire!""

 radiosyktyvkar.48.d: ""And, welcome back. That was "Farewell Of Slavianka", played in honor of our Civil War dead - and how many those were. Truly, a national tragedy."\n\n"Now, our lovely listeners, I'd like to introduce our latest guest - our very own Andrey Dikiy, journalist, historian, and publisher of the Ust-Sysolsk Defender newspaper. Now, Mr. Dikiy, thank you very much for making our show."\n\n"It's an honor, Ivan, and hello to Ust-Sysolsk, and all of the lovely people listening in."\n\n"Now, you always call our fair city 'Ust-Sysolsk' - why is that? Something you've encountered in your research?"\n\n"Ah. The history of our Republic is always something I enjoy teaching. You see, Ivan- 'Syktyvkar' is not the original name of our city, just as 'Komi' is not the original name of our region. It's important to remember our history, after all - the Imperial names for our city have a far greater heritage, which is why I choose to use them. I would advocate for all of our citizens with an interest in tradition to call it as such."\n\n"Now, that's fascinating - there's a lot of precedent and tradition buried by the Reds. I'm sure our listeners will be delighted to hear some of what you have to say. Now, for those tuning in for the interview proper - as always, this is Radio Free Syktyvkar, telling you what they don't want you to hear!""

Now, many of you have been writing into the station, asking about political matters, and our endorsement for 1963. As much as Radio Free Syktyvkar is apolitical... and don't forget that, we can't help but pick out one candidate for extraordinary strength of character. A man of skill and dedication, our very own... Igor Shafarevich, of our very own district!"\n\n"Good choice, Ivan. Now, what makes Mr. Shafarevich so special? I'm sure the listeners are excited to know,"\n\n"Well, Sergey- and listeners, our endorsement is of course carefully thought out - we go through all the candidates' stances and standards before even thinking about making one. Mr. Shafarevich has come to our attention because of his fantastic efforts to advocate for the common citizen, and his skills at compromise. Make no mistake, Shafarevich is a true centrist, a true moral conservative, and we're honored to have him running for the Presidency."\n\n"Thanks, Ivan. Now, onto the music.""
 radiosyktyvkar.49.a: "When everyone is to your left..."

 komi.50.t: "The Komi Republican Navy"
 komi.50.d: "General Ivan Korolkov slowly paced down the Sysola docks, Defense Minister Ligachev and six Republican Guards in tow. The waters of the river which nourished Syktyvkar and Kotlas, and formed the Republic's border with the Front, were calm, clear, and placid in the fall air.\n\nThe object of Korolkov's attention, however, was no placid vessel. It was a gunboat, the first that the docks of Syktyvkar had purpose-built. Mounted machine-guns ringed her hull, and a single 85mm cannon graced her front deck, taking up the majority of the available space. To the assembled military men, she was beautiful. A beautiful solution to the ugly problem of piracy and smuggling.\n\n"Give the dockworkers my congratulations," began Korolkov, surveying the radio antenna on her stout command center.\n\nLigachev nodded. "They've been paid double for laying her down. We'll be getting you another four, provided funding holds up - two more for the Sysola, and two for the Vyatka."\n\nThe newly promoted commanding officer of the Komi Republican Navy stared intently into the water. Yes, this would do nicely. All his lobbying and harassing the Defense Minister had finally managed to procure a solution, and he was damn well going to show what river supremacy could do for the Republic."
 komi.50.a: ""It's an honor, Minister.""

 komi.51.t: "The Line"
 komi.51.d: ""So, how long have you been in the NKVD?"\n\nThis question would have seemed innocuous enough, were it not for their predicament. Even after Lysenko was removed from power, the people of Orenburg weren't exactly too keen on forgiving them- nor was the new government. The former officers- now convicts, stood together herded into a single line. "Two years." One younger one spoke, as the police surrounding them watched. "Step to the left." "Ten years." "Step to the right." "Five years." "Remain where you are."\n\nMinutes passed, as the men were funneled- processed, and finally, grouped.\n\n"Your new cellmates, gentlemen. Congratulations." The policeman in charge practically spat, turning to the officers at his sides. "Get them moved to the cell blocks within the hour; I'd like to get home by the end of my shift." And so, it happened despite kicks, screams, and begging- men were dragged, cajoled, or simply walked defeatedly in, all getting their bearings.\n\nIn truth, these cells were similar to that of the Black Mountain's, and the irony was not appreciated by Alek, or his cellmates. He turned to the guard, opening his mouth- only to be silenced with a reply as the lights turned off."
 komi.51.a: "Get comfortable; you're going to be here for a very long time."
 
 komi.52.t: "A Dead Man's Ideals"
 komi.52.d: "President Svetlana Stalina sorted through the pile of paperwork that had accumulated over the night, a task that had not become easier with the reunification of Western Russia. Many of the papers were the usual: status reports from the Moskowien border, reconstruction progress, and anti-partisan efforts. One document, however, captured Stalina's full attention.\n\nApparently, just across the Urals, another warlord had unified a large chunk of Western Siberia. The West Siberian People's Republic, led by one Mikhail Kaganovich, had unified a quarter of Russia. Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, "Stalinism" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization. Stalina's father had died when she was young, but it seemed accurate to what she remembered of him.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter what specific strain of communist belief Kaganovich spouted, because at the end of the day they were still communists. Russia had suffered under Soviet rule once, Stalina refused to let it happen again."
 komi.52.a: "Grigorenko, we must secure the eastern border."

 yakovlev.1.t: "The Man from Korolyovo"
 yakovlev.1.d: "Out of all the Deputies to come from the former Front territory, none has attracted as much attention as the recent election of Alexander Yakovlev, affiliated with the DSNP. Born to a peasant family in Korolyovo, his father served as a Red Cavalryman in the Civil War and became a leader of a small Collective farm in his village. Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast. Intelligent and reform minded, it remains to be seen whether his left wing credentials can gain him the political power he desires."
 yakovlev.1.a: "More the merrier!"
 
 yakovlev.2.t: "The Party's Firebrand"
 yakovlev.2.d: "Despite only having been elected a few months ago, Alexander Yakovlev, a freshman Deputy of the DSNP, has since made himself known as an influential political operator both within and without of the party. He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."
 yakovlev.2.a: "A man with vision and principles!"

 yakovlev.3.t: "The Red Star"
 yakovlev.3.d: "While still a moderately fresh face in politics, the Western Russian Free Republic's Alexander Yakovlev has made himself known as a man of the left in the People's Democratic Socialist Party. A powerful political operative, known for his reformist and socialist tendencies, Yakovlev has gained a following among younger intellectuals, working class trade unionists, and citizens of the Front territory, all of which have made him a powerful figure on the left wing of the party.\n\nWhile once a freshman Deputy from Korolyovo, he has since raised his status as a popular figure among socialists and other leftists within the DSNP, much to the chagrin of the party's right wing. With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."
 yakovlev.3.a: "An idealist is rare in Russia."

 yakovlev.4.t: "Voznesensky Announces Retirement!"
 yakovlev.4.d: "Shocking news coming from the Western Russian Free Republic today, as it's first and longest lasting President, Nikolai Voznesensky, has announced his retirement at the end of his term, and that he will not be seeking an additional term as President.\n\nOriginally elected in 1958 after spending a year as its head of state, President Voznesensky went on to be elected two more times in 1963 and 1967 by convincing margins under his leadership. While his popularity was far from what it once was, he has been able to keep the young and unstable Republic from breaking apart.\n\nVoznesensky has not explicitly endorsed a successor, although it is expected he is to endorse his Party's primary winner for the 1971 election. Many in the Republic, however, can not imagine another man to fill his shoes."
 yakovlev.4.a: "Whether his successor can maintain order remains to be seen."

 yakovlev.5.t: "A Power Play"
 yakovlev.5.d: "To the surprise of everyone across the country and beyond, Alexander Yakovlev, a up and coming politician from the Arkhangelsk Oblast, has won the primary to be the candidate of the People's Democratic Socialist Party. Originally considered a dark horse candidate for the party, he narrowly beat out his moderate opponent.\n\nFor years, Yakovlev has been representing the DSNP's left wing for years, advocating for a stronger left wing economic policy, and has led the charge against the party's economic liberalization. This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly. Whether he can win the Presidency, however, remains to be seen."
 yakovlev.5.a: "Let's see what this youngster can do."

 yakovlev.6.t: "Yakovlev's Speech"
 yakovlev.6.d: ""It is time for a return to the fundamental axioms of those who came before: a republic for the establishment of socialism, a world in which no man has too much nor too little, and an economy based upon the ideals of Marx and Engels. While the right may balk at us, the workers of this nation know who their true enemy is."\n\nAlexander Yakovlev's speech officially announcing his candidacy for the President of the Komi Republic has been well received by many on the left wing of the Democratic Front and beyond. While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can succeed his predecessor in maintaining order and stability within our young nation."
 yakovlev.6.a: "He can talk the talk - but can he walk the walk?"

 katushev.1.t: "The Iron Governor"
 katushev.1.d: "With the recent integration of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, into the Republic, it was considered essential to establish legitimate governance within both it and the surrounding region.\n\nElections for all positions, legislative and executive, were therefore announced and subsequently held. Although many races were competitive, one in particular - the Governor's - was not. Konstantin Katushev, a local engineer and industrialist, and notable for his long-standing support of and advocacy for broadly liberal policies, won by a considerable margin.\n\nKatushev, who entered the regional political sphere as soon as he was able, quickly negotiated with and secured the endorsement of the SMR, commonly known as the Young Reformers, and began proclaiming their general position to the electorate. Proving himself an exceptionally skilled political organizer, he quickly established both a robust and rapidly expanding political infrastructure, greatly expanding local awareness of and support for democratic ideals.\n\nThis infrastructure proved an insurmountable challenge for his opponents, as though several other campaigns outspent Katushev by a considerable margin, none were able to significantly challenge the increasing momentum displayed by his own.\n\nExperts agree that the 'Iron Governor,' as he has been increasingly referred to, is likely to leverage that infrastructure in order to further establish Nizhny Novgorod as a stronghold, both for the Reformers and for their political adherents."
 katushev.1.a: "A rising star, indeed."
 
 katushev.2.t: "The Party Machine"
 katushev.2.d: "As was previously predicted by experts, the continued efforts of the SMR-aligned 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, to establish Nizhny Novgorod as a bastion of liberal idealism have shown results.\n\nOnce again demonstrating a profound talent for organization, Katushev moved quickly following his election to identify local allies, particularly among those who carefully concealed democratic leanings under the former regime, and then appoint them to politically influential positions. Although many of these allies have been criticized by Katushev's opponents as inexperienced and 'eccentric,' counting among their number political novices from numerous menial careers, their inclusion has won Katushev the support of many within the city.\n\nWhile tirelessly working to continuously further expand the political infrastructure established during his election campaign, Katushev has begun to apply that infrastructure in support of the candidacy of other SMR prospects. Indeed, many of the city's National Assembly districts are now held by SMR deputies, and experts predict that the degree of support extended by Katushev's machine is such that they are unlikely to be unseated by their many opponents anytime soon.\n\nUnder Katushev, Nizhny Novgorod has very quickly become a political bastion of the Young Reformers, and the influence of this fact on the political landscape of the Republic as a whole is expected to grow in the months and years ahead."
 katushev.2.a: "A beacon of liberalism."

 katushev.3.t: "From Oblast to Nation"
 katushev.3.d: "The political influence of Nizhny Novgorod, as one of the largest cities in Western Russia and thus the source of a significant proportion of the National Assembly's deputies, has continued to grow. As has the influence of its 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev.\n\nKatushev's now-extensive political infrastructure and, consequently, his ability to mobilize support for the SMR within the region has led to other parties being all but shut out of its Assembly delegation. Indeed, deputies from Katushev's 'domain' now constitute a considerable portion of the entire Young Reformer caucus, affecting the party's viewpoint as a whole. Recognizing this, the SMR has begun shifting more and more of its administrative organs, other than those required in Syktyvkar itself, to the city.\n\nA corollary to this shift in both caucus demographics and organization is the rapidly increasing influence of Katushev within the party on the national level. He has reportedly begun making 'suggestions' on electoral and positional policy, and it is considered likely that other figures within the SMR's senior leadership will be unable to resist them.\n\nAmong oppositional party organizers, consensus has therefore been reached that Katushev is to be considered a critical and near-irreplaceable figure within the SMR, and he has been identified as a prime candidate for potential party leadership in the near future."
 katushev.3.a: "The 'Iron Governor's' influence grows..."

 katushev.4.t: "Morozov Announces Retirement"
 katushev.4.d: "Earlier today, President Ivan Morozov announced that he would not seek re-election upon the expiration of his current term, and would instead be retiring from political life.\n\nIn a brief speech, Morozov made the proclamation while speaking about his personal political journey, from his time spent in the Soviet state apparatus to his arrival in the Republic and later foundation of the Young Reformers. He exhorted the Republic and Assembly to remain true to the principles of democracy and liberalism on which he was elected, and emphasized to his eventual successor the importance of rejecting radicalism of all types within the national political discourse. He subsequently ended his speech with thanks to his many political allies and other confederates.\n\nWhile some experts had correctly theorized the purpose of Morozov's speech, most appeared to have been taken by some degree of surprise. Whatever the criticisms held by opponents against Morozov, and they were many, all could generally agree that he had long desired to see political stability in the Republic.\n\nWhether the race for the Presidency, which has been galvanized by the announcement, will possess such stability is currently unknown."
 katushev.4.a: "The end of an era."

 katushev.5.t: "The New Reformer"
 katushev.5.d: "The meteoric rise of the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, has continued unabated as he has recently secured the leadership of the SMR as a whole and thus, its official nomination for the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nLeveraging his enormous personal support and political influence within Nizhny Novgorod in the wake of the three-time SMR candidate Ivan Morozov's recent announcement of retirement, he moved quickly to position himself as a candidate for succession. Although other senior party figures soon did the same, much as it did in his earlier gubernatorial election, Katushev's early advantage and quick action proved decisive, and he was elected leader of the SMR on the first ballot.\n\nThis surprised many observers, who were expecting multiple rounds of negotiation by candidates among the SMR caucus. However, as was evidenced, the increasing degree of party centrality upon Nizhny Novgorod overwhelmingly favored Katushev, and support for other contenders was seen to quickly collapse among the contingents of SMR deputies not already from districts in or around the city.\n\nHaving secured his party's nomination, Katushev is soon, along with the candidates put forward by other parties, expected to begin his national campaign for the presidency. While many have expressed certainty that the policies of the Young Reformers are likely to find little support outside urban centres, others have been quick to identify Katushev's skills at attractively packaging SMR ideology.\n\nOnly time will tell which opinion proves correct."
 katushev.5.a: "All but inevitable."

 katushev.6.t: "A Revolutionary Platform"
 katushev.6.d: "Konstantin Katushev, known nationally as the 'Iron Governor' and the SMR's nominee for President, today officially launched his campaign in his personal and party stronghold of Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nSurprising many, his commencement speech made no mention of socialist concepts, long considered a cornerstone of SMR ideology. Instead, Katushev spoke strongly in the support of promoting national modernization through comprehensive programs of ecological conservation, the enshrinement of meritocratic principles in both public and private sectors, and in promoting general economic prosperity through the invitation of foreign investment and bilateral trade.\n\nPolitical pundits were quick to respond, with those sympathetic to the SMR praising Katushev's speech as a focused vision for Russia's future. Those opposed were equally quick in decrying it as a thinly veiled attempt to conceal the 'fundamentally socialist' nature of any SMR policies from rural voting blocs.\n\nRegardless of expert interpretation, however, Katushev's speech drew intense interest from many communities across the Republic, urban and rural alike, and the SMR was quick to capitalize on this by issuing an immediate appeal for both the recruitment of local campaign organizers and of general fundraising.\n\nThough a long campaign remains, and none can yet be sure of the election's eventual outcome, Katushev and the Young Reformers have managed to secure a strong starting position."
 katushev.6.a: "A new direction for Russia?"
 
 komilaws.1.t: "The 1962 Budget of the Komi Republic"
 komilaws.1.d: "The Komi Republic, unlike many of the warlord states that have spread across the old Soviet Union, is blessed with a formal governmental and economic system. However, this does not entail stability or any sort of expedience in the National Assembly's budgetary machinations.\n\nThe so-called Voznesentsi, the ruling party in the governing coalition of the Republic, have prepared a budget for the year, a comprehensive initiative focused on external defense, internal policing, and public welfare to repair the damages caused by the bombings. However, internal polling reveals a rather concerning trend within the coalition - with our current number of 'confirmed' votes it seems that if any more dissensions at all are to take place within the governing coalition, the budget will fail, and the Republic's government will be paralyzed for months.\n\nIn the wake of the discovery of this distressing trend within the party, the President of the Republic has been forced to make a decision. The budget could be handed to Ivan Morozov, leader of the "Young Reformists" Party and talented economist, or it could be kept as-is, and strings pulled to ensure that the vote goes our way. While Morozov is slightly to the right of the President, his influence could ensure that the budget passes safely and comfortably, evading an embarassing government failure or shutdown."
 komilaws.1.a: "No alterations will be necessary."
 komilaws.1.b: "Morozov can handle this."
 
 komilaws.2.t: "Insufficient Votes"
 komilaws.2.d: "President Voznesensky finds himself once again challenged in carrying Komi through yet another year of endless instability. This time the national budget is his problem. The DSNP and PSD lack the necessary votes to pass the budget through the National Assembly on their own, and Voznesensky's budgetary proposals of shifting funds from internal spending to military production has left the SMR unwilling to back the bill, which they claim abandon the ideals of the true people's revolution to cater to Stalina and the opposition parties. To pass the bill, there are two proposed strategies. Either roll back some of the proposals to get Morozov's party back on board, or try to get Zhdanov's faction of the KPK to vote with the government by promising the military contracts will be awarded to council-run industries associated with his support base. What should we do?"

We just have to pray nobody important notices us reshuffling the planning committee. Let us hope the right wingers don't find out."

 komilaws.4.t: "Shafarevich's Denouncement"
 komilaws.4.d: "The Passionariyy have criticized the government in the National Assembly, accusing it of capitulating to the communists. Our representatives have staunchly denied this as untrue, but not many people believe it since Shafarevich can point to multiple sources within the government, not to mention the recent addition of several KPK members to the budgetary committee. More worryingly, multiple members of the Assembly from our coalition parties have stated they will vote with the Passionariyy against the budget should it fail to reassure them it is not the result of a backroom deal with the communists. Well, we'll have to reassure them, failure of the budget is not an option."
 komilaws.4.a: "Why is he here?"

 komilaws.5.t: "A Provision for the Conservatives"
 komilaws.5.d: "After many intense hours of infighting, the more moderate Passionariyy and our doubting allies have fallen in line and endorsed the budget. Through some clever coordination, Zhdanov's allies on the committee made it appear as though they were vigorously defending a social security provision in the budget, then playing offended and withdrawing once Voznesensky "doubtfully" withdrew it. The right wingers are now confident they defeated communist collusion with the DSNP, not realizing the actual backroom deal regarded which factories get the production contracts. A few choice cuts to non-essential services like library funding and housing acquisition brought them on board with the new budget. With the support of both the communists and the right, it won't matter if some SMR representatives won't back the bill over the internal spending cuts."
 komilaws.5.a: "This is all we can do."

 komilaws.6.t: "Voznesensky's Budget Passed! - The Komi Courier"
 komilaws.6.d: "Through an incredible upset today, President Voznesensky's national budget proposal has passed through the National Assembly!\n\nDespite receiving praise by Svetlana Stalina and unanimous support from the People's Democratic Socialist Party and Sovereign Democratic Party for its efforts in improving national security, as well as an unexpected number of votes from the Passionariyy faction, members of whom have cited common-sense budget cuts and responsible fiscal policy, the bill still looked dead on arrival. Ivan Morozov of the Union of Young Reformers was highly critical of the bill for its cuts to internal spending, particularly on social security, and almost two thirds of the party's representatives refused to vote for it. That is when the Communist Party unexpectedly came to the President's rescue, the majority of their representatives voting for the new budget on grounds of its importance in protecting national industry and securing the Revolution.\n\nThe budget thus passed with a comfortable majority, and President Voznesensky is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those opponents who supported the bill. All may however not be a bed of roses for the President in the future, as Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich have issued a joint press statement that they will conduct a thorough internal investigation on both of the members of Shafarevich' circle who backed the bill without checking it for communist infiltration, and of the government's own potential collaboration with the KPK. The DSNP might have trouble getting their collaboration in the future."
 komilaws.6.a: "So... inelegant."

 komilaws.7.t: "Morozov's Budget"
 komilaws.7.d: "Cause to celebrate for President Morozov today, as his Union of Young Reformers have handily passed a revised national budget, increasing internal spending while also giving concessions to the DSNP and PSD on matters of expansion of national security infrastructure. The Passionariyy and Communist Party have both decried the bill for its raising of taxes and bypassing of industrial self-regulation principles. Lacking the necessary majority to challenge the bill, the opposition could do little but protest as it passed through the Assembly with great aplomb. President Morozov is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those doubtful of his faction who still supported the bill. Here at the Komi Courier we can only hope the revised budget genuinely helps carry our nation forward into the future."
 komilaws.7.a: "Well done, comrade."

 komilaws.11.t: "Stalina's Budget"
 komilaws.11.d: "Supporters of the Sovereign Democratic Party are celebrating across the Republic today as President Stalina's budget handily passed through the National Assembly. Chants of "Steel does not bend!" could be heard across public squares in Syktyvkar after it was announced the leadership of the DSNP and SMR were withdrawing their challenges to President Stalina's new national budget reform and fully backing it. While the bill was initially heavily criticized by the coalition partners for focusing heavily on national security and internal stability issues, the President has clearly made her partners come round to her way of thinking. With the hopes of the opposition to kill the bills dashed, it is expected the President will soon roundly congratulate her allies and decry the weakness of the opposition. We here at the Komi Courier only hope the budget will deliver on the promised national security improvements."
 komilaws.11.a: "Nothing concerning here."
 
 komilaws.12.t: "Passing the Compromise"
 komilaws.12.d: "The government's national budget proposal passed through the National Assembly today, but many members of the cabinet are disappointed and see it as a defeat. To get the required majority, President Voznesensky had to roll back a number of his proposed budget changes, especially in regards to cuts to internal spending to balance out the increase in military spending. This has forced the government to consider raising taxes, an unpopular move indeed. At least the President can be relieved the Republic will remain functional another year. Here at the Komi Courier, we have to say that is often all one can hope for."
 komilaws.12.a: "It had to be done to keep the system stable."

 komilaws.13.t: "The Infrastructure Repair Bill"
 komilaws.13.d: "As part of our new set of reforms, an increased amount of funding will go towards restoring the functionality of infrastructure damaged by German bombing, particularly paved roads, railroads, and larger bridges. The problem is that if we follow the recommendation of the democratic coalition partners and commit to this without compensating for the very likely possibility of going over our very limited budget, we risk running up debt, which is notoriously expensive due to our isolation from international credit. Yegor Ligachev of the DSNP believes he has found a solution after receiving assurances from Zhdanov that the KPK will vote in support of any increase in income taxes necessary to fund the Infrastructure Repair Bill. This will however be highly unpopular both with the people and with the democratic centre. The Passionaries on the other hand want to ensure the repairs are done within budget by utilizing our thousands of prison inmates as unpaid workers. This suggestion would be most popular with the people, but the rest of the governing parties would see it as highly inhumane. Which proposal should we go with?"
 komilaws.13.a: "Pass the tax hikes, with Zhdanov's support."
 komilaws.13.b: "Unite the center - expand the budget!"
 komilaws.13.c: "The prisoners need exercise anyway."

 komilaws.14.t: "The Mandated Minority Representation Bill"
 komilaws.14.d: "It is a sad fact of life that in a republic centered on the Komi region that the actual Komi people and the other Fenno-Uralic minorities in the Republic are woefully underrepresented in the regional government and National Assembly. As such, the Communist Party has introduced a bill enshrining the right of the natives to have a number of Assembly seats proportional to their population in the Republic, as well as a guaranteed right to jobs in the government of majority native municipalities. Needless to say, passing this bill would strengthen the Communists considerably, as they are already doing well among the natives and this bill would enshrine them as the party of native rights. As such, the Passionaries want the bill voted down, on the grounds of mandatory native representation being undemocratic in a system preaching one man, one vote. Of course, in reality their chief concern is the threat a strengthened Communist Party could present. As a compromise, the native Komi SMR representative Ivan Morozov has drafted a bill that would guarantee the natives access to local government and a heavier vote weight in Assembly elections, but no mandatory lower limit on native representation. The Center have rallied around this proposal, though many in the SMR and DSNP are clearly more sympathetic to the Communist's Mandated Minority Representation Bill. What will the Assembly conclude?"
 komilaws.14.a: "Pass it in full, an excellent idea!"
 komilaws.14.b: "We can learn some lessions, here."
 komilaws.14.c: "This is patently discriminatory against Russians."

 komilaws.15.t: "The Defense of the Republic Bill"
 komilaws.15.d: "The Republic has mandated conscription to defend itself, but the opposition is highly critical of the two-year draft system favored by the DSNP and PSD. The current system has held for years, as the SMR, despite being critical of conscription, accepts it as a matter of national security. Now, however, in an unusual act of cooperation, the Communists have endorsed a bill first introduced by the Passionariyy suggesting an alternative four year conscription system, albeit with a provision for lowered recruiting standards to ensure a bulkier army. With this alliance, and the risk of more conservative PSD members defecting to vote with the Passionariyy, there's a very real chance the two-year model is under threat. The Assembly will need to pass a decision on the Defense of the Republic Bill."
 komilaws.15.a: "The bill passes, including the KPK provision."
 komilaws.15.b: "The bill passes, but the KPK provision fails."
 komilaws.15.c: "The Center holds, the PSD whips kill the bill in committee."

 komilaws.16.t: "The Comprehensive Zoning Reform Bill"
 komilaws.16.d: "We have gained a stable enough majority in the National Assembly that we can... redraft... parliamentary districts in an... equitable... fashion. Yes, that sounds good, a very generous description of the Equal Zoning Bill.\n\nOn paper, the bill will ensure "fairer" representation by redrafting districts to be of equivalent geographical area rather than based on population alone, ensuring a better representation for the countryside, which generally leans centrist, over the population centers like Syktyvkar. Now, of course, it is very possible that some districts may be more equal than others, and should we desire to instead benefit one of the opposition factions for the purposes of our plans, it can easily be done by adding a provision allowing for smaller districts either in city centers, benefitting the KPK, or the suburban regions and smaller towns, benefitting the Passionariyy. How should we draft the bill?"
 komilaws.16.a: "Well, if it could keep us safe from Suslov..."
 komilaws.16.b: "Best to be in Gumilyov's good books."
 komilaws.16.c: "We have no need for enemies of the Republic!"

 komilaws.17.t: "The Municipal Pacification Bill"
 komilaws.17.d: "Svetlana Stalina has introduced the Municipal Pacification Bill, calling for vastly increased police funding and rights to use force to break up paramilitary movements, particularly ones involved in street violence. It is a blatant broadside against the Communists and Passionariyy, but it would go a long way in restoring order to the streets. However, both the DSNP and SNR are worried about the public reaction; killing the bill would make them look weak on crime, but endorsing would ensure its passage and make them seem to support police brutality and politicized attacks on their opponents. It remains to be seen what they do about the bill."
 komilaws.17.a: "The DSNP and SMR endorse the bill, passing it."
 komilaws.17.b: "The DSNP and SMR kill the bill in committee."

Voznesensky blinked drowsily and confused at the messenger on his porch.\n\n"It is marked as urgent, Sir!"\n\nVoznesesky gave the young man some coins and turned to enter his house, but froze when he saw the telegram's contents. He turned to ask the messenger about it, but the man was already gone. The President quickly retreated back into the safety of his home and locked the door behind him before turning on a light to read the telegram better.\n\n"TO PRES VOZ RESIDENCE STOP URGENT STOP STREET VIOLENCE INCREASING AT ALARMING PACE STOP HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOVERNMENT TAKES ACTION TO ENSURE IT DOES NOT FUND EXTINDUDICIAL PARAMILITARIES STOP GREAT CONTRIBUTORS TO VIOLENCE STOP REMEMBER AGREEMENT STOP YOUR FRIEND Z END"\n\nThe President groaned in frustration.

Listen, I have to ask you a favor. As you may know, I have been preparing for a long time to put on a really great show for Baba soon, show him a really great party, but then I hear that our friend Alexei has been organizing his own party and it might steal all the attention. That is hardly fair. I wondered if maybe you could get him to tell you his plans for certain... parts of the park where our two parties might overlap a fair bit, so we can know what events he's got planned. That way, things would be better for everyone, yes?"\n\n"I- I don't know Andrey, I understand what you mean, but Alexei is a dear friend of mine, and I am not sure if I can do that to his party."\n\n"Nikolai, please, just a quick peek at his plans, yes? You know you over me a favor, and I've already helped you a lot, as you know. Let us keep on doing that and really surprise Baba, yes?"\n\nA secretary knocked at the door to the study.

 komi_zhdanov_demand.3.d: "Voznesensky's receptionist entered his office, saying that an unmarked letter had arrived in the mail. Voznesensky thanked her, and waited for her to leave the room before opening the letter. Zhdanov was certainly getting bolder with a move like that. Voznesensky began to read, dreading whatever demands Zhdanov had cooked up this time:\n\n'To my dearest friend Voznesensky,\nViolence between communist and republican paramilitaries has been increasing as the election grows ever closer. I know that you are a very busy man, especially in such important times as these, but I would like to ask you a favor. Gumilyov and the Eurasianists in the Passionariyy are a serious threat to Syktyvkar, and their influence must be curbed. Tell your gangs and paramilitaries to stop going after communists, and instead focus their efforts on Gumilyov's forces. Once I learn of the ceasefire, I will follow suit. This is a very easy decision, comrade, the rightists must be stopped. I trust that you will make the right decision.'\n\nA ceasefire with the communists would give them time to increase the size of their forces, and they could use the extra breathing room to possibly prepare a coup. However, Voznesensky held no love for Gumilyov, and he certainly wouldn't mind seeing his gangs stop openly roaming the streets. Should he agree to the ceasefire? If he refused, Zhdanov would inevitably release his kompromat, and that would be the end for Voznesensky. The President sighed. It seemed that his mind had been made up for him."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.4.t: "A Charitable Donation"
 komi_zhdanov_demand.4.d: "Voznesensky entered his office, and noticed an unmarked letter on his desk. He cautiously opened the letter, and began to read. Voznesensky knew immediately that Zhdanov had another demand to ask of him:\n\n'To my dearest friend, Voznesensky,\nI feel that Syktyvkar has been corrupted by greed. They need an example, a leader to show them the virtue of charity. I have gone through the trouble of selecting a suitable organization. I feel that in order to make the message hit closer to home, that the donation should be equivalent to USD $10,000,' that was a lot of money to simply donate out of the blue, Zhdanov was clearly getting more ambitious with his demands, 'I hope you make the right choice. Sincerely, your friend Zhdanov.'\n\nThe charity Zhdanov had selected was owned by a family with personal ties to Svetlana Bukharina. If Voznesensky accepted the demand, he might as well have been paying the Communist Party directly. Of course, Voznesensky wasn't stupid. If he refused, Zhdanov would surely release his kompromat on him. He pulled the checkbook out of a drawer in his desk, but paused as he uncapped his pen. Should he do what was best for himself, or should he do what was best for the Republic? If the information in that kompromat was released, Voznesesnky's career was probably over. With quivering hands, he put the nib to the paper, and watched the ink flow."

After several long, pained minutes, he opened the letter to see what that accursed Zhdanov wanted from him this time. They were supposed to be friends, and had been for years. Why would he keep treating him like this? He read the letter, and leaned back in his chair with a pained groan.\n\nIncreased press freedom. Could have been worse. An end to persecution of radical left journalists. Not ideal, but fair enough, leaving them alone might even make them less prone to calling for violence against the government."

The President has been forced to admit to a longtime friendship with the communist, which has earned him some begrudging respect from the Morozov and the KPK, but caused a serious loss of authority within his own party, criticism from the PSD, and outright anger and distrust from the Passionariyy.

This will seriously hurt our position going into the next election, especially as the Passionariyy are shouting from the rooftops about how this collaboration clearly went further, perhaps into the realm of illegality and unconstitutional behavior.

Some of the actions, like the awarding of supposedly open contracts to communist-affiliated cooperatives, are flat out illegal. The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionariyy, while the coalition is reeling. The KPK, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrei Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the 'gifts' from the President were done illegally. The President himself has locked himself in his office, from where he has been trying to call somebody all day without luck. Our administration may be history."

Poor, trusting man. You never had it in you to fully separate public and private life."\n\nHis smile faded.

He looks like he has just seen the Devil in bed with his wife and with his wallet in hand.\n\nIt is fortunate that the General cannot escape this particular meeting through making foul faces - fortunate for the Republic, that is. A list of staffers and senior military advisors is thrown at his desk. An unsmiling Committee Deputy demands more names, training times, a full inventory of equipment. Gluchenkov growls that this is an unprecedented intrusion into Army business on the part of a few jumpstart apparatchiks. The Deputy, the iron showing in his face, points out that if the General does not hop to and give him names, the latter will soon have no business with the Army, or in Komi, or in the world of the living.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of such snarling, the General relents. He knows he's been dealt a losing hand. Still smouldering, he writes down a list of names with such volcanic force it nearly tears the paper - names of his closest staff, of his subordinates, even of privates and corporals far below his rank.\n\nThat night, hundreds of people enter the barracks of Gluchenkov's command headquarters at the XXth Battalion (Infantry).

Surviving its troubled transition to democracy and the attacks from radicals of all sides, Syktyvkar provided itself a special spot in the Russian history.\n\nAs some political workers of the Republic developed sentimentality towards the city with which they went through the hardest challenges in their lives, it is time to admit, however, that in the light of our current strategy, Syktyvkar no longer fits as a centre of the democratic Russian advancement. It is too far from the core of communications in West Russia, and too close to hostile forces.\n\nThe government has therefore taken up an initiative to move the capital to Vyatka, the former residence of the short-lived rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor, in order to address these issues. Whilst many officials express melancholy at needing to move, and there are widespread fears that the now-overshadowed city of Syktyvkar will be left neglected, general consensus is that the relocation represents the maturation of the Republic to a state capable of contesting all of Russia."

Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees. Surely this would be enough.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet... Stalina's head whirled, a maelstrom of thought. It was far too much, it was never enough. How had it ever come to this? And was a better choice even possible?"
 komi_recgov_smuta.4.a: "A measured response."
 komi_recgov_smuta.4.b: "A forceful blow."
 komi_recgov_smuta.4.c: "A light hand."

 komi_recgov_smuta.6.t: "A Firm Handshake"
 komi_recgov_smuta.6.d: "The National Assembly was a cast of eclectic characters, to put it charitably, at the best of times - and Stalina's regime had been one wild worst time after another, in quick succession, for quite awhile now. Legislators gathered in resentful clumps, like driftweed caught in some strange tide, and aired their thoughts on the matter. Stalina knew she was losing control - reading crowds was intuitive to her - and for the first time in quite awhile she struggled to compose a response.\n\nPresently a group of middle aged bureaucrats padded up to her, led by old Morozov, long-time associate even if they had never really agreed on much. Morozov cast a quizzical look at her, unsmiling, calculative as ever. "We need to talk about the role that the Assembly plays in, well, governing this country. As you can see, we are one-track horses: when the racetrack is denied us, we whinny in our stables until we are set loose."\n\nStalina chuckled, a rare occurrence. She'd never seen Morozov's sense of humor before, and certainly not in an atmosphere as tense as this. Perhaps crises really did bring out the best in people. "You know, Morozov, you might be right. These people are acting like addicts."\n\n"Of course we are. Have you ever been to the smoke-break areas? It's a wonder half these people haven't sold their lungs for tar yet." Morozov leaned close, the skein of humor slipping off his face. "In all due seriousness, however, we would like to know when we can get back to governance, and representing the people, like we are paid to do."\n\nStalina kneaded her temples. It was time to bite the bullet. "I assure you, this period is temporary. In my years of work, have you ever seen me hesitate in my struggle to build democracy? I will not abandon my long work for the sake of petty power." She gestured at the Assembly. "Tell your friends, scream it at your enemies. We will restore you sooner than you think."\n\nMorozov looked unsatisfied, but nodded. For the both of them, this would have to suffice until some better alternative emerged."
 komi_recgov_smuta.6.a: "One day freedom will ring anew."
 
 komi_recgov_smuta.7.t: "A Blank Cheque"
 komi_recgov_smuta.7.d: "The National Assembly was a cast of eclectic characters, to put it charitably, at the best of times - and Stalina's regime had been one wild worst time after another, in quick succession, for quite awhile now.

These people were worse than horses, she thought: horses could be ridden, while people were never so trustworthy as to carry out even that simple task. How many times had she been sidelined by the allies she had trusted? How many times had simple mandates gotten bogged down in the realpolitik she was forced to endure?\n\nShe had made the mistake of betting on horses once before. It was time to learn from history. Rising to leave, she said loudly, so Morozov's men could all hear it: "The stable gates will stay locked, then, until these horses learn obedience. My mission is absolute."\n\nCasting a quelling glance at Morozov, she added, "Yours, however, is not. You would do well to remember that." Morozov watched her leave, dull horror etched on his face - but Stalina had never been one to look back"

 #Diplomatic Events
 komidiplo.1.t: "Komi Requests Closer Relations"
 komidiplo.1.d: "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today. Ever since the so-called Komi Republic illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"
 komidiplo.1.a: "Let us bury the hatchet, and pursue warmer relations with the Republic."
 komidiplo.1.b: "These splitters have the gall to come crawling back? Ignore them."
 
 komidiplo.2.t: "A United Front"
 komidiplo.2.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. They have agreed to pursue warmer relations with our Republic. The current hostility between our governments shall cease, and communism shall once more present a united front against fascism! We are glad to see that our fellow comrades will not let bad blood betray the Revolution. Hopefully this is just the start of a mutually beneficial relationship between our two governments..."
 komidiplo.2.a: "We are glad that cooler heads have won the day."

 komidiplo.3.t: "A Split Front"
 komidiplo.3.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. Unfortunately, it seems their government still sees us as hostile to their cause. They have denounced our government as illegal splitters who betrayed the Front in Russia's darkest hour. The West Russian Revolutionary Front have effectively barred our diplomats from their government, and some advisors believe war may be on the horizon."
 komidiplo.3.a: "It seems old grudges are more important to them than the Revolution."

 komidiplo.4.t: "Shared Training Exercises?"
 komidiplo.4.d: "Ever since we began pursuing peaceful relations with the Komi Republic, their diplomats have become frequent visitors to Arkhangelsk. Today their message is different, however. The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources. However if we refuse we may offend the Komi government and risk damaging relations irreparably. Do we accept the request?"
 komidiplo.4.a: "Cross-training our troops can only be beneficial to our goals."
 komidiplo.4.b: "We can not spare the manpower, we must unfortunately decline."

 komidiplo.5.t: "Fighting Together"
 komidiplo.5.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, but they have not returned alone. Several officers have arrived in preparation for the shared training exercises, much to the delight of our government. Hopefully their advice will aid in raising the effectiveness of our military, and provide new insight into military doctrine that our officers may have neglected. Of course, we shall send over several of our own officers immediately, as agreed upon. It seems our relationship with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is beginning to bear fruit..."
 komidiplo.5.a: "...and may our relationship continue to bear fruit in the future."

 komidiplo.6.t: "The Front Declines"
 komidiplo.6.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, bearing a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Their government claims they can not spare the manpower to undergo shared training exercises, as they claim to require every officer they can get their hands on. Their government apologizes for their refusal, but claim their hands are tied, and such a request simply isn't feasible at this time."
 komidiplo.6.a: "Hopefully they may change their minds in the future..."

 komidiplo.7.t: "Komi Requests an Alliance"
 komidiplo.7.d: "Diplomats from Syktyvkar once again come to our government bearing a request. The Komi Republic requests a formal guarantee from our government, to last until the threat of reactionaries is purged from the immediate area. They wish to ensure the safety of their people, and believe our military could provide the defenses necessary to secure the Republic's position.\n\nSome within our government believe we can't afford to defend both Komi's territory and our own, and that we must decline such a request at this time. They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one. Others within our government believe guaranteeing the Komi Republic's safety could allow us to gain a valuable and trusted ally, and that our military is large enough to spare the men and equipment for such a request."
 komidiplo.7.a: "A formal guarantee is in our best interests, tell them we shall protect each other."
 komidiplo.7.b: "We can not afford to defend them, they must secure their position themselves."

 komidiplo.8.t: "Mutual Protection"
 komidiplo.8.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear good news. The West Russian Revolutionary Front has agreed to formally guarantee our government. This mutual protection guarantee will place our Republic in a much safer and stronger position. We are glad our allies are willing to cooperate to such an extent, and this partnership has once again proven its worth. In such turbulent times, it is comforting to know that we have such a dependable ally backing us."
 komidiplo.8.a: "We are now a truly united front!"

 komidiplo.9.t: "Alone Once More"
 komidiplo.9.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear bad news. It appears the West Russian Revolutionary Front has refused our request for a formal guarantee of our safety. They claim to be unable to spare the manpower and equipment to defend us at the moment. Not only is our government disappointed by this decision, this decision has disappointed the people of our Republic. If the West Russian Revolutionary Front can't commit to defending their allies, then why ally with them at all? Maybe they will change their minds in the future, but as it stands relations with Arkhangelsk have taken a heavy blow."
 komidiplo.9.a: "Komi stands alone once more."

 komidiplo.10.t: "Allied Pragmatism"
 komidiplo.10.d: "Although the alliance with our ideological brethren in Komi was, of course, valuable to the state both diplomatically and in terms of deterring foreign aggression, it now presents us with a pragmatic issue, as they have now gone to war with the Tsarists based in and around Vyatka.\n\nNaturally, many in our government are adamant that we have both a moral and doctrinal obligation to support our communist brethren against reactionary forces, and should therefore immediately join in their war effort. Others agree with this sentiment in principle, but are wary of a potential intervention by other reactionary elements while our forces are deployed on the front lines.\n\nThis is not an unrealistic fear - we must always be vigilant against the enemies of the Revolution, and there truly are very many such enemies. But is this fear worth potentially being seen as betraying one of the very few geopolitical 'friends' our state has?\n\nRegardless of choice, a decision must be made by the state's leadership, and it must be made soon."
 komidiplo.10.a: "We must fulfill the terms of the alliance. Follow Komi to war with Vyatka."
 komidiplo.10.b: "We must defend ourselves first. Make excuses, and do not get involved."

 komidiplo.11.t: "Komi's Request"
 komidiplo.11.d: "We have received a diplomatic mission from quite an unexpected state, and that is the socialist Komi Republic situated to our east. Ever since they managed to secure their rule over their own borders, the leftists that finally dominated politics in Syktyvkar have turned outwards, and now seek to expand in the rest of Russia. Of course, we are a hurdle to their expansion, but they have not immediately taken up their arms to invade.\n\nAn offer has been made, and that is for our two republics to merge into one. According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again. We need to make a choice, or else we will soon have none"
 komidiplo.11.a: "Agree to their deal."
 komidiplo.11.b: "Reject the offer, we do not support socialism."
 
 komidiplo.12.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.12.d: "Vologda has finally endorsed socialism and its principles by joining the proud Komi Republic, after a short period of integration. After seeing the advantages we have to offer, and how successful we have been, it would be logical for any warlord regime to join us. And they, despite their suspected anti-communist sentiments seeing as they were a despotist military junta, have accepted. As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."
 komidiplo.12.a: "A victory for the proletariat!"

 komidiplo.13.t: "Vologda Declines"
 komidiplo.13.d: "Even though some had voiced their concerns on the military government of Vologda and their possible reluctance to join us, we decided to take the chance and make an open offer, since we had nothing to lose. But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time. At least, that's what the High Command claims. Thus, we can no longer delay the invasion of Vologda."
 komidiplo.13.a: "To arms, comrades!"

 komidiplo.14.t: "An 'Offer' of Integration"
 komidiplo.14.d: "The Foreign Ministry has informed us that, earlier today, a message was received from the government in Komi concerning the integration of our state with theirs.\n\nThough many within our government at first reacted with confusion, as the context of the 'offer' became clear, sentiment darkened rapidly. It is now clear that those in Komi intend to absorb our state entirely. Peacefully if possible but, as this communication proves, with force if necessary. They will not take no for an answer.\n\nAnd, yet, an answer must be given. What shall it be?"
 komidiplo.14.a: "We do not stand a chance. We must submit to annexation and integration."
 komidiplo.14.b: "Never! We secured our independence one - we can do so again."

 komidiplo.15.t: "A Successful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.15.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as many in our government and military advised us would be the case, a reluctant yet inevitable acceptance.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria opposed this decision, preferring to challenge our rising supremacy and fight to the bitter end. Fortunately for them, cooler heads prevailed, and we can now begin the process of annexing their lands.\n\nWhile also saving our strength - both economically and militarily - for the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.15.a: "They made the right choice. For us, of course."

 komidiplo.16.t: "An Unsuccessful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.16.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as only some in our government and military believed would be the case - owing to the sheer insanity of it - a stern refusal.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria supported this decision, resolving themselves to oppose submission of any kind, and fight to the bitter end. It is most unfortunate, as now we will need to fight to secure their lands.\n\nWhile victory is inevitable, the damage upon the territory that will be inflicted will take time and resources to fix - which would have been much better spent towards the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.16.a: "They chose... poorly. As they will immediately learn."

 komidiplo.17.t: "Komi Offers Integration"
 komidiplo.17.d: "The socialist state of Komi, believing we have much in common and share common beliefs and ideologies, has decided to peacefully approach us. Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."
 komidiplo.17.a: "Join with our socialist brothers!"
 komidiplo.17.b: "We cannot be annexed by them, reject the offer!"
 
 komidiplo.18.t: "Gorky Accepts Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.18.d: "This day marks a victory for socialism in West Russia, as Gorky has welcomed Komi's government with open arms. Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armored fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t: "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d: "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a: "Let's hope we succeed."

 komidiplo.20.t: "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d: "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a: "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b: "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.t: "Vologda Accepts Our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d: "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a: "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t: "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d: "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a: "Vologda will stand on its own."

 komidiplo.23.t: "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d: "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a: "Let's send them our own aid."

 komidiplo.24.t: "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d: "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a: "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d: "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a: "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b: "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"

 komidiplo.26.t: "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d: "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a: "This is what happens to traitors."

 komidiplo.27.t: "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d: "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our Republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a: "This is truly a day of joy."

 komidiplo.28.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy within the Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d: "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a: "Our independence is not up for debate!"
 komidiplo.28.b: "It is for the best that we join them."

 komidiplo.29.t: "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d: "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a: "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."

 komidiplo.30.t: "Tatarstan Agrees to Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d: "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our Republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a: "Diplomacy has won the day!"

 komidiplo.31.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy within the Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d: "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a: "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 komidiplo.31.b: "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."

 komidiplo.32.t: "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d: "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a: "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t: "Bashkiria Agrees to Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a: "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t: "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d: "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the Republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a: "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b: "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t: "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d: "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our Republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a: "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t: "Vyatka Refuses Our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d: "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a: "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.t: "The West Russian United Front?"
 komidiplo.55.d: "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."
 komidiplo.55.a: "Pah! We will go our own way!"
 komidiplo.55.b: "Let us merge the two governments."
 
 komidiplo.58.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.58.d: "Over the past few weeks, our scouts have observed an increase of military activity on our borders with the state known as "Ust-Sysolsk"; a highly militaristic, far-right regime based in the lands formerly owned by the Komi Republic. The belligerent attitude this regime has held towards their neighbors has been cause for concern, and now it seems they are turning our sights towards our holy order.\n\nA message has been received this morning demanding our immediate submission. Should we accept, they would peacefully integrate our order into Ust-Sysolsk and bloodshed would be avoided at the expense of our own freedom. On the other hand, should we decline, it seems clear they would not shy away from military action..."
 komidiplo.58.a: "We have no choice but to submit."
 komidiplo.58.b: "These heretics do not deserve our fear!"

 komidiplo.59.t: "The Order Submits!"
 komidiplo.59.d: "As expected, the Order of Saint George has wilted in the face of our military might and decided it would be best to submit rather than risk a military confrontation. Our troops are already moving across the border into Gayny to ensure the integration process goes smoothly and without incident."
 komidiplo.59.a: "One more step on the road to unification."

 komidiplo.60.t: "The Order Stands Defiant!"
 komidiplo.60.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Order of Saint George has refused our demands and stands defiant even in the face of our overwhelming martial superiority. They are already reinforcing their borders and preparing for the inevitable conflict, but this effort is almost certainly futile. Our forces outnumber theirs by a considerable margin, and this war is not likely to take long."
 komidiplo.60.a: "Brave, but foolish."

 komidiplo.61.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.61.d: "Trouble on the horizon. The far-right regime based in Syktyvkar has long been a source of concern for us, and it seems their attention has finally been drawn to our neutral zone. Large forces of troops are massing on the border, and this worrying turn of events has coincided with a message to our foreign office.\n\nThe so-called state of "Ust-Sysolsk" demands the neutral zone's immediate submission and integration into their borders. Should we refuse, they have vaguely implied some kind of military action. Judging by the large presence of troops on our border, this threat is hardly a bluff. Shall we surrender and put the final nail in the neutral zone's coffin, or attempt to defend ourselves?"
 komidiplo.61.a: "We cannot possibly win. We must submit."
 komidiplo.61.b: "The neutral zone cannot fall!"
 
 komidiplo.62.t: "Vologda Submits!"
 komidiplo.62.d: "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified."
 komidiplo.62.a: "Neutrality is overrated."

 komidiplo.63.t: "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d: "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a: "We will crush them!"

 komidiplo.64.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d: "Worrying news from our supposed "allies" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a: "We never should've trusted them!"

 komidiplo.65.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d: "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."
 komidiplo.65.a: "Perhaps it is time to lay down our arms..."
 komidiplo.65.b: "We shall crush them beneath our treads!"

 komidiplo.66.t: "Gorky Surrenders!"
 komidiplo.66.d: "The bandit brigades of Gorky have wisely decided to surrender to our forces, no doubt coming to the conclusion that a conflict would result in their total destruction. Our troops have secured control over Gorky and its important mechanized factories without so much as a shot fired, and the integration of the region proceeds as planned."
 komidiplo.66.a: "How fortuitous."

 komidiplo.67.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d: "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."
 komidiplo.67.a: "Those rusty tin cans do not scare us!"

 komidiplo.68.t: "A Letter to Tatarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d: "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tatarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, "much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."
 komidiplo.68.a: "God Willing, may our union bring glory to us both."
 komidiplo.68.b: "Rebuff these fools. Their words mean little."

 komidiplo.69.t: "The Instrument of Accession"
 komidiplo.69.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."
 komidiplo.69.a: "Glory to our brothers from Tatarstan!"

 komidiplo.70.t: "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only "natural political and cultural concerns" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a: "They will come to regret this."

 komidiplo.71.t: "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d: "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common "base of faith, tolerance and ardor" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a: "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b: "We stand alone!"
 
 komidiplo.72.t: "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a "staunch brotherhood and mutual respect" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"
 komidiplo.72.a: "Glory to Gumilyov!"
 
 komidiplo.73.t: "Stubborn Fools!"
 komidiplo.73.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the "spittle of Satan", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."
 komidiplo.73.a: "Mere delays to the inevitable."

 komidiplo.74.t: "A Threat to Berezniki"
 komidiplo.74.d: "Kazembek's watching the guard escort the Eternal Loyalty convoy to the gates when the message comes. The sky is foggy and the wind gnaws at everything, such that the messenger's words are almost lost in the whirl:\n\n"Ust-Sytolsk wants our terms, Sir!"\n\nThere is little doubt what he means: Vyatka's active government has long warned of such a possibility. Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."
 komidiplo.74.a: "Submission."
 komidiplo.74.b: "War."
 
 komidiplo.75.t: "A Resignation"
 komidiplo.75.d: "Berezniki's choice is clear when the morning comes: the border garrison notes mass surrenders of border troops and a rapid breakdown of anything resembling coherent resistance. As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"
 komidiplo.75.a: "Serve Eurasia or die for yourself."
 
 komidiplo.76.t: "A Simple Refusal"
 komidiplo.76.d: "Berezniki makes its stance clear in the dead of night: the envoy from Ust-Systolsk is expelled and his guard unceremoniously shot as a warning, and as he is taken back to the border by People's Battalions he records the following:\n\n"Watching a convulsion of violence erupt, from the safety of my truck: here and there bonfires and shouts, and I hear screams from the grasslands. They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them."\n\n"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar."\n\n"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war."\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."
 komidiplo.76.a: "I'm not sure whether to believe this."

 komidiplo.56.t: "The WRRF Refuses!"
 komidiplo.56.d: "Excerpt from "On Deviationism: A Response to the West Russian Pseudo-Revolutionaries", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt is with deep disappointment, but no real surprise, that we discover the true nature of the so-called Arkhangelsk Socialists - or, as we now know them, the Arkhangelsk Junta. We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous Communist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkhangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

 komidiplo.57.t: "The WRRF Accepts!"
 komidiplo.57.d: "Excerpt from "On Solidarity: A Response to the West Russian Comrades' United Front", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt was always to be expected that our brothers in arms would one day find us, their natural allies and equals, and it is with great joy that we announce that the inevitable has finally occurred. We look to the World with expectant eyes, and to the rest of our Motherland - if the generals of the Front hope to find in us the ideological strength and the collective will to undo the Undoing of the Nation, they can rest assured that they will find us more than sufficient.\n\nWe must not rest on our laurels, however. The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day. Only our resolve is required, that on that day we might stand in the hallowed ranks of the Martyrs and say:\n\nI was there when History needed me."

 komi_DSNP_regional.1.d: "Rodionov gazed at the hulking shell of the factory, lost as ever in thought. He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - Voznesensky had sent him here, on this 'fact-finding mission', to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry. If that wasn't symbolic, he didn't know what was."

 komi_DSNP_regional.2.d: "No one at the DSNP headquarters knew when the miners' protest letter made it to Voznesensky's office. Truth be told, that was probably the only reason why it got as far as his door in the first place - the DSNP had gotten past its worst day, but a residue of suspicion seemed to taint everything past the office doors these days. Even so, once the letter made it to Voznesensky there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon Voznesensky later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. Voznesensky seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to 'speak' directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling Voznesensky held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

The Unionist grimaced at his glance, but otherwise did nothing. It wasn't like he could do anything about the man with the popular mandate, after all.\n\nNow Voznesensky approached the topic of contention again, almost patient, like a schoolmaster feigning concern. "Alexei, I believe we have certain concerns your Union has failed to address - I am not a man enamoured of warding off the inevitable, so let us try again. Will you, or will you not, stand for a work-week reduction?"\n\nThe Unionist sighed, trotting out the same words he'd always trotted out to the faux-benevolent. "With all due respect, Mr. President, you simply don't understand the material conditions here. We are already treading on the ragged edge of our employers, and it would not do to anger -"\n\nAll at once Voznesensky was animated, almost snarling. Alexei reeled at the sight. "And there it is! How dare you comport yourself like a union man while you bow and scrape before your employers! What a travesty to the spirit of Unionism, and an insult to the ideals of our Nation!" Was it just him, or was there a gleam of triumph in the President's eyes? Was this sport to him?\n\nAs the men gathered around him clapped and jeered, Alexei covered his face with his hands. He'd lost the union's heart, and who knew if his successor would resist crumbling before the demands of the people? Or if the Company wouldn't expel them from the factory altogether? Voznesensky, shaking his hands, leaned in and whispered, as if delivering a final blow:"

He hadn't even agreed to the damned meeting, so why had the President authorized a 'mandatory getaway' from his duties in the Army to attend it? Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Republic Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were. I wish to hear a little more about why Voznesensky chose you - for our common will must be built through our understanding of our individual purposes. What can we bring to democracy - and how can we bring it about?"\n\nThe men looked to him, then around them, and they began to laugh. One slapped the table, chuckling as he got the words out. "Oh, Korolkov, you're funny. You're right. Let's admit it, folks -" The man gestured expansively to a nodding audience. "We were picked because we stand to gain from it all. We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when Voznesensky wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile. "And the more he wants done - the more democratic his elections will be.""

Never would the children know of Rurik and his sons, or Alexander Nevsky's victory over the Teutonic Catholics. It wasn't simply the destruction of a book. It was the obliteration of their history. Then a man from the government came. He was short, balding, and had no smile. A perfect bureaucrat and a boring human being. Yet Katerina wished she picked up that tiny man and kissed him on the spot for what news he brought. New books! Not just reprints, badly copied ones at that, but actually new books with the latest in historical efforts. And not just for history, which had been lost in the bombing, but chemistry, math, biology, and the humanities.\n\n"Come children, come!" Katerina said, clapping her hands together.

Arguments over weights and prices had often turned into scary shouting matches around her.\n\nThat scary market was now firmly a thing of the past, at least to Zora. For the first time she could remember, basic goods were plentiful. There were more smiles to be seen, fewer arguments, and most importantly, a plethora of new faces, stalls and goods on offer. It seemed every market day there was something new to see, smell or taste! The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat. Once the market came into view, her mother gave her a warm smile and a small coin. "Run along, Alsu, and enjoy yourself. Find me in front of old Mustafaev's stall in an hour's time."

The first half hour now spent making assurances that the failure to produce a majority was not due to the electorate doing something wrong, somehow, they were starting to get somewhere.\n\n"Since no party can command the council by themselves, they will have to work together. Many cities already do this. Sometimes they have stable alliances that rule together, sometimes the largest party builds different coalitions from issue to issue. Even President Morozov has to listen to the other parties and work with them."\n\nHe was optimistic they could do it, too.

Strenuous qualification standards, the focused attraction and repatriation of exiled and expatriate academics, and the provision of proper funding and equipment for scientific purposes, have all contributed to this.\n\nAlthough the level of the Republic's available academic offerings does not yet begin to approach that of more established localses, such as the Reich, the Sphere, or the United States, the gap is quickly closing.

Staring at her piercing eyes, Yahontov sensed a hunter, and his instinctive urge to back away grew in his throat. Even so, he was not one to refuse this hospitality - he'd lost so much in the last lawsuit filed against him by that goddamn snake in the grass Boris...\n\nStalina started at the trembling little man, his back hunched with exhaustion but his eyes fiery. Flipping through the pages of her mental dossier, she pondered her assessment again. This man seemed stubborn, old, burned-out and on the way down with a tiny political party along for the ride. So what if his union proposal was something even Morozov said was a good idea? Surely there was a better way to build a Coalition than this.\n\nSighing, she shrugged off the notion. There would be no better opportunity to build trust in her government than the one presented by this feisty character here. Her hands were tied. Forcing a half-smile, she rose to speak:"

 komi_PSD_regional.7.d: "Sergey Ivanov nodded politely at the blubbering middle-aged lady. Waiting for the sobs, like hiccoughs in a child, to die down, Ivanov murmured: "We are terribly sorry for your losses, Madam Lykova. The last few years have been harsh on us all. But my heart bleeds for you and your son."\n\nThe mention of her son seemed to sweep Lykova into a fresh wave of sadness. "My son - my son - how will he be employed with his hand? How, I ask you? And with the latest layoffs-"\n\n"Yes, caught in the organ-grinder at a machine-shop. I'm told that the shop has shut down for lack of money, so if it eases your heart, Madam, the men whose neglect hurt your son are no longer at large to do so."\n\nAs the Madam sniffed, Ivanov gestured frantically to the audio-crew. Time to wrap this up in a nice little closing segment, and they could begin the work of clearing the woman's voluminous tears out of her seat and the table. Goodness, this would certainly leave a stain.\n\n"As the latest Budget of the Republic suggests continued economic downturn for the next three fiscal quarters, women like Lykova find their worries only growing. Hard-earned savings are drying up. Businesses shutter, their revenues fleeing to the four winds. And as Russia's workers struggle, the question is not whether the Government will act to rebuild the economy."\n\nIvanov paused for dramatic effect. "The question is whether the Government will do it by itself, or if the working-men of Russia must force their hand.

The party has been split in two by this issue, and if we do not step in, it could divide the party even further and destabilize our democracy.\n\nAdopted by party members many years ago, the policy espoused by the PSD, or rather a collection of policies, are very critical of Russia's past actions - especially those of the empire. Those who support the policy, primarily those who helped create it, say the policy is necessary to encourage positive change and improvements in Russia, as we should not forget those who failed before us. However, some say it is so anti-Russian that it must be abolished. Those who critique it say it goes against the ideals of a strong, united Russia, and if advocated for by the PSD, it will only weaken the party and the Republic in the long run.\n\nTo maintain the unity of the party, action must be taken.

I'm not stupid, if it weren't for the bottle, none of you would come around."\n\nSuch was the climax of Nadia's lengthy argument with Old Man Vadim, the most stubborn veteran in all of Russia. Nadia sighed, threw up her hands in defeat, and finally departed the little cabin, an hour after her friends had already left. All except Pavel, as it turned out, who smiled at her from a chair on the porch, causing instant guilt and embarrassment to come bubbling to the surface.\n\n"You have a strange taste in friends", he spouted with scathing sarcasm. She shot him a glare, and as he stood up, a punch on the shoulder. She hated to admit it, but the statement held some truth. What was she doing hanging around an old soldier all day? Her friends had come for the booze and the tall tales, two things Vadim had in spades. He was an entertaining spectacle to be sure, but for the rest of the young people in Syktyvkar, nothing more.\n\n"I just think that old fool needs some help is all. It isn't healthy to spend all your time drunk, weaving words and reminiscing alone. Besides, there's a good heart buried in there somewhere" Pavel responded knowingly.\n\n"Well, if you want to spend all your time around old kooks with Soviet flags on their porch, I won't stop you..."\n\nShe knew he was right, on some level. Who was she to tell some old man what to do? Still, each week she would find herself lingering in Vadim's residence, shooting the shit in lengthy kitchen discussions. There was something tender about the old man, and as the months went by, mild curiosity became a genuine friendship. Vadim had become Nadia's pet project, and she encouraged him to come into town. Like a turtle, coaxed from its shell, her efforts had begun to yield fruit."

It had been a rough day, rejected in both her class project and a romantic prospect. Vadim, usually a belligerent complainer, had noticed her change in attitude. He was calm, caring, and for once, her confidant. She had sat crying on his furniture, feeling better after a long talk.\n\nToday, as she approached the small cottage from a distance, a pit formed in her stomach. Vadim's flag was down, and his front door wide open. Two cars flanked each wall, and an armed militant leaned against one.\n\n"Whats going on?" She called out nervously\n\n"Displaying symbols of antidemocratic regimes is a crime," the militant retorted matter of factly, "What do you care?"\n\nNadia felt sick. If there was anyone in Syvkvytar who would resist such a measure, it would be Vadim. Though he could hardly make his way across the house sometimes, she held no doubt's that the tough old bastard would throw punches before taking down his flag voluntarily. The thought of Vadim, bloodied and languishing in jail, was almost too much to bear.\n\nShe set off in a panic, afraid of what she would find when she arrived."

 komi_PSD_regional.10.t: "The Russian Identity"
 komi_PSD_regional.10.d: "Stalina stared at the proposal before her, annoyed at its existence. The "Party Program Regarding Russian Identity" was dripping with danger. A political landmine had found its way to her desk, shoving a wrench in her proceeding with more important matters.\n\nOn the "Left" were those that supported autonomy. Russia, they rightly argued, was neither wholly European or Asian. Beneath her shattered banner lived many races; Buryats, Kazakhs, Tatars, Bashkirs. Each had unique customs, and a distinct identity. Trying to force them all into some unitary "Russian" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian Republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image. To live in Russia was to be Russian, insignificant cultures be damned. Besides, what would matter most to the Baskirs and Tatars, bread and electricity? Or some pseudo-autonomy?"

 komi_PSD_regional.11.d: ""Alright, class, today we will be learning about the colonization and conquest of Siberia. Many centuries ago, Russia was much smaller than it was before the Great Patriotic War and the Russian Revolution. Siberia remained much of a wasteland, with few people living there. To expand the glory of the empire and spread Russian culture, the Tsars decided to settle more Russians east of the Urals. Nowadays, many Russians live in Siberia, and it is no different from Russia the further West you go. Expanding into Siberia made Russia big and strong. No one wants to be in a tiny country, do they?" The teacher paused and looked around the classroom, finding a boy with his hand up.\n\n"Teacher, what happened to the people in Siberia before we went there? Did they go somewhere else?" The boy questioned.\n\nThe teacher paused a moment, thinking. "Well, as I said, there were some people in Siberia before us. Not much changed for them though, they are still there, even in Siberia today. Back then though, many were ruled by terrible khans and suffered under raiders until Russia united them and brought them into Russia. With Russian culture, they learned to work together with each other and the new Russians." Content with her explanation, the teacher began to change the subject, then the boy spoke up once again.\n\n"Didn't they fight back though, like we fought the Germans?"\n\n"What, that's nothing like what happened at all," replied the teacher, obviously vexed by the boy. "Those are two entirely different situations. The raiders fought us of course, but they were murdering poor and innocent Russians. They had to be fought. Meanwhile, the Germans planned to exterminate all of Russia! The Germans were brutish devils while the Russians were pure saviors. Now, I don't want to hear about this any longer. We are going to talk about the war with the Polish Commonwealth to liberate the Slavic peoples there. Open your books to page 402, please.""

 komi_PSD_regional.12.t: "To Write a Speech"
 komi_PSD_regional.12.d: "Stalina sighed as she looked at the multitude of suggestions for her upcoming speech that had been thrown onto her desk. When she had thought of working to unite Russia, working to a better tomorrow for democracy, she hadn't imagined fools throwing themselves around at irrelevant issues instead of looking at the bigger picture. The biggest points of contention lately had not been of military strategy or anything that actually had any meaning. No, the bureaucrats were battling over the "Redemption of Russia". She needed to cement the state position, otherwise the Republic would still be babbling on about culture in the year 2000. Looking over suggestions for opening her speech gave her a headache. One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards "Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to "The most loyal Russians of the Empire". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the "critique" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem "Imperialistic". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted "as a man".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket. For this speech, she already knew the general ideas of what both sides of the party wanted. The Left, pandering to progressive causes and pluralism. The Right, lip service to a strong Russia. She weighed her options. She had little care for the actual issue, but the Right were presently a more powerful ally. It would anger the Leftists, sure, but, perhaps, that didn't quite matter all that much anyways. As long as Russia could be united under the Free Republic, it didn't matter who she stiffed. Decided, she finally began to write."

 komi_PSD_regional.13.d: "President Svetlana Stalina sorted through the pile of paperwork that had accumulated over the night, a task that had not become easier with the reunification of Western Russia. Many of the papers were the usual: status reports from the Moskowien border, reconstruction progress, and anti-partisan efforts. One document, however, captured Stalina's full attention.\n\nApparently, just across the Urals, another warlord had unified a large chunk of Western Siberia. The West Siberian People's Republic, led by one Lazar Kaganovich, had unified a quarter of Russia. Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, "Stalinism" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization. Stalina's father had died when she was young, but it seemed accurate to what she remembered of him.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter what specific strain of communist belief Kaganovich spouted, because at the end of the day they were still communists. Russia had suffered under Soviet rule once, Stalina refused to let it happen again."

The streets were littered with the chaos of the recent days, red and gold-black banners mingled with the usual unpicked garbage, and navigating through them was almost an adventure in itself. Trying to ignore the acrid stench of cordite, she marched on, eyes almost closed - and it was then that she ran into the barricade. Curious. The street had been open the week before. And these soldiers didn't look like members of the People's Battalions, either: they wore the colors of the Republic on their armbands.\n\nAlmost on instinct she drifted towards the soldiers. If they had an extra toll for visitors, it would do no harm to find out early, wouldn't it? A soldier with an epaulette on his shoulder - an officer, perhaps, nodded to her. "Good day, madam. What can we do for you?"\n\n"If there's a toll we need to pay to cross this street, how much is it going to be? The last People's Battalion charged a ruble." Her voice sounded almost childish, talking about these things. "Isn't there a market rate for this sort of thing?" The soldiers looked at each other and chuckled. One of them threw Galina something - in her surprise she barely caught it. A military ration-biscuit. Official.\n\n"We ain't from no irregular unit, lady. This here is all Government-sanctioned." The officer smiled, his face barely twitching above the lips. "There's a new Government in town, and from here on out there won't be toll-booths for streets ever again. Not if we can help it."\n\nAs they waved farewells behind her Galina stumbled on her way. She dared not hope for better, but perhaps if these new folks were in town, things would change - and when the future arrived in Russia it hit hard and fast."

 komi_recgov_regional.2.d: "Ludmila liked the quiet of the morning office. Boss Matovsky seldom came in before 11, the workers filed in at 9 sharp and between these times a peace descended upon the little cubicles of the Tax Registry Bureau. She would take her custom-made cup (a gift from a friend) and swish the dregs of her tea as she paced the office, taking in the sheer freshness of the morning streaming in through the office windows. There was something about solitude, Ludmila felt, that made the everyday magical - it was the redeeming perk of an otherwise uneventful job.\n\nShe wondered, as she often did, what the men and women of the office did to make them stay so late. Most offices closed at 5 and opened at 8, but she'd been specified to leave the offices open till 2am. If her parents hadn't passed on a few years back she'd have refused the job outright for its late hours. Even so, she was a light sleeper.\n\nAnd sometimes files passed, here and there, without even Ludmila noticing, and some of the dossiers she managed were thick one day and thin the next. It wasn't her job to notice, and so she made an effort not to. Better to keep to silence than to risk an intrusion - or her salary.\n\nThis morning, she thought, she would make herself her favourite tea-brew. Humming a light tune, she walked to the office doors and was taken quite by surprise by the thud of gunfire.\n\nAs the noise hammered her ears, she huddled by instinct against her desk and watched her world torn asunder by burly soldiers hefting crate upon crate of files - and protesting men - out the door. An officer, clambering up to her, yelled at her to go home - and four words, repeated over and over, such that they rang in her head with every step of the journey."

He had no idea how he'd escaped the initial payroll purges, but here he was, the last real tea-boy in whatever the Republic's leadership apparatus had become. And he had a job to do.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he struggled to write everything down: the two animated figures certainly didn't seem terribly concerned about their scribe, talking in a constant, uninterrupted flow of dialogue. Damn this job! He knew the two were friends - the way they were at ease with each other, it was hard not to see them as the two nerdy children in every schoolroom - but did they really have to speak this much on official business?\n\nStalina paused, her face momentarily darkening, and Brukhonekov murmured a silent prayer as he finished the last notes on their conversation. A discussion on democratic reversion, the usual talk of military loyalty - nothing beyond the ordinary. But if he knew Stalina, her pause meant she was moving to the real meat of the conversation.\n\n"Petro, you are of course aware of why I am here. My apologies for being indirect - you know I hate being curt with friends - " Stalina took a sip of her tea. "Officers like you, they don't come freely these days. I want to know if your men can stomach my next orders, because if they can't, well, our State will never be brought to proper health." Another sip, like a pause in a music-sheet.

They crossed each street once or twice, leaving a trail of paper behind them, and then they left for the town centre. Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world.

Its title was unassuming - a bureaucratic euphemism, typical of laws passed by the National Assembly, in the age of the newly unified Western Russia. The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window. Far away, she imagined, in every city and town of Russia, every mansion, apartment, or rural hut, the people of the Republic now lived in a world that had just become a little bit safer for Russia."

How had she worked with them for so long without tiring of the effort?\n\nPresently they were speaking regarding the latest Political Reservation measures, measures she'd put in place to ensure the safety of the State. These idiots were playing the audience like a fiddle, speaking of the dangers of "overreach" - they didn't have the good sense to see the threats only the President could ever see. Was this how that fool Voznesensky had felt?\n\nGod, she couldn't believe the nerve of these people. At least her Party men had the good sense to remain silent. Well, this latest bill would shut up the yapping once and for all. Hiding her growing irritance she waved for the Speaker to admit her name to the list.\n\nSavouring the looks on the legislators' faces as she did so, Stalina spoke in what seemed almost like glee: "Under the auspices of the Executive Directive Act, I declare the Political Reservation Measures under discussion today a matter of National Security. Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget..."\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach.

Even so, there remained the tiny, dubious hope of being allowed to speak freely on intra-party policy. It was a mere sliver of political concessions, but that was all that could be afforded.\n\nMost had simply lost hope, in part yielding to the new circumstances, in part simply tiring of it all. Morozov lost friends, one by one, in the trickle back to the provinces and villages. One last act of protest. Morozov was left to wonder if anything would survive of Morozov's brainchild - in theory or practice - when the reign of the PSD came to an end. Assuming, of course, it came to an end at all.\n\nMorozov preferred not to think along those lines. Perhaps the residual unease was why receiving the news of the new Democratisation Order gave him such a wild joy - the President had been explicit in her orders, and he looked forward to retrieving his old membership rolls. A new beginning was here for his movement.\n\nAs he looked on, however, darkness once again clouded his vision: for it appeared that someone had gone through his membership records with a sharp eye and a sharper knife. Members, here and there, had been lost - the Party's best and brightest - and Stalina had been very, very explicit about not seeking out members beyond the records. It appeared that Morozov's free party was in fact free only to form a party: everything else was up for debate."

We are to act as older brothers, too: always nurturing to our lessers and juniors, while retaining the endless patience necessary to teach them to be better."\n\n"But when it comes down to it - when it is time to really get this country going - the elder brother must take the steering wheel, and he cannot afford any distractions.

It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day. For now, what she had built would suffice. She reached to the telephone to call Morozov. Even if the Republic disdained her, her friends - and her brandy - would not."

Usually this took the form of mild snarls and accusations of incompetence, which was comparatively mild for the Republic's politics. It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. "No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances." She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. "President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week."\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him. "With all due respect, I care not a whit for you or the corporate suits. My job and my heart lie with this country, and if we are to sell its treasure to those who cannot be trusted with it we may as well disband the Army and lower our banners tomorrow."\n\nShe turned to her papers with a rare vehemence. "You are forgiven the little transgression of your ignorance. Speak against me again and I will ensure even that privilege is stripped from you. Now leave.""

Beside him the squad rustled in its frantic activity: water canteens needed filling, loaded bags checking, rifles inspecting. There were barely enough hands on deck to accomplish it all.\n\nAs the officer lumbered away, Kirov whispered, "Shitbag." What an insufferable son of a whore! And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic. Kirov was a man of faith - he had faith only in what men could bring him, that was. And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him. He moved towards his squad. "Are you lot ready to go? Get your thumbs out of your asses, gentlemen. It's time to start hauling ass, and if you lot have taught me anything it's that men without brains can get very, very far in life. It's time to start putting that theory to practice."\n\nA chuckle escaped the squad, and Kirov's gaze shot to its source. Glaring at the conscript, Kirov let the coldness of the evening into his voice. "Did you think that was funny, Private? Don't give me an answer. You'll have time to think about it on guard duty tomorrow. Double shifts." He turned to the rest of the squad. "Get ready to move. One mike.

 komi_dem_generic.2.d: "It was, like every other evening at the Foreign Strategy Office, both way too long and ridiculously short for their work. Another exercise was planned the following week, and the Commanding Officer had put everyone on standby for emergency planning duty. Officer Nabatov had been on emergency duty the last twenty-four hours in a row, and the map wasn't just swimming in front of him - it was doing victory laps in his eyes.\n\nShaking his head, he took another swing of the jealously-hoarded coffee ration and looked again at his prooftexts. He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. "Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though." And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work! His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

 komi_dem_generic.3.d: ""For the last time, Officer! I am not handing over the strategy of this country to a Council that thinks that the Army can be relegated to a secondary priority!" The thud of a binder punctuated the last words, and Strelkov flinched. At least the Commander hadn't aimed for his head this time. "If the Council truly believes that this newfangled strategy is what is best, I think it best that we safeguard the real power far away from them until they are disabused of the notion."\n\nStrelkov nodded helplessly. "Commander Grigorenko! Please, this is not a usurpation or anything of the sort. We are simply attempting to better strategy now that our Air Force is in working condition. After all, we in the Republic cannot afford casualties the same way large countries can - "\n\nAnother binder-thud, this one louder than the first. "You are delusional if you think that the air-land strategy will safeguard our losses! Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us."\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples. "Commander, there is to be no stealing - we will allocate funds as we deem fit for the health of the Republic. Moreover, we are aware that the transition to air-land battle will take quite awhile, which is why we need you on board. Who else could train with us?"\n\nGrigorenko simply shook his head.

 komi_dem_generic.4.d: "There hadn't been a fistfight in the General Headquarters for quite awhile now, and so Korolkov was taken by surprise when the latest iteration broke out. It had been sudden, too - one minute there was a reasonable discussion regarding prioritization of funding to be given to the Military Research Department, the next a full-on fistfight had been in progress, with men in middle age on both sides struggling to either restrain or deck their peers.\n\nKorolkov sighed. Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories. Well, glories was a strong term, but he lacked another word for it.\n\nAt least this paperwork would be of use to the Republic - a paper drafted by one of his staffers on the movement of hybridized troops in the last days of the West Russian War, and a note on how to make it applicable to the Republic's current situation. Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. "Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim? Ah, this will do," and the paperwork was snatched from Korolkov's desk.\n\nThe General Staff member retreated, and Korolkov kneaded his temples in frustration. This was his third day of promotion, and already he missed nothing more than the lowly status of his previous position. The Republic, he was certain, was doomed regardless; but at least he had been blind to it beforehand."

 komi_dem_generic.5.d: "Yefimova's father had whispered dreams to her when she was a child: dreams of a shining fleet of ships, flying the Red Ensign in unison. Each ship, he had told her, was far bigger than the fishing junk they shared: they had guns, ammunition stores, quarters for dozens of people on each ship, and the burnished steel shone like gold in the sun's rays, like some forgotten treasure brought to light.\n\nOf course, that had been a long time ago, he had whispered, and now the Republic they were in was landlocked, and the dream, for now, was dead. But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow. Her father, wherever he was, could rest now. His dream was here, in the flesh, and she was living it for him."

The defect he'd been warned about was clear as day now: it bent just a little forward, forcing the shooter's position down by a hair's breadth. Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatoust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, "Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping. Perhaps - yes - that would have to do.\n\nKorenev scribbled: PUT SOME EXTRA STOCK ON THE RIFLE AND TELL THEM TO AIM HIGHER. Satisfied, he nodded and went on to the next rifle."

 komi_dem_generic.7.d: "It was, in the end, the budget that decided it for them all, not tactics, not armor specifications, not even the opinions of the tank-crews themselves. The budget simply didn't have enough room for the additions of tank units to the regiments of the existing armor corps. It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit. There was a sense of general anticipation - this one, it was believed, would go far, and it would take the Republic with it."

 komi_dem_generic.8.d: ""God, this place is far," Sokalov grumbled as he checked the timing for the truck. His rusty old wristwatch had been a gift from Dad, but there was no sign of his father's precision now as he watched the dusty road. It had been, if this little contraption was accurate, almost half an hour since the scheduled delivery to the Military Academy. How the hell was he supposed to get there on time?\n\n"Yes, far indeed. I've been waiting forty-five minutes myself." There was a twinkle in the other man's eye. Sokalov sized him up, suspicious as a miner's son in a poor district could be of someone who looked suspiciously bourgeois. Dressed in relatively well-tailored clothing, with a little cap to stave off the wind - this man looked nothing like what he'd been told to encounter. "I don't believe we've met. I'm Semyon. You?"\n\nSokalov glared at the hand, then relented and shook. "I'm Sokalov. South of Syktyvkar. You with the Academy?" Semyon - if that was his real name - nodded, his smile firm on his face. "Well then, I suppose we'll get acquainted eventually. What's your designated specialisation?" The man rustled about in his breastpocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. "Ah, I'm assigned to Artillery and Fire Control. You're Infantry Standards, I take it? I know they're taking a lot of them these days, and you seem the type."\n\nSokalov nodded, chuckling a little. "Can't believe they sent me to Vyatka after sending me into the roughbodies - think the Army wants to kill me, between the both of us." Semyon chuckled back, and the air between them grew easy. "Why did you sign up? This course ain't gonna be easy for none of us."\n\nThe man seemed almost shy. "The same reason as you. I love my country." He waved to the fields around them, boundless as the sky itself. "And I want to keep it free." Sokalov nodded. The two were very different, but they were going to get along just fine."

WELCOME, BROTHERS FROM RUSSIA is plastered virtually everywhere in the airport, and the questions seem to be fired in volleys for maximal damage. It's all the bodyguards can do to keep him safe from the chaos.\n\nIt gets a little better when the Ambassador is ushered to the Finnish Government's official headquarters. There the mob of intense reporters is locked out, and the only man in a suit the Ambassador must face is the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what he lacks in numbers he more than makes up for in intensity: there seems no escaping from his intense, silent gaze.\n\nAt least the conversation starts cordial. The Ambassador makes polite small talk, drawing from the little he knows of the Finnish within his own country: he talks of music, culture, shared brotherhood. The Prime Minister replies in kind, but there is something in his eyes that reminds the Ambassador of a butcher checking his latest cut for its weight and value. Something transactional, something shallow.\n\nThen the Prime Minister looks him in the eye and asks: What is the status of the occupied territory of Karelia? The room seems to drop a hundred degrees in minutes. What answer could there possibly be?\n\nAs the Ambassador squirms in his seat, a fish fresh out of water, the Prime Minister guffaws and bear-hugs him. Welcome to Finland, he says.

West Russia's representatives have been talking the ears off of influential economists, politicians, and government bureaucrats, and now the word on plenty of lips is "investment". The WRFR has vast fields of oil, a strong timber industry, and increasingly developed light and heavy industrial sectors, such as steel and chemicals. In addition, given river and rail development, the WRFR also has economic ties to other parts of Russia, Central Asia, and regions further east. However, this nascent economy needs a boost in order to be all that it can be. Should we offer direct financial aid, investment subsidies, and perhaps R&D funding to the WRFR? It could yield economic and political benefits down the line, even if the cost up-front strikes some as unreasonable."

 komi_dem_generic.39.d: "An interesting offer has recently come to the State Department from the embassy of the [KOM.GetName]. The country controls a series of ports along the White Sea, in the far north of Russia, near Finland and the Baltic region. While the sea is fairly quiet these days, there is a substantial amount of military infrastructure left over from when ports like Arkhangelsk were controlled by the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The WRFR is offering to give us basing rights at these ports, in exchange for a yearly increase to their aid funding of approximately 550 million dollars. While this sum may seem eye-popping at first, it's a rounding error for a budget as big as the USA's, and in exchange, the US Navy would have a toehold deep in the heart of Russia, within striking distance of numerous strategic targets. What should we do?"

For us, this is a significant diplomatic coup. We get an American military presence for defense, and a substantial amount of funding that can be put to good use. Already, officials at our foreign ministry are toasting to a job well done."

While the American government has noted that our offer of basing rights on the White Sea had its benefits, and that they desired continually positive diplomatic relations, the price tag was ultimately too high for them to justify. Negotiations over the agreement broke down, and unfortunately, they broke down quite publicly. Word of the failure has already made its way to the press, and some commentators are calling for the foreign minister to resign over the matter. With the diplomatic row and the loss of a potential financial lifeline, this has clearly been a major blow to our government's standing."

The Democratic Socialist People's Party, supporting democratic socialism in the Republic, have started to spread their message of equality and workers' rights. This has gained the support of the poor and the workers of Russia, who now see the DSNP as a party for the poor. It seems the DSNP will have a lot of support from the laborers and the working class.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist's promises for equality in the Republic have also gained the support of many laborers and farmers alike, unhappy with their conditions and especially with the landowners that have been gaining power ever since the collapse of authority in the warlord era. However, the DSNP's past scandals still hurts the party to this day, and it may be an uphill battle to win the election."

They didn't seem interested in him, more glad to have a break than anything. Voznesensky knew he would have to make a good speech to get these workers on his side.\n\n"Laborers of Gorky, I come here with promises. Promises of workers' rights, healthcare, higher wages, safety regulations, more pay and fewer hours. You have worked tirelessly for Russia. Whether you produce tanks or toys, you are the ones who will be building a better Russia. Not the politicians, not the economists, but you, the worker. Producing weapons or civilian goods, you make a better Russia for us all, one step at a time."\n\nThe workers had begun to perk up, it seemed like they were becoming more interested in what Voznesensky had to say. "For all you have done, I thank you. But I wouldn't be doing anything if I was just congratulating you or giving out promises, would I? I assure you, in my presidency, the workers will be my top priority. Your hard work will no longer be unrewarded! For what you do for this country, you will be duly compensated. I promise all of you, no worker of this republic will ever be ignored again!"\n\nAs he finished the speech, Voznesensky looked into the eyes of everyone in the room.

Containing the ideals for a democratic socialist state, the DSNP wants to reach as much of the masses as possible to win the election.\n\nThe pamphlets include writings from prominent DSNP members and the party's platform. As such, the pamphlet mentions the DSNP's plan to increase workers' rights in great detail. Plans of workplace democracy, empowering unions, and increased pay have been promised to all the workers of the Republic. The pamphlet also goes on to say how the DSNP plans to transition the Republic into a socialist democracy and a socialized economy, creating a republic of equality. Still, many doubt the DSNP, if elected, could successfully implement any of their reforms."

 komi_dem_generic.45.d: "The campaigning parties continue to spread their platforms across Russia, and the PSD is no different. From the large cities to the small villages, Sovereign Democratic Party presence can be seen almost everywhere. A platform for a strong, sovereign Russia, the PSD hopes to appeal to everyone, the factory workers, the farmers, and the business owners. The Sovereign Democratic Party hopes anyone who cares for their motherland will vote for them in the coming elections.\n\nThe PSD, hoping to steal votes from other parties as well, are also promising social democratic and capitalist policies. Social policies as well as free-market economics are becoming a main point of the Sovereign Democratic Party. One thing is for sure, the PSD should not be underestimated."

 komi_dem_generic.46.d: "More pamphlets are circulating across the country from the parties. The PSD's includes stories from everyday Russians both young and old as well as the party's platform. Containing the ideals for a strong and independent Russia that stands above its enemies, the pamphlet has many promises for the future, hoping to gain the support of every Russian.\n\nAs written in the pamphlet, the Sovereign Democratic Party has promised a social-democratic republic, one that does not ignore the poor and in need, yet bashes the DSNP for its radical ideas. The pamphlet also advertises anti-extremism and anti-radicalism, denouncing both fascism and communism. The PSD has also promised more liberal social policies, advocating for equality and liberty. Most important to the PSD however, is the reclamation of Russia. In their platform, the PSD has promised to focus efforts on reunifying the motherland, no matter the cost. With this, the Republic under the PSD can expect an increase in the size of the military and preparations for a war economy.\n\nIt's certain the PSD has much support, but will a platform of war and reclamation work with everyone?"

 komi_dem_generic.47.t: "Surrounding Threats"
 komi_dem_generic.47.d: "It was a brisk, cool morning in the Republic's capital.

Our young republic is surrounded by those who wish to destroy it, just as it was ten years before. We cannot make the same mistakes! We must all be stronger. The failure that led to the destruction of the revolutionary front by Germany must not end our Republic as well. And to the east are even greater threats. Rival governments that claim they are the true government of Russia. Warlords who wish to conquer and pillage our homes and destroy our democracy. We must defend our families, our Russia!"\n\nThe crowd seemed to be growing larger now, so Stalina began to speak louder. "A PSD victory means a Russia that can defend itself from aggression, and a Russia that can take the upper hand. If we want to defeat those who threaten us, we must strike first. Russia needs a large to defend herself. If we appear weak, our enemies will strike us down. Vote PSD, and save Russia!""

Russia needs all of your help. Your intelligence, creativity, and determination will decide the future of your country. The Union of Young Reformers is working towards a developed and modern Russia. I promise that together, we can lead Russia into a new age. The SMR will fund your projects, your dreams, and your jobs. You will be the ones transforming Russia, helping its economy, its sciences, and its people. A smart, modern Russia can be built out of nothing. What will you do to help Russia? What will you do to make your dreams come true?"\n\nThe incredible crowd, encompassing most of the university, went wild with excitement. They were Russia's future. Why would the SMR let them down?"

Including the dreams and ideas of a modern, developed Russia, the pamphlet hopes to attract voters who wish for a better life escaping from poverty and living a modern lifestyle. In the pamphlet, the SMR promises to totally transform Russia during its term.\n\nResearch funding is also a major stance taken by the party, hoping new technologies will modernize the country. This has also begun to gain the interest of everyday Russians, intrigued by new technologies that could make their lives easier.\n\nThe Union of Young Reformers also includes ideas from other parties, including social equality and workers benefits. The SMR hopes to create a full market economy and bring prosperity to all Russians. Connections can be easily made to the American system.

However, that is not to say our position is stable. The lingering remnants of our past political rivals still remain in the country, and could potentially cause issues if they are left to their devices.\n\nWe have no choice but to take preemptive action; we must find these dissenters before they can cause serious damage to our efforts to stabilize the situation. The security forces stand ready to conduct a search on key targets from several opposing factions suspected to have a presence in the country.\n\nTheir base of power will wither away without a strong leader at the reins, so surgical strikes targeting the head of the dissenting groups is necessary.

She is almost certainly accompanied by some of her loyal associates, in particular former Gen. Petro Grigorenko (PDZ-339), in conjunction with whom she poses a serious insurgent threat to our government. Her liquidation should be undertaken at the earliest opportunity possible."

Sightings of questionable veracity have placed him at numerous locations inside, as well as outside, of Komi proper, raising speculation that he may be undertaking trips of some kind to other states.\n\nAnalysis:\nAnalysts consider it unlikely that Morozov is involved in front-line resistance work against the government, and speculate that Morozov may instead be attempting to liaise with rival governments in an effort to procure outside financial and material support for liberal resistance groups. His liquidation has the potential to cut off insurgent supply lines and significantly decrease such groups' efficacy."

However, it should be noted that these witnesses should not be considered necessarily reliable due to severe discrepancies in their stories, and there are other reports suggesting that he may have fled Komi entirely and may be in Vyatka.\n\nAnalysis:\nAlthough former President Voznesensky is not known for his political tact, it is believed to be entirely possible that he still commands a degree of loyalty from some remnants of the old regime.

No location has yet been ruled out, and it is not impossible that he has simply remained in Syktyvkar or even fled Komi entirely.\n\nAnalysis:\nSuslov is exceptionally dangerous, and likely still exercises extensive power over Communist Party remnants. It is very likely that he possesses a senior leadership role among leftist resistance elements, and his liquidation must be considered an extremely high priority for our administration.

Sources close to leftist resistance cells claim that Zhdanov is in hiding in an isolated village somewhere in the remote northern regions of Komi, though his exact location is reportedly being restricted only to the most trusted party cadres. Subject's activities are unclear, and he is suspected of being connected to the production of certain leftist pamphlets found circulating in the Syktyvkar area. Subject is additionally suspected of complicity in several terror attacks against military installations, though this is unconfirmed.\n\nAnalysis:\nZhdanov's own capacities as a leader of armed resistance are limited, but his skill as an ideologue and orator should not be underestimated. Penetrating his inner circle in the past has been quite difficult due to the highly-indoctrinated and even fanatical nature of many of his closest associates, and it stands to reason that his present circumstances may only exacerbate this tendency. There is no question that Zhdanov will resist our government in any way he is able, and it is for this reason that it may be advisable to either capture or kill him."

 komi_opposition.6.d: "ATTN: Top Clearance\nClassification: MONOLITH\n\nActivity Report: PDZ-213, BUKHARINA SVETLANA NIKOLAEVNA\n\nSubject's whereabouts are unclear, but it is suspected that she may have fled to the virtually uninhabited wilderness directly south of Syktyvkar, where she is believed to be in hiding with a large force of leftist insurgent fighters, believed to be responsible for a series of roadside bombings against military convoys in the region, as well as attacks on military facilities.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe symbolic importance of capturing or killing the daughter of the Soviet Union's former leader cannot possibly be overstated. Although Bukharina is undoubtedly an effective political force in her own right, her symbolic value is arguably far more threatening, and she could serve as an effective rallying point for Bukharinist holdouts. She is a highly charismatic leader who is also willing to employ great violence in the pursuit of her goals, and it is for this reason that she must be targeted with maximum prejudice before she can become a broader symbol of armed resistance to our government."

 komi_opposition.7.d: "ATTN: Top Clearance\nClassification: MONOLITH\n\nActivity Report: PDZ-002, GUMILYOV LEV NIKOLAYEVICH\n\nSubject was witnessed fleeing the capital by boat via the Vychegda River, and sources suggest he may be in hiding with a group of ideologues in the Ust-Vym/Kokvitsy region. He is believed to be actively publishing subversive materials, and several editorials under the subject's name calling supporters to undertake violent acts of terror against our government have appeared in an underground far-right broadsheet titled "EURASIAN MISSION." Police efforts to trace the ink and typeset used in its production have thus far been unsuccessful, and a canvassing of known printing workshops in the Ust-Vym/Kokvitsy region has not produced any apparent matches.\n\nAnalysis:\nGumilyov's central role among Komi's reactionary movement cannot be overstated, and his neutralization would deal a serious blow to the Passionarist movement. As the voice and ideological father of the movement, and a highly influential figure among right-wing circles more broadly, Gumilyov is arguably one of the most capable organizers of opposition against our government. It is absolutely necessary that he be dealt with one way or another if we are to solidify control and suppress rightist resistance."

 komi_opposition.8.d: "ATTN: Top Clearance\n\nClassification: MONOLITH\n\nActivity Report: PDZ-314, SHAFAREVICH IGOR ROSTISLAVOVICH\n\nSubject's whereabouts are unknown, although he is believed to fled Syktyvkar by boat via Sysola river. Intelligence organizations weren't able to precisely determine the subject's whereabouts, but information obtained from captured Passionarist insurgents led to believe that he is hiding in either Koygorodok or Obyachevo region.\n\nAnalisis: even though a chance of Shafarevich participating in front-line insurgent operations is meager, he is a trained orator and a high-class demagogue, which shouldn't be underestimated. His moderate rhetoric may sway a lot of people on the rightist side. His detention or liquidation will significantly decrease the capability of reactionary opposition to organize."

 komi_opposition.9.d: "ATTN: Top Clearance\nClassification: MONOLITH\n\nActivity Report: PDZ-162, SEROV IVAN ALEXANDROVICH\n\nSubject's whereabouts are uncertain, but he is believed to have fled southeast into the sparsely-populated wilderness in the Mordino/Namsk area, where he may be hiding out in the forest with a group of supporters. Search parties have reported finding traces of camps having being set up in the wilderness in this area, but many of these locations seem to actually be elaborate hoaxes seemingly meant to divert authorities' attention from some other unknown activity, and at least one of such locations was revealed to have been rigged with skillfully-created traps seemingly intended to injure search personnel.\n\nAnalysis:\nAlthough Serov is seen by many as a fringe figure, he is a highly skilled and brutal intelligence operative who is willing to do almost anything to get what he wants. His military experience, along with his training in counterintelligence and deception, likely makes him a highly elusive and resourceful foe who will require significant resource investment to track down. Additionally, his military experience, coupled with his former leadership role in the NKVD, make him a highly capable insurgent leader, and one who should be liquidated at the earliest possible opportunity."

Search parties in the area have found multiple corpses; initially, these were believed to be followers who had died of exposure to the elements. However, the discovery of ligature marks and signs of torture (at least one corpse was found nailed to a tree) suggests that these individuals were killed deliberately, possibly by the subject and his remaining supporters, though the motives for this remain unclear. Although tracks were found at the various kill sites, the direction of motion suggested by each does not suggest any overall direction of movement, and it is presently unclear whether the subject and his supporters remain in the area at all.\n\nAnalysis:\nTaboritsky is a highly unpredictable figure who is seemingly willing to undertake extremely brutal violence against his perceived enemies. Analytical personnel have expressed a lack of confidence in their own ability to predict or draw conclusions about Taboritsky's objectives, let alone his future actions. There is, however, little doubt that he is presently fomenting opposition of some kind against our government."

 komi_opposition.11.d: "How strong the rain was, and how dark it was outside. It did nothing to alleviate Svetlana's mood. Her and her cohort of bodyguards, all armed and ready to open fire on whoever they thought would approach them stalked through Komi's terrain, soaked by the weather and dodging anything that looked like it have wanted them dead. Not only that, but she towed with her Vasily. He was a fighter, certainly, but she could feel the bitterness radiating from him. "You've yet to tell me, sister," he began, barely audible among the many raindrops, "When you plan to come back to Komi. You've always wanted to restore it to normalcy, after all."\n\nSvetlana sighed, running a hand through her hair and wiping off the excess water on her forehead. "I don't." She responded, bringing Vasily to a few seconds of silence. "This has been the first time the nation's fallen into such chaos, brother, and I'm not a one-man-army. I can do much, but I can't stand up to this new order by my own."\n\n"And what of your supporters?" Vasily asked, hoping to find some respite as he was suddenly ushered by one of Svetlana's guards to hide in the grass. After half a minute, a few cars passed by the gravel road, and nobody wanted to know what they were there for. Once they got out, he continued on his previous tangent. "Surely, this is not the end, is it?"\n\nSvetlana gripped the barrel of the gun tightly in her hand. "Vasily. There is nothing left for me there. The Republic is in chaos. Gone, brother. If I go back there, I would only be killed. I'm not throwing my life away for a hopeless shot of some ideological fervor. Now, quieten down. I don't want anyone to hear us." Vasily's bitterness never abated for the rest of the night, but Svetlana was made all the more frustrated for it."

 komi_opposition.12.t: "A Hand Towards Open Fire"
 komi_opposition.12.d: "He had cut communications with everyone he knew for a while now. For the past day, Morozov was alone, his mind aching at the thought of what was going back home - yet he couldn't dare turn back. He knew what had happened, how Komi fell into chaos. Every hour, every minute, he cursed himself for not taking enough action. He knew the eventual fate of Komi, yet kept himself silent. Now he had paid the ultimate price, and the only thing that came his way was downfall. He hadn't even learned about the fate of Svetlana Stalina, a fact that haunted him every step of the way. There were the fates of many to worry about, but he shared with her a sort of grim opinion of Komi's democracy that, unfortunately, turned out to be true.\n\nNow, guided by the strobes of moonlight his escape from the compromised nation came into fruition. In the thick forests, there were no guards, no tachankas, nothing that could stop him. Only the blowing wind and the idle sounds of forest life. Even then, his nerves were on-guard, and Morozov felt that this trip through the forest would be the makings of a new source of paranoia - but he had to brave the sheer emptiness of it all, the lack of human life, and pray that he would not suddenly receive a bullet to the back.\n\nAt the crack of next dawn, Morozov found himself on the other side. He wasn't sure what sort of freedom he would find, and he didn't know if it would truly be a better fate than death at the hands of the radicals. But he had already made his choice long ago, and he would reap the rewards and suffer the consequences for it. Voznesensky's ideal was dead, and Morozov wanted nothing further to do with it."
 komi_opposition.12.a: "Not anymore."
 
 komi_opposition.13.t: "Dreams of a Nation"
 komi_opposition.13.d: "Voznesensky felt betrayal of the greatest kind. The people of Russia had already been humiliated once, their people scattered, their ambitions dusted - but Nikolai managed to build something more. Out from the ashes, a phoenix burned, holding the ideals of thousands and thousands, of a stable Republic, of something that every Russian would gladly call their home.\n\nYet unlike a phoenix, Komi was burnt too badly, and the phoenix of democracy crumbled back into ashes. As Voznesensky ran into the night, death grazing his shoulder multiple times, he finally found himself at the edge of a river. From the other side, there were new pastures, and on the bottom of the river near him sat a small boat made for one person. He had arranged it for himself and only himself, in the dead of night, so that no guard could spot and open fire at a traitor of the new Komi.\n\nWhen he settled himself down and began to cross the river, he looked back. Perhaps in these new lands of Vyatka, he could make change. Perhaps, he thought, it was unnecessary to dream about what Komi had been. It was stabler in Vyatka, potentially even richer. There was a Tsar, and while that in itself didn't bode well, he knew that it was no autocracy. Elements of freedom still remained, and, unlike Komi, were not directly threatened by forces that wished to lock it all away. As Voznesensky looked back, he felt the grip on the paddles weaken, though remain firm. He didn't wish to cross, but he knew that he only had one choice.\n\nBy the time he arrived on the other side, he only wished to lay down and rest, for the horrible realization that struck his mind only kept growing and growing in his mind. Everything he had built up to this point had shattered, and for what? Perhaps, Voznesensky thought..."
 komi_opposition.13.a: "Perhaps the spirit of Komi never existed."

 komi_opposition.14.t: "No More Strings"
 komi_opposition.14.d: "Every hour that passed, he asked the driver the same question. Unflinchingly unchanging. "Have we made it?" It would roll across the tight walls and bump against the windows. For every hour he was met with "no", he became more and more agitated. Mikhail Suslov had planned this from start to finish, true, but he couldn't determine any factors beyond hoping that there would be nothing to stop the black van from travelling down and out of Komi. The nation was swept in chaos recently either way, so it was likely that another such vehicle would merely be passed off without a second thought.\n\nSo he thought. But Suslov's suspicion about something like that happening so easily led him to repeatedly asking that same question, and, as noon turned down midnight, he began actively fidgeting, pressing his thumbs to his hands and moving them up and down. That was the only sign he gave, and that was enough to send worry to the other agents in the vehicle, driver included. If he was worried, they pretended not to notice, but they, along with Suslov, knew.\n\nWhen the hour struck somewhere within the night, his tired voice asked yet again. "Have we made it?" It sounded like Suslov was to pass out soon enough, but he wouldn't dare do that. Not when his life was on the line. He waited and waited, until he received his answer. He couldn't process the word at first as it felt so foreign to him, but when he did, his chest tightened, and his gaze looked up at the barely-lit road in front of him as the vehicle stopped. "Where are we exactly?" He asked, voice now sharper, clearer."
 komi_opposition.14.a: ""Vologda, sir. As per your request, we are now in neutral territory.""

 komi_opposition.15.t: "A Visionary Suppressed"
 komi_opposition.15.d: "All he could feel was dread and shame. Dread, in that this had finally occurred. The nation of Komi, in his eyes, was now too overrun with reactionaries to save. Reactionaries that would gladly dismember him and his ideal of socialism piece by piece until there was nothing but a subservient puppet left. Shame, for Andrei Zhdanov had every right to attempt to save the Republic from the decadence of capitalism and its fascist and fascist-adjacent allies. But here he was, on the run, with nothing to show. His influence within the National Assembly was now nulled, and what remained was merely the ideology that he has formed.\n\nZhdanov, however, would scoff at the notion that his ideology would not eventually be triumphant. Even as he took off into the cover of night, keeping his identification card in his back pocket and driving through the dark streets of Komi towards the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he was stopped by two guards on the border. "Name and identification, please." One of them ordered, and Zhdanov was more than happy to comply. "I am Andrei Zhdanov," he began, passionate yet worried at the same time. "A political refugee from Komi. The nation has fallen into chaos!" He exclaimed, and the guards eyed him warily.\n\n"Chaos?" One of them asked, returning Zhdanov's identification card to him. "Yes!" He responded. "The reactionaries have taken Komi. Please, let me go to your territory - I must continue to build socialism somewhere, anywhere!" Even while fearing for his life, Zhdanov remained a charismatic force. "And I know that your nation is the progenitor of it. Please, men!"\n\nThey stared at him for an uncomfortably long period of time, but, eventually, one of them broke the silence. Shuffling in place awkwardly, he readjusted the gun in his hands and sighed."

 komi_opposition.16.t: "Never Another Union"
 komi_opposition.16.d: "It was cold. So, so, so very cold. Svetlana Bukharina shivered with how cold it was, and gritted her teeth hard. The only thing that kept her attention busy was the chirping of the bird on her shoulder, which she had to forcefully keep shut whenever she heard footsteps from the road. She knew that the process of crossing a border was painful, but being alone, with the potential to be shot by a soldier of a Republic that now saw you as an enemy of the nation, filled her with an emotion she was familiar with, yet refused to interact with whenever it made its motions.\n\nFear. That's what Bukharina felt. At any point while she made her way towards Vologda, she was afraid of feeling the piercing shot of a bullet through her skull. To meet the same fate that surely many in Komi would, and disappear into history, not unlike her father before her. What carried her through the night was not only her sharp senses, and the fact that she knew when to move and when to stay put. No, if she wished to not be dead by daylight, laying in a pool of her own blood, it was the determination to keep going.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, she had resolved, would not end up like her father. She refused to let herself vanish into thin air, even as her ambitions were suffocated and her goals brought to a sudden, unsatisfying halt. That grit pushed her through the cold, keeping her bird safe in her grasp, and as the hours drew by and energy left her body, the cold seeping through her clothes and biting into her skin, she lived."
 komi_opposition.16.a: "Cowed, but not broken, Svetlana Bukharina lived."

 komi_opposition.17.t: "Unspoken Differences"
 komi_opposition.17.d: "Hate filled his mind and body like waves of pulsating pain. Lev Gumilyov had let Komi fall, and the Passionariyy would be no more. Not without his guidance, his intelligence, his beliefs. He did not know what would happen to Shafarevich, but he could not say that he cared too much about the man's fate. Gumilyov knew that he was the head of Komi's right-wing, but now they had kicked him out, and he knew exactly why. The serpents, the snakes, the rats - all of them have caused the downfall of his ideals!\n\nHe was headed for Vyatka, and had managed to bribe a man into driving him to the border and dropping him there. Yet all throughout the ride, he couldn't stop thinking about Komi. They had ruined everything - his grand vision of Eurasia, tarnished! Now Russia would never again be the center of the world as it was always destined to be. In Vyatka there was a Tsar, unfocused and unguided, a fact that did little to alleviate his anger, as it was only marginally better than the betrayal he found in Komi. There, at least, he would not be put up for a mock trial and executed shortly afterwards, if even given such the privilege back home.\n\nWhen the driver was almost at the border, he stopped at the sidewalk and demanded his pay, unceremoniously kicking Gumilyov out as if he was any other civilian. If only he was still in the National Assembly and treated as someone who wasn't to be executed on the spot. Calmly and politely, Gumilyov travelled the rest of the distance on-foot, and met no resistance. There were no guards of Komi to stop and frisk him, only the ones of Vyatka to interrogate him and eventually let him pass. And as he did so, a single thought burned in his mind."
 komi_opposition.17.a: "One day, the fools will realize their mistake, and I shall return."

 komi_opposition.18.t: "An Escape From Madness"
 komi_opposition.18.d: "Igor Shafarevich could feel it. Going down and down and down - he thought that Komi was one of Russia's last bastions of democracy. But that proved to be false, and here Shafarevich was, lingering with regret, unfulfilled words, and a desire to guide Russia into the limelight of history. Now it was all for naught.\n\nNow he had fled his post as Elected Deputy, reduced to nothing more than a target and a traitor of the state he wished to do nothing more with. He had left almost everything behind him; his post, his home, his car, his valuables. Everything except the clothes on his back, his papers of identification, and a heavyset book that he refused to leave behind.\n\nHe blended in amongst the dozens and dozens that flooded the station. Such as the state of Komi was that everything had a hint of chaos to it, even in the daily life of a citizen, and Shafarevich's heart skipped a beat when he had to face a guard. But he hadn't recognized him. He was merely a man among many others who did not care about the trappings of politics. Only the safety of their personal lives.\n\nAs Shafarevich boarded the train, he pondered that possibility. When night fell upon the passengers and himself, and the chugging of the engine lulled him to sleep, he grasped the book in his hands tighter. Mathematics had always had a passion in his heart. Perhaps in his new life he would settle down as a teacher. As deeply political of a person he was, he had no desire to die. And a life as a teacher, to pass on wisdom and intelligence to the bright new minds of Russia..."

 komi_opposition.19.d: "Ivan Serov wanted Komi to be everything it was not. To be strong, while it was weak. To follow the principles of socialism and nationalism undyingly, and yet here the government in power stood as a mockery to his values. There would be no pride in Komi left, not when they had effectively casted him out of the government.\n\nInstead of laying down and dying like a good little agent who outlived his usefulness, Serov had already thought of this happening beforehand. His path was clear and straightforward. All that was needed was a push. That push came in the form of a car drive in a vehicle he had anonymously bought days before. By the time the sun came down, Serov was already at the border, staring down a pair of guards whose faces seemed awfully familiar to him.\n\nRolling his window down, he began pulling out his papers when they came up to his car and heard them start talking. "Papers, please." One of them said, keeping one hand on his rifle and another hand free. Handing over a sheet of them, the guard took some time reading them over. "You are... Anatoly Maksimov?" He said, and Serov nodded. "Currently unemployed, used to serve in the Komi military as a corporal before being honorably discharged?" Another wordless nod. "And you wish to cross into the West Russian Revolutionary Front." That was not a question, Serov could notice, but he nodded anyway.\n\nWith a sigh, the guard handed the papers back to him. "You will see a building a kilometer north from here. Go there and begin processing your documents. Have a good day..." The guard's expression never betrayed an emotion. "Sir." As Ivan Serov rolled up his window and his vehicle came to life once again, he could already imagine himself somewhere else."

 komi_opposition.20.t: "There Comes a Time"
 komi_opposition.20.d: "Never was there a flicker of hope in these God-wasted lands and never the inklings of doubt that faded in Sergey Taboritsky's mind; his musings which ebbed between hatred and malice for the ruiners of civilization proved themselves right in the world, yet wrong for his hopes, as for a moment he wished for the degenerate government of Komi to set themselves on the right path.\n\nThey did not. And they would not, either. Too far did they fall from Taboritsky's gaze. Too strongly were they influenced by the workings of madmen - the lunatics of Zion ever-cursed by the mark of Cain, the murderers and bandits that belonged in the clique of the Communists, and the atheistic spirits who gouged their own eyes out in the name of progress, who silenced their ears to listen to the cry of democracy, and cut their own tongues out to join the ignoble masses. His were the pleas of sanity that were left to rot in the dirt, in likeness of their belief that Tsarevich Alexei did stand in waiting, did not hide in shadows until Russia's savior would come at last, that he was 'dead', 'executed'.\n\nThe case of Komi was one of undoctored insanity, and Taboritsky would not wait for its ill effects to pass on to him. There was a new place to go, and only one stood in the ashes of Russia as something perhaps passable, perhaps not. This so-called 'Aryan Brotherhood', and to get there he had to go through the land of Vyatka. The false Tsar, he would not pity him by remembering his name, was nothing to him. Merely an obstacle.\n\nFor day and night and day and night did Taboritsky cross land and broke through the biting cold, the enemies of the Lord; nothing could prevent his path. When Taboritsky began his journey, his pistol was loaded with eight shots.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the borders of the Brotherhood, all eight were guided by the hand of God to those who were to oppose him."

 komi_opposition.21.d: "The cold bit deeply into her body, even while wrapped in thick and heavy clothing. Svetlana Stalina twitched when she heard the wood snap next to her, and ducked her head down slightly while she grabbed hastily for a magazine. She remembered vividly how things went down. One moment, she was walking with Vasily and her bodyguards. The next, one of them was dead on the ground, and they rushed towards cover.\n\nNow she was stuck behind a collection of soaked trees and wet bushes, the rain making it difficult to move, to see, and to shoot. Occasionally she would glance to her brother from the opposite side, who remained steadfast and silent. She was a good shot, but Vasily was better, though she could feel his nervousness climb with every bullet fired. In the myriad of flashes of light, she decided to call out to her brother. "Vasily!" She yelled, and her brother opened fire. "Vasily!" She shouted again, pulling back the bolt on her gun. He turned around, and looked at her with an expression both annoyed and concerned. "We must pull back! I'm running low on ammo, a-"\n\nIn the blackness of midnight, the misty cloud of dark red that sprouted in front of her was paired with a crack that rippled through the air and her mind, and she felt her body go cold. "Vasily?" She muttered, seeing his body drop as everything became difficult to observe. "Vasily! VASILY!" The weapon in her hands violently clattered against the ground, as she took hurried, unpaced steps towards whatever unfocused shape there was on the ground. She could feel static in her ears, protruding everywhere around her, as sharp pain coursed through her knees when they landed against mud and dirt, and her hands tightly grasped cloth and skin.\n\n"Brother-" She choked out, catching a breath as tremors ran up her arms. "Brother. Move, please. Please start moving." It was difficult to take in air, and everything was so loud. Everything was so, so very loud. The static burned her ears, and the ringing deafened them. She couldn't see anything beyond masses of shapes, she couldn't hear anything except the pain in her mind, and then..."

 komi_opposition.22.t: "Silencing the Voice"
 komi_opposition.22.d: "Ivan Morozov gripped the pistol in his hand tightly, clutching it with an almost fervorous death grip. Ever since Komi's government toppled in favor of the new order, he had been sent into a run. Now he was far away from civilization, wandering between Russia's trees and the crickets of night life that made him jump in his skin. He knew, damned as he was, knew that Komi would capitulate itself to the chaos Voznesensky refused to deal with. But it was too late now, and he paid for it in form of exile.\n\nKeeping himself steady, he moved deeper into the forest. By the time the sun shone down on him, he would be out of Komi territory and into safety. That was the hope. The truth was that such hopes would be dashed into the ground. It came in the form of a gunshot; crackling and powerful from his left side, Morozov's heart dropped and his arms went cold. He wasn't hit, but perhaps it was worse because of it, as his legs thumped and feet began pounding against the dirt and mud and leaves that all fell around him. He was already tired before, now he brinked on exhaustion.\n\nHe barely kept his eyes forward as he ran, only enough to see what trees to dodge and what foliage to jump over, while his mind whirred with chaos and fear. Was this the end? All it would take was one shot. Morozov grit his teeth and fired blindly to his side, quickly emptying the magazine of his pistol. Every shot missed, he knew, but as if penance struck him, he felt one of his legs go numb, and Morozov fell, his head slamming against the hard ground.\n\nWith a pounding headache, a throbbing heart, and a tremoring body, Morozov's lips formed the words for mercy. He was in too much pain to see, let alone speak properly, but still his voice croaked for relief, begging to be spared."

Where, exactly, would his path lead him now? His project was toppled down like a house of cards blown against strong wind, and all that was left was the grand visionary, all alone. To the more amicable members of the National Assembly, he did not know their fates. Nor did he want to. Anywhere from freedom to painful death awaited them. To his enemies he cursed their names, but nothing more. They, he figured, would be left behind him.\n\nThere was a river that separated the nation of Komi from the Tsarists in Vyatka, and he figured it his best option of escaping. So he convinced the local fisherman to lend him a boat. Just a simple crossing, he said, then it would be returned to him. That night, as he carefully walked through the grass and to the border separating him from life and death, Voznesensky felt like something was off. Something was different in the air that night than the one before it- but he had no time to think on it.\n\nInstead, he got on the boat, and began to paddle to the other side. It brought him some peace of it, the simplicity of it. A simplicity that he, unfortunately, could not take in for long.\n\nGunfire ripped holes into his body from behind, as they pierced the wooden structure of the boat. Voznesensky felt shock, pain, and terror - then he felt nothing, as his body wobbled, then collapsed into the azure blue river that began to be stained with the blood of an architect."

When Mikhail Suslov felt that something was wrong, then something was horrifically awry.\n\nIt was the dead of night, and Suslov met with his bodyguards. One man was to be the driver. The other two would sit in the back of the van and serve as muscle and firepower. Suslov would be hanging back as well, sufficiently armed for an extended firefight. As they got into the vehicle, he could feel the air tighten. Again, Suslov felt that something was wrong, but he made no emotion present. Merely warning his guards to keep their eyes and ears out - especially the driver. The goal was simple. Get to Vologda.\n\nYet only ten minutes after starting their journey, Suslov's suspicions were proven right. Bullets pierced the door to the back of the van, and he ducked his head down, grabbing tightly his rifle as one bodyguard rushed to the front. The driver kept his eyes on the road and began swerving left and right, and Suslov and his other bodyguard kicked open the back doors in tandem, revealing something they had to pay attention to immediately.\n\nTwo open-topped cars trailed past them, both armed with gunmen, both making holes in the van. Suslov immediately got on the floor, bringing up the iron sights and opening fire as his bodyguard was not so lucky, crying out in pain and collapsing in a huddled mess. The exchange went on for a few seconds more before Suslov heard his bodyguard at the front begin to open fire as well, and he could see the vehicle in front of him begin drifting sideways, the driver slumped back as it eventually slammed into the off-road.\n\nBut Suslov was not a lucky man. Even though he felt secure in victory, fear began to finally grip his heart when he heard flesh rip behind him. Letting go of his gun, Suslov began running to the driver's seat. The van bumped wildly against the road, and as he began forcing the dead man off the wheel, he felt the vehicle flip."

There hadn't been any particular reason for the choice; decisions tended to make themselves when one was mere minutes ahead of armed gunmen.\n\nIt wasn't fair. Not at all. He was going to be General Secretary... no, Paramount Leader! He was Marx and Lenin both, the man who would elevate the people to their rightful place in the world. First to the dictatorship of the proletarian; then to global revolution; then to the stars. It wasn't right for it to end like this. Zhdanov heard footsteps drawing closer outside his hiding place as the gunmen bounded up the stairs. There was nowhere else to run, now. Damn his instincts for driving him upwards. Something slammed against the door with terrific force. Zhdanov screamed. There was a pause, then a second blow that smashed the flimsy wood inwards and tore it from the hinges. A dark figure rounded the corner, lifted a pistol, and fired."
 komi_opposition.25.a: "It's not fair..."

 komi_opposition.26.t: "History Repeats"
 komi_opposition.26.d: "The truck jerked and rumbled as it made its way through the wooded road just outside Syktyvkar. Bukharina, like the rest of the Party members rising in the flatbed, was silent. There was little in their cause worth cheering for by that point. Even their armed escorts and abandoned them; nobody had time for a few failed ideologues.\n\nThen, there came the sound of a distant engine, growing closer and closer. It was deeper and louder than their beat-up old ZIS - and definitely faster. Bukharina's blood ran cold, and she leaned over to hammer on the top of the cab. "Faster, driver, faster! Someone's on our tail!"\n\n"I can't go any faster!" she hollered back. "This thing barely runs in the first place, ma'am!"\n\nJust as they were approaching a bend in the road ahead, one which might have bought them time to disembark and scatter, the pursuers came into sight. Roaring along in an armor-plated truck of American make, the fugitives could see their hatred in the cold professionalism with which they carried themselves. They had a light machine-gun mounted atop the cab, and before the ZIS could reach the bend, it opened fire.\n\nIn the moment before she was riddled with lead and toppled from the truck, Bukharina whispered an apology: to her Party, to her friends, and most of all to her father. Bukharin's dream died with her."
 komi_opposition.26.a: "As it should have long ago."

 komi_opposition.27.t: "There'll be Another Time..."
 komi_opposition.27.d: "Books, a stack of rubles, two pistols, ammunition, clothing, food, water. Gumilyov nodded to himself and slammed the truck of his car shut. Slumping into the driver's seat, he took a moment to reflect - and to indulge in a little self-pity.\n\nDamned snakes. How many times would the dream of Eurasia be deferred? He placed his face in his palms and sighed. Maybe he should have just tried to seize power years ago, or thrown his lot in with another faction under a false ideology. Now, the aspiring father of Eurasia was about to flee Syktyvkar in an old car with nothing but his most treasured possessions to call his own.\n\nGumilyov set his hand upon the wheel and breathed deep, taking a moment to pause and relax before exhaling. It wasn't over yet, he told himself. You're a scientist, Lev. This experiment didn't go according to plan, but that doesn't mean you can give up. Just go back to the drawing board... maybe head for Kazakhstan, see if anyone's looking for a Russian teacher or something down there. There'll be another time.\n\nHe slid his key into the ignition, turned it, and the car-bomb exploded."
 komi_opposition.27.a: "...or maybe not."

 komi_opposition.28.t: "Abandoned"
 komi_opposition.28.d: "Shafarevich stared glumly down at his clasped hands. His knees ached after kneeling for so long, but still he prayed. "God," he whispered, "Please, if you save me now, I swear that I shall never harm another living being again. I'll even take up the cloth. Wouldn't that please you, Lord? Wouldn't it?"\n\nThe monastery doors crashed open. No, it seemed, it wouldn't. Shafarevich closed his eyes, tried not to weep, then began to anyway. "Just get it over with, you bastards!" he yelled out, hands dropping to his sides.\n\nFootsteps drew close, soft on the carpet lining the aisle. A wire loop dropped around his neck and was pulled tight. His eyes bulged and his hands scrabbled feebly at whoever was behind him. His lips parted one final time, trying desperately to take a breath, and then his world plunged into darkness."
 komi_opposition.28.a: "God helps those who help themselves."

 komi_opposition.29.t: "Last Stand"
 komi_opposition.29.d: "Ivan Serov dashed down the alleyway, PPSh gripped tight in a white-knuckle grip. He didn't know this part of Syktyvkar at all - was he heading for safety, or to his death? Stumbling over a fallen trash can, he quickly regained his footing and came to a fork between the buildings that loomed around him. In the dead of night, he couldn't see whether they led into the darkness of a side road, or into dead ends. "I see him!" cried a voice from behind him, and a rifle boomed. Something made a deafening crack as it hit the bricks just above his head. Out of options, he took a gamble and bolted left.\n\nGlancing back at the way he'd come, he didn't see the dead end until he ran face-first into it, stumbling back with blood streaming from his temple. The world was spinning around him. He'd gambled - and he'd lost.\n\n"Fine," he growled, spitting upon the concrete. He lifted his PPSh and racked the bolt, teeth bared in a defiant grin. As the first two pursuers rounded the corner, he yelled his fury and squeezed down on the trigger as hard as he could. Gunfire filled the alleyway with a roar. Muzzle-flash illuminated his surroundings, dancing off the walls and his polished brass buttons. "You want me? Come and take me, you pigs! I'm Ivan fucking Serov!"\n\nWithin seconds, his drum magazine was empty. Tossing aside the submachine gun, Serov drew his Tokarev and began snapping off shots, not bothering to aim. He smiled with satisfaction as he saw two bodies lying in a bloody heap at the fork in the alleys. He laughed as the next assassins came into sight and began laying down fire. He hit one of them in the chest and saw the bastard fall, but then something sharp and hot struck him in the heart. Serov toppled back against the wall, pistol clattering to the ground. The most vicious man in Syktyvkar died with a manic grin on his face, knowing he was still the hardest bastard of them all."
 komi_opposition.29.a: "Tough son of a bitch."

 komi_opposition.30.t: "Nevermore"
 komi_opposition.30.d: "Sergey Taboritsky padded silently around the little chapel he had taken refuge in, trailing petrol from a canister in his hand. As it ran dry, he tossed it aside with the rest and stood before the altar, gazing up at the visage of Christ. Soon, the gold would melt, the icons would be cinders and he himself would be nothing more than ashes on the wind. Better that than to die at the hands of heathens and traitors.\n\nHe heard banging on the chapel door, and the distinct sound of an axe chopping into reinforced wood. It was time. He was ready.\n\nOpening the final canister, he lifted it high and poured the contents upon himself. He closed his eyes and let the cool fuel trickle down his face, seeping into his imperial uniform and saturating his hair. Dropping it to the floor, he picked up the lit candle that stood upon the altar and whispered one final prayer.\n\n"Tsarevich Alexei, forgive me. I wasn't strong enough. Please, return to your people someday."\n\nWith that, Taboritsky touched the candle to his oil-soaked chest, and was immediately transformed into a pillar of flame. He fell to his knees and stretched his arms outwards. The oil beneath him ignited, followed by the trails of it he had left all over the chapel. Cries of alarm came from the doorway as someone noticed the growing inferno. Taboritsky closed his eyes and gritted his teeth against the searing of his flesh, and perished in holy fire."
 komi_opposition.30.a: "You will not have me."

 komi_opposition.31.t: "Whatever Happened to the Lady of Steel?"
 komi_opposition.31.d: "Svetlana Stalina nodded to the men and women across the table, a half-smile on her lips. "We thank you for your proposition, and your generosity in hosting this meeting. My party will, of course, consider it." Rising up to offer a handshake, her mind is far away - there is always something else to be done for the PSD, another conference, another stack of paperwork, another rally to speak at. Even so, she makes sure to keep the smile on her face as she nods.\n\nShe knows, as she steps out of the doors of the conference hall and into the windy streets, that something is wrong. It's the instinct of a dog sensing a strangely hot and ashen wind upon its coat, or that of a bird hearing the crash of distant waves. Or perhaps it's the fact that the street is empty at what's supposed to be peak hour in the Capital, and the fact that there is a station wagon parked at the end of the street.\n\nSvetlana passes a binder to an aide, whispers, "Swordfish. Rendezvous Limestone.", and begins to walk hurriedly in the other direction. The rest of the staff whisper to themselves and disperse, scattering to the four winds. If something goes wrong, Stalina alone will suffer - her work will be preserved, and the PSD be given a fighting chance to escape ahead of the bullet.\n\nStalina focuses her breath, thinking only of the men and women who have served her. Every step she takes will buy her followers a little more time to safety. Eleven, twelve, thirteen. Footsteps follow behind her, in perfect lockstep with hers. She grits her teeth, paces. Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. She takes a sudden twist down the alleyway and runs.\n\nEighteen-nineteen-twenty-twentyone-twentytwo- as she is brought to the ground by policemen, she prays to a God she doesn't believe in that her friends, her party, made it out. That's all that matters, she thinks as the bag goes over her head. I bought them time. That's all that matters."
 komi_opposition.31.a: "I'm sorry I couldn't delay them more."

 komi_opposition.32.t: "Morozov Arrested"
 komi_opposition.32.d: "Ivan Morozov and his wife were packing their belongings, growing increasingly panicked. Morozov knew the government would be coming for him, and that he and his wife did not have long before they received a knock on their door. If they were smart, they could find safety in Vologda, or maybe somewhere to the east. Either way, they were not safe here and now.\n\nThey heard a loud banging come from the front door, "Ivan Morozov! We know you're in there!" Their time had run out.\n\n"Dear, they only want me, but just in case, exit through the back along with your bag. I don't wish to see you harmed. I'm sorry, I wish it didn't have to be this way," she nodded, and Morozov closed the bedroom door before making his way to the front door. Reluctantly, Morozov opened the door, and greeted the soldiers, "Gentlemen. I presume you wish to speak with me?"\n\n"Ivan Morozov, through your transgression of Article 39.B Subsection 5, you have broken the law. You are hereby under arrest," barked the soldier. Morozov simply nodded in response. There would be no negotiating with these men. He didn't resist as the soldiers cuffed him and started hauling him towards their vehicle. As Morozov was shoved into the back of the car, his mind was fixated on his wife, and he hoped that she would be safe."
 komi_opposition.32.a: "He will trouble us no more."

 komi_opposition.33.t: "Cut and Run"
 komi_opposition.33.d: "Voznesensky slammed the brakes on his car, screeching to a halt in the middle of a road in the backcountry of what used to be his homeland. With his tired eyes, he had failed to notice the barricade occupying the road before him. Concrete barriers manned by soldiers hunched down and armed with rifles blocked his path to freedom just 100 feet ahead of him.\n\nHe cursed himself. How had they known he was going this way? Had he not covered his tracks well enough?\n\nOne of the soldiers called out, cutting the tense silence and urging their former leader to slowly step out of his car. He complied, his shoes crunching the gravel beneath them as he slid out of the front seat and slowly began walking towards the barricade. Hands behind his head, the once proud defender of his country walked a death march toward the soldiers of those who had crushed his chance at freeing Komi.\n\nAbruptly, he felt a pain between his shoulder blades as he was shoved to the ground, colliding with the dirt in a daze. Discombobulated and unable to resist, he found his wrists shackled within seconds. Now covered in dust and bruised from the rocks and divots in his path, he was dragged off and thrown carelessly into the back of a truck. There was nothing he could do for Komi now, and so he fell asleep to the subtle purr of the engine."
 komi_opposition.33.a: "Off to prison, or worse?"

 komi_opposition.34.t: "Pursuing Suslov"
 komi_opposition.34.d: "The government's troops had found Suslov's location faster than expected, but it wouldn't matter. Suslov had his belongings packed into an unmarked van ready to leave, he just needed to burn some papers first.\n\nSuslov heard the firefight outside grow closer, and Suslov wished he had chosen a slightly more defensible safehouse, as he would have to hurry. He poured the flaming trashcan across his desk, and began heading towards his escape route. He could hear gunshots from both ends of the hallway, which wasn't a good sign. He entered the garage, and saw his men attempting to hold off several government soldiers.\n\nSuslov's bodyguard, one Maksim Gorilov, shielded Suslov as they made their way down the stairs, stepping over a man's corpse as they made their way to the van. Suslov's bodyguard got behind the wheel, while Suslov himself sat in the back of the van. Before Suslov could get settled, his bodyguard reversed out of the garage with astounding speed, but as he was shifting gears, a hail of bullets shattered the windshield, killing Maksim. Suslov tried to think of a new escape plan, but he couldn't think of anything realistic. The van sat helpless in the street as several soldiers forced open the doors, and hauled Suslov out into the open. Komi's Shadow Master had been captured."
 komi_opposition.34.a: "Let's see him plot his way out of a jail cell!"

 komi_opposition.35.t: "Ain't Too Proud to Hide"
 komi_opposition.35.d: "Zhdanov could only hear his heavy, labored breathing over the shouting of soldiers and revving of engines as he ran through the streets of Syktyvkar. He had heard them a fair distance away from the apartment he had been hiding out in since the change in government, it seemed the man hiding him had sold him out. Thus, he wriggled his way out of the building and into the street. The voices were getting louder, the hellhounds having narrowed down his position to this back alley.\n\n"Too goddamn old for this." Thought the aging fugitive as he gripped the lip of a dumpster, hauling himself in among the putrid garbage and letting the lid enclose him in darkness. It wasn't much of a hiding place, nor a dignified one, but Zhdanov wasn't a man who would pass off this kind of opportunity. Now, he could make out the words of the soldiers looking for him. Simple callouts, mostly, but they were getting closer.\n\nHe could hear them just outside his rotten hiding place. The footsteps paused. Zhdanov held his breath, but one sound betrayed him. As he had stiffened up, an empty can crunched under his elbow.\n\n"In there!" Shouted one of the soldiers, and the light came pouring back into the dumpster as the lid was thrown open. A hand gripped Zhdanov by the arm and he was hauled, screaming, out of the dumpster.\n\n"Fascist dogs! You can't do this! You've killed Russia!" Frothed Zhdanov to no avail, as he found himself once again in darkness. This time, he was in a truck, presumably bound for prison."
 komi_opposition.35.a: "Rotten luck."

 komi_opposition.36.t: "Gethsemane"
 komi_opposition.36.d: "Bukharina nods to the Unionist leadership. Twelve of them there are, firebrands whose passion survived even the Government's repressive measures, and they're absolutely devoted to the cause. She knows her cause can be entrusted with them. She knows she bears a giant target on her back.\n\nIt's always healthy, after all, to cultivate a succession plan. Where better to build a team - and a culture - than a garden?\n\nShe begins to speak. "Comrades, thank you for coming here. It's a difficult thing to wring time out of the working day, I know, and especially in these trying circumstances - I am thankful." The Unionists talk eagerly to her, and it is apparent that their intensity is borne of desperation: Bukharina spends some time dissecting the struggles of an underground union scene with them, talking of avoidance of police raids, the organization of mass education, and resilience in the face of oppression. As she ends, their shining faces give her a new measure of strength. Perhaps there's something worth fighting for in the world after all.\n\nImpulsively she reaches to embrace the nearest Unionist, a bear-hug that squeezes the breath from him. As she thanks him again for his time, she notes the trembling hands, the quavering breath, and she knows.\n\nAs she pulls back, the little garden comes alive with shouts and torchlights. Rifles are thrust in the air, and orders barked to get down on the ground, now, before armed force is authorized. The youngest of them, a woman of about twenty-five, pulls a sidearm, yelling insults of her own. Her hand twitches on the trigger -\n\nAnd Bukharina is by her side, soothing her, lowering the arm that holds the gun. "It's okay," she whispers. "Let them take me. What we build will long outlive us." Trembling, the woman puts down her weapon and watches Bukharina disappear in a swarm of black uniforms, leaving nothing behind but an awful silence."
 komi_opposition.36.a: "Who was it that betrayed her?"

 komi_opposition.37.t: "Passionately Hidden"
 komi_opposition.37.d: "Lev Gumilyov was already alerted to the intruders when his host gave the signal. He could hear most of what went on in the house below, and the new, male voices had tipped him off. The signal had just confirmed it. They were here. He briefly considered trying to escape. He could try to jump, he supposed, but from an attic above the fourth floor he'd be lucky if he could still walk afterwards, never mind run. And after making it down to the streets, then what? All his plans to get out of this mess relied on staying hidden for a month or two until the state of alertness had died down a bit.\n\n"We need to check the top floor too. You stay here"\n\nHe could make out their words clearly now. They were right below him. The latch up to the attic was well hidden. They might still miss it.\n\n"There is nothing here."\n\n"Keep searching. There should be another floor above us, I saw it from the street."\n\nIt was over then. Gumilyov briefly considered jumping after all, but decided against it. Instead, he found his pack of cigarettes, got one out and lit it. It didn't take long until the latch opened and the severe face of a young soldier popped up. Gumilyov threw him the packet. "Want a cigarette, young man? I was hoping you'd let me finish mine. It might be the last one I smoke for a while.""
 komi_opposition.37.a: "One cigarette can't hurt."

 komi_opposition.38.t: "At the Service"
 komi_opposition.38.d: "The Sunday service was the favorite part of Igor Shafarevich's new existence. Standing among his fellow believers, the familiar hustle and bustle of the opening services seemed to pull the uncertainty and fear from his body. The Slavonic chants drowned out all the unpleasantness of the recent times, and he could let his mind wander freely without fear of where it might go. It was also the closest he came to sharing in the brotherhood of the convent - he had been an important friend to the monastery, but he was no monk, and he was never going to be.\n\nSoon after the Outrenya gave way to the Divine Service, the rhythm of the church was broken by the unmistakable sound of automatic gunfire from outside. Soon after, the doors of the chapel swung open and four uniformed men, their faces hidden under makeshift masks, entered the room. Shafarevich couldn't bring himself to blame the brothers for moving out of the way of the intruders, opening a path straight to him. When the gunmen had secured him and were pulling him back out of the compound the monks seemed to find their courage. The brothers followed his captors, shouting their protests at the intrusion, but their threats and accusations didn't seem to faze the soldiers. His captors were content, it would appear, to commit a naked affront to God."

 komi_opposition.39.t: "Halfway to the Dvina"
 komi_opposition.39.d: ""Why is this car so damn cold?"\n\nIvan Serov half-muttered the question before pulling his coat a little closer and adjusting his light brimmed hat for the twentieth time in the last couple of minutes. He couldn't stop thinking about it. How wrong everything had gone all of a sudden. The warning signs he'd ignored, now all so clear looking back. Opportunities he'd let slip through his fingers, connections he'd missed...\n\n"Better get used to it, comrade. It'll be even colder on the barge this time of year."\n\nAt least Borisov had picked him a good driver. A genial boy, true socialist Russian. "I suppose it will. How far are we from the harbor?"\n\n"It will be another half hour at least, I have to drive carefully in this weather."\n\nThe harbor, then the barge, then north-west on the Dvina. He'd take his chances with the Front. He'd rebuild a small platform there and then, when the corruption and incompetence of the damned coup-makers had been exposed, he'd return and pick up where he left off. The ones who followed him before would follow again, and more would listen after seeing... Something felt strange.\n\n"Why are we stopping?"\n\n"There's something in the road", the driver answered. The "something" turned out to be another car blocking their way, surrounded by a handful of uniformed men. Already on their feet by the time they stopped, the men moved quickly towards them.\n\n"Get us out of here, boy! Whoever those men are, they're bad news for us!"\n\n"I'm sorry comrade. This the end of the road for me."\n\nIt didn't take the men long to pull him out of the car and tie up his hands and feet. Once bound, Serov couldn't put up much resistance as they threw in the back of their truck. It had been Borisov, the only one who knew the whole route. He promised himself he wouldn't forget."
 komi_opposition.39.a: "It had been Borisov."

 komi_opposition.40.d: "Taboritsky stepped out to the small shrine in his garden. He crossed himself before the shrine and closed his eyes. "In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." His mind shifted away from the world, calmed by the peace of God. Three times, he bowed, whispering, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."\n\nHe concluded the morning ritual in peace. When he turned back to his dacha, he heard approaching trucks. They stopped outside, the soldiers getting off. They entered his garden, searching for him. He felt his stomach turn as they came, instincts tugging at him to run. But he couldn't. They had caught him before he could think of any kind of escape.\n\nA sergeant informed him of his arrest while two soldiers took him by the arms. He did nothing. Later, he was brought into one of the trucks.\n\nHe appealed to his Lord, hoping for the tsarevich's intercession, who was sure to come.\n\n"Holy God, give me strength," he prayed, even when they nudged him to be quiet, "O God, cleanse me a sinner for I have done nothing good before Thee."\n\nWhen they finally reached the end, they marched him into the prison. He strained to hear God's reply as the soldiers continued with him. A deep yet comforting voice, which Taboritsky alone heard, came to his ear.\n\n"Be strong. Keep in thy mind the memory of my servant." And a familiar hand touched his shoulder just for a moment.\n\nHis body shivered with the spirit and the guards simply kept him moving until they brought him to an empty cell.\n\nBefore they pushed him in, they freed his hands. "Lord, receive my spirit," he finally said, crossing himself, after they shoved him in. He did not turn around to look at them go after they locked him up. Instead, his eyes were lifted up, seeing God smile upon him for his faith, with the tsarevich by his right hand and Saint Stephen at his left."

Despite it being a well-functioning heart of the Republic's body, it was filled to the brim with different shades of plaque clashing within. Among the zealous left and populist right laid the ruling Center coalition. The DSNP, SMR, and PSD were the three truly democratic parties in the Assembly. While they could not be more different in terms of their policy, all of them sat together and all of them hated the extremist wolves eyeing their seats hungrily from the shadows.\n\nOn the border between SMR and PSD seats sat two assembly members, looking a bit more alert than usual at the new selection of bills being brought up on the floor. From the SMR, there was a tall yet dainty looking woman; perhaps a bit older than she'd look. From the PSD, a stocky, brash, well-built young man sat next to her. They both thought similar things about the debate happening, listening intently for anything intolerable. As much as they hated the extremists, they loved the Republic, and loved her democracy.\n\nAfter a member of the Passionariyy went on an agitated, boisterous rant which disturbed half the assembly, the two eyed each other. "People like him would destroy our democracy", they both said in their glances, exchanging expressions. With a small, mutual nod, they introduced themselves to each other..."
komi_friendship.1.a: "A place for all of us."

komi_friendship.2.t: "A Friendly Debate"
komi_friendship.2.d: "While the Assembly was on a break from discussing policy, the now acquainted SMR Deputy, Elena Kozlova, and PSD Deputy, Yevgeny Yahontov, got to know each other decently well. They happened to agree on some aspects of policy together, despite having vast differences. Both of them held distaste for the far-left and far-right, and both of them were elected under similar circumstances, under similar stakes. They were becoming fast friends, despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle.\n\n"So, Yevgeny. Do you really think Miss Stalina's economic recovery plan is that different from Voznesensky's?"\n\n"Voznesensky is a left-wing populist who would let Zhdanov and his goons walk over him and influence his economic policy. Stalina would never let radical leftism taint her economic policy!"\n\nBoth of them gave a small chuckle, and continued debating. They all knew it wasn't serious, and it was more to gauge their individual abilities and comfort with each other. They did sit in the same caucus after all; it wouldn't hurt to know the ideals of your ally. As the assembly began to clear out for a break, the two remained behind, still sitting together and growing ever quieter.\n\n"Hey, Elena? Why are you working with me? Doesn't Morozov see Stalina and my party as borderline despotic?"\n\n"Well..." she said, after a pause..."
komi_friendship.2.a: ""That doesn't matter to me. We both stand for the Republic.""

komi_friendship.3.t: "Murmurs from the Assembly"
komi_friendship.3.d: "Today was not a very good day for the SMR. After the news of Voznesensky deciding to sideline Morozov's coalition, many assemblymen and women walked out of the building in protest and would only return for important policy decisions. But not Elena. Despite her being rather furious, she stood her ground with very few other SMR members, those who would hopefully make their voices heard.\n\n"That disgusting, apathetic, traitorous pig! Is Voznesensky abandoning the party that won the last election with him for those dirtbag Marxist-Leninist zealots?"\n\nYegveny sighed, understanding her concern. "I get that, I really do. I'm sure he would've done the same to us if we were in the SMR's place, but our caucus has bigger things to focus on right now. Almost the entire SMR delegation walking out shows the others that we do not stand in solidarity with each other, and it makes us look weak."\n\nElena, now looking physically furious, began to full-on debate Yevgeny. "How could you even support anything that conniving despot says? He would throw the entire caucus under the bus to drink champagne with his party and celebrate victory while working with the very forces which want to destroy us! Let me guess, your 'Woman of Steel' said it wasn't a big deal. That she would work with whatever the DSNP wants to keep her own party in the majority. We're supposed to stay true to our democratic principles!"\n\nThe rest of the Assembly looked on in intrigue, and Elena soon became part of the procession who left the building. Yevgeny sat there, somewhat upset and embarrassed, but silently believed that she would come to her senses. She, and the rest of the SMR, had to. For if they didn't, our democracy would die."
komi_friendship.3.a: "You are tearing us apart, Voznesensky!"

komi_friendship.4.t: "Burying the Hatchet"
komi_friendship.4.d: "Today, members of all three major democratic parties concluded a closed Assembly meeting to discuss issues which all parties faced. While the discussion was fierce and there were plenty of times where certain delegations almost stood up and left entirely, a sound conclusion was reached and a plan was formed for the survival of democracy in the upcoming election. Cheers, handshakes, and applause roared throughout the assembly; Elena and Yevgeny included.\n\n"I'm not too partial on Morozov's approach to reconciliation with the radicals and military policy."\n\n"And I'm not too happy about Stalina dodging questions about gerrymandering, but we're still here, no?"\n\nYevgeny nodded, and a smile formed on both of their faces. Their friendly debates and mutual agreements finally came in handy today. When discussing law and order policies, Elena's defense of PSD's actions managed to keep many from the SMR from walking out in protest. A mutual consensus was seemingly agreed on, one without any spoken word or initiative. The consensus of peace, the consensus of stability, and the consensus of holding true to what made our Republic special. We would never stoop to the level of the Tsar or the Marshal, we would always look to the people and the President.\n\nEven if compromises had to be made, our coalition and system would survive."
komi_friendship.4.a: "Despite their differences, they would stay the course."

komi_friendship.5.t: "Elena's Secret"
komi_friendship.5.d: "The Assembly was out today, after many in the government decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the overwhelming influence of the Left. Despite this, Elena remained in the halls and her office, sitting at her desk solemnly with a cup of tea poured. With a sigh, and a glance at her personal journal, she took a long sip and shakingly put the cup down.\n\n"What if they found out?" she thought to herself. "They'd refuse to work with you, and potentially the rest of the SMR. Maybe they'd witch hunt out anyone like you. It would all be for naught..."\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door, and a distant Yevgeny approaching her with some papers. In a panic, she knocked her diary to the floor, but accidentally spilled her tea along with it.\n\n"Goodness, are you okay?" Yevgeny said, walking toward her with caution.\n\n"No, Yevgeny. No I'm not."\n\nYevgeny helped Elena clean up, and then sat down with her. She spoke softly, and quietly, and said something which made his eyebrows raise.\n\n"I was... A follower of them before. I was an ardent socialist once. To think that if nutjobs like Zhdanov weren't in the party, I would've stayed. I'm just scared that someone will find out now that we're taking the fight to them."\n\nYevgeny, standing up, put his hand on Elena's shoulder supportively and smiled. "That's in the past now, no? We're fighting them now, and that's what matters. Who better to beat them than a former supporter?" She smiled, politely nodded, and thanked him. She was safe, despite her secrets, and so was her beloved Republic."
komi_friendship.5.a: "They would trust each other for the sake of democracy."

komi_friendship.6.t: "The Problem with Voznesensky"
komi_friendship.6.d: "The Assembly was out today, after many in the government decided to focus their efforts on holding the democratic Center at all costs. Reconciliations between parties and a strategy for election day were planned to happen tomorrow. Among other initiatives to strengthen the power of the Center came Elena and Yevgeny, as they were a few months ago, analyzing key issues together. Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n"The left is divided between 'reformist' and 'orthodox' lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus." Elena presented.\n\n"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well." Yevgeny added. "We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face."\n\n"Like what? What's an obstacle which could possibly be holding us back?" Elena eyed Yevgeny, and the two nodded at each other. They were ready for this. They've seen and known it since day one. And now, it was time to say it."
komi_friendship.6.a: ""Voznesensky. We must bury the rumors regarding his ties to the left.""

komi_friendship.7.t: "Yevgeny's Past"
komi_friendship.7.d: "The Assembly was out today after many in the government decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the overwhelming influence of the Right. Despite this, Yevgeny remained in his office, smoking a cigarette with the window open. He did not want to remember the documents he burned in his house today with the very same matches he used to light his cigarette. "Member of the Passionariyy Society. Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise." Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n"Hey, Yevgeny!" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. "I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. "Elena, I have to come clean. I was a card-carrying member of them once. The Passionariyy. To think I only spent some years off the street beating our political opponents... I don't want to be reminded of it, and I'm terrified of what they'd do to me if they found out."\n\nElena sighed, and sat down on his desk, with her arm extended to move his face to look at her. "Yevgeny, it's okay. I don't care what you did back then. You're a good person now, and you're going to help us put a nail in their coffin for good. I know it."\n\nHe smiled, exhaled camly, and thanked her. He was safe, despite his past, and so was his beloved Republic."
komi_friendship.7.a: "They would trust each other to curb radicalism."

komi_friendship.8.t: "Getting Behind Stalina"
komi_friendship.8.d: "After much debate in another closed meeting of the Assembly, many agreed that Stalina was the best shot at curbing radical leftist influence. A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic..."\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. "I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Morozov was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts. Especially not me."\n\nWith a sigh, she nodded. "I'll consider supporting her agenda in the future. I suppose I owe you for this one, friend.""
komi_friendship.8.a: "A bone-deep cut, but it will make us all stronger."

komi_friendship.9.t: "Burning Bridges"
komi_friendship.9.d: ""Heartless traitors!"\n\nYevgeny's words rang out with stinging barbs. "How dare you ignore our calls for unity and belief in Stalina to curb these dangerous radicals? Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. "I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors." With his statement, the Center remained quiet. The roar of celebration from the other sides, however..."
komi_friendship.9.a: "With thunderous applause."

komi_friendship.10.t: "The Fragile Alliance"
komi_friendship.10.d: "Elena and Yegveny exited energized from the final assembly meeting before the election preparations. The birds outside the capital were flying freely, sweeping low through the streets and high into the clouds; even amidst the rare crack of gunfire. Even with the intensity of Komi's political situation ramping up, both of the assembly members remained calm and collected. There would be a future for the people of Komi which wasn't one which would bend too far to either side.\n\n"So..." She began. "How does it feel to be headed into this election as one, partner?"\n\nYevgeny looked to his side, eyeing the smiling Elena next to him. "Partner? I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose."\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. "Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too." Elena nodded.\n\n"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through. As uncoordinated and bickering as the Center may be, they shall hold fast once again."
komi_friendship.10.a: "May the dance of democracy go smoothly."

komi_friendship.11.t: "The Rays of the Rising Star"
komi_friendship.11.d: "A special committee meeting was called this morning to discuss a mysterious figure on the left who may be rallying the entire party together over the radio. Both Elena and Yegveny were present; listening carefully, and getting ready to decide on a plan of action. Whoever this person was, they were becoming a clearer and more present threat to the now weakened right and fragile center.\n\n"We believe we may have a lead on who this figure is." The room goes silent, as another assemblyman passes around a dossier to the members of the meeting. "Bukharin's daughter. While heaven knows if her old man is still alive, the name alone carries intense weight for all of us; especially the voters."\n\nElena turns to Yevgeny, and she begins to whisper. "Stalina. Not yours, though. I've heard rumors of her. Didn't even think she was a real person..."\n\n"She's one of those populist types. If she comes around and charms over some of the left's voter base, a good fight will be had."\n\nWith a strict ahem from the orating assemblyman, the two quiet down and listen. "Nevertheless, around the rumors and speculation, we must crush this 'rising star' before they crush us. All in favor?""
komi_friendship.11.a: ""Aye.""

komi_friendship.12.t: "Input from the Assembly"
komi_friendship.12.d: "Amidst the candidates themselves voicing their platforms and debating the others, several party members have been allowed to take the stand and do the same. Some provided endorsements, some made rallying speeches, and some simply took the time to plead unity across the entirety of the Center. Elena and Yevgeny both gave two short speeches in support of their candidates, hoping to garner up some last minute support for both.\n\n"...I know Ivan personally. Deputy Morozov would be a safe, sane choice for a healthy democratic Komi, and perhaps with time, Russia as a whole. In a region and world so corrupted by undemocratic tyrants, the policies of Deputy Morozov would be the light shining against the darkness."\n\n"...I speak for many of us when I say that Stalina is a bulwark. She will protect your rights, your freedoms, and this country from radicals. No other candidate is as crucial to ensuring a safe and just democratic process as she is. I promise she will never let you, nor the people of Komi, down!"\n\nBoth finished their speeches to respective cheers and boos. As they both sat down in their seats, they gave each other the same look they once did a year ago. Whatever the result would be, they were in this together, and spoke their minds as anyone should."
komi_friendship.12.a: "Although they are not running, their opinions are just as valuable."
komi_friendship.12.b: "Popular sentiment seems to lie with Yevgeny's speech."
komi_friendship.12.c: "Elena sways hearts and minds towards Morozov."

komi_friendship.13.t: "The Dual Disappointment"
komi_friendship.13.d: ""Fucking Voznesensky..." Elena and Yevgeny both sighed, with a look of visual disappointment on their faces. Neither the clean record and charm of Morozov or the firebrand integrity of Stalina would defend the Center. She thought of Voznesensky as a closet communist. He thought of him as a misguided idealogue.\n\n"Now what?" Elena sighed, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. "Neither of us want to stand up for that racist bastard, but do we have another choice?"\n\n"I didn't come this far over a year to quit now. You don't care about how we got here, and neither do I. But this is the hand we've been dealt. There's too much at stake to not play it."\n\n"I... Suppose you're right. It's just disappointing to have it come down to this."\n\nThe two walked briskly in silence. Yevgeny's hands were sternly clasped in his pockets, gripping an anger that wasn't entirely there. For once, they were lost. Yet, despite it all, both of them seem to agree on one last thing..."
komi_friendship.13.a: ""It's not who we wanted, but who we will have to defend.""

komi_friendship.14.t: "Sighs from the PSD"
komi_friendship.14.d: ""You goddamn liberals!"\n\nYegveny sighed, with a look of visual disappointment on his face. Although Voznesensky was rightly defeated on the ballot to the elatement of both assembly members, Morozov's nomination deeply upset many in the PSD. Yevgeny was no different. Although he had pledged to defend democracy, was this really who he had to fight for? Was there no true other choice?\n\n"I know you're disappointed, Yevgeny. I can only imagine what you feel." Elena tried to console her colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on him. Much like the Woman of Steel herself, Yegveny was seemingly dead-set on his iron-willed ideals.\n\nThat is, until he stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep inhale, he released the tension in his body, and turned to face Elena. "It's no big deal. I know we were upset during the nomination, but I want to talk to some of them. Tell them that there's still hope. We may not be the happiest, but we're willing to hold on much the same. Even with Morozov."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, he crosses the busy street. Elena, with a small smile on her face, thinks about what the future may hold with this tenacity."
komi_friendship.14.a: "Tolerable, but only just."

komi_friendship.16.t: "Sighs from the SMR"
komi_friendship.16.d: ""You disgusting despots!"\n\nElena shouted, with a look of visual anger on her face. Although Voznesensky was rightly defeated on the ballot to the elatement of both assembly members, Stalina's nomination deeply upset many in the SMR. Elena was no different. Although she had pledged to defend democracy, was this really who she had to fight for? Was there no true other choice?\n\n"As upsetting as it may be, Stalina is the only shot we have at keeping the entire system alive; including the existence of your party." Yevgeny tried to console his colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on her. Idealistic to the end, much like Morozov himself. She was seemingly unmoving and uncompromising in her direction.\n\nThat is, until she stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep exhale, she released the tension in her body, and turned to face Yevgeny. "No matter, I suppose. Many in our delegation are... very clearly disappointed, but there's nothing they won't do to bring freedoms to the people of Komi. Including supporting Stalina."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, she crosses the busy street. Yevgeny, with a large grin appearing on his face, laughs happily to himself. Democracy is unbreakable, it seems."
komi_friendship.16.a: "Tolerable, but only just."

komi_friendship.17.t: "One Last Promise"
komi_friendship.17.d: "Tomorrow was the big day. Perhaps it wouldn't last, perhaps all of their work would burn down in flames. Perhaps Komi wasn't going to survive the cast of a ballot. Despite all of this, Elena and Yegveny sat down one last time together as allies. For all of their hard work, the last thing they wanted to do before it all went down was head for a drink.\n\n"Ready?"\n\n"Ready. Za zdorovye!" With the clink of two glasses, both assembly members take the first few sips of their drinks. Yevgeny coughs a bit, but with a cheerful expression. Elena simply sits calmly and downs her liquor, the bitterness trapping her tongue. Vodka, above all else, was more than just cheap entertainment and a staple of the Anarchic diet. It was a truth-sealer. "I didn't think we'd get this far without being shot, honestly."\n\n"Oh, nonsense! If you keep thinking like that, Elena, I'd be surprised if you don't drop dead from this vodka." Holding in their laughter, the two finally break and chuckle childishly. Perhaps in the past year, they would never expose this laid-back attitude to one another. Political enemies. PSD dog. SMR freeloader. All of that distrust and hatred disappeared with a few sips.\n\nAfter sitting silently for a while and drinking a bit more, Yevgeny pushes his drink to the side and faces his friend. "Hey, Elena? Promise me something over one more drink, eh?"\n\n"What's the matter? About to tell me your life story?"\n\n"Nah, this is way better. You and me, no matter what happens tomorrow... I want us to stick together. We came this far to protect our democracy. I don't want to jeer at your side of the aisle again."\n\nAlthough originally taken off guard, she nods intently and offers her hand. "Shake on it. For life." With the firm hold of their hands, they would form a spiritual bond which, perhaps, could survive long enough to see their future come to fruition. A future for all of us."
komi_friendship.17.a: "In vino veritas."

komi_friendship.18.t: "The Sunrise over Syktyvkar"
komi_friendship.18.d: "Syktyvkar was alive again. Locals rang out in jubilant cries of celebration, all members of the Center held a rallying speech in the Assembly, and the streets were pacified again. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the Center has held strong. Democracy has survived our fragile system, and has emerged stronger than ever before. The thought that this was a time for celebration was an understatement, Komi is essentially able to breathe once again.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like the day before, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red. It's a miracle you woke up today." Elena retorts. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and much work to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every heated debate led to this tranquility. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands. As they begin to head home, they only wish for a better tomorrow, one with the wounds of the past long gone."
komi_friendship.18.a: "Forever on the same team, even if not in name."

komi_friendship.19.t: "Our Extremely Fragile Democracy"
komi_friendship.19.d: "Syktyvkar was burning. It seems that the efforts to ensure that the Center would win the election were not as strong as once believed. Violence by extremists was reported six hours ago. Two hours ago, the first Zhdanov cocktail had been thrown. Now, the city streets of Syktyvkar became an all-out warzone, with different factions determined to wrestle control over the facilities of government. It seems that the worst case scenario has become reality; and now it was a time of survival.\n\nElena and Yevgeny were shocked, initially. How could all of their efforts have failed? Was the Center not united enough? Perhaps the extremists gained too much strength? Whatever the case was, both of them have been drafted to serve under an emergency government under [KOM.GetLeader]. Their goal was no longer to save democracy, but save Komi entirely from the ever-encroaching threat of radical takeover.\n\n"Yevgeny." Elena said, shakily gripping her hastily-issued pistol in its holster. "Is this a bad dream?"\n\nHis expression did not give her any condolences. Perhaps, behind his usual carefree and steely demeanor, he was terrified too. "The only way to wake up is to work together now. This time, for real. I know we can do it."\n\nPlacing a comforting hand on her shoulder, the two pass by some soldiers and walk into an emergency command room, ready to take action once more."
komi_friendship.19.a: "The strength of the Center is put to the test..."

komi_friendship.20.t: "Trial of the Counterrevolutionaries"
komi_friendship.20.d: "They woke up with bags around their head, and their hands tied with rope. All they felt was the tight grasp of somebody escorting them, and then forcing them to their knees. Elena and Yevgeny breathed heavily, as other people were forced to sit around them. The crackle of flames were present around them. What exactly happened? Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. "Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?"\n\n"Not Guilty!" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--"\n\n"GUILTY! Let them hang alongside their collaborationist brethren."\n\nDespite their cries, despite their physical resistance, this was the end. Elena and Yevgeny, with the strike of a gavel, now had their necks wrought around a noose. They had failed. Despite all of their promises, their work would be for naught with the simple collapse of a platform. Tears escaped Yevgeny's eyes. Elena remained silent. Both of them composed themselves, with a final exhale, before their lives were taken from them as swiftly as the floor below them dropped."
komi_friendship.20.a: "The revolution eternal, but at what cost?"

komi_friendship.21.t: "Refuge"
komi_friendship.21.d: ""I'm sorry."\n\nThose were the only words which escaped Elena's mouth. The defense was failing. Around them, their safehouse was burning. Their last, desperate attempt at freedom has gone awry. Rightist paramilitary groups were winning against the final garrison defending the would-be refugees. The hallways were filled with gunfire, screams, the crackling of wood. All that they loved, all that they fought for, was finally being eviscerated in front of their very eyes. Good men died to prevent this. Worse men fought to reduce it to ash.\n\nYevgeny coughed heavily, a stray bullet still lodged in his lung. The clenched hand grasping at his gunshot wound was becoming weaker by the second. He didn't believe that he would die here. Not in some run-down records room, slumped over against a table with one of his former enemies at his side. The pistol on the ground was empty, much like the air in his body. Perhaps, if there were still some bullets left, they could fight. One last, desperate clawing attempt for liberation. Perhaps they could end their life. Surely, whatever the fascists did to them would be worse than death.\n\n"We promised... And we failed."\n\nAs Yevgeny became closer to death, the door to the record room was slammed open with a kick. A member of the fascist paramilitary, with the raise of his PPSh, filled the duo with bullets and added to brass piles on the floor. After a quick look around the room, he looks down at the victims. Whoever they were then didn't matter now; Russia would move on without them. With that concluding thought, the soldier exits the room and ducks his head low to avoid the smoke around him."
komi_friendship.21.a: "It's never easy."

komi_friendship.22.t: "No More Shadows"
komi_friendship.22.d: "Syktyvkar was breathing again. Soldiers were putting down the last fringes of extremist resistance. Locals were rebuilding from the fighting. The President gave a heartfelt, rallying speech outside the Assembly early this morning. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the Center has survived the impossible. Democracy has survived a dangerous trial, and has emerged stronger than ever before.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like that day in the bar, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red. Although, perhaps we may need more spirits to deal with the previous chaos." Elena suggests. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's surviving street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and plenty of rebuilding to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every inch of ground held led to eternal peace. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands. As they begin to head home, they only wish for a better tomorrow, one with the wounds of the past long gone."

komi_friendship.23.t: "Into the Light"
komi_friendship.23.d: "Syktyvkar was breathing again. Soldiers were putting down the last fringes of extremist resistance. Locals were rebuilding from the fighting. Stalina was giving a national radio broadcast, denouncing the actions of the past few weeks. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the efforts of the PSD's reconstruction government have triumphed over all opposing forces. Stability would no longer be a word foreign to any citizen of Komi.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sat on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like that day in the bar, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red.

For all of us.\n\n"I never thought I would celebrate side-by-side with a liberal."\n\n"How about a fellow anti-extremist?" Elena replied. Yegveny nodded. "I can do that."\n\nKomi was once again safe, now under the paternal grip of Stalina to guide the nation. As the two began to walk home, Elena turned back to Yevgeny, but his eyes stayed the course forward. Despite their victory, she felt like something was lost. Something ate at her from the inside, a feeling which did not go away through her steps echoing off the pavement below her..."

 #SMR Elected 

 komi_SMR.1.t: "The Republic, Forward!"
 komi_SMR.1.d: "He had done it. It wasn't an insignificant effort by any means, requiring a fair amount of the typical political maneuvering - he had to muster up all the smarts that he could - but it was done. Ivan Pavlovich Morozov was going to be President of the Komi Republic.\n\nAn ordinary politician would pause here, anticipating the thousands that waited eagerly for an inspiring speech, taking the moment to enjoy the victory and soaking in the cheering crowd. But as he walked up the steps to deliver his inaugural speech, one idea stood clear in his brain, a refrain that repeated over and over again:\n\nThe Republic must only move forward, not backward.\n\nAs Morozov arrived at the lectern, the crowd cheered loudly, and he smiled widely before beginning. "Thank you all for electing me to serve as your President!" he opened. "I thank you all for placing your trust in me, and it is truly an honor to serve this great nation."\n\n"I will be frank with you," he said, his face becoming more serious. "The Republic has endured difficult times recently. The chaos and violence during our elections has threatened our democracy and disrupted our nation."\n\n"We will need to stabilize our country, build our economy, and prepare for the unpredictable times ahead." Morozov paused, and when he continued, his excitement was tangible. "But friends - we have an opportunity today to build something beautiful. Something that lasts."\n\n"There is much work to be done. I am under no illusions that this journey will be swift. Yet I am confident that we are up to the task! Together, we can build our nation - not the same as before, but even better! Let us all work together to advance the Republic forward!""
 komi_SMR.1.a: "Here, a hope begins to blossom."

 komi_SMR.2.t: "To Protect Us"
 komi_SMR.2.d: "As Svetlana Stalina sat on the stage, she relished every single moment of the ceremony. In a few minutes an old judge, the last tufts of his hair a mousy gray, would administer the oath, and make her position official. As she waited, many thoughts flew through her mind.\n\nMinister of Justice, S. Stalina. That certainly had a nice sound to it, and, given the current political situation, could not have come a single second sooner. Bombings from the communists, parades from the fascists - it seemed that everywhere you looked in the Republic, there was chaos, and the democracy itself was in peril.\n\nAs Minister of Justice, she would be tasked with fixing the situation and bringing the full force of the law against these criminals and terrorists. There would be no half-measures. Their democracy was too important to just let their enemies assassinate it in broad daylight. No, of course not. To protect their beautiful democracy, they needed to go after the people who would destroy it if given only the tiniest sliver of opportunity.\n\nThis really was the ideal position for her. Was there anyone else whose commitment to law, order, and justice matched her own? She had always wanted to defend the Republic's citizens - with her ascension to the position, she now had a chance to actually do it. She knew her enemies could hide no longer, and that was something she took some pleasure in.\n\n"Ms. Stalina? Do you agree to serve this Republic faithfully, executing all your duties to the best of your ability?"\n\nThat snapped her back to the present situation - she had gotten slightly carried away. Hurriedly, she composed herself, taking a couple of breaths, then answered, speaking with all the confidence that only she could have."
 komi_SMR.2.a: "Yes. I will."

 komi_SMR.3.t: "The Day of Reckoning"
 komi_SMR.3.d: "The legendary Sokolov was exceptionally good at what he did - and everyone in his town knew it. This was a professional man, always in a suit, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the tax code was always impressive. Many whispered that he was actually more familiar with those arcane rules and procedures than the people who wrote them. He was a blessing to the town, someone who removed the worries from their burdened hearts.\n\nIt also helped that the towns tax burden under his care was significantly lower than their neighbors - a fact that the KPK doubtless appreciated, and one that its rivals fumed at.\n\nBut the man himself was rather distant, someone remarkably private. Sokolov never answered questions directly and never revealed who his clients were. For that matter, no one had seen the inside of his office either. So when national police kicked down the door to his office at four in the morning, Sokolov himself seemed shocked that the jig was up.\n\n"Stanislav Sokolov Semyonovich," the policeman declared. "You are under arrest."\n\n"But... b-but you cant do this to me!" Sokolov argued meekly. "Im innocent!"\n\nThe reply was blunt. "You are not. For years you have dodged the law, helping the Communists to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. You were very successful at doing so - given that our calculations show that the Communists owe hundreds of thousands of rubles." The policeman smirked. "But no matter how you hide, you cant run away from justice forever."\n\nThe handcuffs slapped around his wrists, and the officer glowered over the accountant, smiling, as his arms were forced behind his back."
 komi_SMR.3.a: ""There are others like you. Tell us who they are. If you dont, well find them anyway.""

 komi_SMR.4.t: "Spirited Away"
 komi_SMR.4.d: "When Lev Gumilyov entered the National Assembly, he instinctively knew that something was wrong, because there was an awkward shuffling sound of lawmakers in their seats as politicians left and right turned to see him. It took him more than a few seconds to get his bearings and adjust himself to the present circumstances.\n\nNot wanting to jump to conclusions, Lev Gumilyov checked his watch. Yes, he wasn't imagining things: he was only five minutes late to another days work at the Assembly - yet his third of that great hall was conspicuously empty. From a quick scan of the individuals present, more than half of his party had apparently disappeared overnight, seemingly without any trace.\n\nHe knew that the actual explanation was unlikely to be pleasant. Despite this, Lev's face remained fixed in a neutral expression, looking forward intently, so as not to betray any reaction. Now wasn't the time to show weakness to the other parties, not when the party's position is so frail. But inside he was both nonplussed and furious. Questions ran through his head at a rapid tempo. How were they so quick? What had happened?\n\nThe rest of the day was spent finding the answers. From snatches of rumors, speaking to his contacts, and making a few calls, he discovered the truth, which was largely what he had expected. His missing friends and comrades had been forced to resign, and those who hadn't complied were arrested.\n\nThis was, without question, a large setback for the Passionariyy - but their mission wouldnt be stopped. However, it was true that overall the environment had become much more hostile - and much more aggressive. They'd need to lay low, rebuild, and find their way back, taking whatever measures necessary."
 komi_SMR.4.a: "And without question, hed need to find cleaner candidates next time."

 komi_SMR.5.t: "Your First Day"
 komi_SMR.5.d: "It had been a long, tiring day, and it wasn't even halfway done yet. The Republican Army was taking in a fresh batch of new recruits, putting them through all the paces, and giving them what they needed to know to win the battles certain to come.\n\nThe three tired twenty year-olds in green fatigues found lunch together in the mess hall and soon began absentmindedly talking with each other. There wasn't much talk before they soon learned they all came from rather varied backgrounds. Here was Vanya, the firstborn son of a family of eight. Beside him, Aleksei, a middle-class boy whose father was already in the army. Opposite them, Roman, the tallest of them, and from the city.\n\nIt was pleasant enough, chatting about simple things like that. But naturally, being the first day on the job for all of them, the conversation eventually shifted to matters of much higher relevance - namely, why they had decided to join the engineering corps of the Komi Republican Army.\n\n"Simple enough." Vanya said with a shrug. "I need the money. I heard they pay well, so all of this will be worth it." A hint of dourness appeared on his face. " I hope they actually pay us on time."\n\n"Its not just about that," Aleksei replied. "Training is important, too. If you want to get a good job out of the army, youre going to need all the certificates and what-have-you - and theyre offering to pay for it. Its a good deal."\n\nRoman wondered why the other two boys were so cynical, but he supposed there wasn't anything particularly wrong with what they thought. Nevertheless, he took the opportunity to push back on their mere material motivations. "Theres more to life than just money, you know. We may not be on the battlefield, but here we can be just as useful in serving our country!" The other two appeared to consider that, if only for a moment."
 komi_SMR.5.a: ""Maybe we can all benefit from this," Aleksei said. "Its win-win, no?""

 komi_SMR.6.t: "Master of Patronage"
 komi_SMR.6.d: "If there was an art to war, it was an ugly art indeed. The heaving tapestry of a parasite, whose survival rests on swallowing up everything good in the world. Here, in a crevice within Russias corpse, Mr Borisov makes the best of a bad situation, and thinks it best to not describe his class like that to his students. Zakhar Borisov, earnt his Masters in a time before the war. However, nations and people could come and go, but his faith in his students remained. He was here, in this damp classroom, of his own free will, for little financial gain, because he believed in them.\n\nBorisov learnt more from them than they could ever from him. The dimensions laid out in front of him, the colors of imagination dimmed by poor opportunities fascinated as much as they saddened. Whenever he thought with confidence on matters other than what he taught, they, in the unbridled variation of youth, would offer different perspectives. That intellectual invigoration was all he had in such impoverished times.\n\nThen, the world, in its unknowable movements, reared its head unexpectedly. No, something even more strange and random to Borisov: Government. Running to the door, he was met with a strange uniformed man with a stranger request, dressed in typical formalities. At the heart of it, however, was salvation. A formal request to contribute to writing a textbook in the relatively obscure field he taught in, and for a not inconsiderable sum of money. Zakhar Birosov, Master of a technical field few knew about, thought about how much more he could feed himself. Most of all, he thought of the equipment he could buy for his students, feeding the minds of the little birds in his academic nest."
 komi_SMR.6.a: "Do it for them."

 komi_SMR.7.t: "Almost There"
 komi_SMR.7.d: "In hindsight, Morozov thought to himself, it might've been better to use a bigger room. This was primarily because the compact room that Ivan called his office seemed to be bursting to the doors with journalists. Despite the limited space, there did seem to be genuine excitement around the main event of the day - the signing of the newly-passed National Reclamation Act.\n\nChief among the President's priorities was to unite the shattered nation; to put the pieces together and to fix what was broken. Naturally, he needed the support of the Assembly, and so a bill was drafted for that exact purpose.\n\nWith the SMR's victory in the previous elections, it went without saying that the bill was going to be passed - and even if they didn't have a majority, few who would disagree with the need to unite Russia. Nevertheless, with the paper resting in front of him, it felt like he was standing at a critical moment in history. The full weight of this task, this duty, was upon him at that minute, at that second.\n\nSoon he, Ivan Morozov, would be leading the reclamation of Russia.\n\nIt was a daunting task, to be certain - but this didn't scare him. Ivan had lived long enough to know not to be scared of the future. He was the man in charge, and was more than prepared for the road ahead.\n\nIvan's mind - and then his eyes - turned to the pen on his desk. He picked it up, signed the bill to the applause of his guests and the clicking of cameras, then flashed a wry smirk to the crowd as he spoke:\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen..."\n\nHe let the silence hang in the air a bit, letting the anticipation build."
 komi_SMR.7.a: ""Are you ready?""

 komi_SMR.8.t: "Rocket Show"
 komi_SMR.8.d: "For the young, the sands of time and history must seem invariably cruel. Just as the sweetness of progress, freedom, and the rising swell of passion graced them, death swelled up as well, invisible to their eyes but inevitable. Just as Komi regains its footing, it must wage war, racing against all enemies, and threaten to exhaust what little it has regained. It is a bitter pang, their new life dying so another may grow. As better as it might be, as it grows it is vulnerable. It may never be.\n\nHowever, one of the chemistry students argues, should this be seen with such despair? When we see explosives, do we picture a harsh, bitter, and permanent end? Or something to revel in, each detonation, under the scrutiny of hindsight, allowing for improvement? Is such growth, change, and evolution natural? Their trepidations waning somewhat, they find their new work somewhat more bearable.\n\nThe Smuta approaches, and all must do their part. The chemistry students are the new architects of war, taught how to fashion their understanding of the periodic table into explosive devices. All these young minds are funneled towards war. That blind Rosetta stone would grind down the unknowable hopes and dreams of youth hearts given half the chance. That is what stands at stake. The future, as mad as a polar moon and indecipherable. That all might end.\n\nSome fires do not live long enough to spread."
 komi_SMR.8.a: ""Are you ready?""

 komi_SMR.9.t: "Exploiting the Spoils"
 komi_SMR.9.d: "Factories, farms, mines, weapons, and many, many workers. Every day there were new reports that detailed the numerous economic resources acquired as Komi soldiers swept across West Russia. The volume of what was being recovered initially seemed overwhelming, and the task enormous - but they needed to focus.\n\nThe only thing worse than no resources was failing to employ what they gained.\n\nThere had been numerous meetings over the past few days discussing this exact situation - and assess how, exactly, to capitalize on all of these new resources that they were acquiring, be they materials, men, or weapons.\n\nThere were factories to repair and staff, mines to open and extract, and logistical networks to establish across all of the reclaimed territory. Which was to say nothing or hiring and organizing people to fill all of these new positions. In some cases the original workers would be around, but there were plenty that weren't.\n\nSo long as the Smuta continued onward, they needed to exploit every possible advantage they possessed, for their enemies certainly were. Even if they were not, something such as this could not be left to chance. Long into the night Morozov and his cabinet worked, hashing out the details while aides ensured they were written down and distributed.\n\nIt would be the first night of many more, but they weren't deterred. Morozov knew they would just work another. They would keep working until West Russia was under their control. Then, and only then, would he allow himself to rest."
 komi_SMR.9.a: "Only then, would he enjoy the fruits of their labor."

 komi_SMR.10.t: "Present and Future Pragmatism"
 komi_SMR.10.d: "The room applauded and cameras flashed as President Morozov signed the legislation in front of him, lifting it up and letting the cameras capture the moment. A wide smile was on his face, one that was echoed by everyone else who was present, especially his cabinet, his colleagues, and businessmen who stood behind him.\n\nThe Technical Development Act was a testament to the ability of the legislature to efficiently work during wartime, as well as recognizing the future challenges they would face. Reclaiming Russia was only the first step - for everyone knew that one day, Germany would be on the horizon, and Russia would be avenged.\n\nBut Germany was also far more advanced and powerful. they possessed technologies and weapons that they couldn't match right now. They were richer, better resourced, and their empire spanned continents.\n\nRussia would need to even the playing field, and the Act would allocate generous amounts of funding to begin that process. The dividends might not pay off for years, but when they did, it would place the Republic in a good place. If it would be enough remained a question, but such could be adjusted as time went on.\n\nIn the short-term, it would serve another purpose. Dispensing with the previously complicated process of private acquisition, a new streamlined process had been created, which would allow private sector investment and purchasing of industry and infrastructure that had been reclaimed.\n\nIt wasn't to say that all the red tape was gone - but the more egregious parts were, and now these industries could be put back to use as soon as possible. Morozov stood and shook hands with a few businessmen who would be making the first purchases, as a new phase in both the war and Republic began."

 komi_DSNP.1.t: "Fragments of a Speech"
 komi_DSNP.1.d: "Good afternoon colleagues, comrades, and patriots,\n\nThe people of the Russian nation have spoken. They have delivered us, delivered the DSNP, a victory. More than that, they have delivered us a resounding victory that is, as we speak, reverberating through the annals of history. None of this could have been accomplished without you. I deeply appreciate each and every person who gave me your support.\n\nI do not need to tell you the struggles we encountered during the campaign. Over the past few months, there was no shortage of skeptics and doubters who believed that our movement had reached its end, that the Russian people had tired of our administration. They spread a great number of falsehoods about myself and my character, telling wild and fantastical tales of corruption to hide their own inadequacies.\n\nBut I will not ruminate on these stories. Unlike some, I have tried to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that will not divide our country. I will continue this attitude into my second term as your democratically elected leader.\n\nOver the next few months, I vow to continue moving Russia forward. I will work to preserve the strength of our democracy against those who would seek to destroy it. I will continue the socialist reforms that have given our nation its strength and ensured that its benefits are felt by all. And above all else, my cabinet and I will work day and night to end the Second Smuta. We will not rest until all Russian people are strong, whole, and unified under one flag.\n\nThank you all for your time. There's much work to be done."
 komi_DSNP.1.a: "Voznesensky retains the people's support."

 komi_DSNP.2.t: "For the Party, For the Republic"
 komi_DSNP.2.d: "After the election, after the speeches and the parties, it was back to work for President Nikolai Voznesensky and his cabinet. There was hardly a moment's pause before he marched back into the cabinet room carrying his usual stack of papers.\n\n"So," said Voznesensky. "Let's talk about the health of our Republic. What are we doing after the chaos of the election?"\n\nFrom among the assembled ministers, Vyacheslav Malyshev cleared his throat. "Sir, my colleagues and I have been examining options. I've asked my distinguished colleague, Petro Grigorenko, Head of the Republican Army to—."\n\nBefore he could finish, Grigorenko stood up. The decorated officer, a one-time hero of the Red Army, looked across the assembled group with an expression of mild contempt. This cabinet knew nothing of the hard work needed to protect a nation. "President Voznesensky, let me be direct: It will take aggressive action to preserve this democratic nation and its people. The last election was a near disaster for all of us and let loose forces that could have easily sent this nation careening into the dustbin."\n\nThere was a pause as the group waited for Voznesensky's reaction. The President decided to let the breaches of protocol slide, gesturing for the man to continue.\n\n"I have asked my deputies to begin aggressive stabilization operations. We will be cracking down on extremist activity, looking to round up those who present an immediate threat to our Republic and its institutions. With any luck, we can mop up the fascists and traitors before they cause too much damage."\n\nVoznesensky sighed. The idealist in him wanted to believe that this was a gross overreaction, that Russia's enemies could be defeated in the marketplace of ideas. The last few years, however, had shown that approach to be a dead end."
 komi_DSNP.2.a: ""Proceed, Comrade Grigorenko.""

 komi_DSNP.3.t: "Laws of Mutual Benefits"
 komi_DSNP.3.d: "The room was small, though well-lite and reasonably furnished. The building itself was in a sparsely-populated part of the city, with little attention paid to it - or the people inside. Voznesensky knew his bodyguards were uncomfortable with the area - and leaving him alone to meet the occupants of the room. However, their concerns had been overruled.\n\nAll of the people he'd expected to meet were present. Their state of dress varied, some were in the attire of businessmen, others had less care for their appearance. He knew only a few of their names, but such wasn't necessary here. "Thank you for your attendance," he said, taking a seat at the head of the table.\n\nThe leadmost figure inclined his head. "And why are we here, Mr. President?" His title was said with just a hint of condescension.\n\nVoznesensky smiled thinly. "We all know how this game is played; the way things are coordinated. There are norms in place we are all aware of - ones that I will note, skirt the boundaries of the law. I believe this should be rectified."\n\nThere was a sense of concern now in the room - not alarm, not yet. The man nodded slowly. "By what means?"\n\n"I believe that certain affairs are a party's to decide," Voznesensky laced his fingers together, resting them on the table. "And the law is, in many respects, outdated. Some, let us say, 'liberalization' is in order, which I believe will be to the benefit of all parties. Something we can all support, no?"\n\nThe men in the room exchanged looks, spoke quiet words into the ears of others, but they were looking at him with renewed attention - and dare he think it - support. The leading man leaned forward, sitting straight and meeting Voznesensky's eyes."

 komi_DSNP.4.t: "A Noose Around the Neck"
 komi_DSNP.4.d: "Matvey sat in his office, in the headquarters of the Russian National Party, staring at the notice in his hand, which had been delivered by a smartly-dressed - and rather smug - police officer. No explanation as to the contents, merely that it was imperative that the party leadership read and review the notice as soon as possible.\n\nNaturally, he was going to read it before delivering the bad news - for he was certain it was bad. Nothing being sent directly from the government could be anything but.\n\nUnfortunately, it was worse than he could have expected.\n\nThere were two requests - or rather demands - enclosed within. The first was to immediately provide an accounting of all party spending, which they had to know was an unreasonable demand. Even if this wasn't clearly a thinly-veiled excuse for the government to find some irregularity and crack down, Matvey was uncertain if that information could even be provided. Which was to conveniently ignore that the leadership was simply not going to want to comply with that.\n\nYet the second demand was somehow worse - a demand to immediately divest from any businesses they had invested in, with an openly stated threat that non-compliance would result in state-seizure of said businesses. He'd done a few brief calculations - and while it wouldn't kill the party outright, it would practically ensure they couldn't grow. A slow death, where they'd wither in impotency.\n\nHe didn't know how he was going to share this with the party. What they could even do. Refuse? Grit their teeth and comply? He was glad he didn't have to make the hard decisions that were coming - all he knew was that this notice was a noose placed around their necks."

 komi_DSNP.5.d: "Ten years.\n\nTen years of service to the law, and providing justice to the people. Ten years of protecting them from extorting landlords, corrupt businessmen, and violent political intimidation. Ten years of work trying, in his own small way, to make Komi a better, safer, and fairer place for the working man to live.\n\nTen years, all for it to end in a single day.\n\nIn the back of his mind, he had wondered before if this day would come. Judges were controversial figures at best, and often ascribed as agents for political parties depending on their rulings, and he wasn't exactly blind to the fact that many of his rulings tended to fall against the side of capital. He would certainly consider himself sympathetic to the communists - but was protecting the common man not the sensible, fair stance for everyone?\n\nApparently not, at least for the government. Today had been his last working day, as when he'd exited the courthouse, a notice had been delivered to him. The contents were short and direct: It was an immediate termination, on the grounds of 'disgracing the office,' with thinly-veiled insinuations that he had abused his power to benefit the communists. No recourse, no opportunity to argue his case. He was finished.\n\nThe sheer injustice of it all made him fume. There had been certain lines before; certain norms that weren't tampered with - but apparently the government had decided nothing could be risked. He feared the Republic was going down a dark path now, one where the wealthy and powerful would be able to abuse their influence, and strangle the people. He had thought himself one of the few safeguards the people had."

However, there had been a few things that Lev had noticed over the past few trips, and he finally decided to vocalize them.\n\n"Does it seem that things are...quieter?"\n\nHis friends seemed to think about it. "Safer, you mean? Now that you mention it..." Roksana mused, pausing briefly, her features adopting a puzzled expression, as if coming to a realization. "Yeah. It's weird."\n\n"Think the communists did something?" Alexei asked, kicking a stone in his path. The district they lived in, and walked everyday, was known to be a stronghold of the KPK. It was the communists that ran things here, so it would make sense if they'd been behind this. "I've not heard anything."\n\n"Not sure, but I don't think it's just here," Lev said. "Talked with a few people in class, and they've all noticed the same thing. Not complaining, but I am curious."\n\nRoksana shrugged her shoulders. "I guess. I'm just glad they figured something out. Take bets on how long it lasts?"\n\n"A month, tops," Alexei chuckled, and all of them seemed to take similar amusement in the joke. "Maybe two, if we're really lucky." Lev smirked at his friend, wondering if he could get something out of this besides bragging rights."

 komi_DSNP.7.d: "Suslov sat in his home, watching as the evening light dimmed and night took over. It was quiet, an ideal time to just be alone with his thoughts, of which there were many tonight. An unopened, unmarked envelope rested on the coffee table in front of him. He didn't intend on opening it; he knew what it contained. He'd received no fewer than three such letters throughout the day of the same event - though he'd heard rumors of something like this being planned before today.\n\nHe'd wondered if they would do it. Now he had his answer. Valentin Varrenikov and Svetlana Bukharina, arrested on charges of terrorism. He personally could not help but find it darkly amusing that anyone could consider Bukharina a hardened terrorist. Please. The very idea was absurd. It was a pretext so thin it was to be transparent. Anyone could see this for what it was.\n\nBut of course, it wasn't about anything resembling 'plausible.' The charges were a fabrication; a front; a mechanism for delivering a message to certain people. In particular, people like him who represented one of the anti-electoralist parties. Historically, the government had accepted their presence, despite their hostility.\n\nIt seemed policy had changed. They were a liability now. Today it was Varrenikov and Bukharina, tomorrow it might not be him, but he would have to be blind to not see where this was leading. One by one, they would be picked off as the government purged the political spectrum of those who threatened their power.\n\nHypocrites, but hypocrisy was an expected virtue among the capitalist class. Not worth becoming offended over, it was their nature, just as natural to them as breathing. Nonetheless, this presented an issue for him. What concerned him was the inconvenient, unavoidable fact that this was not going to be an easy problem to get around."

 komi_DSNP.8.d: "Igor returned from a successful jaunt in the woods, a good three hours spent doing what he did best, which was to hunt the poor hapless animals who couldn't see his bullet coming. When he pushed open the creaky wooden door to enter the lodge of the local hunter's association, however, what he found there surprised him. It was a man in full military uniform standing confidently just behind the door.\n\nThe hunter was surprised, but then spoke first, a tension clear in his voice. "Sir: with all due respect, you know that this is an association for civilians, right? I'm sure you're busy preparing for the war, anyway."\n\n"Relax. I'm not here to take anything." The military man chuckled slightly. "Instead, I have an offer."\n\n"I see your hunt was rather successful. It is clear that you - and the rest of your society - are very accomplished sharpshooters. Your skills will be of great use in the reclamation of Russia."\n\nIgor remained rather nonplussed through this speech, but when the military man pulled a large wad of bills from his pocket, that caught his attention.\n\nSmiling, the recruiter continued. "This is only the signing bonus. I can assure you that there is more, too - we will help you and your group with your healthcare, and we offer a pension."\n\nThere was a short pause in the air. "Let me think about this," Igor said. "It is a large change from my previous life." Slightly disappointed the recruiter turned and left, but not before offering some final words."

 komi_DSNP.9.d: "When they met after the day's training their spirits were high. The conversations were flowing again - the smooth talk that only those who have fought together can engage in - and the youngest among the (now former) militiamen spoke about what was on everyone's minds.\n\n"Wow. Their manpower shortage is pretty terrible, right?"\n\nThe Republican Army, in a quest to improve the numbers of their relatively small force, decided to offer a blanket amnesty to various extremist groups on one condition - service.\n\nThis particular group had, like many other Eurasianist groups, committed many crimes, some of which were more serious than others. All of their past deeds, then, were completely set aside: they were in the army now, and that didn't matter.\n\nA tall slim man spoke. "I'm surprised they put us all together," he said. "Not saying it's a bad thing, but I thought they'd try to split us up."\n\n"No, I agree," said another shorter man. "There are many familiar faces in the regiment. But they didn't put boss in command - I think he's somewhere else."\n\nThe youngest spoke up again. "Seems like everyone just wants to come clean, now. It's a decent deal. I'm not surprised they all took it." The group nodded: that was probably the most likely reason. Then the tall slim man took out a cigarette, lit it, and relaxed."

 komi_DSNP.10.t: "A Predictable Victory"
 komi_DSNP.10.d: "The President's office was unusually sterile in the previously hectic city of Syktyvkar. At the head of a large desk, President Vozenesensky sat staring at a single piece of paper on his otherwise clear desk. Standing beside him was prime minister Rodionov. In his hand shook a pen, looking anxiously at the paper in front of him. While the law in front of him was not particularly revolutionary, what it signified was frightening.\n\nWith a few flicks of the wrist, he scrawled his name on the piece of paper. The action lasted only a moment and with it, the deed was done. As he watched the ink dry, his mind began to race with thoughts of the consequences. Soon new chaos would befall Russia, including the state which he was elected to lead. Destruction was not an impossibility, but neither was unification and victory.\n\nA sigh escaped the President. "So it has been done. The National Reclamation Act has been signed." All that is left is to prepare for the troubles ahead."\n\nRodionov patted his soldier. "Indeed, but we will get through this. You've maintained this state through so much in the past, what's a little war and diplomacy?" A chuckle escaped the Prime Minister.\n\nVozenesensky could only look up from his desk and towards the window. If only he shared the same optimism as his friend. Yet, with so much he had seen in his time, he knew even in victory there would be losses, and he did not know how much more he could bear."
 komi_DSNP.10.a: "If only the future was not so enigmatic."

 komi_DSNP.11.t: "Coming Duties"
 komi_DSNP.11.d: "For a rare moment, the Republic of Komi was quiet, or at least as soft as the statelet could be. Gunfire had slowly disappeared from Syktyvkar and the countryside seemed calmer, even with the occasional bombing. Yet this peace was not long. For just beyond the momentary calm, a storm awaited on the border, ready to cross over and wreak havoc on the state.\n\nThis state was on the mind of Naum and Leonid as they took their daily smoke break in the little town of Vilegodsk. The two police officers had enjoyed an easy life in their little town, away from the chaos of the city. For as much as they valued their lives though, they both knew it could not last forever.\n\nLeonid took a deep drag of a cigarette before turning to his colleague. "So, about these new duties, when are we supposed to get training?"\n\nHis friend turned to him. "Not much longer, probably tomorrow. I heard they were just in Shirokii Priluk. Although with the uncertainty of war, who knows if we'll even get the chance?"\n\nWith haste, Leonid took another drag. "I sure hope so. I just want to keep the town safe, that's why I joined after all. I don't know what I'd do if something major happened, why I'd just-"\n\nNaum cut his friend off and grabbed his shoulder. "Hey, don't worry about it. We'll get through it. Civil defense duties aren't even frontline work necessarily. We could be assigned as glorified traffic cops for all we know."\n\nA faint smile appeared on Leonid's face. He knew his friend was right. Looking at his watch, he saw that their break was over. Yet as he walked back to his post, Leonid remained anxious, knowing that the long-held peace in his life was on borrowed time."
 komi_DSNP.11.a: "Peace, so long as you can keep it."

 komi_DSNP.12.t: "On the Other Front"
 komi_DSNP.12.d: "Free time was a luxury these days.\n\nEver since the Smuta had begun in earnest, Voznesensky had found that there was barely even a few minutes where he was free. Be it continuous reports from the frontlines, meetings, strategy discussions, and the other responsibility of leading a nation, there was almost no time for himself. Not anymore, and he didn't think it would change until the war was over.\n\nThough at least for now, there was a slight reprieve.\n\nVoznesensky figured it was only a matter of time before this changed. And still, even with this reprieve, work dominated his thoughts; one issue in particular had grown in concern over the past few days. Morale on the homefront could be fickle, and there were signs that it was wavering, and subsequently, needed to be addressed.\n\nHis advisors were aware of this, but he feared that if it wasn't pressing like a hundred other things, it would fall to the wayside until it was too late. As such, their ideas proposed had been...lacking.\n\nHe didn't want to rely solely on propaganda, overreliance on that was a bad thing, in his experience. When it came to messaging, people needed to believe in the messenger, just as much as the message. A personal touch, perhaps; authenticity was one of the most potent elements in any successful messaging campaign. The President needed to be seen, to meet with the newly liberated peoples, and rally the troops.\n\nIf the people at home saw their leader personally doing the work, they would believe in him. In war, belief was something that was valuable. Yes, there was something here. On a scrap of paper, he wrote down a few notes to save for later. His advisors would be able to refine this further."
 komi_DSNP.12.a: "For this war was one they were going to win."

 komi_DSNP.13.t: "Spoils to the Liberated"
 komi_DSNP.13.d: "Voznesensky smiled as the press filed into the auditorium, speaking on the sidelines as he waited for everyone to move into their positions. After a few minutes, it was time and he took a seat at the table, with the legislation resting in front of him. Behind him stood members of the party, several military officials, and a few workers from newly liberated territories.\n\nThe Industrial Distribution Act. A piece of legislation that he was fairly confident wouldn't have been able to be passed in peacetime - at least not without controversy and a lot more debate. Now, with a stroke of a pen, the workers of the newly reclaimed territories would be given full collective ownership of their workplaces - with a few conditions.\n\nThere would need to be at least fifty workers for this to take effect, though in practice Voznesensky expected there'd be some exceptions for factories near that threshold. It remained to be seen, but it had been received quite positively by the workers, even if some of the more conservative politicians grumbled at the so-called 'communist' legislation.\n\nIn truth, the move was just as pragmatic, as it was ideological. They were taking territories with significantly different economic models, and there was no faster way to break the economic norms than democratizing as much of the economy as soon as possible. Voznesensky didn't really consider it deceptive - as far as he was concerned, everyone got what they wanted.\n\nWhen the pen was put to paper, the Act was signed into law, to the applause of those present. With a wide smile on his face, he shook the hands of the workers for the cameras, and departed only a few minutes later. An important step had been taken, but there remained more work to do."

 #PSD Elected

 komi_PSD.1.t: "All Russia's Ambition"
 komi_PSD.1.d: "Stalina was not a superstitious woman, but it was sometimes difficult to ward off such baseless, irrational thoughts, no matter what one's actual beliefs were. She certainly knew better than to ascribe omens to completely random things like weather - but as she prepared to step onto the balcony of the Presidential Palace to give her inaugural address, she felt some small, silly measure of optimism.\n\nIt was a beautiful day.\n\nIndeed, it likely could not have been a more pleasant atmosphere. The sun was out, but not blinding. The wind was refreshing, but not overpowering. The temperature was noticeable, but in a pleasant way. It of course meant nothing - but it almost felt like a sign of a newer, better era. Even though she knew what would have to come next.\n\nThe Republic's problems were far from over. Extremism and violence still bubbled under the surface, and would need to be dealt with. Which was to say nothing of the surrounding statelets who were eyeing them closely, as rumors of war circulated. It was not a surprise - all saw the unification of the Motherland as the greatest mission - herself no exception. Today was the first step in a new era for the Republic - and for Russia.\n\nAdorned in attire befitting a head of state, Stalina walked out onto the Presidential Palace Balcony, to the cheers of the people. Below her, hundreds looked up in hope and adoration; men and women who had placed their trust in one who represented order, stability, and moderation from the forces that threatened to tear the Republic apart. It was for them she would work, and it was for them she would not fail.\n\nAs the crowd quieted, she rested her hands atop the sides of the podium, and began to speak."
 komi_PSD.1.a: ""Citizens of the Republic, it is an honor to speak as your next President...""

 komi_PSD.2.t: "The Temporary Triumph of Democracy"
 komi_PSD.2.d: "Meetings in the middle of the night were not something that Stalina wanted to make a regular occurrence - but if the problems of the nation demanded it, it was the price she would pay. Petro Grigorenko, Georgy Shakhnazarov, and several police commissioners were all in attendance; all to discuss one singular topic: How to save the Republic.\n\nStalina turned her attention to the nearest police commissioner - Leonid. "Summarize your report of election day. The same one you gave me."\n\nHe nodded once, and cleared his throat. "Yes, Madam President. Upon a review of the incident reports on the day of the election, we confirmed multiple instances of voter intimidation, voting infrastructure sabotage, and even several armed clashes between extremist paramilitaries. To say that there was election interference would be an understatement."\n\nThere was a long pause. "If the violence had been more widespread, or God forbid, candidates were assassinated, I do not think it an exaggeration to say that democracy would have come to an end."\n\n"Thank you, Leonid," Stalina said once he finished, before turning her attention to the rest of the room. "The issue before us is clear. Democracy triumphed this time, but if the status quo is maintained, we may not be so lucky. It is clear that there are certain elements who have no interest in preserving the Republic, and its democratic institutions. My predecessor was content to let this fester." She made sure to meet each of their eyes, her voice steeled. "I will not make the same mistake. Democracy will be secured - and those that threaten it expunged from the nation."\n\nShe clasped her hands behind her back. "We have work to do, gentlemen. Let's not delay.""

 komi_PSD.3.d: "Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov stared at the notice in his hand, reading it a second time, as conflicting emotions of disbelief, anger, and fear all raged within him. He finally looked up, managing to find his voice. "This is a joke, right?"\n\n"I believe the seal speaks for itself," the Komi Republican Army Major answered, a blocky man, with a blocky face - but expressive enough to show his barely hidden mirth at the situation. "Per the directive of the President of the Komi Republic, Radio Free Syktyvkar is henceforth under placed the purview of the administration, with all current staff relieved of their duties."\n\nNationalization. They were fucking nationalizing the station - and firing all of them at the same time. He was almost - almost - impressed that Stalina had the spine to actually go through with it. It was an act of naked political repression, retribution, and abuse - but there wasn't a lot they could do about it, and Stalina definitely knew it.\n\nIt was a very risky play of course - doing this in the territory of the Passionariyy would cause a stir, and the fact that Stalina had apparently decided that was possible... well, the group of soldiers that were accompanying the major spoke for themselves. "What are we supposed to do now?" He finally asked. "We're all out of jobs because of you."\n\n"That," the major said dryly. "Is not our problem. But I wouldn't worry," he suddenly smiled. "I'm sure that you'll be able to find something else. Cockroaches always find another rock to scurry under when exposed." With that, he turned away, and marched out with the soldiers, leaving Ivan alone to fume.\n\nThere would be some kind of consequence for this - but for now, all he could do was stew in the indignity of it all. Ivan turned to go back inside, uncertain how he was going to break the news to his colleagues."

 komi_PSD.4.t: "Dares and Deniability"
 komi_PSD.4.d: "Control and power were two tools one needed when dealing with the politically inconvenient, and Andrei Zhdanov and Igor Shafarevich both certainly qualified. Both men had been seated, and were waiting for her arrival. She only made them wait a few minutes. Short enough that they would not become irritated, but long enough that her entrance would make a point - That this was her domain, not theirs.\n\nNonetheless, she greeted them with a smile as she sat opposite them. "Gentlemen, thank you for your punctuality. There are several developments that I believe you will want to be appraised of. Agafia? Folder one, please." Her aide handed the folder, and Stalina began the meeting.\n\nBeginning with the first folder, she methodically moved through them - each containing arrest warrants for various paramilitary figures of far right and left persuasions, complete with indisputable evidence of corruption, blackmail, and other crimes. As she spoke, she watched them carefully.\n\nBoth men were growing more uncomfortable, as each knew this was an explicit attack on their supporters - but also being constrained by the fact that they, supposedly, had no connection to any such criminals. They might be wondering if this was going to end in their arrest, but as much as she'd like to remove them both, unfortunately, their plausible deniability was too strong.\n\nHowever, that had its own uses. When she was finished, she addressed them once again. "As you can see, gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that the extremist threat to the Republic has been thoroughly dealt with." Their expressions slowly changed, as the realization of how she had trapped them became clear.\n\nStalina smiled. "The Republic appreciates your present, and continued cooperation should any such threats surface.""

The thunderous boom of tank fire could be heard in the distance, as well as sporadic gunfire throughout the city.\n\nIt seemed like a nightmare. Everyone knew that Stalina considered the Passionariyy as a threat to the stability of the Republic - but there had always been an uneasy truce in place. No one had ever considered that such a line would be crossed; no one had expected anyone would dare.\n\nYet dare, Stalina had.\n\nThe Republican Army, firing on Republican citizens, all in the name of fighting extremism. Larissa watched as a nearby building flying the Passionariyy banner was shelled into rubble, just before Komi soldiers swearmed the street, and began storming anywhere they suspected enemy soldiers were hiding.\n\nShe quickly hid in a closet, and hugged her knees, just waiting for it to be over. And gradually, the sounds of fighting grew more distant, the shelling gradually ceasing, and the booming of tanks falling silent. In just three hours, the Republican Army secured Syktyvkar, and in the end, every element of resistance was exterminated or driven out.\n\nThe extremist threat, as would be declared in the following days, had been defeated - But it was a victory that even supporters of the President looked upon with unease. Yes, the Passionariyy had been a problem; some might even say a threat to the stability of the Republic, but soldiers' bullets had still landed in citizen's bodies. The precedent had been set, and there was no going back."

 komi_PSD.6.d: "News-worthy events in Komi were not the most common thing - at least when it came to the legislature. Rare were legislative functions as banal as bills and acts that which captured the attention of the media and general public - but there were exceptions to everything, and this was one such instance.\n\nMedia outlets, local journalists, and a few prominent community figures were all in attendance as Stalina prepared to sign the National Reclamation Act into law, as she was surrounded by her advisors and several PSD members. It was the perfect kind of event for an administration - a useful mixture of impact, propaganda, and authenticity.\n\nOf course, this was not exactly some great triumph of statesmanship - most everyone expected the Act to pass, for it embodied a goal that even those who disagreed with the PSD could get behind. All the same, the scale, importance, and historical weight of the Act could not be understated.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, preparations for the reclamation, and reunification of Russia, would begin. How could she not be satisfied that this had been achieved, no matter how 'assured' it had been?\n\nWith her signature, the Act became law. The people in attendance broke into applause, and she stood, giving the expected handshakes, smiles for the camera, and performed obligatory rounds of thanks and pandering to the attendees. She'd have to give a few soundbites to some of the journalists as well, but she didn't mind it. Some showmanship was required, especially in a democracy, and if this was the price she'd need to endure to ensure that Russia could be unified? Well, it was a very small one to pay. What mattered was that it was done."
 komi_PSD.6.a: "And soon, all Russia would be united."

 komi_PSD.7.t: "The Winds of War"
 komi_PSD.7.d: "Leadership was just as much about optics as it was about substance. All the words in the world were insufficient in the face of action - a fact she never forgot. It was why a visit to a military base - not even an important one, just one of the many training grounds in the Republic, was more than just an inspection to Stalina. It was a means of demonstrating this fight was just as much hers, as it was theirs. There was certainly an optical calculation here - not even she would deny it.\n\nBut one could not say it was effective - or unjustified.\n\nThe soldiers stood sharply at attention as she walked past their lines, her face stern; an aura of command she possessed intensified by her decision to don military-style clothing of her own. Most of the soldiers were young men; boys really, who would soon bleed and die for Russia. Yet each one worked to control himself, and hide his nervousness.\n\nIt was endearing, and she decided to put them at ease with a friendly smile. That seemed to help. She was here for other reasons as well - a demonstration of a new submachine gun was planned. After a brief field test, she fired the weapon herself. She was not too familiar with such weapons - but it did appear to be perfectly serviceable.\n\nIt was soon time for her to leave - there were other duties that awaited, though not before she gave some parting words for the soldiers assembled. After a few moments of pause, she began. "Each of you have been preparing, and readying yourselves for what is coming. There are many threats that lie beyond our borders; parasites, extremists, and tyrants which leech off Russia."\n\n"The war that is coming will not be easy. It will not be without sacrifice." She continued, while meeting their eyes unflinchingly. "However, I am certain of one thing.""
 komi_PSD.7.a: ""After what I have seen today - we are ready to unite Russia under the Republic.""

 komi_PSD.8.t: "Qualities of Life"
 komi_PSD.8.d: "There was, Stalina thought, something personally satisfying about conducting unplanned visits. It was likely going to take some time for everyone to get used to the fact that this was something she would do on occasion - even if it was on what could very well be the front lines soon.\n\nThe outpost was a small one, containing only an old anti-aircraft battery being maintained along the Vyatka River, but it nonetheless was going to be along an important line of control when the fighting reached here. To their credit, the soldiers had quickly scrambled to attention, and while the ranking officer was surprised, he displayed admirable professionalism as he showed her around the site.\n\nShe mostly nodded along, interjecting in a few places concerning the state of defenses - but for the most part it appeared that the men were prepared. Instead, she was focused on several minor elements that had caught her attention. One of which she finally pointed out to the officer. "I haven't seen many bandages," she indicated a few sparse cabinets in an outpost. "Why have they not been replenished?"\n\nThe officer shifted uncomfortably. "No replacements available, Madam President. We have to make do with what we have, not a priority for-"\n\n"Make it one," she told him. "I need soldiers on the front lines who don't have to fear bleeding out if they're injured. Put in the requisition, along with any other minor materials you need. I'll see it personally approved."\n\nThe officer nodded emphatically. "I'll see to it immediately." Stalina inclined her head in return, and gestured for him to finish his tour for her impromptu visit. It would take a few days for the materials to arrive - but when they did, she hoped the men would be grateful for the supplies, such as it was."
 komi_PSD.8.a: "Such was deserved, for the men who would fight and die for Russia."

 komi_PSD.9.t: "The Long Road to Victory"
 komi_PSD.9.d: "Mayors, bureaucrats, and Republican Army officers surrounded Stalina as she sat at a desk, before over a dozen cameras pointed in her direction, as she prepared to sign the Independent Supervisory Act into law. Another necessary measure, as the reclamation was set to begin, and certain processes needed to be put in place.\n\nOne concern that had emerged was the appropriating and managing the civilian administrations they would capture. Stalina did not want to implement immediate martial law, as she believed - and other civilian officials concurred on - that the sooner civilian rule was established, the better.\n\nThe Act was intended to facilitate that by allowing Republican Army Officers to appoint civilian officials to government positions, in addition to expanding access to the government as they pertained to military intelligence. Reports, overviews, and analysis concerning the war, from the front lines, would be available to them, and subsequently allow them to be informed as to the state of the war.\n\nIt was the kind of useful, pragmatic legislation she expected of the legislature. Some were doubtless going to argue that giving the military powers to appoint civilian officials wasn't a good solution to the problem - however, it would be sufficient for what they needed. Besides, the people would be grateful that military rule was not being enforced.\n\nStalina signed her name on the document to the polite applause of the attendees, and to the snap and flash of cameras. Journalists shouted questions and cajoled to get closer to her as she departed, her mind already focused on the other dozen tasks facing her. However, something important had been achieved today.\n\nIt was another step to victory."

 komi_RNP.1.d: "The residence of Igor Shafarevich had long been of little note in the politics of the Republic despite his relative prominence. He had few visitors over, since he liked to think that he preferred the quiet solitude of a lonely evening than the trappings of a social visit. As he sipped on a glass of water, he felt his dinner digest.\n\nAs the evening's sunset cast shadows over Syktyvkar, the newly-elected President noticed his feet wandering towards his apartment's balcony. The fresh, frigid air gripped the mathematician-turned-politician's skin despite his clothes, and as he held the water in his hand, he felt his mind wander towards the future. Shafarevich had worked hard to create his coalition, to grow grassroots support in Gumilyov's camp and among the more radical members of the democratic right.\n\nHe brought to mind all the manipulation, all the backstabbing, betrayal, blackmail, and underhanded tactics that he had employed during his years as a politician in the Komi Republic. Reflecting on what he had done to get elected, a single thought crossed his mind: he didn't regret it. Not a single thing that he did he considered below what was necessary to save Russia. "I'd do it again", he said, to no one in particular. Thinking about what he said over in his mind, he amended his statement. "I will do it all again."\n\nThe wind picked up as the President-elect looked down upon the streets of the capital. The sun was setting, but it felt as if Shafarevich's work had just begun."

Smoke from the cigarettes clutched in the teeth and fingers of the cabinet wafted in front of the light like evening fog. "Gentlemen," began Shafarevich, "we may rule the roost now, but our rule stands on shaky ground as long as this man," the President gave the image a particularly vicious jab, "this Mephistopheles, is allowed to run rampant.\n\n"The Left will fight us at every turn, poison the public against our policies, and might just launch a coup if they're able." Shafarevich paused to draw breath, sighing like an overworked father. "The Left, and Suslov especially, pose a very real threat to our administration." A ripple of muttering flowed through the room like a gale across a pond. Shafarevich held up his hands to demand silence. "Suslov, the great devil of our time, must be removed." The mathematician raised his right hand in a fist. "The law is on our side. Suslov appreciates the rule of law, of working within the system to his own benefit. Let us crush the little spider in his own web." Shafarevich paused to sip water from a glass, "tomorrow, we'll mobilize the Assembly to institute a ban on his party.

The centrists were always nervous around socialists, especially those of Suslov's caliber, and had scurried to accommodate Shaferevich, Morozov chief amongst them. The PSD had scoffed at the notion, responding with some self-righteous drivel about refusal to "be seated with an extremist President". The KPK, naturally, had not been invited at all.\n\n"Gentlemen," began Shafarevich, taking his seat at the head of the table, "I'm glad you were able to join us." Morozov inclined his head in agreement, his eyes betraying a slight unease at sitting at the same table in negotiation as a Passionariyy.\n\n"What's this about Suslov?" Morozov asked, eyebrow raised.\n\n"My friends, our nascent democracy stands on a vital precipice. We have fought, in some instances men have died, to preserve our Republic. What Voznesensky was unable to maintain through concessions and compromise, we must maintain by the rule of law."\n\n"This is Komi, gentlemen, we are no stranger to coups." The President allowed this last statement to hang in the air for a moment, the significance sinking into the assembled SMR members.\n\n"You think Suslov is planning something?" asked Morozov with a hint of alarm.\n\nShafarevich scowled, "He's Suslov, of course he is. Gentlemen, the RNP stands against extremism, against the sort of socialist nightmare that Suslov wants to unleash on Russia. I propose an emergency session early this morning. With your support, we can protect both democracy and drive the KPK back into the dustbin of history where it belongs." Shafarevich fixed Morozov with a stare, awaiting the answer he knew was coming."
 komi_RNP.3.a: ""I accept. For democracy.""

 komi_RNP.4.t: "Fear and Loathing in Syktyvkar"
 komi_RNP.4.d: "Suslov placed the phone back down on the receiver as he suppressed the urge to swallow nervously. There was no time for fear, no time to fret. There were calls to be made, papers to be burned, affairs to be put in order. Shafarevich, that fascist pretender, had held an emergency session at two o'clock and declared the KPK a terrorist organization. As always with fascists, the hammer blow would follow swiftly. If the KPK was to survive, both as a political organization and quite literally, action would need to be taken now. For an instant, he considered not informing Bukharina and Zhdanov, but thought better of it. No, the party would suffer without them, action could be taken later.\n\nIt took only ninety minutes for Suslov and his comrades to make good their escape. The old spider had put the arrangements in place months before. When the hammer fell, Suslov and his comrades were long gone, and six nondescript cars sped across the border to Vologda."
 komi_RNP.4.a: "It's not flight; it's a tactical retreat."

 komi_RNP.5.t: "The Iron Fist"
 komi_RNP.5.d: "Stupid, that's all Suslov could think when the police battered down the door of the KPK headquarters. Stupid. Did someone betray him? Zhdanov, perhaps? Suslov had been many things in his life: plotter, mastermind, chairman, hero, but never blindsided. He stayed seated as the fascist police barged inside, all noise and pointed pistols. Aides screamed and panic reigned around Suslov as the raid continued, and he let them. Why bother? Either he would escape into the night or he would be dead, there was no third option.\n\n"Mikhail Suslov," said an officer, pistol pointed in the bespectacled man's face, "you are under arrest for charges of political terrorism under section A of the Defense of Nati-". Suslov looked up at the fat, balding man with contempt.\n\n"Then don't just stand there, arrest me! If you're going to execute me, don't waste my time with justifications and statutes! Behind bars or a bullet, officer! What will it be?" Suslov calmed almost immediately, his sudden outburst seemingly forgotten. The officer wavered, working his tongue into a retort.\n\n"Bars, sir," he said finally. Suslov nodded and rose, extending his wrists.\n\n"Then let's get this over with." The cuffs slid over Suslov's thin wrists, the teeth of the clasps rasping together. The head of the KPK was lead outside. Gunshots could be heard behind him. Not everyone in the KPK was important enough to warrant a trial, and Suslov suspected that some old paramilitary scores were being settled."
 komi_RNP.5.a: "Just another night in Syktyvkar."

 komi_RNP.6.t: "The Daily Beat"
 komi_RNP.6.d: "The sentence had been life, but Suslov knew what the judge had meant. No, not the judge, what Shafarevich meant. It was a death sentence. Perhaps not today, perhaps not this year, but Suslov knew that it was only a matter of time before an unsympathetic inmate stuck a piece of glass between his ribs or the warden invented some reason for him to be shot.\n\nTime, then, was not on Suslov's side, and time was what he needed most. His list of allies was growing thin, and Suslov suspected that Bukharina and Zhdanov, if not already imprisoned, dead, or fled, would do little to aid him.\n\nThe situation was not ideal, Suslov could admit that, but perhaps-a firm hand caught Suslov in the shoulder, stopping him dead in his pacings. The guard was a big man, tall and broad and a face like crumbling masonry.\n\n"You're Mikhail Suslov," growled the guard, truncheon clenched in a meaty fist. Murder glowed in his eyes, scars criss-crossing a face used to war.\n\n"Yes?" asked Suslov, his eyes scanning the prison yard. Lost in thought, he hadn't noticed the other prisoners gradually drift away from him, leaving him and the guard alone.\n\nTime, mused Suslov, had perhaps run out. The first blow, a meaty fist slammed into his gut, drove the air from his lungs and doubled him over. The second, this one delivered by the truncheon, cracked his skull and drove him into the dirt. Suslov failed to meaningfully register any blow following the fourth. His glasses shattered as his face hit the yard, glass and dirt rubbing into the cuts on his face. Blood leaked out from between his lips, and Suslov attempted to crawl away.\n\nNo one came to his aid, guards and prisoners alike watching in silent or jeering observation. So this was how it all ended, he thought, in the dirt of the prison yard. Perhaps he would have laughed if he had some distance from his predicament. He was joining the ranks of many illustrious socialist martyrs. Wasn't this a death expected of revolutionaries?"
 komi_RNP.6.a: "The death of one man is a tragedy."

 komi_RNP.7.t: "A Sound of Thunder"
 komi_RNP.7.d: "It was eight in the morning, just as the legislators were beginning to trinkle into the National Assembly, when a queer whistling could be heard. It was so horribly loud and shrill that everyone in the city heard it. So hideously familiar that the old threw themselves to the ground in familiar fear and so alien that the young stared at the sky dumbstruck. It was, by all accounts, an excellent shot.\n\nRubble, dust, and shredded limbs were hurled in all directions as the high explosive shell slammed into steps of the National Assembly. A great boom like the beat of some angry god's drum resounded throughout Syktyvkar, rapidly accompanied by screams of pain and horror. Medical personnel and police swarmed the streets, cordons were established, and those who could still be saved were tended to.\n\nThis was dreadfully tragic considering the placement of the second shell.\n\nThe crowd that had gathered and the medics tending to the wounded suffered the brunt of the second explosions. Guts and blood were strewn over the pavement, the air stank of dust and copper, and every molecule and atom rang with screams. This time, personnel did not swarm, but stayed huddled in buildings or with their hands over their necks. The third shell crashed more or less harmlessly into the steps.\n\nTheories ran like blood. Was the Luftwaffe back? Was the Front invading? The culprits, it was soon revealed by a sweep of the countryside, were a cabal of Suslovite terrorists operating a captured artillery piece.\n\nLater identification determined these men were low-level street fighters: a cobbler, a factory worker, two farmers, and a sailor. All had recently escaped from prison following the roundup of KPK members. The gun had vanished from an armory a week prior, written off as an administrative error."
 komi_RNP.7.a: "Don't be paranoid, of course it was the KPK!"

 komi_RNP.8.t: "We Will Endure"
 komi_RNP.8.d: "The politicians sat, huddled in fear, the stink of blood and fear still lingering in their collective memories. Terror gripped all in attendance, all save one. Shafarevich stood at the top of the podium, a sheave of papers held in his steady hand. No one chattered in the crowd, as if afraid that an errant word would bring the shells crashing back down. "Esteemed members of the National Assembly," began the President, "a great tragedy has befallen us. The unwarranted and horrific attack on this very building, upon the very foundations of democracy, cannot go unanswered." A quiet ripple of nods swept through the assembled legislators.\n\n"The blood and dust have not yet settled, the nightmare of yesterday is alive and well today. The communist monster continues to haunt us still. While we mourn, while we bury the dead, we must not grow complacent. Even the banning of the KPK did not end their evil. We must exorcise this spectre from the Russian nation forever."\n\nNods became raised fits and shouts of assent. Grief and horror were becoming rage and Shafarevich played upon it expertly. "Communism, Socialism, Bolshevism, all are still rife right here in this very city! Our democracy has been beaten, bloodied by leftist hatred for our cause! Will we let this attack go unanswered? Will we sit idle as Suslovite terrorists shell our very Assembly? Gentlemen, I am not afraid! Are we frightened mice or are we Russians?"\n\nThundering cries of, "Russians!" boomed through the hall, and Shaferavich forced down the grin rising to his face.\n\n"My fellow members of the Assembly, I have in my hand a proposal for emergency measures to crack down on political terrorism..." The votes were tallied and democracy endured."
 komi_RNP.8.a: "Sometimes we must sacrifice some liberty for the sake of security."

 komi_RNP.9.t: "A Little Bird"
 komi_RNP.9.d: "Shafarevich held the memo, controlling what had been a shaking hand seconds ago. The contents of the memo were treasonous, deeply damning and exceedingly dangerous. The Ministry of Defense had been meeting without him, that alone was suspicious, but what they had been speaking about...\n\n"Fuck!" shouted Shafarevich, slamming the palm of his hand against the wall. "Those roaches, those blood-sucking parasites, think they can replace me? I made them, God damn it!" Of all the phrases in the document, "possible regime change" jumped out at him again and again. Was he in danger? Who could he trust?\n\nShafarevich slumped down into his chair, finger resting on his lip as he seethed in thought. No, he reasoned, this could work to his advantage. The document had named names, including those who had dissented to the possible regime change. Could he trust those voices? No, they had still kept the meetings from him, but they could serve as potential allies. Trust was in short supply these days, and as Shafarevich himself had observed not too long ago, Komi was no stranger to coups. Something would have to be done, and soon.\n\nA little bit of blackmail might help grease the wheels. Reveal to certain ministers that he knew about the meetings and bend them to his service. Now somewhat calmed, Shafarevich picked up the phone and began to dial."
 komi_RNP.9.a: ""Hello, Soloukhin?""

 komi_RNP.10.t: "Drumming Out"
 komi_RNP.10.d: ""You stand accused of conspiracy to commit treason, conspiracy to bring about an unlawful regime change, fraternizing with the enemy, corruption..." The list went on and on, the dumbstruck Grigorenko, Pokus, and Korolkov wearing masks of fear and consternation. Soloukhin, that bootlicking snake, had wasted no time in rounding them up and placing them under arrest. Soloukhin, one of the very men whom the trio had bandied about the notion of deposing Shafarevich, now sat with the prosecution, his demeanor self-satisfied. The judge continued to read, half of the charges bunkum invented to guarantee a conviction.\n\nGrigorenko stood, unable to contain himself any longer. He may have been stripped of his rank, but he still had his dignity. "Soloukhin, you roach! You sat at the table with us! We were comrades! Never would I think that Vladimir Soloukhin would sink so low." His face was beet red with rage, his skin quivering with nervous fury. Soloukhin, for his part, didn't seem overly worried.\n\n"Bailiff," he said, pointing at the raging Grigorenko, "remove this man. On second thought, remove them all, the court has heard enough." The guards advanced, the officers protested, fought back. They were past their prime, old fighters who were no match for the rifle butts and kicks of their younger enemies.\n\nThey were dragged from the court, and into a waiting armored car."
 komi_RNP.10.a: "Three shallow graves are all that mark their legacy."

 komi_RNP.11.t: "Political Science"
 komi_RNP.11.d: "Democracy, mused Shafarevich, was a wonderful thing. Gumilyov, Serov, Taboritsky, all strong and capable leaders in their own right, could never have done what he had just accomplished. The National Assembly, their bowels icy and their spines gelatinous after the fateful terrorist attack on that organ of state, had hastily approved and ratified the National Democracy Act. The act, for all its titular implications, had for all intents and purposes, made Igor Shafaraveich the highest authority in all of Komi.\n\nHe sniffed, taking a slug of vodka smuggled over the border from Vyakta, the tsar's spirits warming his own. Shafarevich looked out the window, glass still in hand. The National Assembly building stood against the setting sun, brilliant and radiant in the golden hour. One could almost ignore the shell damage and the throngs of protestors. Well, thought Shafarevich, he supposed he could afford to ignore them for the time being.\n\nThe President poured himself another drink and toasted to National Democracy."
 komi_RNP.11.a: "Deriving our just powers from the implied consent of the governed."

 komi_RNP.12.t: "Democracy Secured"
 komi_RNP.12.d: "Democracy, mused Shafarevich, sometimes must be forced. The will of the masses, though of course represented in the legislature, must occasionally take a back seat to the man they elected to lead them. Undemocratic means must sometimes be employed to protect democracy. It was unfortunate, then, that the people of Komi had failed to understand that.\n\nHe snorted, of course he had passed the National Democracy Act through executive order. If the masses hadn't insisted on disrupting the proper democratic process through protests, then the act could have been implemented some other way. He supposed it didn't matter much now, as the act had empowered Shafarevich to such a degree that he had no concerns about what the masses, or the National Assembly for that matter, thought of him. Democracy was saved, he thought to himself, and as the National Assembly building was set against the setting sun, he tried to ignore the screams of the protestors and the sporadic peals of gunfire."
 komi_RNP.12.a: "Democracy is not a set of actions, but a way of thinking."

 komi_RNP.13.t: "Ascending from the Depths"
 komi_RNP.13.d: "Finally, we have done it. Not through violent revolution, but rather the efforts of our legislators and tireless President, we have emerged victorious. The leftists, liberals, and cosmopolitan influences within Ust-Sysolsk have been neutered, and now only our cause remains as a relevant political force. The failing Komi Republic has once and for all been put out of its misery via the stroke of the President's pen. A round of new laws have passed the National Assembly, dissolving the Republic and creating a new provisional State of Ust-Sysolsk, to last until our government is solidified. With no institutional opposition to oppose us, we no longer have to fear the overthrow of our regime. However, we have much work left to do.\n\nWith communists to our north, an expansionist tsarist pretender to our south, and... whatever is going on in Perm, our regime still has plenty of external threats to deal with. We must prepare our people for war. This means rebuilding industry, equipping our armies, reorganizing our military, and ensuring that our soldiers are willing to die for our cause. Once we are prepared, we shall wage war against all who seek to threaten us. In the end, Western Russia will surely be ours. The Motherland has long been shackled by the weak, and we shall finally set her free."
 komi_RNP.13.a: "They shall tremble before our might!"

 komi_RNP.14.t: "A Stealthy Killing"
 komi_RNP.14.d: "A native Komi teacher stood outside her boss's office. A proud native Komi, she taught the group's native language at a local school. It was an often difficult thing, only allocated a small budget, but recently things had gotten worse. The supplemental funding for the program had dwindled over time, which now led her to today when she realized they were out of funds. At last, she found the courage to knock and open the door.\n\nOksin' took a seat across her superior's pitiful desk. "Afanas, what happened to my funding? At this rate, I'm going to have to stop the language classes. If that happens, what will become of our culture, our identity? Surely you can find it in the budget to continue funding the native language program?"\n\nAfanas let out a long exhausted sigh after hearing his colleague's concerns. "I'm sorry Oksin' but there isn't much I can do. Those funds were from the government and they have not been the most... supportive of that kind of cultural preservation. I wish the elections had turned out differently, but diverting funds is too risky. The school could risk losing more funds or worse, something more overt."\n\n"Fine!" That was all Oksin' said before getting up and storming out of the office. Afanas watched her crestfallen. The whole ordeal just made Oksin' mad. The previous government already did not do much, but this was cultural genocide!\n\nShe thought about finding time out of school to teach, but then reality set in. If this was the government being subtle, what was the government being overt? At that moment, she remembered the gangs on her street, and her son in Syktyvkar. Frightened, at the thought, she decided to head home, frightened at what else might happen."
 komi_RNP.14.a: "Hopefully no one heard their conversation."

 komi_RNP.15.t: "Government Assistance"
 komi_RNP.15.d: "Feliks was a simple man. Every day he woke up, attended his government job sorting out the logistics of Komi's food aid, and then returned home. However, this structure was about to be upheaved in an unprecedented way for the aging man. Today was his last day at his job and he would soon be retiring. This development both excited and scared Felik as his life was about to be sent in an all-new direction.\n\nAs he prepared to leave his desk for a final time, he spotted an unopened envelope that was delivered earlier in the day. Curiously, he opened it and read out its contents. It was a generic letter from the national assembly, accompanied by the artificial signature of the current President, Shaferavich. However, far from some government order he instead discovered a last-minute change to his pension, more specifically a raise.\n\nImmediately he began thinking of what to buy with this increase. His previous amount was not terrible, but he would not have to cut back his lifestyle with the new amount. Renovating his home, buying his children some nice gifts, and even splurging on some good food. However, that was for the future, now he had to get home.\n\nAs Feliks walked home, he was all around pleased. He had lost any faith in the national assembly, having to constantly deal with the consequences of their shenanigans, but this was a change. Politics were never his forte, but with all this and the free time he now possessed, perhaps he would get involved with the RNP."
 komi_RNP.15.a: "It feels good to be represented."

 komi_RNP.16.t: "A Stroke of the Pen"
 komi_RNP.16.d: "As the President of Komi, Shaferavich sat with complete authority at his desk as a group of individuals surrounded Him. His closest political allies stood beside him, while reporters loyal to the RNP holding notepads and microphones watched eagerly. Before him on the desk lay a single piece of paper alongside a few pens. Today marked a bold new step for the Republic.\n\nFor war was on the horizon and turmoil alongside it. The National Reclamation Act in front of him symbolized the republic's first steps into this chaos, and Shaferavich's plans to be proactive with it. While the bill was an easy thing to pass, it was monumental nonetheless, and a calculated political opportunity for Shaferavich to exploit.\n\nCollected, Shaferavich gave a serious look at the reporters before speaking. "Hello, my fellow Russian citizens. It is with dignity and pride that I sign this order of the National Assembly into law. This act signifies the coming clouds of war on the horizon, and the necessity of our state to fight in these upcoming battles. I will not lie, the following months will not be easy, but the RNP is prepared to protect all of its citizens as we step into this new chapter of Russian history."\n\nHis hands shook with the signing leaving his name awkwardly smudged on the paper, but there regardless. Inside Shaferavich was nervous, aware of the instability that would come, but kept on his confident face knowing that his party could overcome anything at this point. At that same moment, flashes encompassed his vision as cameras from the papers were eager to take his picture.\n\nAlmost immediately after, the invited reporters started to ask their questions. However, Shafervich had not invited them there for that. Without much fanfare, he shuffled them out of the room, as his aides handed them the party's precomposed press statement. Left alone, he mulled over his thoughts on what his coming actions should be."
 komi_RNP.16.a: "The storm draws ever nearer."

 komi_RNP.17.t: "Change or Continuation?"
 komi_RNP.17.d: "The streets of Komi began to take on an entirely new appearance. Where there was once political violence and crime there now stood a new sense of order brought on by the RNP. However, not all was well. On the horizon, the clouds surrounding the republic had finally crossed the border, and with them the drums of war. All knew what it meant and dreaded it.\n\nAmong those who dreaded the implications were a group of former KPK activists forced to relinquish and work underground after the start of the repressions. Worried about what this new chaos might bring, they were huddled in a bar determined to come up with a plan.\n\nThe group's leader, Klavdii, was the first to speak and give his plan. "It is clear that the climate here is no longer receptive to our ideas, err former ideas. As such with the likely events of the future, I propose we split up and stay underground, even blend in with the RNP if necessary." The leader let out a long sigh. "While not ideal, it'll keep us safe."\n\nWhile Klavdii was met with a few murmurs of agreement, dissent to the idea was raised almost immediately. Holes were poked into the plan, leaving Klavdii's leadership in doubt more than it already was. After all, the RNP was more than just Shaferavich and while he could tolerate them just staying silent, others might not. Not to mention the vulnerability and ideologic betrayal present in the plan.\n\nAmong the bickering, a new voice piped up, coming from a particularly rowdy member of the group. "To hell with it! No one's forcing us to stay here in Komi. If worst comes to worst we could just flee across the Sysola into Red Army territory! It's a tough trek, but at least it's not the city." The group had stopped and shifted their attention to the woman. Unlike the previous suggestion, this one had some consensus, and the group agreed to the plan."
 komi_RNP.17.a: "They only wished it never had to come to that."

 komi_KPK.1.d: ""Good, Comrade President, though perhaps..." the photographer paled before he could finish his sentence, and froze in front of [Get_Left_President_Last_Name].\n\n"Yes, comrade?" [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] asked.\n\nThe photographer cleared his throat. "Well, comrade, it's just...your uniform, sir. It might not seem, uh, presidential." He audibly gulped. "I'm sorry, comrade, I didn't -"\n\n"It's fine, it's fine." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] waved the young photographer off. He had to admit, this wasn't going too well. Half the people around him looked like they were afraid to do anything at all around him for fear of some reprisal, like he was a Tsar who could have them flogged at a moment's notice. What was there to be done about it, though? He remembered how they'd treated Lenin and Bukharin, and if he was going to restore Soviet order to Russia, they'd treat him like that as well.\n\nBut they liked Bukharin! The golden child, they called him, with his boyish face, his affable smile, and his charming manner. Sure, people feared Bukharin's name, but when they faced the man himself they were laughing and joking with the General Secretary. He had his disagreements with his erstwhile comrade and boss, but Nikolai had been good at one thing; making people like him. It was how he'd come to power. He'd have to calm those around him.\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] gestured to one of the Party militia officers he'd brought with him. "Hand me that cap, comrade," and he then put it on his head. "Comrade photographer! Do I look more presidential now?" he asked, smiling to the people around him. A few of the Party men dutifully laughed, and the photographer gave a stilted chuckle. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name]'s smile faded. Perhaps he was no Bukharin."

 komi_KPK.2.d: "Officially, this meeting was happening in the Presidential residence. In truth, however, it was happening in a secret Communist Party safehouse, far from any prying eyes. Cabinet meetings were technically not open to the public, and so to host the rest of the party leadership he needed it held away from the normal location. Though there were additional reasons for the secrecy. "This was discovered near an incinerator in the Ministry of Defense," [Get_Left_Sec_Min] began, passing copies of a dossier to the members of the cabinet. "'Case October;' as you can see, details a plan by the Republican Army to launch a military coup against the government in the case of the government falling into our hands. It was drafted by by Grigorenko and Korolkov."\n\n"I assume this was without Voznesensky's approval?"\n\n"Correct, Comrade Furtseva. They considered him an unreliable element."

"Comrade President, if they have incinerated most of the documents, then we can only assume they will strike imminently."\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] fumed. "Those bourgeois pigs." He slammed his fist against the table. "Those pigs! Those bastards! I am their President! Don't they see I am for the good of the people?!" The rest of the room looked nervously at one another, all except Suslov, staring at the President through those cold spectacles of his. He didn't fear Suslov, but what was he planning?\n\n[Get_Left_Sec_Min]'s voice brought him back to reality. "Comrade President, I recommend stationing the following units around Syktyvkar," he said, handing a list to the President. "I have vetted them personally, they are loyal to the revolution. We can use our paramilitaries to suppress the traitors." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] calmed down. Calm, he'd have to be calm. Calm like Bukharin had been.

Soon there would be something far superior to give the workers of the world protection. Still, he'd deal with them for now.\n\n"Comrade President," the chairman began, "Thank you very much for meeting with us. We're extremely pleased to have a President committed to socialism and the workers' struggle."\n\n"I'm glad to hear that, comrade. But first we must build the workers' utopia before we can celebrate it, no? Let's not count our chickens before they hatch." A few chuckles came from the committee, but nothing much. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] continued, "We have much work to do. Our paramilitaries and loyal soldiers are still attempting to sweep up the disloyal elements, and -"\n\n"Actually, Comrade President, we were hoping to discuss something else," the chairman interrupted. "Before we can discuss any of these measures, we need assurances."\n\n"Assurances? Comrades, you bewilder me, what assurances do you need?"\n\n"The old Union subordinated workers' associations to the Party before. We understand the role of the vanguard in the revolution, Comrade President, but Bukharin's experiment ignored the role of the workers in favor of bureaucrats - present company excluded, of course."

Ah, that was it. A minor infraction when he hadn't paid enough at a cafe once in 1960 was the only real misdeed, and indeed was the one listed as the reason for his discharge, but Grigorenko had noted Bezmonov before, for his refusal to allow KPK propaganda leaflets to be distributed in his unit. The discharge order had been signed by the President himself. The fifth one this week.\n\nGrigorenko tossed the discharge order aside. Did [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] know? They'd incinerated all the October files. Or had they? There had always been Communist infiltrators, had a copy been leaked? No, it couldn't have been.\n\nDamn the October files, though.

We now have a second and, arguably, more pressing. The Passionariyy." Furtseva handed out dossiers to the cabinet members. "As liberal capitalism collapses into its inevitable demise, many look to the light of socialism as the future, but others among the middle class and some...misguided proletarians look to the past, to the esotericism of Gumilyov and his cronies."\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] shrugged. "We can deal with them easily. We can strangle them by cutting off their voter base and disrupting their meetings and fundraising, and use the police to break them up."\n\n"Would that it were so simple, Comrade President," Furtseva bemoaned. "As you are doubtlessly aware, our former comrade, Serov, has joined the Passionariyy in his naked revisionism and powerlust. He is intimately aware of our security procedures, our structure, and our weaknesses. Most importantly, his Ordosocialist paramilitaries are extremely dangerous. All ex-Red Army or ex-NKVD. They're not Gumilyov's lambs, they have no compunction with killing, and Serov has no compunction with having them do so."\n\nThe cabinet thought the matter over, before a voice in the shadows whispered quietly. "Comrades. Everyone here is aware that whoever the people hate the Germans the most. They have taken everything from us, and everyone on the street knows at least someone who died to German bombs or bullets. And what is Serov if not a fascist?" Mikhail Suslov leaned into the light. "What is the greatest friend of the fascist if not the German?"\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] faced his former protege. "We know they are likely Nazi collaborators, but we can't prove it to the people."\n\n"Comrade President, we have his manifesto. And you know as well as I that where evidence is absent it can be 'found.' And they collaborate with Serov. And then, once the people see these Germanophiles for what they are...""

Provided, of course, that you commit to keeping within the legal strictures of Republican norms and laws."\n\n"Pah! You're one to talk about 'the legal strictures.' Just last month, KPK paramilitaries were shooting at me as I walked to the cafe!"\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] sighed. "The violence of the past and of my party are both regrettable, and must be averted from here on out. But we have moved on; the Party has realized the errors of paramilitary violence, and now seeks to function legitimately." He couldn't help but notice the nodding of the DSNP delegates next to Rodionov. Each had been blackmailed by Suslov's intelligence apparatus beforehand. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] would have to find out what else Suslov knew eventually, but for now he was only grateful.\n\nRodionov, considering the mood of his compatriots, mused on the potential deal in front of him. "We can agree to ban the Passionariyy, in exchange for certain concessions. First, the disestablishment of the KPK's paramilitary. Second, a commitment to abide by Republican principles, including multiparty democracy. Third, an official condemnation of past terrorist actions by the KPK in public."\n\n"Done," [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] smiled, then shook Rodionov's hand.

 komi_KPK.8.d: "Shaferevich had known this was coming for some time now. He had watched the polls, done the math, and guessed that the Communists would win. Once [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was in power, it wasn't difficult to guess where it was going. Gumilyov didn't listen, Serov seemed more excited for a fight than anything. Of all the people in the Passionariyy, he hadn't expected Taboritsky to be the one to nod silently when he had brought up his predictions. He'd been prepared for some time. Whatever happened to the rest was no matter; he had to get going while the going was good, and that window was closing.\n\nThe truck pulled up in the lot he had planned out. It stopped, and the driver stepped out. "You need help with that luggage?"\n\n"Sure, please." The driver helped load suitcase after suitcase into the back, then got back into the truck. Shaferevich, holding a book, a piece of scratch paper, and a pencil got into the passenger seat. With that, they drove off into the Syktyvkar night.\n\n"So what's your story?" the driver asked.\n\nShaferevich paused, nervously, then answered as truthfully as he could. "I'm a mathematics professor. I taught courses at the local university until relatively recently."\n\n"Ah, that sounds like a good gig. Why'd you leave?"\n\n"My employment was, uh... terminated, recently. Have to find a new job."\n\n"What happened?"\n\n"Disagreement with the boss." The driver nodded, and Shaferevich thought it over. He'd acquired forged documents that could get him through WRRF territory, from there into Onega, and then on to Helsinki. It could be worse, he told himself. They might need professors in Helsinki. Come to think of it, he'd heard that the streets there needed an improvement. He took out the paper and pencil, thinking of a new way to organize the flow of urban traffic. It would be a quiet life as an exile, he thought, but at least it would be life."

At least [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was obeying the rules of the system, unlike Gumilyov and his ilk. He marched through the hallway of the Passionariyy's headquarters, at the head of a veritable stream of soldiers through the door. Time to put the traitors down.\n\nHe knocked on the locked door of Gumilyov's office. "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov!" he announced. "The building is surrounded! Come quietly and face prosecution for your crimes!" Nothing inside, except the faint sound of a window being opened. He grunted, then had the two soldiers accompanying him kick down the door.\n\nThe office, full of shelves and books, was dark and devoid of people save one man. He stood in front of an open window, holding a rope tied to his heavy desk, then looked at the door. His eyes filled with fear as he saw the soldiers, then he tried to climb through the window. Popov grabbed his legs as he tried to escape and dragged him back inside the office. Gumilyov squirmed on the ground as Popov slapped handcuffs on him, then pulled him to his feet and forced him through the door.\n\nOutside, he threw Gumilyov into the same truck as a bulky, raging figure in an old uniform then shut the door. He turned to a beaten and bruised Sergeant Fedorov. "Serov, I presume?"\n\n"No, it's some other ex-NKVD thug that took three men to subdue."\n\n"Hmm." He checked his list. Gumilyov and Serov were in custody, but where were Taboritsky and Shaferevich? He sighed as the minutes went on and the missing Passionarists remained missing. Eventually, as trucks were loaded with guards, archivists, and others, he decided his work was done."

 komi_KPK.10.d: "Gumilyov and Serov, once the masters of the Pasionaryy and contenders for the throne of Komi, rattled along in the back of the truck, their heads hidden by black bags. Shackles bound their hands and feet, clinking with every bump in the road. Serov sat with his back straight, feet planted firmly on the floor. As a former member of the NKVD, he had no illusions about what was at the end of their road and he embraced it. Gumilyov, bent over in his seat, felt sick. Not only from the certainty he was about to die, but from the jostling and jumping of the truck along the pot-holed road. He had once said that you couldn't kill an idea, but now that he was facing his almost certain death, he supposed that a bullet in the head might kill any ideas he could have.\n\nThe truck squealed to a halt, and the KPK thugs in the back of the truck with the two Pasionaryy bosses hauled them to their feet. The bags were torn from their faces, and Gumilyov blinked and swore as the light hit his retinas. It was, he supposed, a nice day. Birds chirped, leaves crunched under his feet. At least he would die in his beloved Eurasia. Serov was an impassive giant, who knew what was going on in that contradictory mind of his.\n\n"End of the line, fascists," said a guard holding a submachine gun, "any last words?"\n\nGumilyov shrugged, why not? "Eura-" The guard pumped bullets into the Eurasianist, light glinting through the holes punched into him. Gumilyov's shredded body fell to the ground without a sound. The guards chuckled at their little jest.\n\nSerov said nothing, just fixed the shooter with dead, hateful eyes. The guards didn't play with him, simply shooting Serov between the eyes and letting him drop."

Unfortunately, plans don't usually go perfectly, but there was nothing wrong with using more unofficial ways to get things done.\n\nThere were protestations of course, but that only gave more reason to remove those more seditious than others. There was nothing the reactionaries could do, socialism would always march on, and soon, it would uplift Russia. Staring out the window onto the crowd of protestors, [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] listened as the sound of gunshots began to fill the air. And then angry shouts turned to screams.

However, with the success of our revolution by ballot, we have taken the first step towards reigniting communism's torch. Despite the liberal institutions standing in our way, we have taken a great step toward the socialist future, and the Party is now the sole authority left in Syktyvkar. We may breathe easier, knowing that Komi's liberals and rightists have been rendered impotent. The newly secured National Assembly has passed a bill to dissolve the Komi Republic, and institute a new Komi Soviet Republic, with a constitution patterned off the old Union's own.\n\nHowever, our regime still has many enemies left to face. Western Russia may be home to our ideological allies in Arkhangelsk, but many of our neighbours seek to destroy the revolution once and for all. Tsarists, fascist collaborators, and whatever abomination the Aryan Brotherhood have become, they all wish to see us and our cause dead. We must consolidate ourselves. We must equip the people of Komi, and we must go to war. If the rest of Russia will not embrace the revolution, it must be spread by force.

It was not difficult to pass, but the traitorous resistance from the opposition was still palpable over ideological differences. Regardless, with it, the unification of Russia would be one step closer, and the dreams of the KPK closer to realization.\n\nThe signing itself lasted only a few seconds. With a stroke of the hand, a signature was placed neatly onto the paper. The deed finally done, a huge wave of relief rushed over the President as they were quickly engulfed in congratulations by their surrounding ministers.\n\nSeeing it as an opportune moment, the President decided to provide some encouragement to their advisors. "Well, it has been done. The reclamation of the USSR is now underway, it's only a matter of time now. This, however, is not the end of our work. Wars are still to be fought, and a revolution to be continued."\n\nAll mumbled in agreement, and soon the President had them pushed out to begin such work. Alone, the President looked at the paper one last time, letting the implications reappear as the relief vanished from their body. He then called in an aide and had it documented."

The two men, Alexander Shepilov and Arvids Pelshe were of the old guard, now in their late 50s and early 60s, and still serving the party they were loyal to.\n\nThe current President had ordered the creation of a new state planning bureau, built from the ground up. In it, the two men were promised all the resources they would ever need, something that excited Shepilov and Pelshe. Unfortunately for them, the short notice required a new set of bureaucrats, which they were now stuck finding before their presentation deadline.\n\nPelshe let out a long sigh. "I can't wait to finally have our own department. It will be just like the good old days before the Nazis invaded and ruined everything." He thought back to his life in Latvia. "Perhaps our work can be used to liberate eastern Europe."\n\nShepilov stopped his work and looked at his older colleague. "Perhaps someday, but that day will never come if we don't get this agency off the ground. If we want that dream we'll have to work for it together." A file was handed to Pelshe. "Now how about we look at economists." Pelshe nodded in agreement, with a newfound commitment to his work.\n\nFinally, just before 2 AM, the pair had their list. Full of seasoned, trustworthy, and reliable bureaucrats that would be perfect for the department. With a big stretch, both men got out of their chairs and left home to get what little sleep they could salvage. Pelshe before exiting, turned off the lights, well aware they would be on when they came back in a few hours to report."

However, it was the calm before the storm, as the clouds that had previously surrounded the republic had finally crossed the border.\n\nOne of the Republic's army captains, a man named Kazimir, walked nervously to a new man in his unit. This new man was young and fresh out of school. He held a sense of idealism and optimism that had long vanished from the rest of the unit. However, despite his inexperience, he was equal to Kazimir himself, for he was the unit's new political commissar.\n\nKazimir cleared his throat and extended his hand. "Nice to meet you! My name is Kazimir and I'm the captain of this little detachment. I hope your stay here is pleasant."\n\nThe young man looked at the Republican captain with suspicion but softened shortly after. He extended his arm to shake. "I'm Iakov. This is quite the energetic group of comrades you have here. I hope they are well versed in party ideology?"\n\nA nervous chuckle escaped Kazimir. "Well, they could probably use some help, which I assume you'll be happy to provide, perhaps over a game of hockey? Sometimes the men like to play out a game on their breaks." Iakov had latched on to the talk, and Kazimir soon found himself in a bit of debate over technique with his new colleague.\n\nBoth men continued their discussion before Kazimir said something out of the blue. "Things sure have been getting crazy recently, haven't they? I'm hoping we can come to some agreement working together with the upcoming war?" Iakov looked at the man again, slowly nodding. The next few months would not be easy, Iakov thought, and any camaraderie he could make would be of great value."

"I trust you've prepared for our discussion?" The discussion in question surrounded the reclamation of Russia - the first step of which was securing the region west of the Urals. Once that was completed, they would continue sweeping east.\n\n"As requested, Mr. President," Grigorenko nodded. "We both have some proposals for you concerning the reclamation operations. One matter that we are at an impasse on is the management of local governments."\n\nVoznesensky nodded, unsurprised. "Go on."\n\n"Barring a few exceptions, the governments in question are going to be hostile to us," Grigorenko continued. "They are going to need to be replaced. Minister Ligachev is of the opinion that continuity of civilian government is essential. I've posited that until the war is concluded, we maintain military control."\n\n"My counter to this is simple," Ligachev rested his clasped hands on the table. "We are to win hearts and minds, not just land. While I have no doubt our soldiers could manage well enough, the optics are not ideal. We are a democratic nation - not a dictatorship or junta. Even if the government is hostile to us, I am certain we could find sympathetic people, who are respected in their communities. Mr. President, your opinion?"\n\nAnd this was why he'd made Ligachev his Defense Minister. Grigorenko meant well, but he was a soldier. Komi was a republic, led by civilians, and Voznesensky believed that should be given priority. He was glad to see his choice had been vindicated."

Some were bored like a donkey, others piercing him like a vulture, others more with the naive innocence of a rabbit. However, all returned to the President, as he prepared for the uncomfortable process before him.\n\n"I'm just going to cut straight to the chase. As we near the end of this Smuta, we are facing the problem of what to do with future elections. After all, the Republic is no longer just Komi, and our election times are no longer in sync. Changes are not a question of if, but what."\n\nVoznesensky turned his body to Chairman Rodionov next to him, giving his friend the floor to speak. "Thank you, Mr. President. I propose a soft reboot to the election timings once things settle down more. It would be a good time to convene and reexamine the constitution while we're at it too."\n\nMurmurs filled the room at the thought of replacing the constitution, mostly from rogue RNP and KPK deputies. Accusations of revisionism carried across the room in anger. Voznesensky watched as deputy Stalina just rolled her eyes at the whining around her. Still, the SMR and PSD seemed fairly receptive, which was important.\n\nThe whining had mostly subsided, but not completely. Seeing an opportunity, Voznesensky decided to end the meeting. "I think that's enough for today. This room needs to be cleared for a meeting with the generals anyway. We'll reconvene to discuss this constitution idea, with everyone that was here today." As people left, a huge sigh escaped the President. The hard part had been done. After all, he did not need everyone to agree with him."

The process was something he had grown familiar with over the years as President, and one he was none too fond of as a result. Yet this meeting seemed less toxic than previous meetings, both in language and procedure.\n\nHe watched as Chairman Rodionov guided the assembly along bill after bill. Procedures were not without arguments, but they passed all the same. Bill after bill meant for the war went through, the entire assembly united in the face of its destruction. From Voznesensky's position, he could swear he saw Rodionov enjoying himself for once.\n\nEven the RNP was supportive for once in their miserable existence, the ever annoying pricks, thought the President. His long bitter enemies now cooperating was something the President could scarcely think of a few years ago. Voznesensky began stroking his beard as a smile appeared on his face.\n\nConsidering the involvement of the KPK though, he stopped. It might not have been the old days with Zhandov, but he still expected more of them than this. Casting no votes made the party look suspicious. Voznesensky returned to stroking his beard, now in contemplation. He would need to poke them harder, maybe threaten his old friend with the threat of Stalina or the RNP.\n\nEventually, the session did end. Before he left, he walked up to his colleague to express his observations. "That was a well-run session, Rodionov. Masterfully in fact. I could only dream of something like this during the early days of the republic." The Chairman only smiled before replying to his friend in earnest."

A few days ago he had received a telegram from the government requesting his union's presence with representatives of the company. Now the two of them were staring at each other in the cramped board room, looking as though they were in a stand-off ready to gun the other down.\n\nAt last, their mysterious arranger finally arrived. As he walked through the door, Onisim could barely believe his eyes. Before him was the Minister of finance Leonid Kantarovich. Now Onisim was confused even more with the whole ordeal. After all, what could a man like Kantarovich do meeting with a small local like his?\n\nThe finance minister cleared his throat. "Good afternoon gentlemen. I apologize for my tardiness. I'm sure you are all curious why I have called you here today. Well, as part of new legislation by the National Assembly the government is in demand of some large quantities of steel. As a result, I have a government contract for the factory." Kantarovich reached into his jacket and plopped a stack of papers onto the table.\n\nEveryone in the room scrambled to grab a copy. As Onisim got a hold of one, what he saw was fairly generous. High worker compensation, representation on the factory labor board, reasonable pay, and safety conditions, it was amazing. He looked at his fellow union representatives to get their opinion. Overall everyone seemed similarly pleased.

Now, in light of the triumph over the troubles of war, we have achieved something amazing.

Like so many documents before, his signature carried its familiar smudges as his hands shook. However, instead of a fear of the future, Voznesensky's hand shook with excitement.\n\nFinishing, Voznesensky stepped aside to allow the others in the room to sign. Soon, signatures filled the bottom as excitement compounded from each following delegate. As the President stood back to watch the sight, a smile filled his face, pleased to find something truly hopeful in a country he had so often in the past watched tear itself apart.\n\nSoon, the room became enraptured in discussing their recent actions, and the President found himself conversing with Rodionov over their accomplishment. However, from the corner of his vision, the President was distracted by a strange man being the last to sign the parchment. He was nearly bald with bushy eyebrows and a thin mustache. He slipped out of his conversation to investigate the man's identity. Reaching the constitution, he discovered a most unfamiliar name written at the very bottom."

Not in the ways that mattered, at least. All the same, this was an unfamiliar air here; one of strategy and scheming. Maps with battle plans were drawn up, and on the table; plans optimizing the methods of killing and war.\n\nThe uniformed General Staff only added to the militarized atmosphere. At heart, Morozov wasn't a military man, and being the only such person in the room that wasn't made him wary. Paranoid, perhaps, but he couldn't help it. "The objective of this meeting is simple," Grigorenko stated. "The coming reclamation of Russia. We've begun planning for this campaign.

However, one of the ways we might achieve this is through a new constitution..."\n\nWhile most seemed satisfied with the arrangement, not everyone was pleased. Notably, what was left of the RNP and KPK were particularly upset at the suggested arrangement. For once the two were united in screeching out their complaints. There it was, the President thought to himself as he watched the scene.\n\nDeputy Stalina was not having any of it though. Standing up, she slammed her fist into the table. "Enough from all of you!" She cleared her throat. "I think the plan sounds ideal. The previous system has caused us many headaches in the past, benefitting the types of scoundrels we just won wars against. Now that nothing stands in our way, now would be the best time to do something, unless any other scoundrels would like to join their compatriots."\n\nThe speech did its job and the opposition had become particularly cagey. Pleased by the consensus, Morozov clapped his hands. "Alright then, I don't believe we have anything left to discuss. You are all dismissed."

 komi_dynamic_SMR.3.d: "Peace. That was what Morozov saw as he watched the National Assembly for the first time since Smuta had started. No shouting, no bickering, no sudden threats of violence or assassination. Just a cooperative group of people working a bill through like a sane group of individuals.\n\nThe sight was baffling to Morozov, if not borderline suspicious. Yet he watched as Liberman steered the assembly along passing an emergency bill extending the funding of bridges across the Vytalka. In the past, there would have been cockamamy accusations of monarchism and betrayal. Now, Liberman calmly answered questions before the bill passing the bill with an overwhelming majority.\n\nAs the session drew to an end, Morozov could only stare bewildered from his seat. He had worked to reform the state into something proper, but he expected something to go wrong as it often did in Komi. Especially during a war, there should be at least some chaos!\n\nWaking from his confused daze, he called up Liberman to ask him what he had just seen before his colleague could leave. "That was an awfully smooth session there Liberman, how did you do it? Bribes, blackmail, threats? Or did I die from some shell while visiting troops last week?"\n\nLiberman let out a hearty laugh before looking at his boss and answering his question. "Well Morozov, that is how a good democracy works, not the hair-brained system we had before. Besides, nothing unites people like war." Noticing the President's confusion he made a suggestion. "Say, you don't look well. How about we go get something to drink before you head back to your office?""
 komi_dynamic_SMR.3.a: "War, the most peaceful of times."

 komi_dynamic_SMR.4.t: "A Tiny Miracle Upon the Sysola"
 komi_dynamic_SMR.4.d: ""It's a beautiful river," the man said, "The Sysola, I mean. You're lucky to be here."\n\nYogush couldn't quite discern who had just entered his office. In every manner, this man was unassuming. His suit was a simple two-piece hidden beneath an overcoat. His hands were worn, gripping tightly onto a small envelope. Even his face was drab, defined with those jowls and folds that seemed to grip every bureaucrat by middle age. Nothing about him seemed to deserve a second thought - yet Yogush couldn't help but pay attention regardless.\n\nThe man continued. "I was recently given a requisition form for a series of river barges. After a short review, a shortlist of possible companies was found, and upon close inspection by a small team of close associates, it was clear your company was best. As this order is of such a great scale, I felt it best to deliver it in person."\n\nA little confused, Yogush began to open the envelope. The contract unfurled below him. Some hundred ships were being ordered, several to exact specifications. No private enterprise could afford this much. The only one who could was...\n\nYogush's eyes turned to the man sitting across from him. "You're here from Syktyvkar?"\n\nA hint of surprise flashed upon the man's face. "Oh! I forgot to introduce myself - my apologies. I am Minister of Finance Gvishiani, representing the Komi Republic. I hope you will accept this order.""
 komi_dynamic_SMR.4.a: "In a moment of shock, Yogush could only smile and nod."

 komi_dynamic_SMR.5.t: "An Impressive Accomplishment"
 komi_dynamic_SMR.5.d: "In an extravagant ballroom, delegates from Samara to Arkhangelsk sat at tables for what was to be one of the most important moments in the republic's history. At the front of the room, President Morozov stood on a stage watching his audience as a microphone was placed in front of him. Behind him, on a lectern, a single piece of paper laid the center of attention of the entire occasion.\n\nHe tapped the microphone before speaking. "Good day ladies and gentlemen. Today we are gathered for what has been one of the greatest accomplishments in our nation's history. For years Komi's constitution has been riddled with holes, leaving the state in political chaos. Now, we stand here today prepared to sign a new constitution. One that will not only guide us into the future but someday the entirety of Russia as well." The President left the microphone and turned to face the lectern.\n\nMorozov grabbed a pen, and with a flick of his wrist, etched his name on the parchment. After the dead had been done he quickly stepped aside to make way for its next signor, Chairman Liberman. Soon a stream of deputies and ministers flowed to the parchment as names were added.\n\nStepping back, the President took a moment and watched the sight. What had been achieved was truly impressive. The members in the room had made for a truly diverse set of minds. In one corner he could see the socialist provisional governor of Arkhangelsk talking with a particularly curious conservative from across the Vytalka.\n\nIt was funny, the President thought. For so long the two men would have been at each other's throats in the past. Now the two Alexanders before him were discussing like rational individuals, even if they did not always agree. A sigh escaped the President's mouth. If people like Kazembek and Yakovlev could get this far, then what they had achieved was truly something an accomplishment."
 komi_dynamic_SMR.5.a: "Nothing like a forum of consensus."

 komi_dynamic_PSD.1.t: "Plans, Counterplans, and Campaigns"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.1.d: "The General Staff stood at attention as Stalina entered. "At ease," she told them, taking her seat at the head of the table. There was business to attend to, and at the top of the list was the reclamation of Russia. The time was approaching, and she wasn't leaving this room until there was a plan.\n\n"I appreciate your promptness," she began. "But there is work to do. I expect that you have a number of plans already. Gabov, you indicated you've begun this process. Elaborate."\n\n"Yes, ma'am," General Nikolay Gabov said. "Due to the numerous hostile states around us, several plans and counteroffensives in the event of an attack have already been drafted. I am confident that a majority of these plans can be converted into proper offensive campaigns."\n\nShe nodded sharply. "Grigorenko, Pokus, Korolkov, is this feasible? More importantly, will it be effective?"\n\nGeneral Yakov Pokus spoke for the men she'd called out. "I believe it is, for the most part, Madam President," he said. "Obviously, there isn't a clear conversion, but given the limited time, this will allow us to prepare our forces for a campaign, with minimal disruption."\n\n"We have to distribute this to our subordinates," General Korolkov added. "While completely new plans would be optimal, without preparation, it could cause confusion instead of clarity. There are costs and benefits to any plan, but the final decision will be yours."\n\nShe again nodded. This was what she had called them for, and armed with the information they were providing, she expected these issues would be resolved in short order. She expected this would be a productive meeting indeed."
 komi_dynamic_PSD.1.a: ""I concur, and trust your judgement. Give me the details.""

 komi_dynamic_PSD.2.t: "Change Behind Closed Doors"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.2.d: "Stalina pushed open the heavy wooden door as she entered the cramped, windowless room. In her view were all the members of her cabinet and the heads of the two other trustworthy parties in the Republic, Rodionov, and Morozov. The whole room stared at her as she entered. She turned around to lock the doors, keeping her audience waiting. This was a high-level meeting after all she thought, and she was the woman who held all the cards.\n\nAt last, though, she gave them what they wanted. "I have called this meeting today to discuss the future of the Republic. As the Smuta ends we are faced with how to manage future elections. The old systems simply won't work. I was thinking of calling new elections in a few months for the new districts, but I am open to other ideas." At the end of her speech, she turned to Chairwoman Bonner for suggestions.\n\nBonner only smiled as Stalina gave her the stage. "Well, I suggest a four-year alternative. If we don't unify the Urals within four years, we hold new elections. Although, codifying such a thing might require some changes, such as a new constitution." Stalina looked around the room to find it surprisingly calm with the new suggestion.\n\nIn fact, the room found itself in complete agreement with the Chairwoman's suggestion. Not a single complaint was raised, including from the two-party heads. Knowing the two, they probably saw it as an opportunity to take her spot, Stalina thought. However, that would not happen, she would make sure of it.\n\nThe rest of the meeting dragged on, settling the finer details of things. However, the framework was set. As Stalina prepared to unlock the doors, she paused for a second thinking about the future. Truthfully there was a part of her that was scared of failure, but it was nothing new. For she knew she would conquer her challengers, just as she had done so many times before."
 komi_dynamic_PSD.2.a: "Everyone else was just happy they could leave the sweltering room."

 komi_dynamic_PSD.3.t: "Order Among War"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.3.d: "Order. Stalina had always wanted it ever since she found herself in Komi. An end to the chaos, the insanity, and the outright nasty politics. It was the mandate which she was elected under, and she could say that she had delivered, in the middle of war nonetheless.\n\nShe watched as Chairwoman Bonner brought bill after bill for the war through the assembly. Each was crafted meticulously from her experience, and each passed better than she could have imagined. Damn, if it was not beautiful, Stalina thought to herself. Especially knowing all the work would go to preserving the republic.\n\nMost beautiful of all though were the empty seats. No godless communists trying to restart the revolution. No fascists attempting to rebuild the state in the image that destroyed it. Just honest democrats doing the work that should have been done in the first place. Pride and glee set in for the President as she cracked her knuckles in a moment of relaxation.\n\nBeauty was the right word too. There was no yelling among the parties, no threats, and no risk of assassination. All Stalina heard was music, the music of rational debate of sane individuals, free of moronic ramblings. It was even without the threat of those no-good extremists, at that! Indeed, the finely crafted ballet was a magnificent sight to the President, she would have to come back again sometime.\n\nAt last, the play had to come to an end. As the representatives filed out of the National Assembly, Stalina headed for the chairwoman. "That was masterfully done, Bonner, I'm impressed. Genuinely, the whole proceeding was a beautiful display.""
 komi_dynamic_PSD.3.a: "Finally, everyone was working together."

 komi_dynamic_PSD.4.t: "The Economics of War"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.4.d: "In a sturdy tent a ways away from Syktyvkar, Minister of Finance Kantorovich stepped out of the snow to meet his current client. It had been a sudden request, but one at the behest of his boss, President Stalina. Now he stood before one of Komi's most hardened men, General Grigorenko, waiting for him with determination in his eyes.\n\nThe two shook hands before the General cut to the chase. "I need motor vehicles, Minister. Our stretch of Russia is wide and cruel. More transport would go a long way to remedying that. We can only keep ourselves stocked with what we capture for so long." Grigorenko cleared his throat. "That is if President Stalina wants to win this war."\n\nKantorovich scratched the back of his head close to his ear. The general's measly threat stung, but it did not worry him. What did was find a suitable supplier on such short notice. He knew a few who might be willing to help, but they would have a cost. Then again, there was always something coming in after every victory, so it might not be as bad as he originally thought...\n\n"Alright, I'll get you your trucks general." Grigorenko smiled at the news. Before he could reach for a handshake the Minister of Finance continued. "However, I'm going to need a report and access to the next factory you find, preferably one for automobiles or tractors. It would help in securing your trucks."\n\nGrigorenko scratched his chin for a bit before reaching out his hand again. "Fair enough, you've got yourself a deal." Kantorovich smiled knowing he could come through for his boss. As he left the General's tent though, a slight unease followed him. His task was not yet done, and he now had to convince his prospective company with little more than a hefty IOU."
 komi_dynamic_PSD.4.a: "Hopefully they found something soon."

 komi_dynamic_PSD.5.t: "The Start of Something Powerful"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.5.d: "Power was something Stalina had craved throughout her life. She had grown familiar with it through her father, but never truly tasted it until she arrived in Syktyvkar. Now, standing before an assembly of delegates from across West Russia, she could no longer deny her label as anything less than strong, as she prepared to change the face of Russian and world politics forever.\n\nStalina spoke into the mic in front of her. "Thank you to everyone here today. For years this Republic has been plagued with the instability of a weak government wrought upon us by the weak constitution of our forebears. However, now, with the hard work put in by everyone here, we can finally claim the powerful unifying government Russia has always deserved."\n\nThe President turned around and walked to the lectern. Grabbing a pen, she stopped before signing. "With my signature, this constitution will carry us into a new age, one of a someday unified Russia!" In an instant, Stalina signed her name and turned around to be greeted by applause.\n\nGetting out of the way, a line of people soon developed in her place. First was Chairwoman Bonner, followed swiftly by several ministers and delegates. Standing back, Stalina watched as the group before her dutifully signed off on her greatest accomplishment. A smile appeared at the wonderful sight, knowing that all her hard work had paid off.\n\nEventually, the line dwindled, and its previous occupants began talking in the euphoria of the event. President Stalina was no different, finding her way to particular members to network. In particular, were the three Alexanders, new provisional deputies whose influence grew fast in a short time. Solzhenitsyn, Yakovlev, and Kazembek were all curious men, Stalina thought, but she would find ways to work with them in all due time."
 komi_dynamic_PSD.5.a: "A woman's work is never done."

RUS_niki.1.t: "Small Acts"
RUS_niki.1.d: "Captain Nikita Preobrazhensky frowned slightly as he looked at the position of the cat in the tree, and then back to the woman who had ambushed him during his time off. The creature had wedged itself firmly in a fork between the trunk and a thick branch, partially hidden by some leaves. It was a large, fluffy cat, barely tamed, staring down at both of them with the arrogant superiority that only a honed stealth predator could muster.\n\n"Vanya?", the woman cried out once more, prompting precisely no reaction except for another retreat on the animal's part.\n\nNikita placed a gloved hand on the bark. He couldn't help but think that this was hardly an emergency - certainly nothing to pull him from his morning route for - but it was a diversion from his morning raspberry vatrushka routine. With a small sound of exertion, he scaled the first three branches, nimbly flattening himself against the trunk to keep himself steady.\n\nHe heard a voice from behind him. "You're close - just one up!"\n\nHe turned his head over his shoulder to respond. "I see, yes... just a moment, comrade."\n\nHe reached out to the cat, letting it sniff at his glove. His bag hung open over his shoulder. He wrapped an arm around the trunk before hauling himself up again, level with the cat, and presented the bag. It looked at him suspiciously, and let out the precursor of a hiss. A branch tickled Nikita's cheek as he tried to look inviting.\n\n"...shhhh," he said to the cat. "You will get hungry eventually, and best to do that where there is food, yes?"\n\nIf the cat understood him, it left no indication, simply continuing to stare with yellow eyes. Nikita let out a resigned sound and placed the bag's handle in his mouth. With his now-free hand, he reached around the cat and shoved it, causing the startled creature to flop right into his pack. Ignoring the terrifying sounds coming from within and the emergent toothache, he hurriedly slung the bag back over his shoulder and descended. He did his best to look carefully stoic as he placed the pack on the ground and the cat leapt out.\n\n"Vanya!" she said, as the cat weaved between her legs. "Thank you- would you like some water, Captain?" she offered, "It must be difficult work." Her eyes flicked to the door of the nearby apartment building. Nikita couldn't help but give a wry smile back, before responding."
