 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_RURIK_II_DESC: "Major General Nikolay Ivanovich Krylov was once an officer of the Red Army, serving as Chief of Staff for the 62nd Army in battles like Sevastopol and Stalingrad. But as the Great Patriotic War became nothing but great defeats for the Soviets, Krylov was wounded both inside and out, and the stress of constant retreats led to a nervous breakdown. However, the 62nd was unaffected by his affliction, since it had already disintegrated. He and his small band of officers without an army joined the eastward wave of refugees pouring over the Urals, eventually finding his superiors in the Central Siberian Republic. Sent by the Republic to deal with the Anarchist insurgency of the Siberian Black Army, Krylov suffered a humiliating defeat and later faced betrayal by one of his trusted subordinates, General Andreev in Krasnoyarsk, and was forced to retreat his forces in Kemerovo. There, he fell deeper into his stupor, drinking or smoking whatever he could get his hands on to dull his pain and guilt.\n\nBut one day, it suddenly changed. After an evening locked naked in his room with nothing but a carton of cigarettes, three bottles of vodka, and a book on Orthodox mysticism, he walked out proclaiming that he had been ordered to reunite Russia. By whom? He declines to say. His officer comrades were worried for his mental state, a fear exacerbated when Krylov crowned himself as 'Rurik II, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus.' However, their concerns were drowned out by a wave of support from soldiers and mercenaries, drawn by promises of conquest and glory.\n\nRurik preaches an eclectic mix of Russian traditionalism and Soviet militarism. He claims to be the heir to the Tsarist tradition, yet despises the Romanovs; he talks about the virtue of Vladimir the Great, but is atheist and dismisses priests as "charlatans and wizards". His motley ideology is represented by his supporters, a mix of reactionaries, Soviet veterans, and soldiers of fortune. Some in his officer corps suspect that the whole "Rurik" act is simply a charade to rally the peasants' support; if it is, he is doing an exceptionally good job at staying in character."

 POLITICS_KING_YURIY_DESC: "If you had told Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov two decades ago that he would one day stand at the helm of a rejuvenated Russian monarchy, he would've no doubt been in a state of sheer disbelief. Yet, in a truly bizarre series of events, Yuriy has risen to become the undisputed successor to his father's almost heroic legacy.\n\nAs a young man, Yuriy took after his father and joined the army of the Central Siberian Republic as an officer, where he distinguished himself as an energetic and capable leader. During his time on the front, he saw firsthand the devastating effects of war upon the poor and disadvantaged of Russia. Although he continued to rise through the ranks, Yuriy became frustrated with his inability to make a real difference in the name of the people.\n\nYuriy's life would soon become even more hectic when his father suffered what appeared to be a severe mental break. When he emerged again as Rurik II, he was quick to establish his progeny as nobility in his self-proclaimed kingdom. After a short period of confusion and concern for his father, Prince Yuriy eventually came to see the kingdom as a chance to make his ideals a reality. The path towards the crown was fraught with political intrigue, but despite these challenges Yuriy would eventually be named as Rurik II's rightful successor.\n\nNow christened as Rurik III in honor of his late father, the King intends to make good on his lofty goals. Under his reign, Rurik III intends to lay the foundations of a more fair and just kingdom, one which looks to the rights of its people first and foremost."

 POLITICS_QUEEN_LYDIA_DESC: "From the chaos and confusion of the Russian warlord era arises Rogneda I, the Wolf Queen of Rus'. The woman formerly known as Lydia Krylova's rise to power was nothing short of meteoric, and she now stands tall as the most powerful authority of the resurrected Russian nation.\n\nIt was not always destined to be like this. Once upon a time, Lydia was a volunteer nurse helping with the rear echelon of the Central Siberian Republic's military. What she witnessed during her time shaped her character dramatically: countless men and women putting their lives on the line for causes they did not fully understand, without any indication that their sacrifices were making a difference. Russia was dying, and this could not be more tangible to Lydia, who was able to witness the effects of these death throes with her own eyes.\n\nWhen her father emerged from his mental lapse as Rurik II, Lydia immediately saw this as her opportunity to turn the tide. As the Kingdom's power continued to grow, so too did the Wolf Princess'. Eventually, she was forced to compete with her own brother for the throne, but her passionate and ruthless drive saw Lydia through to take his place as Rurik II's rightful heir.\n\nNewly reborn as Queen Rogneda, she intends to restore strength and honor to the wounded Russian nation, no matter what the cost may be."

 ### Ideas ###
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom: "Esoteric Kingdom"
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom_desc: "His Majesty Rurik II is a man burning with desire to see all traitors and all despoilers of Holy Russia perish. Normally, this would be the kind of man our shattered land would need, but his mental state has led to him developing some... interesting ideas as to how the Restoration of the Motherland should proceed. Some may find hope and inspiration in his drive, true, but most of his neighbors would only see a madman."

 KEM_the_two_wolves: "The Two Wolves"
 KEM_the_two_wolves_desc: "The King's children, Yuriy and Lydia, while both exemplary advisors and administrators, each have their own, radically different ways of governance. Prince Yuriy favors a lighter, more populist touch, and urges his father to give his subjects the power to decide their own fates.\n\nPrincess Lydia, on the other hand, espouses a more militaristic, hierarchical ideal. She urges her father to closen his relationship with the military and to distance himself from the commoners, for none of them are as fit as he to wear the burden of leadership upon their shoulders."

 KEM_kings_unions: "The King's Unions"
 KEM_kings_unions_desc: "In a bizarre symbiosis of the ancient ways of the Rus and the modern ideals of the Bolsheviks, King Rurik has declared that trade unions will be free to operate within reason. This has, surprisingly, served the King well, as the peasants who might otherwise call for his overthrow are now placated by their state-sponsored Unions. However, if the people are given a taste of freedom, who knows where it may lead them?"

 KEM_kings_unions_2: "Royal Unions Strengthened"
 KEM_kings_unions_2_desc: "Following national developments, the trade unions operating within the state have been strengthened, and operate with even fewer restrictions or oversight than before. Workers and union officials have indicated their pleasure at these developments, confident that they represent their King's concern for their situation."

 KEM_kings_unions_3: "Royal Unions Unshackled"
 KEM_kings_unions_3_desc: "Trade unions within the state have been nearly entirely unshackled, operating with a freedom uncommon outside of ostensibly socialist states. Workers across the nation rejoice, extremely pleased that their King cares enough about their conditions to permit their association."

 KEM_unions_subdued: "Royal Unions Subdued"
 KEM_unions_subdued_desc: "The Royal Unions have been subdued, with their rights restricted and with more stringent regulations imposed upon them. Workers across the nation are, understandably, quite upset at this development, while others insist that they simply do not understand that the state has more productive ideas in mind for their organization."

 KEM_unions_subdued2: "Royal Guilds"
 KEM_unions_subdued2_desc: "The Royal Unions have been restructured into the Royal Guilds. These institutions will ensure that the workers over which they exercise oversight are working harmoniously in support of the state and its goals. As a secondary function, they also manage workforce concerns to the greatest degree reasonably possible without impeding efficiency."

 KEM_idea_raising_an_army: "Raising An Army"
 KEM_idea_raising_an_army_desc: "Conscription has been introduced into the realm in an effort to rapidly expand the military's size. Though this is of course necessary to ensure proper security against the state's many enemies, it is extremely unpopular with the common people, and will hamper the government's political endeavors."

 KEM_revolutionary_king: "Revolutionary King"
 KEM_revolutionary_king_desc: "At the behest of Prince Yuriy, King Rurik's revolutionary past and service in the Red Army has been emphasized in state propaganda. In doing so, the commitment of the state to those ideals will be reinforced, and the people will see that the King leads by example."

 KEM_a_new_sobor: "A New Sobor"
 KEM_a_new_sobor_desc: "Continuing reforms, the Zemsky Sobor has been increasingly empowered and given authority over various state functions. Intended to facilitate eventual transition of the state to a democratic parliamentary monarchy, this action serves to decisively prove this commitment to the people."

 KEM_militarist_king: "Militarist King"
 KEM_militarist_king_desc: "At the behest of Princess Lydia, King Rurik's military triumphs in past service, against both the Germans and the insurgent anarchists of the Black Army, have been emphasized in state propaganda. In doing so, the people will see that the state remains surrounded by enemies, and that a powerful and expanded military is necessary."

 KEM_a_new_hierarchy: "A New Hierarchy"
 KEM_a_new_hierarchy_desc: "Continuing reforms, Princess Lydia has decreed her intention to establish a new social order, and thus a societal hierarchy. Naturally, military officers and noble aristocrats are positioned at the top - such is the only correct course of action, after all as, absent proper leadership, how can anything of note be accomplished?"

 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy: "Kingsguard Primacy"
 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy_desc: "The Kingsguard has expanded its influence on the state's political affairs at the behest of Princess Lydia, with many of its officers accepting positions of importance overseen by her faction in the pursuit of future wealth, status, and glory."

 KEM_kingsguard_academy: "Kingsguard Academy"
 KEM_kingsguard_academy_desc: "In an effort to ensure that the state's future army is led by properly trained and professional officers, the Kingsguard Academy has been established. It is expected that the positive effects of this professionalization will be observed within the military in short order."

 KEM_pride_of_the_king: "Pride of the King"
 KEM_pride_of_the_king_desc: "United behind their King, the state's military is motivated, enthusiastic, and eager to march in support of his goals and political vision. Though the soldiery is well aware that challenges will be faced, they are just as equally confident that their King will guide them to eventual victory."

 KEM_the_peoples_guard: "The People's Guard"
 KEM_the_peoples_guard_desc: "At Prince Yuriy's insistence, the Kingsguard has been disbanded and replaced with the People's Guard, a force that he, and many others, consider to be far less concerned with their own position and primacy, and more concerned with the protection of the state and its citizenry."

 KEM_ship_expansion: "Constructing a Royal Fleet"
 KEM_ship_expansion_desc: "With the acquisition of a coastline, the state has committed to the construction of a number of warships in order to patrol and secure its territorial waters. Targeted investments have been made in order to ensure rapid production."

 KEM_trade_deals: "Lucrative Trade Deals"
 KEM_trade_deals_desc: "Promoting economic expansion, the state has sent diplomats to many foreign countries to both negotiate favorable trade deals and invite foreign businesses to establish operations. These efforts cannot but generate lucrative rewards."

 KEM_wartime_industry_idea: "Wartime Industry"
 KEM_wartime_industry_idea_desc: "With Central Siberia embroiled in conflict, we too should gear our economy towards war. The King has decreed that all industry should shift towards military production and that all industrial efforts should be doubled."

 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king: "Reign of the Mad King"
 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king_desc: "Nikolay Krylov, now known as Rurik the Second, has so far proved to be an exceptionally eccentric ruler. His rule thus far has demonstrated his continuous ability to contradict himself on several subjects, and few believe that this ability will end any time soon. The Mad King has also decided upon strengthening the military in order to strike out against our neighbors, which he sees as rebellious subjects.\n\nThere is clearly plenty the King has to do before he can embark on the warpath. The King's children are both attempting to persuade His Highness to follow their visions for how to prepare the kingdom for the future wars. Judgments will have to be made on whether to follow the populist policies of Prince Yuriy or the brutal pragmatism of Princess Lydia.\n\nRurik will need to determine the direction of the economy, the army and the society he wishes to establish. Once these challenges have been overcome, we can set out on the warpath."

 KEM_the_kings_industry: "The King's Industry"
 KEM_the_kings_industry_desc: "After the past deterioration of our standing in the region, it was assumed that we were doomed to obscurity due to our complete lack of fortune. Or so it seemed. However, we still control the industrious city of Kemerovo.\n\nIf we were to utilize and advance the output of the city, producing new guns and equipment, equipping freshly trained soldiers and extending these plans to enhance our infrastructure, improving the mobility of our army and workers. Maybe we could once again take our place as a relevant contender in the region under the ambitious King Rurik II."

 KEM_support_the_unions: "Support the Unions"
 KEM_support_the_unions_desc: "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nCrown Prince Yuriy Krylov has expressed his support for the existing trade unions, emphasizing how expansion of our output will never be sustainable without the support of the workers in the factories.\n\nThis choice will pose a bizarre conflict to the new monarchy which his majesty has created, but such an unusual contradiction will be nothing new to those who know the King."
 KEM_chose_econ_Y: "Chose §MPrince Yuriy's§! economic proposal."

 KEM_the_will_of_the_people: "The Will of the People"
 KEM_the_will_of_the_people_desc: "Now that His Highness has decided to follow a more progressive approach to our economy, we shall endeavour to begin laying out the new foundations of our supportive economy.\n\nNew legislation will be put into place to protect the rights of the kingdom's loyal and diligent industrial workers and unions will be strengthened. Popular policies like these will be necessary if we are to keep our working classes devoted to the cause of the King.\n\nFor the will of the people shall not be ignored as long as King Rurik is around to hear it."

 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king: "And the Power of the King"
 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king_desc: "His Highness has heard the outcry of the people and he has listened, our recent attempts at restructuring the economy have proved very popular with the poorer members of our society.\n\nThe workers' conditions have already begun to improve, along with popular support for the King's rule. But if these trends are to continue, power will have to remain in the hands of the King, after all his grace has proved himself to be a worthy leader of the working classes.\n\nThe cooperation of the people with the authority of the monarch will be required if our economy is to improve."

 KEM_a_change_in_course: "A Change in Course"
 KEM_a_change_in_course_desc: "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nPrincess Lydia Krylova has planned to set out a proposal to the economic minister, Lev Voznesensky, which would undermine the current rights of workers, but significantly increase the extent of our production. After all, trade unions and collective action will only serve their own interests and oppose the greater aspirations of the King. If we were to put these plans into action, the King may lose the support of the workers in the future.\n\nWe must hope they can see the kingdom's true potential."
 KEM_chose_econ_L: "Chose §LPrincess Lydia's§! economic proposal."
 
 KEM_lean_right: "Lean Right"
 KEM_lean_right_desc: "The time has come to break with the outdated economic system that our kingdom currently upholds, unions and workers' rights have proven only to be obstacles to our economic potential.\n\nRemoving these laws and significantly reducing the power of the unions, will certainly benefit our short term output and remove a substantial amount of power from the hands of the union leaders. But we continue to run the risk of antagonizing the working classes, as they still believe that the old system works best for them.\n\nRegardless of this risk, we shall push ahead with the necessary reforms to unleash our as yet unrealized economic potential."

 KEM_a_truly_free_market: "A Truly Free Market"
 KEM_a_truly_free_market_desc: "Following the success of our recent reforms to the economy, it is obvious that we should continue to pursue the plan put forward by Princess Lydia and liberate the markets from its remaining restrictions.\n\nState intervention will be limited and the last of the unions will be muzzled, in order to create an environment for a truly free market.\n\nSoon we will only need to wait for the inevitable boost to the efficiency of our industry that will inevitably arrive, establishing a great advantage over our surrounding enemies."

 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age: "An Economy for the Modern Age"
 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age_desc: "We have, at long last, completed the necessary reforms to our industry that will develop a suitable base for future production. The direction of the royal economy has ultimately been decided, for better or for worse, the days of our ineffective economy are gone, and Kemerovo has truly become home to an economy fit for the modern age. The extra capacity that our changes have brought will prove instrumental to our future prospects in the region.\n\nHis Majesty is pleased with the kingdom's progress, there is now a lot less holding back the King's immense ambitions."

 KEM_the_kings_society: "The King's Society"
 KEM_the_kings_society_desc: "The order of the kingdom's society is yet to be determined, two clear options from His Highness's children have emerged. First, the ideals of Prince Yuriy, which would remarkably improve the political rights of the people of Kemerovo and promote equality amongst the population.\n\nAlternatively, Princess Lydia offers a more pragmatic vision of Kemerovo's society, which would entail closer links with the military and an enforcement of a strict hierarchy to ensure stability.\n\nWhoever King Rurik decides to follow, will have an increase in their power and influence within the realm."

 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals: "Prince Yuriy's Ideals"
 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals_desc: "Crown Prince Yuriy, the heir to the throne, has attempted to influence the King to make reforms to increase the freedoms and power of the people. The prince argues that his idealistic vision will inspire people, whereas his sister's bleak, repressive structure for society will only create resentment.\n\nA liberated population will limit resistance to the rule of the King; our subjects throughout the rest of Central Siberia will also be less inclined to resist us.\n\nPrince Yuriy assures His Highness that these adjustments will ensure the realm's stability and prospects for the future."

Not used since the seventeenth century, the Sobor had been recreated in Kemerovo to give the subjects access to the King.\n\nGiving more power to the Sobor will make the people's voice even more important to the King. It will also bring Prince Yuriy closer to building a truly democratic and representative parliamentary monarchy that serves the people."

 KEM_princess_lydias_pragmatism_desc: "Contrary to her brother's beliefs, Princess Lydia believes in a pragmatic approach when it comes to modeling the King's society. She has endeavoured to sway King Rurik to her beliefs by undermining Prince Yuriy's attempts to force His Highness to surrender more and more power to the people.\n\nInstead, she insists that the King should rule in an increasingly authoritarian manner, employing the force of the royal armed forces to keep his people in check. All that Princess Lydia believes will come of her brothers reforms is weakness or worse, revolution.\n\nSo, for the sake of the stability and longevity of the kingdom, she will continue to endorse the formation of an authoritarian kingdom."

The new model of society has started to bring stability to the realm, something that has relieved everyone, from the farmer toiling on their collective farm, to the King himself.\n\nHis Highness hopes that the internal squabbles between his children have ended, not just for the sake of his own threadbare sanity, but also the kingdom's longevity as a whole."

The military needs to be changed if we want to have any hope of defending ourselves and defeating the rebellious subjects outside our borders.\n\nTo make an army our King would be proud of, our small forces must be increased to a full standing army to defend the nation. That means even more men will need to join our forces if we want to have the chance at victory. We must also increase our military production to arm the new recruits. Lastly, our tactics must be retouched to fight a modern war in the Siberian Wasteland. The Royal Army must never lose!"

 KEM_a_conscripted_force_desc: "A larger army is required to defend our realm, and the only possible way to increase our military's size is conscription. Our army will be backed up by conscripts which should give us a lot more infantry to be able to train. This gives us the chance to mobilize light infantry which would be able to back up our heavier armed regular infantry in wartime.\n\nStill, this will not be popular with the people. We will need to conscript laborers and farmers, and they won't be happy with leaving their homes and workplaces.

Our enemies will fear our might when they see the superiority of our army combined with tanks that can turn them into dust! Mixed with motorized infantry we will roll over all hostile armies with impunity.\n\nHowever, armored divisions may take a while to train, but the reward once we mobilize them will still be immense. We will have the speed and strength not just to defend, but also to conquer. We must make it worth our effort though, losing too many tanks that we will not be able to reproduce will be costly."

 KEM_the_kings_speech_desc: "This is a story.\n\nOnce, there was a good general who lost everything he knew to monsters. Cold, desperate, and fearing for the safety of his surviving men, the general made a great sacrifice. He broke from the past, took upon the heavy weight of a crown, and set upon a quest to protect all those within his company.\n\nNow, ages past, that quest seems less of a fool's errand. The general-made-King has made a place for himself and his people. He has vanquished beasts and driven back the darkness. On the border of Central Siberia, he prepares for the next great chapter of his story: the reunification of his homeland."

 KEM_yuriy_the_long_arm_desc: "Many years ago, the general-made-King begot a son. The boy, Yuriy, grew up in a time of war and exile, of famine and defeat, of suffering and death. He came to know all the evil of the world and, instead of numbing his senses, he committed himself to thwarting it. He would be the good and just hero that his people needed.\n\nLike his father, Yuriy took upon a quest. He dedicated himself to improving and expanding his father's domain in Kemerovo. Guided by the greatest civil servants of the kingdom, he set forth to make the city a modern place protected from the petty scheming of his sister and the sinister machinations of the Boyars. He knew that only by proving himself here could he hope to succeed his father."

 KEM_revive_the_kontsy: "Revive the Kontsy"
 KEM_revive_the_kontsy_desc: "The first labor that the prince encountered was one of stewardship. Though Kemerovo had once prospered as a mining town, the logic of empire meant it could not remain as such. The capital of a kingdom needed to be vibrant, diverse. It needed to be a place where many people of many trades could work and prosper.\n\nFor many nights, the prince consulted his advisors and tomes. Then, while reading of ancient Novgorod, inspiration hit him. He could apply the long-dead city's kontsy, its varied boroughs, to Kemerovo. He could divide the city into several regions, each dedicated to a different trade or profession."

 KEM_work_with_our_subjects_desc: "The next labor was one of diplomacy. While the good King had earned much acclaim from his subjects for his achievements in battle, his son was untried and untested. Many feared that he would recklessly remake their city, that he would uproot the poor to support his fanciful designs.\n\nThe prince set about combating these fears. In every neighborhood of the city, the good prince held court, gathering his subjects so that they could share their hopes and fears with him and his agents. Through these "public hearings," the prince and his advisors harnessed the people's will and ensured the city grew in ways that respected the wishes of the people within it."

 KEM_elected_posadniks: "Elected Posadniks"
 KEM_elected_posadniks_desc: "Through his tireless sacrifices, the prince completed his quest. Hearings received positive responses. Merchants provided funding to support great renovations. The hum of construction could be heard all across the city.\n\nBut, more than that, the prince used his administrative skill to realize one more innovation, one reform that person after person had called for him to implement: Elections. Rather than being led by nobles, the prince decreed that the people of Kemerovo would be led by whomever they chose. The city would not be subjected to leaders selected by the accident of birth - but by skill."

For, without his knowledge, his sister and all the scheming Boyars had entered into an alliance against him.\n\nWithin days, the plans to remake Kemerovo unraveled. Public hearings received no visitors or hostile audiences. Funding for great works vanished. Construction stalled. In the end, all that remained of the prince's grand design were drawings on paper and the sad knowledge of what might have been."

 KEM_royal_manufacturies: "Royal Manufacturies"
 KEM_royal_manufacturies_desc: "Unsatisfied, the prince persisted in his labors. He spent long days and nights with engineers and craftsmen, hearing their fears of the kingdom's survival. He toured city streets, aware of the monsters pressing in upon his father's armies. He watched as shipment after shipment left Kemerovo for the frontlines.\n\nThough he lacked the martial spirit of his sister, the prince knew he needed to act. With a flourish of his pen, he granted each of Kemerovo's largest factories the royal seal of approval. He would allow them to use government funds to expand their operations and divert activity toward military production."

 KEM_all_flows_through_kemerovo_desc: "Not all stories are ones of great battles and conquests, of brave knights and fair maidens. Some of the greatest stories are about good men and their wits. They are about those who ignore the temptation of adventure for the hard work of governing and administration.\n\nIn the end, that was what Yuriy's story was. He was no great warrior, no masterful strategist or tactician, but he was a man who listened to his people and sought to preserve their prosperity. Though there was much work still to be done, his efforts ensured Kemerovo could act as a leading city in Central Siberia, a staging ground for the fights—military and political—in the days to come."

 KEM_advice_from_boris: "A Word From Boris"

The sister fought for the nation, for the dynasty, for authority. The brother fought for the people, for their liberties, for their rights. And their father, his heart filled with love for his children, could do nothing to stop their strife.\n\nYet the King had birthed another son, free of the ambition that haunted his kin. This son, the second son, sought only to keep his family together. His name was Boris, and he knew that something needed to be done.\n\nAnd so, he came to his father with a request..."

To the outside world, it was simply to gauge its general quality in the wars to come; to determine if it could weather the trials and tribulations ahead.\n\nOnly Boris and Rurik could know its real purpose - to evaluate the effect of the courtly bickering on the staff.

Some, however, clung to ways of old, refusing to see valuable changes. An ancient class of staff only wanted to grow their prestige, and not a nation.\n\nRurik thought for days on how to resolve the issue. Yet in a moment of idle thought, the perfect plan came to his mind. He should expand the army, grow the ranks of conscripts, and through this isolate the old cranks who turned brother against brother. Certainly, the recruits would favor Yuriy, but how could that compare to a world of petty dictators?"

 KEM_favor_lydias_shieldmaidens: "Favor Lydia's Shieldmaidens"
 KEM_favor_lydias_shieldmaidens_desc: "Yet there would come no good tidings for Kemerovo. The army was filled with insubordination on every level. Youthful gangs refused the good commands of their betters, instead siding with those radicals who had no legal authority over them. The men and women of Kemerovo were forgetting their King.\n\nRurik easily came to a solution, for it was one Lydia had suggested for many years. The Shieldmaidens, her well-picked elite squadrons, would become an example from which all soldiers would aspire. They would likely favor Lydia, of course, but that was preferable to an army of immature brats!"

 KEM_a_militia_of_hope_desc: "With the army given to the people, an air of joy came across the people of Kemerovo. No longer would they have to fight for weak rulers and petty despots; for men with no vision of the reunification to come. No longer was there reason to fear the calls to arms, and the commands of those from on high.\n\nNay, their leaders were kings and queens in the making! A royal family whose love for their people matched their skill on the battlefield.

Yet they were so blinded that they could not see what they were doing to their people. The hearts of Kemerovo wept for these poor siblings, while their minds grew listless and confused.\n\nIn times of war, Kemerovo needed to sing with one voice, steady and true, until the last armies were scattered across the land. Whatever rivalries plagued the court, they would have to wait. Even if Yuriy and Lydia's schism was unmendable, it would need to be postponed - for King and for Country."

Her Shieldmaidens had been primarily used for special operations, but she saw potential in them for something greater.\n\nThe armies of the ancient Rus had been well equipped with druzhinas, personal retinues of the most well-trained horsemen. The age of the horse had of course passed - but new inventions could fill its role.

The play rooms stood empty, no longer home to scheming advisors. The bedrooms were filled with slumbering helpers, no longer entranced by the sibling feud. Even the grand hall stood quiet, aside from the occasional guard on patrol.\n\nOnly in the war room could one hear the family stir. Every Rurikid voice spoke out, tones high and low, well into the night. But the air carried no tension. Their shouting was not out of anger, but raw excitement, the glory of creativity in the wars to come. Each knew it could fade in time. Each knew that politics might soon rear their ugly head. But if only for today, the Rurikid family was whole."

 KEM_lydia_the_seer: "Lydia the Varangian"

She saw him return from wars, wounded and haggard. At night, she heard him weeping in his bed at the men he had lost, and the suffering of his people. Instead of numbing herself to this pain, she committed herself to stopping it. She would be the strong and valiant hero that her people needed.\n\nLike her father, Lydia took upon a quest. She dedicated herself to strengthening and reinforcing her father's conquests across his large kingdom. She would seed the nobility that had sprung up outside her castle's walls throughout the lands, and appoint them as new overseers and administrators. Through their leadership, she could centralize the kingdom's government. She knew that only by proving herself here, could she hope to succeed her father."

While she had always considered her home—with its stone facade and underground, reinforced chambers—as a castle, it was not truly one. Indeed, it was a small, squat building; a mere old military outpost, easily dwarfed by the city and trees beyond.\n\nThis would not do. Consulting her advisors and tomes, the princess was determined to renovate her home. She would give her beloved father the war rooms and defenses he deserved.

She needed people who could act on the crown's behalf.\n\nFor the good of the realm, the princess swallowed her pride and went among the petty Boyars. With honeyed words and the sweet promise of glory, she urged them to spread out across the realm and serve in the army as governors of the new territories.

No. She would revive the spirit of the people and their armies. She would transfigure the decrepit institutions of old into something new and vibrant. She would instigate a cultural revolution.\n\nThe commissars cast aside their red stars, their hammers, and their sickles. In their place, they took up imperial eagles, swords, and shields.

For, without her knowledge, her brother and his scheming courtesans poisoned her honeyed words. Every Boyar that she promised glory received a letter informing them of the dangers of the countryside. Each lord spoken to about the importance of history instead received meager, demeaning posts.\n\nDeprived of noble leadership, the princess's efforts faltered. Morale declined and confusion reigned. Kemerovo's armies had none to guide them but the aging general-made-king. In the end, all that remained of the princess's grand ambitions were scrapped promises, and tear-soaked parchment."

 KEM_old_history_new_media_desc: "The cultural campaign continued faster and faster, spread along by television and radio to every corner of the map.\n\nThrough films and posters, the princess and her advisors reminded the people that they were not men and women living in the ruins of an empire but one part of a long, unbroken chain. For one thousand years, their land had prospered. For one thousand years it had produced great art, science, and military feats. Under the rule of House Krylov, they would achieve glory again. Their story would never end."

 KEM_the_volost_system: "The Volost System"
 KEM_the_volost_system_desc: "Every great story of conquest is a triumph of logistics, of great networks of men and women working together in common cause. The princess knew this fact better than anyone in the kingdom. Over weeks, she wove together the disparate peoples of the kingdom into something that would withstand the monsters that threatened to consume them.\n\nThe result was not pretty, but victory rarely is. What Lydia created was a union between the new and the old, between peasant self-rule and military order, between the old Volosts of Kievan Rus and the Soviet administrative system. With this new model, she would beat back the darkness. Though there was much work still to be done, her efforts ensured Kemerovo could act as a leading empire in Central Siberia, a staging ground for the fights—military and political—in the days to come."

The King is in no doubt on who shall feel our might first: his once trusted comrade, General Andreev, whose betrayal came at the most burdensome time of the King's attempts to contain and defeat the anarchist insurgency of the Siberian Black Army.\n\nAll of the hurt and humiliation his grace felt shall not go unpunished. In time Kemerovo and Krasnoyarsk will shortly be reunited, from there we can turn our attention to our numerous other opponents.\n\nThe start of our actualization has just begun, and King Rurik II sees this as only the beginning of our reunification of the entirety of our great empire."

His Highness has made it clear that he is willing to show more mercy to them than he did with their treacherous general.\n\nAs such the Tsar has commanded that the army immediately set about integrating these new generals into our army, the sooner the better. After these talented new officers have been combined with our own, we will certainly be much more prepared for the inevitable conflicts of the future."

 KEM_the_trial_of_andreev_desc: "Following our recent triumphant victory over Krasnoyarsk, their leader, General Andreev, now stands before the mercy of King Rurik; the man who had abandoned him at his lowest. Andreev's great betrayal had affected Rurik greatly. The drinking, the smoking, the humiliation and the guilt. All these habits and feelings appeared to have passed after that fateful evening of his transformation.\n\nBut the betrayal had never left. And now that the King has been reunited with his bitter rival, he will finally put Andreev on trial for his treason. All that remains is to administer a suitable punishment.\n\nOne severe enough that no one will ever again think to forsake his majesty ever again."

Old administrators are to be replaced, new flags are being brought in and the image of General Andreev shall vanish from the streets of Krasnoyarsk.\n\nAfter we have imposed Rurik's authority over his new subjects our position in the region will be far stronger. The state will soon be ready to remove the remaining opponents of his grace that skulk around us.\n\nIt is now seeming that it is only a matter of time before his majesty will rule over all our enemies."

The odd ways of their leader Zavoloko has led to unity and stability with the native Altaic people despite the vast cultural differences of. The peoples of Oyrotia have truly earned the respect of His Highness; as such his grace has determined to send a proposition to Oyrotia.\n\nThey shall be granted an opportunity to surrender to the King in return for his protection.

 KEM_the_power_of_myth_desc: "The strange ways of Oyrotia continue to intrigue the King, who has become increasingly interested in orthodox mysticism. His excellency has commanded that a number of mystic advisors be invited to his court as swiftly as possible. The arrival of these holy men will certainly cause some confusion due to the King's known cynicism of religion and past dismissal of priests, although this would not be the greatest change the King has been through.\n\nOld Believers in the recently occupied lands of Oyrotia are sure to approve this decision and the benefits that it will bring to their conditions. These new spiritual guides are bound to hold great influence over his grace and thus have considerable power and prestige within the kingdom."

The anarchist insurgency which has caused substantial embarrassment to his grace over the past few years because of his defeat shortly before being abandoned by General Andreev.\n\nPreparations are to be made by the army before they are to re-enter the region. They were forced to retreat from just a few years ago, but our strength has since grown greatly.

The workers' councils, left over from the rule of the Siberian Black Army, have continued to run the region after its surrender; and the King sees little reason to remove them.\n\nAllowing such organizations to continue to run would be bizarre for any normal monarchy, the rule of Rurik the Second will only continue to be anything but a normal monarchy.\n\nAnd so, we will maintain the workers' councils, in the interests of equality and the unity of all the loyal subjects of King Rurik."

The strongest part of the old People's Revolutionary Council was the Red Army and the strategies and skill that its officers and soldiers employed. The remnant of the Red Army has already proved its effectiveness, especially in its recent war with Mengjiang.\n\nHis Excellency has suggested that our army should set about utilizing these tactics for our own cause for our future battles.\n\nWith the methods of the Red Army and the wisdom of Rurik the second we will prevail."

His subjects rely on his strength and wisdom for guidance in trying times, and nowhere are times more trying than the shattered statelets of Russia. In short, the King must lead.\n\nHis Majesty Rurik II is already preparing a speech in order to bolster the flagging spirits of our soldiers.

His Majesty, the one who channels all the creative force of the people, must respond to this waiting crisis.\n\nStreets and railroads will be restored and more, reliving the great infrastructure projects of the old tsars.

The extent of his realm is too great to be supervised entirely from his seat in Kemerovo. The time has come to delegate helpers, the eyes and ears of His Majesty in the newly conquered lands. The establishment of royal governorates will vastly streamline the process of ruling.\n\nNaturally, the officer class are the best candidates for these new positions. They fought to add them into the kingdom, they know the land, and they have the respect of the people and soldiers. For their efforts, they can expect handsome rewards and the honors of royalty in the form of official titles."

The remnants of this regime remain in power up north, centered in the city of Tomsk where, cut off from industry, the military, or the broader masses, feuding cliques of intellectuals wage petty feuds over ideology while their people suffer for lack of leadership.\n\nThe final death of the CSR and its weakness cannot come until His Majesty marches his forces through the capital of their successor statelet.

With luck, Prince Yuriy's plan will ensure that the people of the region remain loyal to their new King."

Princess Lydia has devised a broad plan to essentially keep the region under control with an iron-clad fist.\n\nThe bureaucracy of the previous administration will be removed, and in its place the Princess hopes to create a new set of laws aimed at suppressing dissent.

Alexander Pokryshkin and his corrupt oligarchs rule the state with an iron grip, and are in command of a formidable army as well as the largest air force in the region. It is only a matter of time before they turn their sights to us, and the King wishes to be the one to strike first.\n\nOnce Novosibirsk and their forces have been crushed by the King's finest, the finest air facilities in Siberia will be at our disposal, and Rurik shall be one giant step closer to reuniting the region under his banner.

 KEM_the_breadbasket_of_siberia_desc: "The plains of Barnaul are some of the most fertile grounds in all of Siberia, and have long existed as the sinews of a critically important agricultural hub. With these areas finally under the King's protection, we can begin to utilize them for our own benefit. Not only can we make improvements of our own to increase output, but we could also examine the layout of the vast farmlands to see if we can't apply them in agricultural regions throughout the entire realm.\n\nWith a little hard work, we will be able to ensure that, at last, the people of His Majesty's realm will no longer go hungry, and that our soldiers can fight on a full stomach for once. These advantages alone will place our young principality head and shoulders above the rest of the warlord statelets."

This region has long been renowned for its extensive industrial centers, and was at one time the beating heart of Russia's once-mighty industry. Now that they are within our hands, we can begin a large-scale effort to refurbish and modernize the factories to get the most out of their potential output. Many of the factories are now quite old by modern standards, and bringing them up to speed should be our top priority.\n\nOnce we have reestablished Central Siberia as the industrial heartland it once was, our realm will be the envy of our neighbors, and we will be able to produce armaments and munitions like never before to ensure our soldiers are some of the most well equipped in all of Russia."

Our realm is no longer a miniscule statelet barely able to keep the wilderness outside Kemerovo under control, but a proper and established government ready to take our cause to glorious new heights. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to call ourselves the Principality of Kemerovo when the King now rules over so much more.\n\nThe King has laid forth plans to reforge his state into a new entity: The Grand Principality of Siberia. Creating this new principality will solidify our stance as the one legitimate authority in the long-divided lands of Siberia, and triumphantly proclaim to the world that Russia is finally on the road to reunification."

 KEM_a_kingdom_of_contradictions_desc: "Once, a long time ago, Russia was a land of valor and loyalty. But with the ages came decadence, and the people forgot their roots. Fascism, communism, democracy... it's all the same. Wolves, who would lure the Russian to their lair. The nation's survival lies at the source - a mighty kingdom, led by a just King. Tsar Rurik II, in his eternal majesty, shall waste no time in healing the wounds of Russia, starting here, in Siberia itself.\n\nBut Rurik II is understanding of his people's needs. He will not embrace decadence, but take the best of all worlds. Help the workers, not because of revolution, but out of benevolence! Maintain the old ways, but not corrupt them like the fascists! Give the people justice, without compromising the rule of the Tsar! Some may find this style of rule erratic, irrational even, but they are blind to the future, which is the past - ignorant of tradition, which is perpetual.\n\nHail Tsar Rurik II, Monarch of all Rus', Shield of Siberia, King of Kings!"

A central location could alleviate future logistical issues, as well as inspire the people - after all, Kemerovo was forced to be the seat of the Tsar because of necessity, but now we can afford the luxury of choice."

 KEM_a_new_aristocracy_desc: "In these turbulent times, men elect to follow those with the biggest purse and gun. A good subject is hard to find, but harder to maintain. The Principality of Siberia is full of opportunists and men of low morals, but they are fodder - the Tsar's advisors, generals, and local leaders shall be rewarded for their loyalty with landed titles.\n\nUseful individuals of poor character will be given honorary, empty titles, and eventually marginalized until devoted men come along. Commanders will be given fiefdoms in the form of villages and camps, so that they can muster custom forces for upcoming campaigns. Mayors and advisors shall receive large settlements to foster economic growth and development.\n\nNaturally, there will be those who decry the nobility as "corrupt" and "archaic". What they do not understand, however, is that an aristocracy organizes the population in a unique way - while the rest of Rus suffers from a lack of hierarchy, we will be planting the seeds for a better tomorrow."

However, with the coming of the treacherous Hun and Japanese, old monuments have been lost, demolished and desecrated.\n\nFortunately, there is no shortage of epics in Siberia, recent tales of courage and the Tsar's might. Plans are already being laid - statues of Rurik II will observe the kingdom from mountaintops, city centers will be decorated with shrines to the bravest of the Kingsguard, every factory shall have a monument to inspire its workers.\n\nCenturies later, when Russia has climbed out of the grave, our children will look back and marvel at the victories we have won here today."

Tsar Rurik himself will oversee the creation of new legislation, and place the royal seal upon the most pragmatic proposals.\n\nThe aristocracy will be given permission to draft laws unique to their own fiefs, but ultimately everyone must answer to the Zemsky Sobor. Lastly, an important issue needs to be considered: Siberia is a large and unforgiving place, so infrastructure is key to reclaiming the rest of Rus.\n\nLocal enterprises will be subsidized to promote the development of roads and communication networks - if the Kingdom is to succeed, it will need to be able to draw upon the land, ensure that its laws are heard by all."

The aristocrats currently command the Ministry and have been focusing down their efforts on private enterprises, while leaving the rural villages out to dry. By reducing application requirements, officials can be recruited from unions directly.\n\nAdditionally, this will greatly expand Prince Yuriy's power base, and give him virtually complete control over administrative affairs outside Kemerovo.

A proud atheist, he has denounced priests as 'charlatans and wizards', a blight upon Russia, not unlike opium. Although a sizable faction within the Sobor calls for the complete destruction of all churches, temples, and organizations that 'undermine the King's authority', certain nobles advocate for a more practical option: repurposing the buildings for more useful tasks. Namely, border churches will be militarized and converted into barracks, their basements turned into arsenals, thereby making the building a village blockhouse.

King Rurik, himself having been a 'common man', understands the complexities of the modern age - the peasantry are no longer illiterate masses with minimal power, but potent tools for change.\n\nKing Rurik wishes to establish minor welfare programs, encourage his nobles to interact with civilian governments, guarantee property and safety rights, among other things.

To ensure the safety of the kingdom, propaganda will spread messages to calm the people.

Women and children can safely travel between major cities, bartering is gradually being displaced by imperial coins, and notorious bandit nests have been neutralized. The clouds feel less heavy, and workers can truly appreciate the morning breeze, confident that their workplace will spare their life and limbs.\n\nThere is still the occasional complaint by some former priest, and every so often a village is awoken by the screams of a socialist, being dragged off to prison.

However, through chaos, there is order. King Rurik II has achieved the unachievable - he has combined the best of both worlds.\n\nOn one hand, the old communist regime's progress cult, militarism, and state atheism.

Kingsguard units no longer skirmish Yuriy's supporters in the streets, and the nobles are finally seeing eye to eye. A general census has concluded that the workers are content and forecasts no second revolution.\n\nKing Rurik II has already summoned the Zemsky Sobor to determine the next course of action - to the East and West lie more pretenders, selfish dictators and those who cling to a failed past. The new Rus' will strike outwards, confident in its security and stability."

 KEM_the_foundations_of_a_kingdom: "The Foundations of a Kingdom"
 KEM_the_foundations_of_a_kingdom_desc: "The once thriving heart of Russian industry is now under the watchful eye of Rurik II, but the sad truth is that this heart no longer beats. Years of strife and warlord conflict have rendered vast swathes of the region in shambles, and many of the factories are in too poor a condition to be of any use to us. This has to change, and quickly.\n\nIt will take a great deal of sweat and toil, but the industry of Central Siberia will come back online one way or another. Once this arduous task has been completed, our Kingdom will have in its grasp a weapon more powerful than any gun or tank in the world: an industrial backbone with no equal."
 
 KEM_a_new_currency: "A New Currency"
 KEM_a_new_currency_desc: "Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, the ruble has become increasingly irrelevant to the point of being worth less than toilet paper. Foreign currencies have begun to grow in popularity in various regions across Russia, and in particularly desperate places the locals have resorted to a primitive barter economy. In His Majesty's realm, this farce will not be allowed to continue.\n\nThe Royal Ministry of Finance has proposed a radical new idea to help build the Kingdom's economy into something resembling functionality. They wish to introduce a new currency known as the Grivna in all territories currently controlled by Rurik II, with the hope that it will be able to stem the tide of foreign currencies worming their way into Russian society. The Grivna, pitched as a new currency for a new Russia, seems like a solid idea worth considering."
 
 KEM_siberian_wealth: "Siberian Wealth"
 KEM_siberian_wealth_desc: "Siberia is one of the most bountiful regions on Earth in terms of natural resources, but the constant wars have made it nearly impossible to take advantage of this fact. Now that the guns have finally fallen silent thanks to the efforts of Rurik II and his armies, we can finally turn our attention to the bounties that await us beneath the soil.\n\nThere are still many mines dotted around the region dating back to Bukharin's era that have gone unused since the collapse, and could serve our purposes handily. Harnessing Siberia's resources is a major step towards building a strong economy for the Kingdom, and it would be foolish to ignore the vast wealth that lies just beneath our feet!"
 
 KEM_build_upon_bukharins_plan: "Build Upon Bukharin's Plan"
 KEM_build_upon_bukharins_plan_desc: "For all of his faults, not everything Nikolai Bukharin did was inherently bad. For one, his Siberian Plan transformed Siberia from a desolate backwater to a formidable industrial powerhouse. The effects of this plan can still be felt to this very day, and is the reason why the potential of our industry is so immense.\n\nThe years, unfortunately, have not been kind to Siberia. Although the infrastructure established in Bukharin's day is still mostly operational, it has seen much better days. Rurik II wishes to reverse the decay, and to that end a new, expanded Siberian Plan will begin. Should this plan succeed, the Kingdom's industrial strength will soar to glorious new heights."
 
 KEM_royal_university_charters: "Royal University Charters"
 KEM_royal_university_charters_desc: "The horrendous state that Russia has been in for the past decade has had all kinds of consequences for the millions of Russian civilians forced to dodge bullets and artillery shells as the warlords selfishly fought amongst themselves. However, now that Rurik II has restored peace to Central Siberia, there may yet be a glimmer of hope for this unfortunate generation.\n\nThe King has thoughtfully decreed that Royal Universities are to be established in every major town currently under his protection. These esteemed centers of learning will provide education to all of Rurik II's subjects and give the youth of Russia a chance that they haven't had in years: the opportunity to receive a proper education."

 KEM_the_knowledge_of_tomsk_desc: "Even in the darkness of this warlord era, the intelligentsia of Tomsk have somehow managed to maintain a highly sophisticated society where art and science have thrived long after the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the city now under Rurik II's control, hundreds of highly intelligent individuals are left wondering what their place will be within His Majesty's realm.\n\nThe expertise of these wise men and women would be a great boon to the Royal cause and it would be a massive waste to not continue the patronage they once received under the CSR. The scientists that once worked for the Republic will be encouraged to lend their talents to us, and they will be allowed to continue their work without any interruptions. The intelligentsia of Tomsk will know that they have nothing to fear from their new King."
 
 KEM_work_programs: "Work Programs"
 KEM_work_programs_desc: "The years of fighting across Central Siberia was brutal and heavily destructive, and many towns have been reduced to not much more than smoldering ruins. Even several months after the fighting, much of the damage from the wars has yet to be repaired. Thousands are without homes and out of work, and the situation could grow out of control if nothing is done.\n\nOur King, ever considerate of his people's woes, has a solution to kill two birds with one stone. A specialized work program will be created with the task of repairing any and all damage caused by the fighting that has gone without repairs. The towns and villages of Central Siberia will be returned to their former glory, and in the process we will provide thousands of people with steady jobs to put food on their tables."
 
 KEM_reestablish_trade_routes: "Re-Establish Trade Routes"
 KEM_reestablish_trade_routes_desc: "The Kingdom's infrastructure is still in a less-than-ideal state, and as a result, any and all commerce that comes and goes through the King's lands will encounter many inconvenient difficulties on their journeys. Siberia is a vast, harsh land, and without the proper roads a trip through the region is a daunting task indeed.\n\nSponsored by His Majesty's Ministry of Finance, new trade routes are to be established throughout the Kingdom. Roads that still require repairs will get the attention they need, and extensive trade outposts will be constructed in even the most far-flung corners of Siberia to give weary travelers a place to find respite."
 
 KEM_improve_agricultural_mechanization: "Improve Agricultural Mechanization"
 KEM_improve_agricultural_mechanization_desc: "The Kingdom's agriculture is in a sorry state, to put it mildly. To put it another way, our farmers are forced to make do with tools and methods that would not seem out of place on farms from five hundred years ago! While His Majesty is well known for his appreciation for Russia's ancient customs, some things are better left in the past if they're going to actively harm our agricultural output.\n\nThe King believes that a full-scale mechanization of his realm's agriculture is in order. This process will no doubt be expensive, but any price is worth paying if it involves getting more food on the table faster. Our farms will become renowned throughout Russia for their efficiency!"
 
 KEM_the_foundries_of_novosibirsk: "The Foundries of Novosibirsk"
 KEM_the_foundries_of_novosibirsk_desc: "The Siberian Plan dragged Siberia kicking and screaming into the modern age, and as a result it was transformed into Russia's industrial heartland virtually overnight. Nowhere can the effects of this ambitious undertaking can be seen more clearly than in Novosibirsk, which was the city that was most profoundly affected by the industrialization of the region.\n\nThe numerous foundries and factories of Novosibirsk were unfortunately left to rot under the corrupt siloviki government that came to control the city. Now that the city is in Rurik II's hands, this situation must change. The factories of Novosibirsk must get running again, and the city must reclaim its place as the industrial capital of Siberia."
 
 KEM_industrial_modernization: "Industrial Modernization"
 KEM_industrial_modernization_desc: "Although our efforts to bring the factories of Central Siberia into the modern age were mostly successful, the fact remains that the equipment used in these facilities are woefully inadequate and no amount of polishing and ad-hoc repairs will fix problems caused by the unrelenting march of time.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary that we make an effort to completely finish the modernization of our industry by improving the equipment and machinery therein. Once His Majesty's workforce has the finest, most cutting-edge mechanical tools available at their disposal, the efficiency of the Kingdom's factories will soar far beyond what they were previously capable of."
 KEM_industrial_modernization_tt: "Will §Gincrease§! §wProduction Unit to GDP ratio§! by §Y2%§!\n"
 
 KEM_crown_cooperatives: "Crown Cooperatives"
 KEM_crown_cooperatives_desc: "After taking into consideration the wise advice given to him by his Ministry of Finance, His Majesty King Rurik II plans to announce the next big step in aiding his loyal workers: the crown cooperatives. Instead of suffering under the tyranny of a rich oligarch, the only authority workers belonging to the cooperatives will have to answer to is the King himself.\n\nThese cooperatives will be allowed to choose their leaders democratically, and these elected officials will, in turn, answer directly to the Crown. Already confident that this ingenious idea would be a triumph for workers' rights in the Kingdom, Rurik II also believes that the cooperatives will go a long way towards increasing the efficiency of the workforce."
 
 KEM_unshackle_the_unions: "Unshackle the Unions"
 KEM_unshackle_the_unions_desc: "As the issue of workers' rights in the Kingdom continues to surface, His Majesty has considered taking another large step towards creating a better environment for his loyal workers. The Royal Unions, already established as a way to ensure the workers are not being taken advantage of while still maintaining Royal oversight, are to be expanded far beyond their original capabilities.\n\nWith the proposed reforms, the Royal Unions will be granted a great deal of freedom to run their affairs as they see fit without too much interference from the Crown. With far fewer bureaucratic obstacles in their path, the King hopes that the unions will become more effective in their duties to the workers of the realm."
 
 KEM_from_councils_into_guilds: "From Councils Into Guilds"
 KEM_from_councils_into_guilds_desc: "The workers' councils of the Kingdom have served His Majesty well so far, but as the realm grows it is becoming increasingly clear that they are becoming increasingly restrictive to our economic interests. Rurik II has, with the best interests of the nation at heart, proposed that the councils be dismantled and be combined into specialized Royal Guilds.\n\nInspired by the ancient merchant guilds of old, these guilds are to handle all issues that were once the responsibility of the councils. Rather than emphasizing the workers, they will instead be focused on increasing productivity and efficiency among the workforce, and will answer directly to the King and his ministers. This will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the Royal economy."

 KEM_the_army_of_the_rus_desc: "With a new principality should come a new army! Although it has proven its superiority over our foes during the unification of Central Siberia, our military is still woefully outdated in nearly every respect, from the way it is organized down to the equipment our soldiers are to use. Before we can seriously consider any kind of plans to reunify the nation, our military needs to be brought up to modern standards.\n\nThis process will be long and not exactly easy, but a fully modernized military would be the envy of the King's many foes, and make reconquest all the more simple."
 
 KEM_learning_from_the_siberian_conquest: "Learning from the Siberian Conquest"
 KEM_learning_from_the_siberian_conquest_desc: "The wars to reunify Central Siberia were brutal and hard-fought, but His Majesty's armies proved their worth and achieved victory in the end. To better understand our own strengths and flaws, it would be wise to look back and examine the doctrines of both our own forces as well as those of our enemies.\n\nWe will find out exactly what worked and what didn't, and once this is done the King's military staff can devise new strategies and tactics built upon the best aspects of each. With the advantages once utilized by our foes now assimilated into the royal army, we will have made a good start towards reshaping the Central Siberian military into a fearsome force indeed."
 
 KEM_mechanized_infantry_corps: "Mechanized Infantry Corps"
 KEM_mechanized_infantry_corps_desc: "Demonstrated time and time again since the Second World War, mechanized infantry units supported by IFVs are without question the future of warfare. As part of his ongoing efforts to modernize his army, the King has begun a series of organizational reforms intended to finally bring the infantry into the 20th century by introducing mechanization. In his ideal vision, all of our infantry divisions are to ride into battle on APCs and overwhelm the enemy with the blistering speed of their attacks.\n\nNo longer will His Majesty's troops slog it out on foot, forced to tow their artillery with horses. Horses! This is a new age, and such ancient concepts simply won't cut it. Our military must embrace every modern innovation they can, and become all the more effective for it."
 
 KEM_expand_the_shieldmaidens: "Expand the Shieldmaidens"
 KEM_expand_the_shieldmaidens_desc: "In our new realm, every devoted subject is willing to risk their lives to fight for a better Russia, even the women. This was no more apparent than during the wars in Central Siberia, when our specially assembled force of elite female soldiers, the Shieldmaidens, proved themselves to be more effective than we could've ever anticipated.\n\nThe implications here are clear: we have an excellent source of manpower that has, until now, gone completely untapped. No longer! With the assistance of Princess Lydia, we will begin to raise more Shieldmaiden divisions to allow the women of Central Siberia the opportunity to fight for their King. With more fierce Shieldmaidens at the King's command, who could possibly hope to challenge him on the field of battle?"
 
 KEM_a_meritocratic_system: "A Meritocratic System"
 KEM_a_meritocratic_system_desc: "In decades past, officers got their command based on the significance of their background, whether it was their noble blood, wealth, ethnicity, or loyalty to the party. Such foolishness was one of the many factors that caused the humiliation of the Russian Empire in the First World War and then the Soviet Union in the Second World War. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past, for to do so would surely invite disaster as it has many times before.\n\nIn King Rurik's newly reformed military, advancement will come from merit alone. Our officers will all have to prove themselves to be capable leaders on the field of battle, and only then will they be given the privilege of a promotion. With the aid of battle-hardened, experienced officers to guide the troops, our armies will undoubtedly march from victory to victory."
 
 KEM_train_new_officers: "Train New Officers"
 KEM_train_new_officers_desc: "The key to building a professional army lies in its officers, and we will need plenty of them as we continue to expand the military. Luckily for us, there is a whole new generation of young officers, just waiting to begin their journeys towards becoming the generals of tomorrow! Therefore, It is high time for the military schools of Central Siberia to open their doors once more, so that prospecting recruits can be tutored in the difficult art of waging war.\n\nThe new recruits are to be trained to the highest possible standard, for the King's military officers are to be the best of the best, consisting of the cream of what Russia has to offer. Not only will this lead to a better led military, but may also result in unorthodox new strategic innovations as well."
 
 KEM_issue_royal_pardons: "Issue Royal Pardons?"
 KEM_issue_royal_pardons_desc: "Our various enemies during the wars of unification fought well indeed, and they have many generals among them who are definitely a cut above the standard career officers. Unfortunately, the fact remains that they were our enemies, and most of them now sit in a military prison for their crimes against Rurik II and his people.\n\nRurik II has floated the idea of issuing pardons towards specific officers who once served with our enemies. In exchange for their freedom, they must make an oath of loyalty to the King and serve with his armed forces. Should His Majesty choose to go down this route, our forces will be bolstered with several more talented officers who can aid us with their expertise. Although our King still holds well-deserved grudges towards some of these men, there may yet be a path to redemption for those whose only crime was being on the wrong side."
 
 KEM_the_kingdoms_finest: "The Kingdom's Finest"
 KEM_the_kingdoms_finest_desc: "During our nation's darkest moments in Kemerovo, our nascent military was forced to make compromises for the sake of getting more rifles out into the field to fight the King's many enemies. Now that all of Central Siberia has been united, the time for compromise is over. Our military must consist of the finest men and women in all of Russia, and to achieve this Rurik II has proposed a significant tightening of the Principality's recruitment and training standards.\n\nFurthermore, he also wishes to completely overhaul and modernize all our current methods of training to create a more efficient system for creating the soldiers of tomorrow. Once these reforms are enacted, only the best will be available to fill the ranks, and the military will become a crack force of warriors who are ready to do whatever it takes to defend the motherland."
 
 KEM_armor_improvements: "Armor Improvements"
 KEM_armor_improvements_desc: "Our tank fleet is a fearsome force indeed, but without the necessary modernizations they will be worse than useless in the coming wars. These vintage relics may have been dangerously effective on the battlefields of yesterday, but with the advent of advanced HEAT warheads and improved man-portable AT weapons, they simply will not stand a chance against our future enemies. Rurik II has approached the Royal Office of Research and Development and stressed the necessity for a fully modern force of fighting vehicles.\n\nThe RORD has wasted no time finding solutions to the problem of our outdated vehicles, and their ideas are quite promising. Higher-powered engines could carry our tanks and IFVs across the battlefield at unprecedented speeds, while experimental new designs of armor may just be able to reduce the danger posed by HEAT munitions. All that remains now is to put these theories into practice."
 
 KEM_study_new_weapon_designs: "Study New Weapon Designs"
 KEM_study_new_weapon_designs_desc: "The Royal Army's troops are forced to make do with vintage bolt-action rifles, while the rest of the world has moved on to using fully automatic assault rifles and man-portable weapons that can crack both the heaviest tank and the fastest plane. This is unacceptable! His Majesty knows this too, and has wisely tasked the RORD with studying modern designs from all around the world.\n\nWith some careful analysis and just a little bit of luck, our engineers will be able to present the military with advanced, but still robust designs that would best serve our troops on a modern battlefield. Only the finest and most modern tools for warfare will do for the King's armies."
 
 KEM_expand_the_arsenals: "Expand the Arsenals"
 KEM_expand_the_arsenals_desc: "When we triumphed over our neighbors during the wars for Central Siberia, the King's forces managed to secure control over a significantly important munitions depot at Abakan. This facility is one of the largest arsenals of weapons east of the Ural Mountains, and for now it has yet to serve a purpose for us beyond taking everything we can carry. This is about to change.\n\nHis Majesty has ordered the Abakan arsenal to be completely refurbished and expanded to become a fully-fledged weapons production center once more. Once it is operational, the arsenal's expanded facilities will allow us to produce more equipment for the troops even faster than before, and will ensure that every man and woman in the King's army has a rifle and plenty of ammunition at their disposal."
 
 KEM_the_falcons_fleet: "The Falcon's Fleet"
 KEM_the_falcons_fleet_desc: "Our previous foes in Novosibirsk once commanded the most formidable air force in Siberia. With a fleet of aircraft that could rival even that of the Free Aviators, they caused us much headache during our bloody war to overthrow the corrupt siloviki. Now that they have been defeated, their aircraft now sit unused in their extensive airfields, just waiting to be unleashed once again.\n\nIt would be a waste to just leave all that valuable war materiel to gather rust. As it happens, the Principality is in need of an air force, and these planes and airfields could fulfill the King's needs quite conveniently. An effort shall be made to renovate the facilities and make sure the planes are still in working condition. Soon, we shall have a fearsome air force of our own."
 
 KEM_fund_the_kamov_helicopter_design_bureau: "Fund the Kamov Helicopter Design Bureau"
 KEM_fund_the_kamov_helicopter_design_bureau_desc: "Jets and the like are all well and good, but our air force still lacks helicopters to help support our troops on the ground. These fearsome machines can perform a multitude of roles, from transport to ground attack missions, and have become an almost essential part of any modern air force. Fortunately, there is one man who could help us to fill this gap.\n\nNikolay Kamov is a brilliant engineer whose specialty is designing helicopters. His design bureau, sadly, was vastly under appreciated by the previous government of Central Siberia, and lacked the funding needed to move forward with any kind of projects. Rurik II wishes to generously fund Kamov's bureau so that he may help us with designing cutting-edge, modern helicopters for our military."
 
 KEM_to_rule_the_skies: "To Rule the Skies"
 KEM_to_rule_the_skies_desc: "Finally, our humble Principality has an air force of its own! Now that we have a fully functional air fleet, complete with newly designed helicopters courtesy of the Kamov Design Bureau, we have surpassed the old Novosibirsk government to become the true lords of the sky here in Siberia.\n\nOur planes will ensure the skies belong to Rurik, while our helicopters will provide all kinds of exciting new opportunities for waging war, from lightning-fast troop transport to raining hot death upon the King's enemies. With such a dramatic advantage over our potential foes, victory is all but assured."

 KEM_the_pride_of_the_king_desc: "Rurik II's reforms are finally coming to a close, and so far they seem to have been a complete success! The Royal Army is now one of the most elite, well-equipped armed forces in all of Russia, and will certainly cause our rivals to go green with jealousy. And with a formidable new air force to support our troops from the air, the inevitable wars do not look so bleak for us after all.\n\nSome smaller minds may consider Rurik's style of governance to be antiquated, but nobody can deny that his newly reformed military is anything but. The Principality's armed forces are now a highly advanced, modernized force, entirely capable of slugging it out with the best of them. All that remains now is to put our new armies to the ultimate test. To victory!"

To further cement his realm's legitimacy on the global stage, Rurik II wishes to begin making diplomatic overtures across the globe.\n\nWith a few honeyed words, his diplomats may just be able to find some powerful friends willing to take our claim to Russia seriously. All that has to be done now is to make the arrangements."

 KEM_overtures_to_washington_desc: "Our envoys in the United States have been making a great deal of progress endearing them to our existence, and have noted that the Americans have been quite receptive to their diplomatic efforts. It is not hard to see why. Although the Principality still has lingering Soviet influence all throughout its policies, we still outwardly defy both the communists and the fascists, and thus make an appealing potential target for US support.\n\nThe royal diplomatic office is to instruct the envoys in Washington to begin opening talks with the aim of establishing an embassy of our own on US soil. Once they have accomplished this, they will have essentially opened the door to mutually beneficial trade deals with what remains of the Free World."
 
 KEM_the_almighty_dollar: "The Almighty Dollar"
 KEM_the_almighty_dollar_desc: "Now that solid trade relations have been established with the OFN, we can begin to reap the rewards. Our envoys in Washington, now firm partners with the Americans, will begin to make requests for US investments in Central Siberia. Our attempts at expanding the realm's infrastructure have been going at a slower pace than the King would like, and he hopes American aid will help tremendously towards getting the ball rolling.\n\nOn top of giving our construction projects some much needed relief, these investments will continue to build good relations between Rurik II and the United States. The Americans will be made to understand that working with our King would be within the best interests of both nations."

 KEM_invite_american_experts_desc: "Although our workforce is well on the road to becoming quite capable on their own terms, it wouldn't hurt to help them along. America has long been renowned for its industrial prowess, and their experts are masters of their craft. It is fortunate, then, that His Majesty's diplomatic efforts to Washington have resulted in strong ties with the United States, which opens several interesting avenues that were previously unavailable to us.\n\nWe can use our influence abroad to send invitations to various American specialists in the field of industry and economics, to advise our workers and improve overall productivity throughout the realm. With their invaluable assistance, Central Siberia can once again become the industrial backbone of Russia."

 KEM_emissaries_to_the_rising_sun_desc: "Although the Japanese were partly responsible for Russia's total humiliation in the Second World War, we cannot deny that opening relations with the premier economic powerhouse of the East would be of great benefit to our young nation. Perhaps it would be for the best to put our past grievances behind us and reach out with good intentions.\n\nRoyal envoys are to be dispatched to Tokyo to begin making important diplomatic overtures in the Sunrise Kingdom, and with luck they will be able to convince the Japanese that Rurik II is a man to be taken seriously. From there, lucrative economic deals could potentially be forged to help bring the Principality's economy onto the global market."

 KEM_zaibatsu_investments_desc: "The Zaibatsu wield a great deal of influence in Japan's economic machine, and their economic ambitions hold great weight in the Sphere. The King's economic advisors have proposed making attempts to reach out to these Zaibatsu to see if they're interested in making investments in Central Siberia. This region is incredibly rich in natural resources, and thus our nation has much to offer to them.\n\nAll we would have to do is convince them of the fact that there is much money to be made here in Siberia, and the door to cooperation with these powerful economic forces of nature will officially be open. Although some in Rurik II's court are distrustful of the Zaibatsu, he is convinced that they are of no threat so long as their requests are not too demanding."

 KEM_the_two_emperors_desc: "Relations between Rurik II's realm and the Japanese have never been higher, and the King has decided the time has come to graciously reciprocate the good that their investments have done for his people.\n\nIn a speech later this month, Rurik II plans to make a special declaration of brotherhood between him and the Japanese emperor, Hirohito. This declaration will more than solidify the strong ties we have built with the Sphere, it will show to the world that the time will come when the continent of Asia is dominated between two great monarchs of equal importance and stature: Hirohito of Japan, and Rurik II of Russia. We have no doubt that the Japanese will be flattered by His Majesty's declaration."

The nation found itself divided amongst ethnic lines, each fighting for his own vision of the ideal Kazakh state, and the government was as divided as its society. Recently, however, the situation has turned around dramatically.\n\nKazakhstan has been unified under a single government once more, and the divisions that once plagued the Kazakh steppes seem to have healed for the time being. Now would be a perfect time for the King's ambassadors to reach out to the Kazakh government to see if their leaders are willing to open relations, assuming their government is willing to entertain such an idea in the first place. It wouldn't hurt to ask."

Although many retain a certain degree of skepticism, our state is finally beginning to be taken seriously as a potential contender to Russian reunification, and our presence has been at least nominally recognized by much of the world's nations.\n\nTrade with the outside world is flourishing for the first time in decades, and Central Siberia is quickly becoming a hub for international commerce as more foreign businesses seek to make lucrative investments in our King's bountiful realm. Our first few steps into the world have so far been a success, and the future of the Principality is looking bright indeed."

Even the brightest minds of the kingdon's high command couldn't have predicted the stunning string of defeats our noble Druzhina inflicted upon the enemy. Now the kingdom stretches from the Ob River in the west to the great Bering Sea to the east, and there is still much work to be done.\n\nPrince Yuriy has maintained his esteemed position as the true heir to all Rus, and through sheer tenacity earned the full attention of both the King and his people. The Crown Prince has ambitious plans for the kingdom, encompassing nearly every aspect of the state apparatus. Through his reforms, Yuriy believes that a bright new future lies just over the horizon, and Russia will become stronger than ever.\n\nThe end of Russia's misery is in sight, and the aging Rurik II has every confidence that his son shall wisely guide the kingdom through the final stretch to unification."

Many of the Guard still remain loyal to Lydia rather than the King's chosen heir, and it is a well-known fact that some of them hold ambitions that some would consider dangerous.\n\nWorse still, there are many in the kingdom who fear the Kingsguard as a dark symbol of authoritarian dominance. Yuriy plans to nip this potentially serious problem in the bud before it grows out of hand. The Kingsguard shall be dismantled, and in their place a more conventional security force will be established to take over their previous duties.\n\nIt is unlikely that the majority of the Kingsguard will take this lying down, but such a drastic step is necessary to ensure the future stability of the kingdom.

The settlements that dot the realm will be shaped into self-proficient defensive strongpoints, armed and ready for any occasion.\n\nThese strongholds will also be provided with new armament production facilities to provide a steady stream of arms and munitions to the front.

Prince Yuriy, however, strongly believes that these reforms did not go far enough in curbing the influence of the aristocracy. While changes have been made to the process of promotions, a great deal of the officer corps still largely consists of rich nobles.\n\nNow that he has the ear of the King himself, Yuriy has presented a radical new overhaul of the existing military bureaucracy. Instead of relying on a system of promotion to attain higher ranks and positions of authority, the Druzhina shall be fully democratized. The rank-and-file shall be the ones to decide who shall lead them into battle, and not some out-of-touch aristocrat who has never experienced life on the front."

 KEM_subsidize_loyal_merchants_desc: "With such vast territories now under the authority of Rurik II, incredible sums of wealth now flow through the realm like rivers of gold. Up until now, the Crown has made little effort to reap the benefits that trade has bestowed upon us, but His Majesty wishes to change this state affairs post-haste. Loyal merchants and tradesmen in the kingdom will be subsidized and encouraged to conduct their business in tandem with the interests of the Crown and the royal unions.\n\nThe knowledge that conducting economic ventures under His Majesty's watch would be richly rewarded will doubtlessly encourage all manner of businessmen to flock to our borders. If business in the kingdom is booming, the economy will experience rapid growth and prosperity shall be within our reach."

 KEM_legacy_of_the_merchant_republic_desc: "One of Prince Yuriy's most well-known influences on his style of governance is the ancient Republic of Novgorod, which was renowned as one of medieval Russia's most prosperous realms. Fascinated by their systems and laws, Yuriy believes that following in the old merchant public's footsteps is the key to national prosperity.\n\nThis commendable influence can clearly be seen in his proposed economic policies. With Rurik II's endorsement, the Prince finally has the opportunity to put his unorthodox theories into motion. Much like the kingdom itself, these plans are an eclectic combination of ancient frameworks paired with modern sensibilities. Under Yuriy's shrewd guidance and with the approval of Rurik II, the economic strength of the Rus' will soar to great heights that had never been achieved before."

 KEM_force_compromises: "Force Compromises"
 KEM_force_compromises_desc: "It is not unfair to say that our system of governance is highly unorthodox and largely a work-in-progress. While it has, for the most part, worked out quite well, that is not to say that problems have not yet surfaced. The administrative bureaucracy is divided up between elected officials, the regional Posadniks that were recently established, and the kingdom's nobility. Each has different ideas on how the administration of the realm should be handled, and each disagrees heavily with the other's ideas.\n\nThese disagreements cannot be allowed to continue. When the bureaucracy begins to fight amongst itself, total disaster is not far off. Prince Yuriy suggests a decisive intervention to end this nonsense- these three bickering groups will learn to play nice and reach some kind compromise whether they like it or not. The stability of the realm is too important to risk on petty squabbles, and ensuring cooperation amongst the administration is the key to cementing lasting authority over the peoples of the Rus'."

However, this is not to say he is without detractors. His sister, Princess Lydia, still has a sizable base of support even after the Kingsguard's dissolution. This base largely consists of rich aristocrats and elder military men, who were given many bold promises by Lydia to ensure their support.\n\nTo secure Yuriy's unconditional support amongst the higher classes of the realm, this state of affairs must be rectified. Therefore, the prince will reach out to his sister's most ardent supporters with the hopes of reaching some kind of understanding. While Yuriy would never dream of compromising on his lofty ideals, he still believes that the old guard can be brought back into the fold with a few honeyed words and reassurances."

In the newly conquered lands to the east, however, foreign currencies still overtake the Grivna in popularity. To encourage further use of the new currency, the Grivna shall be accompanied by a new set of coinage courtesy of the newly established Royal Mints.\n\nThese new coins shall present a flattering depiction of our beloved King, Rurik II, and come with a highly sophisticated decorative design. While the coins will not have much practical use as currency, they would go far in both popularizing usage of the Grivna and increasingly the already boundless popularity of the King. Soon, His Majesty's face shall grace every home and every wallet with its benevolent presence!"

Meanwhile, unions are a commendable achievement for the worker, but do not exactly encourage brutal efficiency. Prince Yuriy suggests that a compromise between the guilds and the unions would be the best option moving forward, and has presented his new plan before Rurik II himself.\n\nThrough a total restructuring of how the guilds are organized, mutually beneficial cooperation between the guilds and the unions will not only be encouraged, but incentivized. The unions will serve as the watchdogs of labor, diligently watching out for the workers of the realm. Meanwhile, the guilds will work tirelessly to make sure that the bottom line is never put in jeopardy, so long as the workers are not troubled. The two will become indispensable parts in the great economic machine of the kingdom, working in tandem to ensure our eternal prosperity."

With the Russian Far East secured, we now have access to the Bering Sea, and the critical port of Magadan has become our proverbial window to the outside world. The waves beckon, and it is time to establish a new fleet to secure a naval presence of our own in the east.\n\nLike our Varangian ancestors of old, the peoples of the Rus' shall take to the open seas once more! While a mighty war fleet is still out of our reach for the time being, we can still put together a more humble force intended to patrol the arctic waters and ensure the safety of our trade. There are many abandoned ships in the port of Magadan that once belonged to our enemies, and after some restorative efforts they could once again serve proudly in His Majesty's navy."

 KEM_the_merchant_marine: "The Merchant Marine"
 KEM_the_merchant_marine_desc: "The port of Magadan now flies the royal banners of Rurik II, and is quickly becoming the preeminent gateway to Russia. Unsurprisingly, this means that most trade entering the country from the east will arrive through Magadan. It is vital that all of our naval efforts are focused on ensuring the money continues to flow through the port. To that end, His Majesty has wisely given the order to form the Royal Merchant Marine.\n\nThis specialized naval task force will be entrusted with the safety of the trade routes coming and going from the port of Magadan. With the loyal sailors of His Majesty's merchant marine at their side, the ships that bring wealth to the kingdom can finally rest easy knowing that the waters are safe from potential ne'er-do-wells looking for easy prey. Slowly but surely, the frozen waters of the Far East shall fall under Rurik II's solemn protection."

It is not hard to see why- our customs and manners are a strange sight indeed in this day and age, and it would be hard to take a seemingly bizarre man like Rurik II seriously as a head of state. Now, however, the tables have turned. With the Far East secured, none can doubt that the Kingdom of Siberia is a legitimate entity that can be taken seriously without too many raised eyebrows.\n\nWe have proven our worth both on the field of battle and at the negotiating table, and the world has taken notice. Time to expand our horizons and consolidate our international ties. The kingdom has already taken small steps into the larger world in the past, but now we shall take a leap."

Prince Yuriy, however, knows the truth - the Japanese see us as nothing more than puppets to their designs, and the perfect host for the all-consuming economic parasites known as Zaibatsu.\n\nRurik II has paid heed to his son's dire warnings about the perfidious samurai, and he is far from pleased. He had approached the Japanese in friendship, and they intended to use his good will to try and turn him into a slave to the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This attempted mockery of our storied legacy cannot stand! Effective immediately, all ties with the Sphere shall be cut, and our efforts shall be directed to a more agreeable party: the Organization of Free Nations."

In particular, the once proud Chinese now languish under the Japanese boot, forced into becoming not much more than an avenue through which the Japanese can siphon material wealth. This is obviously what they had intended to turn us into as well, and Rurik II feels nothing but disgust when he sees the conditions that the junior members of the Sphere are forced to endure.\n\nPrince Yuriy advises that we take a closer interest in East Asian affairs, and begin to find ways to undermine Japanese dominance in the region. To start, we shall begin a clandestine operation to smuggle weapons and ammunition into China, to help equip their forces and hopefully inspire some kind of action against their foreign oppressors. Should the situation in China deteriorate, the oppressed peoples of the Sphere will know that Russia hears their plight and will stand with them in their struggle however we can."

Millions of Russians were slaughtered at the hands of the Nazis, and millions more now find themselves ruled by an oppressive colonial government hell-bent on erasing the Russian people and their culture for good.\n\nRussia cannot truly be whole again while our ancestral heartland is firmly under the Nazi yoke! For the good of all the peoples of the Rus', Rurik II shall denounce the Nazis and their unbelievably cruel regime. Their innumerable crimes against humanity cannot go unanswered forever. The Germans will know that, in time, justice shall be served in the name of all the men, women, and children of Russia who lost their lives in the face of Teutonic aggression!"

While their diplomats were quite baffled due to our strange ways, they were nonetheless endeared and willing to foster relations with our nation. Over the last few years, our realm has expanded to include the vital ports of the Russian Far East, and we now lie within close proximity of the US. This, coupled with our mutual dislike of both the Japanese and the Germans, makes them an obvious friend to our kingdom.\n\nRurik II intends to visit the United States personally to meet with their leaders and discuss the future of our two mighty nations. His Majesty's eccentricities and strange form of dress will surely catch a great deal of media attention in the states, and will introduce many new eyes to our young kingdom's existence. Although many viewers will most likely see our King as a silly old man, the fact remains that knowledge of the kingdom's struggle to reclaim the lost nation of Russia will spread like wildfire throughout the nations of the OFN because of the coverage."

The previous decades have been some of the darkest days in Russia's entire history, and the suffering endured by the Russian people has been nothing short of unimaginable. Many are now beginning to believe that Yuriy is the modern reincarnation of Alexander Nevsky, the great general and statesman who valiantly rose to the occasion and delivered Russia from its darkest moments nearly a millennium ago.\n\nRurik II trusts that, when the time comes from him to move on from this world, the kingdom that he built will be in good hands.\n\nAll hail King Rurik II!\n\nAll hail Crown Prince Yuriy!"

Following this great triumph, Rurik II has gone so far as to declare himself King of Siberia to commemorate this significant milestone in the quest to reunify Russia.\n\nHis daughter, the shrewd Princess Lydia, has risen to become the chosen heir to Rurik II's coveted legacy. Even now, she stands at her father's side as his top advisor, guiding his hand towards the establishment of a stronger kingdom than ever before. Princess Lydia envisions a kingdom with a strictly-enforced hierarchy; a supremely powerful state invulnerable to enemies from within and without.\n\nThe end of Russia's dark age is close at hand.

 KEM.1.t: "The King in Kemerovo"
 KEM.1.desc: "Sergei walked up the long and heavily decorated stairs leading into the Grand Palace of Kemerovo, the residence of the great Rurik the Second and his family. He could not help but notice the signs of destruction from the days of the Siberian War in what used to be the local Gorkom headquarters. Thankfully, the new rulers of the land had gone to great lengths to hastily repair the building. The Rurikid ensign was visible in every object and wall, often simply replacing the hammer and sickle, and more than likely bolstering the ego of General Nikolay Krylov. Modern comforts were combined with medieval architecture in an unexpected way.\n\n"You shall have an audience with His Majesty in precisely two hours," was the response of the secretary. Until then, Sergei could admire the wonderful artwork and furniture, occasionally peeking out of the window to enjoy the view of the central square - even though the arrival of winter discouraged many from spending time there.\n\nAt exactly twelve o'clock, the wooden doors of the palace opened, and Sergei entered the King's residence not as a noble or a general, but a mere businessman. On an expensive throne, Rurik II sat and observed the economist with a judging look. Just as all the dozens of other men to have entered the room, Sergei truly had to prove his value to the mad King and his advisors. Undisturbed by the situation he was in, he outlined his plan of economic development and won the trust of the Royal Court, which seemed open to inviting him again. For all the rumours of him being an insane and brutal King, Rurik seemed awfully logical and pragmatic in person.\n\nThe man left the Palace, unsure if the story of Kemerovo's Tsar was a farce or a tragedy. Either way, that did not have an impact on the situation on the ground: the state was surrounded by enemies, and the choice of siding with the General was dangerous to make. Yet that did not stop some of his more affectionable subjects from doing just that."

He spoke softly, yet firmly, and seemed exactly of sound mind even while addressing himself as Tsar, or firmly insisting he be called Rurik II to everyone who called General Krylov by his old name.\n\nOccasionally, the servants mused amongst themselves about the King whilst he roamed the palace or resided on his throne. Was he truly mad? Was this what the horrors of war brought? No, others argued. The General is merely putting on an act to confuse and bewilder others. Yet, all of them knew the others had no concrete answer. The Tsar certainly gave none.\n\nWhat of it, then? If they were following a lunatic, he was a benevolent one who treated them well. If they were following a man talented enough to put on such an act, then clearly they were working for one of the greatest minds in Siberia.

I do not expect even the slightest hint of warmth from any of you! But what I DO expect is that you will fight when ordered and keep fighting until your body can fight no more!

He had definitely wished it was, however. Today, he had to deal with the royal family. Prince Yuriy and Princess Lydia were by all accounts upstanding people on their own, but when put in the same room, they were as dangerous a combination as nitric acid and glycerin.\n\n"...how dare you insult the Royal Unions like that!

Voznesensky loudly cleared his throat. "Let me try and understand this. Prince Yuriy, you suggest that His Majesty concentrate on workers' rights reforms in order to improve quality of life? And Princess Lydia, you support lowering subsidies and rolling back regulation to free up more funding for your hospital expansion program? Am I correct in these assumptions?"

Ivan had come to expect the unexpected during his many years as an industrial worker, but not even he could expect someone like King Rurik II to take charge. The King, long may he reign, was certainly a strange one, especially considering that Ivan remembered the times he used to call himself 'General Krylov' and would stagger out of the old Gorkom headquarters to give slurred speeches about traitors and mutiny.\n\nDespite the King's many, many eccentricities, ol' King Rurik II seemed to be a good man to follow. He hadn't done anything malicious or harmful to people like Ivan so far, in fact he seemed to really be dedicated to taking care of Kemerovo's people. He made sure that the common man felt safe and protected, which Ivan had thought impossible ever since the Huns took Moscow. His outfits and palace might be a tad odd, but when he gave a speech, even a weary old man like Ivan felt in awe. Ivan even felt like King Rurik's strange little regime had a decent enough shot of liberating Russia from its many fractured rulers. If King Rurik ended up ruling all of Russia, why, Ivan felt like that wouldn't be too bad."

Yuriy enjoyed coming here and being around all the people who were just going about their daily lives and enjoying what they can. It was somewhat calming, and a good break from the throne room and his cynical sister.\n\nThere was still something off-putting, however. Wherever Yuriy went, there was a sense of fear. Fear of bandits, fear of raids. Fear of invasions from other warlords, and the fear that their family wouldn't have enough to eat that night. It was there and almost everywhere Yuriy went.\n\nThe people couldn't live like this, Yuriy thought. All the dread and despair deep inside everyone, it was unbearable. Every time he went to visit the town, he felt like something had to be done. Anything to improve people's lives, at least somewhat.\n\nWhat was he thinking, he was a prince! If someone could do something to help the people, it was him. Sure, his father did seem to care a lot for his Kingdom, but from what Yuriy saw, it wasn't enough. More had to be done if Kemerovo was to be the grand kingdom that cared for its people."

Poverty and banditry are rampant, and starvation is the norm. Warfare has destroyed what were once great cities and will continue to do so."\n\nYuriy began to speak louder now, more energized than he had ever felt before. "This cannot continue to go on! Something has to be done, the people of our kingdom cannot continue to live in impoverishment. That is why I believe everyone deserves equality under their King. Life in fear and terror is not a way to live! If we are to be a modern Kingdom, we need to follow new ways. The welfare of the people must be assured, a King and his government cannot ignore their own citizens."\n\nYuriy looked around the room to see the people's reactions. Were they happy, eager even? It was hard to tell, so Yuriy continued. "That is why I hope this realm can become a better one. One with a parliamentary democracy, where everyone can have their voices heard, and the King can act on the will of his subjects. Those are my hopes and my dreams.

Now, Rurik has the opportunity to hear the opinions of his subjects even more, and it's safe to say the Kingdom is slowly moving towards democracy.\n\nWhile this does give more power to the common people of Kemerovo, the added power has also increased the influence of the nobles and priests as well. The common people may be able to voice their opinions now, but the rich nobleman now has the opportunity to use his influence in other means. The reformed Sobor may not be perfect, but in Yuriy's mind, the more voice the people have in government, the better.\n\nAnd while Yuriy may be satisfied for now, there is still much the Prince wants to see changed for the Kingdom can become a better place for everyone.

A ruler had to be decisive, a wrong decision could turn entire empires upside down. Monarchs were the best for laying down the law of the land, and they knew how to use their authority.\n\nEver since the end of the wars in Russia and Siberia, the Krylov family had changed. With her father carving out a fiefdom in Central Siberia, the entire family now had their own ideas on how to fix Russia. The Princess felt the best way to lead the kingdom was with a strong autocrat. Prince Yuriy, on the other hand, thought the best way was to follow the opinions of the people. Where he was idealistic, she was pragmatic. Where her brother was pacifistic, she was militaristic. Ironic, considering her past as a nurse, but necessary in the new order of things. Her brother just didn't understand the world they now lived in. Did he really think all the enemies that surrounded them would just hand over control to their father?\n\nNo, and that's where Yuriy would fail. Her goal wasn't to sit in Kemerovo and try to grow more food for the people while bandits continue to raid farms and murder their owners. Her goal - their family's goal, was to reunite Russia. Only then could the people be fed and their lives be improved.

Her brother, Yuriy, had not shown up as he was supposed to. How careless, he couldn't see how they were creating a more refined Kemerovo. Democracy could not work in a Kingdom. How could he not see that?\n\nIt took a lot less than she thought to transform an entire society, she wondered. One decree made by her father and an entire class system could be built out of nothing. A new hierarchy, she thought. The kingdom could only be ruled by order, and without order, there would be turmoil.\n\nThe new society that would be created would finally allow the elites to be on top. Her father would rule over a perfect and neat structure, where everyone knew their place. The nobles' and military's rights to power would finally be upheld.\n\nAs Lydia watched her father sign her creation into law, she knew his Kingdom had become even more perfect. Kemerovo had to be kept powerful and out of the hands of uneducated peasants who know nothing about ruling a nation. A guiding hand, led only by the King and the nobility would lead to the defeat of their enemies. Society would be purified through fire and blood, or it would not be pure at all."

While we completed some reforms to improve the lives of the workers, it might not have been enough. Critics of the reforms have stated they did not go even close to creating a lasting effect.

What was once a dead economy with only poor farmers and laborers was becoming more modern by the day. Perhaps the quirky King knew a lot more about leading than anyone thought. It certainly seemed like it.\n\nAnd the people! Oh, they were an interesting sight. No one dressed like them anywhere else in Russia, that was for sure. But it wasn't how they were dressed that was the most interesting thing, their actions were even more colorful than their looks. Formal yet casual, joyful yet serious.

As each of the children entered, things started well. Rurik decided to steer towards something all of them would enjoy: the unification of Central Siberia under him as King.\n\nIt wasn't long until Lydia decided to take the conversation in a different direction though. "If we want to unify the region, the military needs even more funding, Father. We need to make sure we conquer our enemies swiftly before any of them can put up a strong resistance."\n\n"What are you talking about Lydia," Yuriy said, opposed to anything she said. "More has to be done for our subjects, not the military. Besides, should we not try to approach things diplomatically first?"\n\n"Are you that naive, brother?" Lydia responded coldly. "Do you really think the surrounding warlords will just let us peacefully integrate them? The Germans will just hand back Moscow?"\n\nYuriy stuttered, to the delight of Lydia, "No-I..."\n\n"Be quiet! Both of you!" King Rurik interjected, angry that nothing had changed between them, despite all his efforts. "I brought you here so you could finally get along. For the sake of the Kingdom, just end your bickering. Boris, you haven't said much, what do you think we should do next?"\n\nBoris looked to his two siblings, both angrily eyeing him as he prepared to speak. "I don't know, father.

It was time for Rurik to bring stability back to Central Siberia.\n\nThe military would have to be prepared for the invasion of our neighbors.

"It's not like we can magically rain down wealth and equality upon every subject. This isn't your dream world Yuriy, get over it."\n\n"Of course it's not!" Yuriy said, starting to get angrier. He knew Lydia liked it when he got angry, but he didn't care. "However we can't ignore what our subjects are going through every day.

Rurik had been apprehensive about meeting with the unions, yet Yuriy had barely managed to convince his old man to come to this meeting. Boris could be found examining every part of the room in confusion, silently questioning why the hell half of its contents were there. What did Rurik need a hearth for in a conference room? And a pair of axes crossed over one another against a shield mounted on the wall above the doorway. Were they real axes? "This guy is nuts..."

Replied the Union Boss.\n\n"Well then, let me just say that, so long as you stay within the bounds of the law, you have the full support of the crown behind you!"\n\nBoris smiled at this news, although was only cautiously optimistic. The prince seemed fully devoted to helping the unions, but Boris got a distinct 'dragged along' feeling from the way the King himself spoke. "What exactly do you mean when you say 'support'?"\n\n"You will be guaranteed more rights as workers, and your unions will be able to operate as they wish within the confines of the law.

He had, in recent days, been speaking of changes to the state's laws and regulations around labor rights, and the introduction of new legislation. No doubt, the men agreed, prompted by Prince Yuriy.\n\nWhile all of them were pleased by the news, given the liberalizations promised, all were similarly skeptical. After all, change had been promised before and, more than once, had proven illusory at best. One man raised his concern that the Zemsky Sobor would muddle implementation. Another voiced certainty that Princess Lydia and her coterie would act to subvert any expansions so codified.\n\nBut, even with such concerns, there was hope. The general trend of state policy lately had been encouraging, and there was a natural tendency to believe that it would continue. That things would get better.

He spoke of the challenges to the state's position that a transition to free-market policies would entail, but also of the many potential and long-term benefits besides, and how they might be implemented in governmental policy.\n\nThe Princess listened in near silence, asking only a few questions, but her stare never left. Her eyes bored into his own, near unblinking and as unsettling as ever, as she processed his words and the gears no-doubt turned in her head. Eventually, when he had finished, she asked him a single question: How would the proposals affect ordinary workers in the short term?\n\nHe knew why she was asking, as did every government officer, but he answered her truthfully, knowing she would instantly identify a lie, however small. It would hurt them, he said, as the economy reoriented and as some inefficient and unviable industries closed down. At that, she spoke, perhaps more to herself than to him. Prince Yuriy would not like that, he heard her say, but he would have to see the merit. She would make him see.\n\nVoznesensky was careful not to add his doubtful opinion.

How are you? How is Alexi?"\n\n"I am doing well. Alexi died two years ago, but our daughter, uh." Anastasia blushed in embarrassment. "Lydia has grown up to be a strong little girl."\n\n"I'm glad to hear that," Lydia's face grew more pensive. "It's been good to see you," she murmured, glancing around at the hospital. "Sometimes I forget where I came from."\n\n"It has been good to see you as well, Lydia." A few more words were exchanged, but soon Anastasia continued on her way to those who needed her. Lydia's gaze followed her, wondering on a future that could have been."

 kemexp.1.t: "Spring Rasputitsa"
 kemexp.1.desc: "The signs have all arrived. The drip-drip-drip of water from the eaves of roofs has ceased, for there is no more snow for the morning sun to melt. Exhalation no longer produces a cloud of mist. The forests have gone from silent to alive with the chirping of birds and the rustling of budding leaves. The ground is no longer blanketed in white, but covered with greens and browns and the myriad colors of wildflowers. Fields once grazed by the occasional elk now played home to herds of sheep and cattle. The farmers were no longer holded up in their homesteads, but were not plowing and tilling their fields.\n\nAnd as the world came back to life, so did the Royal Army of Tsar Rurik.\n\nParade grounds were once again swarming with men. Firing ranges crackled as they had months prior. Cadets ran through obstacle courses, driven hard by generals to make sure that their men's skills had not deteriorated over the winter. And in the command tents, generals unfurled maps and diagrams they had spent months planning. During the winter they were patient, and during the spring they will strike."

 kemexp.2.t: "The Shieldmaidens"
 kemexp.2.desc: "King Rurik looked over the courtyard from the front of his palace. Before him, over a thousand women stood at attention. These were just the first recruits of the newly formed Shieldmaidens. The Shieldmaidens were to be led by one Anna Kotsur, a Ukrainian nationalist who had been transported between various gulags before ending up near Kemerovo. She had been selected by Princess Lydia to lead the Shieldmaidens, and both Anna and Lydia stood next to King Rurik in front of the palace doors.\n\nAnna Kotsur gave a speech thanking King Rurik for the opportunity to lead these brave women into battle. Her Russian had a noticeable Ukrainian accent, and King Rurik admittedly didn't catch every word she said. Nevertheless, her speech resonated with her troops, who applauded as King Rurik appointed her officially to the rank of General. After she concluded her speech, Princess Lydia gave a speech of her own. The Shieldmaidens had originally been her idea, and she gave a passionate speech about how the bravest soldiers in the realm will now finally have their chance to display their bravery upon the battlefield. Once she concluded, King Rurik stepped forward.\n\nHe thanked the shieldmaidens for choosing to serve their King in the most honorable fashion. No longer would the realm deprive women their chance to fight the enemies of the King upon the grand battlefield that Russia had become. With that said, King Rurik concluded his speech, and called for a 21-gun salute. The last gun signalled the end of the ceremony, and Anna Kotsur led the troops out of the courtyard."

 kemexp.3.t: "Oaths of Loyalty"
 kemexp.3.desc: "Aleksandra Samusenko couldn't help but be a little nervous as the Royal Guard led her and several other former generals of Krasnoyarsk through the palace. While they had all surrendered somewhat peacefully and pledged their allegiance to King Rurik, he still demanded they do so in person. She wondered if the King continued to hold a grudge against them for siding with Andreev.\n\nThe doors to the throne room opened, and there he sat. King Rurik II, formerly known as General Nikolai Krylov. The Krasnoyarsk generals kneeled before the King, who rose and grabbed a sword from some dignitary. He stood before Samusenko, his face difficult to read.\n\n"Aleksandra Samusenko, if you wish to serve King Rurik II, King of the Rus, then prove your loyalty and humility," stated the King, evidently referring to the boot he presented before her face. It felt humiliating having to kiss a man's boot, but that was likely the point of this whole act. One final test of loyalty.\n\n"Aleksandra Samusenko, please rise to your feet," stated King Rurik, and Aleksandra Samusenko did as he commanded. He placed the sword upon her right shoulder, and then the left, and withdrew the blade, "General Aleksandra Samusenko, may you serve this kingdom with pride and valor."\n\nSamusenko was beckoned to the side of the throne room as another Krasnoyarsk general stepped forward, and the same procedure repeated. That whole ceremony had been quite tense, and she hadn't realized she had been holding her breath throughout the ceremony. Samusenko sighed, Kemerovo was certainly a different beast compared to Krasnoyarsk, she just hoped she could adapt."

 kemexp.4.t: "The Traitor General"
 kemexp.4.desc: "Nikolay Andreev was dragged into King Rurik's throneroom and forced to his knees before the King. He was bruised and bloody, and the once charismatic general now was quiet, his eyes staring at some unknown point of interest on the floor. Andreev was the man who had deserted King Rurik at his lowest point. The smoking, the drinking, the humiliation, and the guilt all stemmed from Andreev's betrayal. While the King had since risen from this nadir, Andreev's betrayal still angered His Majesty. Andreev was formally charged with a long list of crimes, and Andreev confessed to these crimes after some coercion from the Royal Guard.\n\nIt was now time for King Rurik to determine Andreev's sentence: Either exile or execution. Would Rurik be like Vladimir the Great, who slew his own brother for his treachery? Or would he set a more merciful example, and let Andreev live on in foreign lands? Could King Rurik forgive this traitor so easily? Nikolay Andreev's fate rested in King Rurik's hands, and King Rurik's hands alone."

King Rurik II wished to grant Oyrotia and its peoples protection, in exchange for fealty. If Zavoloko agreed, Oyrotia would no longer be an independent state, instead a subject to a mad King. However, the envoy made it clear that if Zavoloko refused, Oyrotia would be vassalized by force. Could Oyrotia defend itself against King Rurik's forces? Could Oyrotia sacrifice their independence in exchange for safety? Was survival worth submission, or was it the only path forward?"

The microphone was set up and switched on, and the speakers scattered across the parade ground were silent, save for the occasional faint whooshing as the wind blew over it.\n\nTurning to face the assembled soldiers, he did not wait before launching into his speech. "SUBJECTS, LOYAL MEN, FELLOW RUSSIANS!" his voice boomed over the speakers. "The time for which you have trained is upon you! Your homeland lies sundered, divided between a hundred bandit princes! They desecrate the corpse of Mother Russia! They cheer as they rape her body, smile as they bathe in her blood, and laugh as they feast upon her children! And they dare to do it while you watch!"\n\n"But watch we shall NOT!" The soldiers were listening intently to Rurik's every word, a thousand eyes boring into him. "We-YOU-shall not stand by! You shall take up the sword once held by your forefathers! You shall strike the foe before you, as we struck the Tatar, the Mongol, the Cossack, and the German once before! You shall pry those who defile the motherland out of their lairs and cast them into the fire! And there shall come a day, God willing, when your valor and sacrifice unite Mother Russia once more!

Yuriy ruled with an even hand, opening up the city's administration to all members of society, as long as they were qualified to do so. Prince Yuriy also attempted to integrate as much of the former Tomsk police force as was possible, so that the citizens of Tomsk could trust those patrolling their streets.\n\nAbove all else, Prince Yuriy wished to embrace the cultural riches of Tomsk. Tomsk had long attracted artists and visionaries from across Russia, an artistic safe haven amongst a sea of violence and repression. Prince Yuriy continued this tradition, sponsoring many artists and musicians, and hosting numerous exhibitions for Tomsk's art scene.\n\nWith Tomsk having had a strong democratic tradition ever since the Central Siberian Republic of old, republican sentiment naturally runs high in the city. In order to combat this, Prince Yuriy created some elected positions within his Tomsk government. Combined with additional sponsoring and funding of pro-Rurikid artists and politicians, Prince Yuriy attempted to sideline republican sentiment through peaceful means primarily, only using violence as a last resort."

She was quick to strip the former police of Tomsk of their weapons, replacing them with loyal Kemerovo soldiers, and any dissent was crushed with force.\n\nHowever, all rulers need allies to survive. Lydia, long a proponent of the creation of a new aristocracy, found her allies in the industrialists of Tomsk. She stacked her administration with these wealthy industrialists, subsidizing their factories and businesses, and having them don the same decorum as the rest of Kemerovo's Royal Court. Lydia's goal as Governor was to make Tomsk a productive asset of King Rurik's realm, so that he may better be able to unite Russia, as is his destiny.\n\nAs part of making Tomsk a productive asset to the King, Lydia also funded infrastructure. She ensured that the roads were safe and well-maintained, that factories were functioning at full-capacity, and that the administration was loyal and well-disciplined. She also funded hospitals, as a healthy populace was a productive populace, and the invasion of Tomsk had overwhelmed what remained of its previous health infrastructure. Lydia's rule of Tomsk would be characterized through her authoritarianism, but also her pragmatism."

 kemexp.11.desc: "The Grand Principality of Central Siberia has now been united under King Rurik II - long may he reign! Formerly known as Major General Nikolay Krylov, King Rurik had come to understand his destiny, overcome his failures, and achieve what few had ever considered possible.\n\nThe Siberian Black Army has been subjugated, the anarchist experiment rendered a failure. The traitor general Nikolai Andreev has been brought to justice, and Krasnoyarsk reintegrated. Novosibirsk, led by the Siberian Falcon Alexander Pokryshkin, now serves King Rurik in his conquests with its vast industry, population, and resources. The People's Revolutionary Council had been defeated, the socialist cause dealt yet another blow. Tomsk, the last remnants of the Central Siberian Republic, were now made a loyal subject under the King.\n\nWith all of Central Siberia now united under the King of Rus, King Rurik now stands as a powerful contender for uniting all of Russia - as unlikely as it may have seemed once upon a time. King Rurik's eccentric persona, beloved by the common people, is now well known across Russia, and beyond.\n\nWho knows what the future holds for this glorious realm, now that it may very well hold the fate of all of Russia in its hands. Of course, King Rurik's dreams are not yet achieved, and other contenders still threaten His Majesty and his realm from both the east and west. Despite these victories, the Grand Principality of Central Siberia is not safe yet.\n\nMany spectators called Rurik mad, and laughed at his dream of uniting Russia. Now, King Rurik is the only one laughing, laughing from his grand and mighty throne as he prepares to bring all of Russia under his rule."

 kemexp.12.desc: "The conquest of Pokyrishkin's fiefdom in Novosibirsk has brought a great deal of resources to the kingdom, but with more wealth come more problems. No better example of that is the case of Prince Yuriy and Princess Lydia, who have occupied the latest session of the Sobor with an hours-long debate on how the newly-annexed factories of Novosibirsk should be integrated into the royal economy.\n\n"Esteemed members of the Sobor, I highly recommend that you reject my dear sister's proposal on accounts that her actions are KILLING the loyal workingmen of Russia! I-"\n\nLydia didn't even wait for Yuriy to finish her sentence. "I call upon the Sobor to reject my brother's proposal, for following it will KILL our nation! We cannot afford to tie up our industry with red tape when we are surrounded by war! Better the men in the factories be a few kopeks short for a few years than for them to be slaves to bandits for the rest of their lives!"\n\nThat line really set Yuriy off. "A few kopeks?! How DARE you suggest it's that minor! My programs will save lives, while yours..."\n\nAs the siblings shouted at each other, the assemblymen of the Sobor (at least, those who could be bothered to stay awake) quietly judged them and weighed their options. At last, the Tsar's thoroughly exhausted children returned to their seats, and the voting began. It was narrow, but the Sobor ultimately swung in favor of..."

 kemexp.13.desc: ""Welcome, Matvey Kuzmich! Sit, sit!" Rurik opened the door and let Matvey Shaposhnikov into his office. Fate had taken them in different directions-one to the military in Tomsk, one to the throne in Kemerovo-but politics and warfare could not wear down the bonds of an old friendship.\n\n"Why thank you, Your Majesty," replied Shaposhnikov, still clearly uncomfortable with the honorific.\n\nRurik laughed. "Nonsense, Matvey! For you, I am still Nikolai Ivanovich!" He walked over to the samovar on an end table and grabbed the teapot atop it, filling two cups and adding cubes of precious pre-war sugar.\n\nThe following hours were filled with laughter while reminiscing about old escapades, tears shed for old friends long gone, and sobering silence as they realized they had once ordered thousands of their men to fight the other's.\n\n"At least," Shaposhnikov said as he sipped the last of his tea, "there will be no more bloodshed between our men. You have brought peace to this region, Nikolai Ivanovich."\n\nRurik sighed. "Aye, but not elsewhere. There will be more battles, and blood and death shall be left in their wake. Such is the price of reforging our homeland."\n\n"Russia is disparate, Matvey Kuzmich, and her people need something-someone-in whom they can place their trust." He smiled wryly at his old friend. "And who better to follow than the ghost of old Rurik, given life once again?"\n\nThe last of the tea grew cold, and Rurik dumped the dregs from his cup into the fireplace as he stood up. "So ends our conversation. It was good to talk to you, Matvey Kuzmich.""

 kemexp.14.t: "Sic Semper Tyrannis"
 kemexp.14.desc: "Rurik II is not the King that they expected, but the King that was needed. Such is the opening of the King's speech in the great square of Krasnoyarsk. Rurik looks from face to face, sees the familiar closed-off look with eyes like barred doors in every Russian face that turns to him. Rurik sees this, and speaks nonetheless. "Andreev was of the military, sworn to defend the people of this land." Rurik says this solemnly, going on in solemn conviction, "Yet the military turned on the people once the Germans bested them. The President-General was as a tyrant with no legitimacy, and no doubt did terrible things."\n\nThe people listen with cautious eyes and the bars seem to lift somewhat as the King assures them that they in better hands now, 'that the King, the Tsar, will bring peace and prosperity to Russia with all his people in harmony'. While there are murmurs here and there that dissent, Rurik simply speaks with plain sincerity. The unlikely-looking King on his dais speaking to the crowds gets much right, but much wrong - yet the sincerity bleeds through nonetheless. The people may, in fact, be in good hands.\n\n'You have labored under a tyrant' says the King, and the people murmur at that, 'But we will feed and clothe you, and we will aid the needy' - and the people's murmurs turn cautiously hopeful."

 kemexp.15.desc: "The King's audience hall is modeled today on what is remembered of the Kremlin, the royal banner behind a great throne on a plinth. The priests come into the room with backs straight and censers of incense, and as the King sits through the service some of the holy men fancy they can see a tinge of skepticism in his eyes. The priest at the head is richly adorned and seems old and wise, and gazes unflinchingly at the King as he chants the service.\n\n"This is a prayer for the King, Your Majesty. For long life, fair and just rule, and the unity of Russia." The words come to Rurik as if from far away, and the King nods slowly.\n\n"And this is widely believed today?" The King's question is not a statement of disbelief, and the priest nods as if it was expected.\n\n"The truth of the Church has survived as it has ages before. When we pray, Your Majesty, we are echoed across the realm. So it was for centuries past, so it is today."\n\nRurik nods, and despite his skepticism can feel something - emotion, perhaps, or maybe the weight of tradition before him. The King slowly nods, and when he next speaks the priest begins to smile."

His experience with the Council's formations in the war with Mengjiang had imparted him both with direct practical experience of the use of cavalry and other mobile formations, and with the challenges and opportunities offered by their use. He had brought this knowledge with him, but progress had been very slow.\n\nThat was not to say, he had to admit to himself grudgingly, that there had been no progress at all. Many of the junior officers, commissioned and otherwise, were eager to implement his teachings, and were stymied only by a lack of transport and communication equipment. And that equipment was arriving in greater quantity.\n\nHe was sure that, with a few more weeks or months of intensive exercises and drill, along with access to the needed equipment and infrastructure, he could properly impart his teachings, and thereby improve the combat capabilities of King Rurik's armies manyfold in open field actions.

They spoke in a form of Russian that sounded rather antiquated to him, and it all felt as though it were some kind of reenactment of a long-past trial from deep within Russia's medieval history. Pokryshkin felt that the scene was so surreal, there could've been a chance this was all just an incredibly vivid dream.\n\nUnfortunately for the captive flying ace-turned-statesman, this was no illusion.

The October Revolution, the glorious victories of his father, the rise of the USSR - and what it would have become if history had turned out differently.\n\nYet ever since his father was crowned as Rurik II, the atmosphere of the resurrected medieval Russian Tsardom manifested - and Yuriy realized that he would also have to deal with it. What was once history was now reality.\n\nLearning more of this history was much more interesting and informative than he'd expected. The young korolevich didn't even notice how very soon the events of the distant past captured him, as he leafed through multi-page volumes as days passed. Many inspiring episodes, and valuable lessons were absorbed during these days - and most importantly, on those white pages, Yuriy was surprised to find the answers he had been looking for.\n\nOnce upon a time, knyaz Yuriy Dolgorukiy found himself on the outskirts of Ancient Rus', pushed aside from all the main centers of power of the Velikoe Knyazhestvo. Instead of trying to conquer through force, Yuriy created his own center of power. He built his lands, established many towns, fortresses and roads, enticing thousands of settlers to join from the southern lands, without relying on the selfish boyars. A man who put the peasant before the noble.\n\nNow, almost a thousand years later, Yuriy Krylov saw how he could employ this ancient experience. Decisions of the distant past were born anew, passing through the prism of his own knowledge and experience, and turning into new ideas. As he finished another book, Yuriy grabbed a pen and began to write down his many thoughts. Yes, he wouldn't just use the ideas of the past - He would perfect them."

Every general had some idea or another - and all of them wanted some time with Rurik to pitch it.\n\nBoris Krylov, the youngest of Rurik's children, was the only man in the staff who refused to play such games. During his time in service, he had met with his father only a few times at most, mostly routine inspections done by his father. To the average outsider, he seemed completely unimportant.\n\nYet in the first weeks of war, Prince Boris perhaps changed history as much as either of his siblings, with one proposal - his first, and his last.\n\nHe came to Rurik with dozens of reports. Each described some sort of dispute in his battalions - shouting matches, scuffles, even routs. Each one started with a discussion of Lydia or Yuriy. Sometimes someone bragged that Yuriy would surely implement his reforms. Other times, someone called Lydia a fascist. Yet it always ended the same way - in strife. The battle between siblings had reached the staff, and it was destroying their resolve.\n\nBoris' words were unprepared and stilted, hardly the kind of rehearsed proposal Rurik had come to expect. Yet Boris' mannerisms carried a look of exasperation, even desperation. How many similar crises had his staff refused to report to him, knowing the danger of insulting the Rurikid dynasty? How could an army so divided hope to unite Central Siberia? How had his family come to this?\n\nWhatever the case, it couldn't continue. Rurik solemnly agreed to the words of his son - something would need to be done about Lydia and Yuriy's rivalry."

Soldiers marched, the sounds of the city reached her ears, and the other men in the tower stood at attention - though the princess was more preoccupied with the countryside than them.\n\nThe land was beautiful; a beautiful picture of the Siberian lands in all their stark glory. Plains and forests stretched out, the bite of the wind was cool, and the overcast clouds cast a dimming light across the land. A few birds flew in the sky, and though she could not see them, she knew that animals prowled in the lands beyond. Lands where their enemies laid. Lands that belonged to them. Lands that would soon be theirs once more.\n\nWhen the realization had hit her, she had found it curious more than anything; a sense of destiny that rested upon her. A realization that she was in the same position as those who had ruled the Kievan Rus so long ago - and whose own conquests had laid the foundations for Russia itself. Was this merely the next cycle of history, and now it fell to her to take up the task of forging Russia anew?\n\nShe wondered how her historic predecessors had approached such a task, facing hostile lands and enemies around them. Perhaps there were lessons to be learned there, as it was the legacy they sought to emulate. Yes, this was her duty - and it required she learn from the past, and apply it to the present.\n\nHer hair whipped around her face as the wind intensified, and the temperature dropped as the sun continued to fall. As it did, she resolved to embrace this destiny that had fallen upon her shoulders, and take to heart the lessons of the past. For she intended to leave a legacy of her own."

In the afternoon, he visited the steel industrial complex under construction, supervising the progress of work. When the day began to give way to the evening, Yuriy finally let himself relax.\n\nRiding in an open-topped GAZ-12, personally modified by him, Yuriy drove from one street to another throughout the city. The whole sloboda was built in such a way that people living and working here would be proud of their profession - an idea that Yuriy learned from Soviet urban planners.\n\nHis gaze caught on the red stars at the top of the gate. While Lydia tried to avoid Soviet symbols, Yuriy loved them. In the ornaments of city decorations, Soviet stars and ears of wheat now and then were intricately intertwined with tridents of Rurikids and double-headed eagles.\n\nAs the sun was approaching the horizon, coloring the sky with orange hues, Yuriy changed his car ride to a walk. Warm wind and the thrill of the drive was replaced by the quieter atmosphere born from steadily igniting lights of elegant street lamps; the muffled hubbub of human voices on the background of smooth sounds of music, heard from cafes around.\n\nBehind all this leisurely promenade, a strange sense of security seized Yuriy, something not experienced by him in many years. This feeling made the korolevich exhale, with some kind of chuckle from sudden realization. The last time he felt this way was in Vladivostok. His long-lost home."
 kemexp.22.a: "It seems that the home has found him again now, in this strange and wonderful city."
 
 kemexp.23.t: "The Rituals of the Present"
 kemexp.23.desc: "Mikhail couldn't help but wonder if he was participating in some kind of game or theatrical play. Being well acquainted with Lydia Krylova, and having demonstrated his competence as an administrator, he'd expected to be chosen the Namestnik of this volost. Such a ceremony he'd expected - what was more odd was Lydia personally coming to oversee the rehearsal.\n\nTruthfully, the ceremony was quite harmless: Oaths, kneeling, kissing a coat of arms and sword, and receiving a special diadem - standard stuff. Then there were more unusual elements as well, such as passing through controlled flames, and washing with pure snow.\n\nAll this seemed to be a strange, bizarre whim of Tsar Rurik II. Lydia nonetheless treated the whole ceremony with the utmost seriousness, expressing critique until the rituals were performed to her satisfaction.\n\nWhen the rehearsal ended, Mikhail relaxed, approaching Lydia to talk more informally. Both exchanged some more pleasantries as they exited the hall, and as Mikhail looked back, he raised an eyebrow at the princess. "Quite a curious ceremony. Is all this necessary?"\n\n"Absolutely." she affirmed without hesitation. "Each aspect was approved by Tsar Rurik II personally - and he expects impeccable execution."\n\n"Certainly, but..." he still wondered. "Why such strictness? I respect His Majesty, of course - but you are a reasonable woman," he risked a smile. "Do you really believe all this nonsense?"\n\nLydia's face went still, cold, and as she appraised Mikhail - hardened. "Without question. I will offer you some advice - If you still wish to be the Namestnik - you better start believing in it too." She stepped closer, her voice leaving no room for doubt."
 kemexp.23.a: ""And you better start now.""
 
 kemexp.24.t: "Together Towards Victory"
 kemexp.24.desc: ""Their eastern flank is weak," Lydia rested a finger on the map. "If we can pin their flanks, we can cut right through the middle, and encircle at least two-thirds of their army. The remainder?" She moved a piece into their ultimate target - the city. "Isolated and weakened. An easy victory."\n\nYuriy rubbed his chin - and Rurik branched himself for an angry retort - but surprisingly, he slowly nodded. The meeting had been called to determine the strategy for capturing one of the larger cities in enemy hands - of which there were several approaches. Rurik had yet to commit to one - instead calling his children to determine a path.\n\n"The city is their lifeline," Yuriy reset several pieces on the map. "Their lines are already extended - so why target their military directly when we can pin their forces down, and the bulk or our soldiers move to secure the city? When we have the city, it is over for them."\n\n"They are already suffering from attrition," Boris pointed out, who had largely let the two siblings debate. "Regardless of the approach, their best-supplied divisions are here, and here," he tapped on the map. "This knowledge should be incorporated."\n\nSome further discussion continued - both Lydia and Yuriy both continued to disagree on the best strategy, yet where this would have devolved into a shouting match at one point, now they were respecting the view of the other. Yuriy finally turned to Rurik. "I think we've reached an impasse, father. What would you recommend?"\n\nThat simple question brought a small smile to Rurik's face. His family, which had been bickering and divided for too long, seemed to be united; more so than he had seen in years. His love for his children, and his happiness at this breakthrough was only for a moment before he tempered himself. There was work to do."
 kemexp.24.a: ""Both of you raise good points, but this what must be done...""

 kemexp.25.t: "A Family Meeting"
 kemexp.25.desc: "With bleary eyes and an awkward step, Yuriy took off towards Rurik's field tent, a lantern in his hand. The night before, he was told to meet his father an hour before the morning briefing. As the staff always met at the crack of dawn, this left Yuriy marching towards his father's quarters in the dark of night.\n\nYuriy arrived to find the tent glowing with a dim light, its flaps open. Sitting on top of his sleeping bag was Rurik - beside him, Lydia. Of course, Yuriy thought to himself. She must have made a mistake, and now Yuriy would have to fix it, just like always. Perhaps she was finally being stripped of her command - that would be the day!\n\nAs Yuriy sat down, Lydia turned to whisper in his ear. "Late as always, brother." Yuriy quickly turned to make a response, but found that Rurik had already raised a hand.\n\n"Stop. It is this exact bickering that must end." Rurik's voice was dry and serious, completely devoid of the King's typical pomp and grandeur. The children froze in shock - neither had heard such a voice since the collapse of the Central Siberian Republic.\n\n"I understand you two are of fiercely different opinion - I am glad you are so devoted to this kingdom. But war requires a united front. Instead, our army abounds with talk of my son and my daughter, frittering like children! The kingdom cannot take this... I cannot take this. If you two are to continue, you will learn to postpone such arguments until this war is over."\n\nFor a minute or two, the Krylovs sat in silence, taking in the severity of the situation. Then, judging there was no more to say, Rurik dismissed them. As the children filed out, Rurik took the crown from his head, placed it upon his pillow, and put his head in his hands."
 kemexp.25.a: "The weight of royalty... it is almost too heavy to bear."

 kemreg.1.t: "A Family Feud"
 kemreg.1.desc: ""As you can see, father, our domain now stretches from Tatarsk in the West to Bratsk in the East. For the first time in several weeks, our forces have reported minimal resistance to our..." Boris Krylov trailed off as he looked to his father. The King looked deeply troubled, his eyes distant and cold. Rurik II seemed to care little about the subject at hand, and it was obvious his mind was focused on something darker. "Father, what troubles you? You've been too quiet today."\n\nRurik II's eyes snapped to his son. "It's your siblings, Boris. What the hell am I supposed to do with them? Their disputes grow more venomous and destructive by the day, and I cannot bear to watch it any longer."\n\nBoris walked away from the map he had been presenting and sighed as he took a seat next to his father. The old King sounded utterly defeated. "I wish I could tell you. You know I was never one for politics, father."\n\n"Politics? You think this is about politics?! Yuriy and Lydia, my own flesh and blood, have become enemies, and I have done so little to stop them. What kind of father stands by while his children go to war?" Rurik II sounded as though he was on the verge of tears.\n\nBoris put a reassuring hand on his father's shoulder. "You've done what you could, father. As much as it pains us to see them fight, this may be the only way they can settle their differences."\n\nThe King's eyes grew distant once more. "Perhaps you're right, Boris. It's just, they used to be so close...""
 kemreg.1.a: "Trouble on the horizon."

 kemreg.2.t: "A New Capital?"
 kemreg.2.desc: "The situation has changed dramatically from the grim hours we had endured several years ago. With the victory of His Majesty's armed forces, and the expansion of the realm's borders to encompass the entire Central Siberian region, the question has been raised of where exactly the Royal Court shall be located. Kemerovo was never intended to be the permanent center of royal authority, and was mostly chosen simply because it was the only noteworthy settlement available to us.\n\nNow that the region has been unified, we now have a few locations that could potentially be more suitable as the administrative center of the realm. Novosibirsk is the most obvious choice, being the largest and most populous city in all of Siberia. On top of being a vital industrial center, the city benefits from well-developed infrastructure and a strong agricultural base.\n\nAlternatively, we could move the court to the city of Krasnoyarsk, formerly controlled by Nikolai Andreev and his mutineers. While not necessarily as populous as Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk is still quite large by Siberian standards, and most importantly of all, is home to a critical junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This fact alone makes the city an appealing choice indeed.\n\nOf course, we could always decide to just stay in Kemerovo. Of all the potential choices, Kemerovo is the most centrally located, and benefits from having been developed into the stronghold of royal authority for many years. Of course, there is also the sentimental value: Kemerovo was where our kingdom was proclaimed in the first place, after all."
 kemreg.2.a: "Novosibirsk, naturally."
 kemreg.2.b: "Krasnoyarsk is the most logical choice."
 kemreg.2.c: "Kemerovo is too important to abandon!"

 kemreg.3.t: "A Minor Issue"
 kemreg.3.desc: "Another day, another heated argument in the Zemsky Sobor. What was once thought to be a minor issue had since escalated to become another verbal battlefield for the two wolves, Prince Yuriy and Princess Lydia, to do battle on.\n\n"To intrude upon the rights of the local councils would be tantamount to tyranny, no matter how small the intrusion. Yes, today it may only be roads and telephone lines, but what of tomorrow? I wholeheartedly agree that the realm must be connected, but we cannot do it without the express consent of the people!" As always, Yuriy was nothing if not passionate.\n\nHis sister, Lydia, rolled her eyes. "Again with this talk of 'rights', Yuriy? How tiresome. Perhaps you would also like us to ask the ground if it would be okay for us to build on top of it? Maybe we should ensure that the God-given rights of the woodland animals aren't infringed upon either?" Laughter could be heard amongst some of the council in response.\n\nRurik II was distraught at the sight of his children arguing with each other in such a way, but did his level best not to show it. It was clear, however, that the two would not budge. Soon enough, the council would be looking to their King to break the deadlock..."
 kemreg.3.a: "We shall pay heed to Prince Yuriy."
 kemreg.3.b: "Princess Lydia has a point."

 kemreg.4.t: "The White Wolf"
 kemreg.4.desc: ""...it is my great honor as Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus' to name my son, Yuriy, as Crown Prince. Upon my death, he shall become your rightful sovereign."\n\nWithin an instant, most of those who were present amongst the Zemsky Sobor erupted into applause. Prince Yuriy, now the heir to his father's legacy, rose from his seat. As he stood, silence once again washed over the room, and the entire council had turned their attention to their new Crown Prince. At such a sight, it was hard for Yuriy to avoid getting emotional.\n\n"I am deeply honored by your show of trust, father. Rest assured, your legacy shall not wither away with your passing. I will ensure that all the people of your realm are treated fairly and with the respect they rightfully deserve. Together, we shall work towards a more just kingdom, and a brighter future for all of Russia!" The applause resumed, more ferocious than last time. Yuriy couldn't help but notice that even those who had remained silent before had joined in.\n\nThe Crown Prince looked to Lydia, who had not so much as moved a muscle since the announcement. Her expression betrayed a deep anger, a fury so intense that it could not be expressed through words. Lydia suddenly locked eyes with her brother's, and Yuriy went cold. Her gaze pierced directly into Yuriy's soul, a stare almost murderous in nature. Turning away from her brother, Lydia got up from her seat and left the council chamber. Most were so swept up in the festivities, that they had neglected to notice the departure of the princess.\n\nDespite his victory, Yury couldn't help but feel some lingering regrets over the feud. Lydia's cold glance had told the Crown Prince all he needed to know about how his sister felt."
 kemreg.4.a: "All hail Crown Prince Yuriy!"

 kemreg.5.t: "The Black Wolf"
 kemreg.5.desc: ""...it is my privilege as Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus' to name my daughter, Lydia, as Crown Princess. In the event of my passing, she shall become your rightful sovereign."\n\nOverwhelming applause followed the King's proclamation almost instantaneously. The newly-appointed Crown Princess and heir to the throne, Lydia, rose from her seat to address the Zemsky Sobor. As she stood before the entire council, silence had once again dominated the chamber.\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for this great responsibility you have bestowed upon me, father. You will not find a soul more capable of continuing your glorious legacy as I. Know that I shall focus all of my efforts on continuing to bring strength and honor to the realm. I will not rest until the darkness that has befallen the Rus' has been banished through sheer force of will!"\n\nLydia's brief speech was punctuated by the boisterous return of the applause. As she surveyed the celebrations, Lydia felt more proud in that moment than any other in her entire life. Victory at last. Her wandering eyes eventually landed on her brother, Prince Yuriy, who had conspicuously abstained from joining in on the applause. As their eyes met, Lydia shot him a smug grin. Yuriy's disconnected demeanor quickly turned to that of smoldering anger, and the snubbed Prince quickly got up from his seat and made for the chamber's exit. Yuriy angrily slammed the door behind him, the noise startling some of the council members.\n\nAfter her brother departed, Lydia's smirk disappeared. She had secured the prize she had so desperately coveted, but was it really worth making an enemy of her own brother? Even now, the Crown Princess was not entirely sure."
 kemreg.5.a: "All hail Crown Princess Lydia!"

 kemreg.6.t: "Preserving the Past, Building the Future"
 kemreg.6.desc: "King Rurik II paced slowly alongside the large scale model of the newly proposed renovations to [KEM.Capital.GetName], making sure to soak in every detail. For too long he had been forced to hold court in the frozen remnants of a proper city. Should the vision depicted within the model before him be realized, [KEM.Capital.GetName] would shine once more as a center of power fit for a monarch of Rurik II's stature.\n\nForeign Minister and Royal Architect Pyotr Baranovsky stood in the corner of the room looking on as his liege gleefully examined the model he had put together. Rurik II was usually a gloomy old fellow, but today his eyes betrayed the excitement of a child in a candy store. "I trust everything is to your liking, Your Grace?"\n\n"Masterful work as always, Baranovsky! Fleeting visions of Russia's past, transplanted into the present..." Rurik II's gaze remained focused on the model as he spoke, and he leaned in for a closer look. The proposed buildings were not unlike the kingdom itself- taking clear inspiration from the architectural legacy of medieval Russia, married with a sensibly modern touch. With walls of red and white crowned with a variety of garishly decorated roofs, the structures of the hypothesized city were a feast for the eyes.\n\nRurik finally managed to peel his attention away from the model and towards the architect. "Marvelous... simply marvelous. When can I expect the renovations to begin, Baranovsky?"\n\n"As soon as we are able, Your Grace. We just require-"\n\n"You will have it. Whatever it is, it shall be yours, so long as this masterpiece becomes reality!""

 kemreg.7.t: "The Royal Inspection"
 kemreg.7.desc: "The men stood in rigid rows, their uniforms clean, and their rifles resting in their arms. General Ivan Yakovlev's men were clearly attempting to make the best impression possible. General Yakovlev walked down the rows, discussing the state of his army to King Rurik, "Back when you first donned the crown, Your Majesty, these men couldn't even line up straight. Now look at them! Disciplined, clean, and some of the finest men east of the Urals!"\n\nYakovlev's words had some merit, with Rurik having just seen the men perform a training exercise. They performed admirably, a far cry from the rag-tag, desperate men Rurik had left after Andreev's betrayal. Of course, there was still room for improvement, the equipment they carried was still outdated, albeit some progress there had been made in the last couple of months. Rurik brought up these concerns, amongst others, and Yakovlev largely agreed, "Yes, the situation regarding equipment and uniforms is less than desired, and the men can lose morale easier than I like, but I'd say that we've improved greatly, Your Majesty. If we ignore the issue of equipment, in which my hands are tied, how does Your Majesty feel about the state of your army?"'\n\n"They seem more disciplined, you've done a lot of good work here, Yakovlev. With our eyes set upon seizing the eastern shores of the Motherland, I hope you can continue to show such excellent results."\n\n"I'll try my best, Your Majesty.""
 kemreg.7.a: "The finest soldiers in all of Rus!"

 kemreg.8.t: "Royal Pardons"
 kemreg.8.desc: "As King Rurik's army grew, it became clear he needed more men to lead them. Unfortunately, most of the Royal Court's candidates were already in charge of armies. He needed to look beyond his own trusted allies, and look for candidates from elsewhere in Central Siberia. Specifically, the former generals of Novosibirsk, Tomsk, and the People's Revolutionary Council. If these men swear loyalty to King Rurik, we can pardon them for their crimes of aiding enemy regimes, and integrate them into our forces. Of course, some of King Rurik's advisors say that pardoning these former generals is too dangerous, and that we can't trust them.\n\nOnly a few advisors protest integrating the generals of Novosibirsk, whose ideology, or lack thereof, is most compatible with our own. They would be the easiest to integrate, but some worry they may attempt to overthrow the King in favor of the military, like they did to the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nThe generals of Tomsk are not rejected for fear of a military coup, instead we fear their ideology. The generals of Tomsk are feared to be radical republicans, and a number of the advisors protest their integration for this reason.\n\nThen there are the generals from the People's Revolutionary Council. Almost the entire court believes them to be unforgivable, and many call for the socialists to be rounded up and exiled away from the realm. However, some argue that any of their generals who can betray their Marxist ideals enough to swear fealty to King Rurik can be sufficiently trusted.\n\nAll of this discussion matters not, in the end, it is the King's decision to issue a royal pardon. Who will he choose?"
 kemreg.8.a: "No pardons shall be given, none may stand against the King."
 kemreg.8.b: "Pardon the Novosibirsk generals, we need their experience."
 kemreg.8.c: "Pardon the Tomsk generals, their republicanism can be forgiven."
 kemreg.8.d: "Pardon the communist generals, they've proven their worth."
 kemreg.8.e: "King Rurik is merciful, pardon them all."

 kemreg.9.desc: ""Royal Ministry of Architecture. Pyotr Baranovsky speaking."\n\n"Is that any way to address your King, Baranovsky? For shame!" The old King's speech was noticeably slurred, even from behind the telephone. Baranovsky sighed. He still didn't know what to expect from the old man when he was drunk.\n\n"I... I apologize, Your Grace. What do you require of me?"\n\n"Let me ask you a question, Baranovsky. How can I claim to be the rightful sovereign of all Rus' when the world doubts my authority? The great leaders of the world look at me as though I was a crazy old man playing dress up. A monarch of my prestige does not deserve to be treated this way!"\n\n"With all due respect, my liege, don't you think we have more important things to worry about than our image?" There was a pause. Baranovsky briefly wondered if he had forgotten his place.\n\n"Utter nonsense, Pyotr. We're going to settle this, you and me!"\n\n"Erm, you and I? Wha-"\n\n"Indeed, Pyotr! You are now head of my new Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I already have a few suitable candidates to serve as our ambassadors. I expect you to put them to work post-haste!"\n\n"But wait, I-"\n\nWith a sudden click, the conversation was brought to an abrupt halt. Baranovsky was left at a loss for words, the phone still pressed to his ear."
 kemreg.9.a: "Time to make an impression."

 kemreg.10.t: "A Curious Visitor"
 kemreg.10.desc: "A curious development has arisen from the State Department. Earlier today, an ambassador arrived in Washington seeking to discuss diplomatic overtures. While receiving emissaries is not entirely unusual in of itself, the man who approached us today was anything but the usual kind of ambassador.\n\nHe claimed to be an emissary on behalf of "King Rurik II, Tsar and Autocrat of all Rus," and his realm which supposedly is based out of a major city in the Russian region of Central Siberia. This claim can be corroborated with reports from the CIA, who confirm that there has indeed been a dramatic shift of the balance of power in the region. While they still do not have a clear picture of the situation, the implication suggests that this "Rurik II" may very well have become a powerful new player in the Russian game.\n\nMonarchist movements are nothing new to Russia, but we have so far been unable to find any man by the name of Rurik who holds a claim to the throne. Stranger still was the ambassador's appearance. Diplomatic officials who were present to witness the meeting described his attire as "straight out of a renaissance fair" and "worthy of a Halloween costume".\n\nEstablishment of diplomatic relations with this "Rurik" could provide much needed information on the dire situation in Russia, and his regime could potentially serve as a key partner for our potential strategic interests in the region. After all, who are we to turn down friendly ties in times like these? On the other hand, more skeptical minds in the State Department are suggesting that the whole thing is merely an elaborate hoax, and should be ignored..."

 kemreg.11.desc: "Pyotr Baranovsky found himself hard at work at his desk, laboring well into the night. The new Foreign Minister was so consumed with his work that he had initially failed to notice that a figure had shuffled into his office. Pyotr pulled his attention away from the paperwork and towards his guest. He immediately recognized the exhausted man as one of his ambassadors.\n\n"Ah, Yevgeny! I apologize, I was so busy I didn't see you there. My vision must be getting worse with age. How was your trip to the States?"\n\n"It was incredible, Pyotr! You should have seen the wonders they had there, you wouldn't believe it unless you saw it. They had these brightly-lit buildings that you could drive right up to and order the most amazing meals, almost like a giant food stall. I could hardly-"\n\n"Yes, yes, but I was actually wondering how your meeting with the Americans went?"\n\n"Oh, of course. The Americans would be honored to establish formal diplomatic relations with the realm as soon as possible. As we speak, my people are working out the details with Washington over our new embassy."\n\n"Excellent work, Yevgeny. His Majesty will be pleased, no doubt." Pyotr didn't show it, but the success of the mission caused him great elation. He wasn't so sure in the past, but the old architect was beginning to think that perhaps he had a real talent for diplomacy's cutthroat games after all."

Clearly encouraged by our attitude towards his so-called kingdom, his diplomats have reached out through official channels to make a request. There is no doubt now that this is not a mere hoax, but a legitimate effort by a Russian faction to strengthen ties with the United States.\n\nThe "King" wishes to attract American business to his growing realm, and wants us to make a significant financial investment in Central Siberia to pique the interest of our businesses in the region and its potential benefits. This request is not to be taken lightly, and represents an important crossroads for relations with the bizarre Russian regime.\n\nWhile the Russian diplomats assure us that an investment would be of great benefit to both parties, some of our economists are not nearly as idealistic and consider the prospect a waste of America's valuable resources. How shall we proceed?"

Already we are seeing various businesses from the US taking an interest in our realm, contacting our foreign office to work out the details of setting up shop in our humble kingdom.\n\nAmerican aid will obviously be the shot in the arm our young economy needs, but most importantly this is a good step on the road to building firmer relations with the United States. We can only hope this is a good sign of things to come!"

Despite the best efforts of our diplomats, the Americans have decided to decline our request to make an investment in our economy. While they assure us they are still committed to maintaining good relations, they claim that such an investment would not be within their best interests for now.\n\nThis is not the result we were expecting, and it leads many in the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs to suspect that dealing with the Americans may be a waste of time. Only time will tell how future diplomatic talks will go."
 kemreg.14.a: "Our disappointment is immeasurable."

 kemreg.15.t: "Another Royal Request"

This time, it appears he is trying to undergo some kind of effort to industrialize his realm, and needs help doing so in a timely, efficient manner.\n\nThis is where we come in. Rurik II is under the impression that certain experts in the matters of industry who currently reside in the US could put their talents to use helping with his industrialization drive. He requests that we send some to Central Siberia to support these efforts, and assures that we will be well-compensated for our show of good faith.\n\nWhile this would surely help with strengthening relations with Rurik II's regime and continue to support a friendly face in Russia, some of our officials have pointed out that the situation in Russia is still quite dangerous and sending Americans to this war-torn country would put their lives in unnecessary danger. What's the call?"

They will be arriving in Central Siberia shortly, and we expect they'll be looking for work almost immediately.\n\nThis is another significant milestone in our efforts to maintain strong relations with the United States. If they are willing to send some of their own people to aid with the development of our humble kingdom, who knows what kind of deals they'll be open to in the future?"
 kemreg.16.a: "Very good!"

The Americans claim that the situation in Russia is simply too unstable to risk sending American citizens to work with us, and are worried that their lives would be in danger in such a wild environment. While this reasoning is not entirely unfounded, it is still disappointing nonetheless.\n\nOur factories will simply have to make do without the industrial expertise of the Americans. While we are confident in their abilities, getting the industry of Central Siberia back online would've been so much easier with the aid of Uncle Sam..."

How they journeyed here was unknown, but the men, dressed like mystics and hunched like pilgrims, started to shuffle toward the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOnce the envoy had arrived at their destination, they hailed themselves as, "Emissaries of the Rightful Tsar of all Rus, His Highness Rurik the Second" and immediately requested a meeting with the Foreign Secretary. Their introduction was as rude as it was bizarre, after all, the rule of the Rurik dynasty over Russia had ended well over four centuries ago. Yet there they stood, impatiently waiting for their assumed meeting.\n\nApart from the initial confusion caused by their arrival, the ambassadors were ushered into the office of the Foreign Secretary. Although he certainly did not fully understand the strange land they came from, he knew that connections with this kingdom would potentially bring great benefits for him and his country."

His astonishment was only heightened when he learnt that they had succeeded in their task. They had forged a diplomatic connection with the empire in the east; such news, Baranovsky assumed, could only be good for the future of the kingdom he served.\n\nYet, as so often the case was for the Foreign Minister, there was plenty more work to be done. After all, Baranovsky knew that communications on their own would not improve the economy of the kingdom."

Revealing a few faces that had become oddly familiar to the workers inside. They were the faces of the ambassadors of Rurik II, since they had been relocated into a more permanent location, they now sought to come to an agreement on Japanese investment. An offer which was readily accepted.\n\nThe Japanese ministers present needed little reminding of the hidden wealth of Siberia, which they knew would be fabulously profitable to exploit. The impeccably efficient techniques and machines of the Zaibatsu would only allow for more wealth to be generated. Such a result would only serve to benefit both sides.\n\nYet the risks of investing in such a volatile region remained heavy on the minds of both parties. Any investment at such a stage in time would surely be a gamble, prone to the many changes that were yet to shake Siberia.\n\nThe Russians were dismissed soon after and told to wait for an official response. All that was left for the Foreign Minister to do was make one."
 kemreg.20.a: "Allow the investments."
 kemreg.20.b: "It's too great a risk."

 kemreg.21.t: "Japanese Investment Arrives"
 kemreg.21.desc: "The news of Japanese investment had been hastily sent into the kingdom, soon to be followed by the tools of the Zaibatsu. Royals, politicians, and mine owners together shared in their ready anticipation of the riches that would soon follow. They could barely wait for their land to be made rich from foreign investment; fortunately for them, they did not have to suffer their impatience for long.\n\nVarious giant metal machines were to be carried across the Siberian plains until they were installed and left to stand, unmoving, to churn at the earth beneath them and uncover its hidden richness. In time all that will remain of such brutal efficiency will be scarred and empty land.\n\nHowever, these thoughts were not present for those in power. They knew that wealth was needed to better the lives of the King's subjects. Besides, it would be more practical for them to accept Japan's assistance as there are still more benefits that could be made from keeping them close."
 kemreg.21.a: "For now, there is profit to be made."

 kemreg.22.t: "Japanese Declines to Invest"
 kemreg.22.desc: "Baranovsky struggled to find a suitable way to break the news to his monarch. Rurik was certain to be upset by such news, the King had been expecting to receive a large amount of support from Japan in the future. The Foreign Secretary continued to try and find a way in which he could assure the King that future cooperation would not be ruled out.\n\nYet no matter which way he constructed what he was going to say he could not undermine the fact that the kingdom would be worse off for the lack of investment. Many would be left unemployed and the states finances would be much worse off as a result.\n\nIn the end all Baranovsky could come up with was the assurance that one day Siberia's vast wealth would be uncovered. For now the expanse of land under His Highness's domain will remain undisturbed, but when it is inevitably exploited, the King's subjects will be richer for it."
 kemreg.22.a: "An opportunity missed."

 kemreg.23.t: "A Letter to Japan"
 kemreg.23.desc: "Following the requests of his Foreign Minister to send an official message of friendship to the Emperor of Japan. Such a letter would help strengthen the bond between the two monarchs and open up a wide range of cooperation in the future, or so he had been told.\n\nHis court members had attempted to hijack the writing of the declaration for themselves, however he had remained steadfast and made sure that all the work was genuine. He thought it better to keep it more authentic than diplomatic.\n\nRurik found the start of his writing the hardest, he had no idea where to begin let alone how to conclude the damned thing. Yet as the night went on, and the bottle on his desk got emptier, he realised that the words flowed from his pen with ease.\n\nBy the time he had scrawled his name at the bottom of the page he was quietly impressed with his efforts. Such length and such style could have only been the work of his genius. He did not bother to reanalyse what he wrote, instead he had it sealed and sent off right away.\n\nBaranovsky was quite taken aback once he had learnt of the news that the King had sent off the declaration without first requesting him to read over it. He might have complained, but he knew better than to question his royal highnesses judgement. The Foreign Secretary knew that all he could do was hope."
 kemreg.23.a: "Let us hope for the best."

 kemreg.24.t: "A Letter From Siberia"
 kemreg.24.desc: "At the height of noon a letter arrived at the office of the Imperial Foreign Minister. It had been delivered by one of the diplomats who hailed from that strange Siberian kingdom; of which the minister still knew oddly little about.\n\nUpon opening the envelope he realised that the letter was addressed to the Emperor and, inexplicably, not to him. He returned it into the envelope and decided against carrying it to the Emperor personally, better not bother him with such trivialities. Besides he would like to read more of it, and he would have had it not been so awfully written, and in Russian.\n\nInstead he found a translator who might have been able to read the appalling work easier than he had. Yet the translator struggled enormously with this task, the phrases were muddled, the word choices bizarre and the punctuation non-existent. Try as he might he could not decipher what was written, he even began to question whether it had been written in some other foreign language he had not heard of. The only part he could confidently decode was the name signed at the bottom:\n\n"Rurik II, Tsar and Autocrat of All Rus"\n\nThe foreign minister turned to the translator and asked:"

 kemreg.25.desc: "From far beyond the Kazakh Steppe, a band of men journeyed toward the capital. Their sole aim being to make contact with the government in Kazakhstan, which they had deemed to be friendly. The expedition they had embarked upon was long and grueling, but soon enough they found themselves at the entrance to the city.\n\nOnce they had been accepted into a meeting with some of the nation's diplomats, they declared that they hailed from [KEM.Capital.GetName] and spoke on the behalf of the Tsar Rurik the Second. They went on to outline how the Tsar would like to establish a warm diplomatic relation with them, for the benefit of both of their lands.\n\nThe Kazakh officials agreed that such an arrangement would be beneficial to the peace and prosperity of both sides. And so a deal was made between the two, and the men travelled back to their strange land, happy with the progress they had made."
 kemreg.25.a: "Friends in Siberia."

 kemreg.26.t: "Our Ambassadors Return"
 kemreg.26.desc: "After a seemingly endless journey into the heart of Kazakhstan, our ambassadors have returned, and they have come with good news. The government of Kazakhstan was as friendly as was first believed, as a result, a strong, fruitful and hopefully long lasting connection has been made with them.\n\nPyotr Baranovsky was pleased to hear this, as he knew that having an ally at such close proximity could only benefit them with their future endeavours. Diplomatic relations with the Kazakh government would certainly lessen the amount of bloodshed in the future. It would also help to bring greater prosperity in peacetime, with future cooperation now available that would enrich both states.\n\nThe foreign secretary was pleased with his ambassador's success, and felt greatly relieved that there was one less potential enemy of the kingdom that he would have to worry about."
 kemreg.26.a: "Friends in Kazakhstan."

 kemreg.27.t: "Have I Played My Part Well?"
 kemreg.27.desc: "King Rurik II's end came gradually, and then all at once. He had been on the decline for years, his body getting slower, aching more and more. Then one day he collapsed at a meeting, having to be rushed to his room by his own generals. Despite expert care it soon became apparent to everyone the King was dying.\n\nThe King awoke one last time, finding himself surrounded by his family. His children at his bedside. Yuriy and Lydia even putting aside their differences at least for the day. He hoped it would last, that they would finally come together as a family. Perhaps they were too far gone, but perhaps not. Regardless, it was not his heir he spoke to, for he had said all that needed to be said to them days ago. It was Boris, the one among them who never had aspirations beyond duty and family.\n\n"Tell me, are the people happy? Is our Kingdom strong enough?" The old King's voice was barely more than a whisper.\n\nBoris smiled. "Yes father, the Kingdom is strong. You've prepared us well for what's to come."\n\nRurik nodded, wiping the sweat from his brow. "Good, good. Then this whole charade was worth it in the end."\n\nHis children didn't question his final words. Perhaps assuming it was madness like others had done since the beginning. Perhaps it was madness, but that didn't matter. Russia was nearly whole again, united and strong. He had done all he could for the people, his heir would do so much more, of that he was certain. While he had regrets, Rurik II, King of the Rus, was satisfied with what he had built.\n\nAnd so Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov closed his eyes for the last time, his duty finally ending."
 kemreg.27.a: "Applaud my exit."

 kemreg.28.t: "The People's King"
 kemreg.28.desc: "It was a crisp, cold day. The crowd outside the place was massive, people filling every able standing spot. The people struggling to get a look at their King, to see him crowned at last. His generals, his family and the Zemsky Sobor had all argued against this, saying a ceremony within the palace would be safer and far more grand. But Yuriy had insisted it take place outside. It was the people who made this kingdom possible after all; they deserved to see such a momentous occasion first hand.\n\nHe turned away from the railing, glancing briefly at his sister, who stared at him from the sidelines. Looking indignant and annoyed but not as angry as he once would have expected from her. He then looked at his father's crown, held by a union leader, selected by raffle for this occasion. He placed his hand on the crown, turning to speak into the microphone.\n\n"This crown is far more than a birthright, it is a vow, a promise to all the people of this great kingdom." He addressed the cheering crowd. "To uphold all my father has built for you. To ensure that your rights, your liberties, and your prosperity are all protected. That no enemy, foreign or domestic, will ever again threaten to take all you have earned in the past decade."\n\nYuriy knelt, allowing the union leader to place the crown upon his head. "I name thee King Rurik III, King of the Rus." The man declared in a nervous voice "Long may he reign!""
 kemreg.28.a: "All Hail King Rurik III!"

 kemreg.29.t: "The Wolf Queen"
 kemreg.29.desc: "The throne room was packed. Soldiers, generals, and nobles alike standing to the sides, all focused on their Queen. Lydia's attire was elegant but austere, a wolf pelt draped over her shoulders like a cloak. The finest men and women of the Queensguard flanking the path which lead to her regal throne. In the past, the Romanovs were crowned by a member of the church, as a sign their power ultimately came from god. The Rus had no time for such superstitious nonsense. The crown was held by one of the Queensguard, and no one would crown Lydia but herself. She grabbed the crown, one she had specifically made for her. Holding in her hands she felt a pain of regret. Her father was dead, her brother in exile. Whatever the kingdom would face in years to come, she would have to do it without them.\n\nShe killed such thoughts. For the sake of the kingdom she would have to move past these doubts, move past even being Lydia. Bury the Princess like she buried the nurse so long ago. She placed the crown atop her head.\n\n"All Hail Queen Rogneda, Queen of the Rus." The Queensguard declared to all gathered.\n\nRogneda rose from her throne as the people clapped. She allowed them a moment before she spoke.\n\n"We have come far in recent years. From one tiny spot in the Siberian wilderness we have managed to forge a vast and mighty empire, defeating all who dared challenge us." She declared to the hall. "But our duty is not over. What my father began, we must finish. Too many of our countrymen suffer under the rule of Teutonic masters, enslaved to the Reich's Eagle. We must liberate our people and cast down Germany's moribund empire. With steel and fire!"\n\nRogneda listened as her subjects cheered on, her thoughts turning to what lay ahead."
 kemreg.29.a: "All Hail Queen Rogneda!"
 
 kemreg.30.t: "A Quiet Moment"
 kemreg.30.desc: "Rurik stood by his bedroom window, looking over the city of [KEM.Capital.GetName]. The sun was beginning to set, the sky a blend of soft orange and blue. As the sun began to sink below the horizon, Rurik reflected upon his rule. From the pits of despair, he had given Russia hope, bringing light to a country adrift in darkness. His rule had not been peaceful, and it had not been perfect, but he had achieved a great deal.\n\nThe sun was halfway below the horizon, the orange sky turning to red, and the red fading to purple. The first stars began to shine down from the heavens, outnumbered by the lights from the city below. The King grew weaker with every passing day, and he now needed a cane to move about his palace. Rurik knew he would not live to see Moscow freed from the Germans who enslaved his people. He would have to leave that duty to his successor, his heir. He knew that they could succeed, he believed he had prepared them well. His child would lead this Kingdom to greatness, and avenge the humiliation the Motherland had been put through. Nikolai Krylov chuckled, knowing that his children and the rest of the nation were so attached to the Rurikid ideals, the mask he had eventually become.\n\nThe sun was now below the horizon, and night had fallen over the Motherland once more. King Rurik turned away from the window, and returned to his desk, for the King still had much work to do."

 kemreg.31.t: "Look Upon My Works"
 kemreg.31.desc: "Standing at least six meters tall including the pedestal, the huge statue was something to behold of. Made of the finest stone and granite in Siberia, Rurik was rather flattered. The armor was quite detailed, using every accuracy of the medieval era. It even included a few jewels and diamonds emplaced carefully into the armor. Rurik was quite sure it would become a staple piece of [KEM.Capital.GetName] for years to come.\n\nOf course, the sculptor clearly took some artistic liberties. Rurik quite often would not go into battle carrying a sword while riding a horse, no matter how much he wanted to. He also was not as muscular as he was in the sculpture, but still, Rurik was quite pleased. He quite liked how it was overly romanticized, and he had to make sure the sculptor was paid well for his work.\n\nAnd if this was enough to be put up just for the unification of Central Siberia, he couldn't dream of what would be put up in his honor once Moscow was back in Russia's grasp."
 kemreg.31.a: "Quite impressive!"

 kemreg.32.t: "A Toast"
 kemreg.32.desc: "Rurik's banquet hall filled with food and laughter as he and his new aristocrats celebrated their victory over the traitors and the implementation of a better Siberia. "Hey Rurik, pass the butter, will you?" yelled one rather large man as he began to drink his fourth glass of vodka.\n\nRurik smiled and reached for the butter when he was interrupted by an older aristocrat. "Sergei! You never talk to your Tsar like that! Where are your manners!"\n\n"It's quite fine, Nikolay, I quite enjoy the pleasantries rather than anything more formal," responded Rurik.\n\n"As you say, Tsar Rurik the Second, by the Grace of God, the Conquerer and the Almighty. I humble in your presence," said the old aristocrat, now bowing.\n\nRurik paused, but he was distracted by another young aristocrat. "You're as good as putting on a banquet as you are at ruling the Kingdom!" he said. "You even got your children to stop arguing!"\n\n"Well, I always know when is a good time to celebrate, and so do my children," Rurik replied. He knew he would be facing more challenges soon, but it was about time to enjoy the pleasant atmospheres of Kemerovo himself. Without him, none of this would exist, after all."
 kemreg.32.a: "Nice to see something without incident."

 kemreg.33.t: "Administrative Grumbles"
 kemreg.33.desc: "The non-royal members of the Zemsky Sobor knew, the moment they entered the chamber, that there was to be yet another showdown between Princess Lydia and her brother. The glowering, venomous looks that she shot across the floor were portent enough.\n\nThey were not disappointed. The item on the agenda concerned the recruitment restrictions and desired qualifications for state bureaucrats, primarily as it concerned their social status. True to his roots, Prince Yuriy favored relaxing or even eliminating them altogether, both in order to promote social advancements as well as to connect the ordinary people to their government in stronger fashion.\n\nAt that, Lydia responded with her usual cutting, derisive laughter. The people, she proclaimed, were unreliable at best, and insurrectionist at worse. Bureaucrats should be hand-picked from the aristocracy, she argued, in order to ensure both that they owed their loyalty to the institutions of government, and were unlikely to have sympathies with revolutionary elements.\n\nThe 'debate' continued as most expected. Yuriy called his sister a tyrant, and she called him a fool, with the epithets only escalating from there and those in attendance silently counting the minutes where they would once again be free, unwilling to place themselves in the line of fire.\n\nThough all, including the royal siblings, knew that a decision would eventually be made by their father."

 kemreg.34.t: "The King's Ear"
 kemreg.34.desc: "Rurik sat at an ornate round table with his hands folded atop it. Around him were some of the most powerful and influential men in the kingdom, conspicuously excluding the two wolves. "I thank you for coming, gentlemen, to the first meeting of the newly-assembled Veche. It is my hope that this council will provide tactful and wise advice to the rulers of the Rus'. Perhaps for this first session we should discuss the growing... discord."\n\nAfter a brief silence, Pyotr Baranovsky was the first to speak. "It's obvious what's causing all this discord: it's those two children of yours constantly butting heads whenever they meet! You want to save the realm from splitting apart? Something must be done about them."\n\n"What would you suggest we do? Their influence grows by the day, and they've already rallied two very different sections of the populace to their cause. I believe we should just nominate a successor and ride out the storm as best we can," chimed in Boris Krylov, the only other member of the royal family present.\n\nRurik gave his son's words some thought. He was hesitant to nominate a successor, but it was becoming apparent that if it wasn't done soon enough, the kingdom's stability could be in jeopardy. The only issue, however, was deciding which one would eventually take the crown..."

He had been rather excited about his election to the position, but when he arrived at the small town in the eastern reaches of the realm he was surprised at the hostility he faced. The townsfolk had been distant and cold at best. As his car drove down the main street to his new residence he had been subject to ridicule from the residents. They had thrown mud and dung at the windows, his manhood was questioned, and his guards were forced to step in when a former Black Army militiaman had thrown himself at the car with a knife in hand.\n\nHe knew he had his work cut out for him. The people in the region had grown so used to the freedom given to them by the Black Army that it would take much to gain even the smallest amount of respect from them. They chafed under new taxes and other obligations to the Kingdom that they found themselves apart of. He knew most of their discontent was idle bluster, but even then he realized the sheer importance stability and contentedness would bring. For the time being, he would have to put up with the heckling as he went about his day and find ways to endear himself, and the Kingdom, to the people he now served.\n\nDimitri turned back to his work and glared silently at the papers in front of him, there had been some issues with the tax numbers this past month. He still hoped to do his duty to the best of his abilities, and he also hoped that the people he oversaw would come to respect him and their new government in the future."

Picking up some bread from the bakery, Oleg noticed some of the other customers more interesting clothing. Women in colorful dresses and tops. Men with large fuzzy hats and dark red coats with detailed patterns covering them from head to toe. It looked almost medieval, thought Oleg. Had everyone decided to copy that mad Tsar? People these days were so eager to latch on to other's fashion.\n\nPurchasing the bread, he noticed even the store owner, Nikita, was wearing a large blue medieval-looking robe and sporting a long beard alongside it. "Even you Nikita! I thought you were a die-hard republican!" Spouted Oleg, surprised to see even him wearing the Tsar's style.\n\n"Ah, but the times are changing," replied Nikita. "I've learned Rurik's a great Tsar, better than any President could be. Besides, these things are comfy, I've heard this one's called a Ferjaz! There's a store selling them right across the street."\n\n"No thanks, I'll stick with my more modern clothing." Replied Oleg as he left the store. Finally arriving home, his wife was the first thing he saw as he walked through the door. "Helana, what are you wearing!" Said Oleg, incredulously.\n\n"It's my new fur coat, all the women are wearing it. Noblewomen used to wear these back in ancient Russia! The colors on it are just gorgeous! I think I'll keep it forever!" Helana said, smiling.\n\nOleg stammered, not knowing what to say. His wife, wearing insane clothing as well? Everyone was wearing something from the medieval age!\n\n"Honey, what's wrong?" Said Helana. "You know what, you really need a new coat. Did you see that place near the bakery? It has a very good selection of men's clothing. Let's take you there tomorrow. We can get some for the kids as well! It will be perfect!""

His church had been 'requisitioned' by the Royal Army for use as a command post, and it had been made very clear, as politely as possible, that he had no choice in the matter.\n\nThe common soldiers themselves had been very respectful, and were taking great care not to damage any of Kiril's religious items as they collected them, but such did little to soften the blow. He had led this church, and the small community around it, for decades, doing his best to provide guidance and support to the simple - yet pious - people of the local villages. And now he was not sure if he would ever be permitted to return.\n\nHe had heard from his fellow priests about this happening elsewhere, churches taken over by the military, who greatly valued the belltowers for observation and the cellars for protection. More than one had been destroyed by the enemy if and when the fighting had turned. More still, though left standing, were returned to their once-shepherds in terrible condition. He dearly hoped that would not be the case for him.\n\nAs the soldiers finished packing and carefully stacked the boxes beside the doorway, Kiril took one last look around the now-empty nave, and realized how much larger it seemed when bereft of fixtures. Then he picked up the boxes, carried them to the cart that one of the local farmers had insisted he use for travel, and departed.\n\nAnd as the belltower of his church disappeared over the horizon, he could not stifle his tears."

Primarily because it meant a decision would most likely be made, and there would not simply be an eternal argument between his children.\n\nToday, they quickly found themselves to be at least half-correct. Rurik, after opening the session and thanking all those there, announced the immediate imposition of a number of welfare-based reforms upon the state, as recommended by Prince Yuriy.\n\nThough Yuriy was quick to stand and thank the King for the 'foresight' he so clearly possessed, little attention was paid to him. For all eyes were upon Princess Lydia who, as her father's announcement had progressed, had become increasingly still, a motion they had learned was always followed by eruption.\n\nAn eruption that soon followed as her voice echoed through the chamber. The very concept was inexcusable, she cried, and by even recommending it to their father in the first place Yuriy had failed in his duties. The challenges facing the state were immense, she continued passionately, and their resources were highly limited. Diverting those to social endeavours instead of the military or other security forces was not only shortsighted, it was, according to her, borderline criminal.\n\nAfter a short while, and during a pause, Yuriy calmly asked his sister if she was finished. As she stared back at him, wide-eyed, he turned to King Rurik, who only nodded as he looked at his daughter.\n\nAnd that was that. Lydia sunk back down into her chair, defeated for now. But the look of fury in her eyes was unmistakable, and all knew that this decision was not, could not, be the end."

Rumors had reached him that there had been brawls on the street between supporters of his son, and those of his daughter. He had hoped, perhaps in vain, that this was merely an exaggeration by the press.\n\nBoris Krylov sat across from his father, taking pause before delivering the news. "Truthfully? Yes, it is. There's been reports of violent scuffles in Novosibirsk between strikers and local police, a bar brawl between coal miners and wealthy patrons in Krasnoyarsk nearly turned into a riot, and to say nothing of the protests and counter-protests in Kemerovo..."\n\nRurik looked distant as his mind processed this troubling news. It was no longer metaphorical: his children were going to war. While these groups weren't directly associated with them, it was all too clear who they had wanted to take charge in his absence.\n\n"... Father?"\n\n"Boris, we need to take back the streets. If we don't do something soon, we'll be heading back to the bad old days..."\n\n"Just say the word, father, and I'll order the troops to move in."\n\nRurik looked to his son with wide eyes.

Placard hit banner as they both came together, not in unity or solidarity, but out of hatred and resentment. As the shouts of the crowds increased in amount and fury, the police standing guard looked at each other nervously. Much as they'd prefer not to intervene, they were being left with little choice. With one of them sent to get backup, the rest of the officers stood watch with grim determination, ready to step in and put a stop to things if necessary.\n\nFortunately for them, backup arrived just in time, having their numbers doubled and being ready to go on short notice by Rurik's own orders. As they reinforced the officers already on the scene, the confrontation before them began to turn violent, with punches being landed and signs being thrown. At the sound of the whistle, the police descended as a group on the two crowds, and after dealing with minor resistance, they dispersed both. Even with the current clash taken care of, each officer thought the same thing."

Together they had devised this imminent meeting between his ever-feuding siblings, but as the time of it approached he could not but feel apprehensive.\n\nLydia was the first to enter, early as usual and wearing her practiced expression of diligent arrogance. He could tell that she had not believed the lie he had told to draw her here for an instant, but had come nonetheless out of respect for their father. Yuriy arrived later. Rurik quickly took control before they could begin sparring.\n\nHe had asked Boris to set this up, he said, because he was tired, both personally and officially, of seeing his two more prominent children at constant, and violent odds. It was bad for his health, he continued, and it was very bad for the stability of the state. Together with Boris he, they, implored them to come to an understanding.\n\nThe room was quiet for a long, long moment, before Lydia laughed, sharply and cruelly, and in that moment Boris knew they had failed. She did not have to do anything of the sort, she said coldly, as she had done nothing wrong. She had always acted in the best interests of the state, and Yuriy needed to accept that.\n\nYuriy immediately retorted that he had always acted in the interests of the people, and if she could not see that a state without its people was nothing, she did not deserve her position. The war of words continued as Boris looked desperately at their father, who only shook his head. Another failure.\n\nShortly thereafter Lydia declared the entire affair a waste of time, and stood. Yuriy did the same, one of the few things, he said, that he could agree with her upon. They both stormed out a moment later.\n\nBoris and Rurik exchanged a sigh. What else could they do?"

Considering some of the stories they had heard of even more unfortunate villages, it very well might be even with them there. They had little food, less warmth, and no guns of any note. All that awaited them was a slow death.\n\nSuddenly they began to hear the sound of boots on the ground, and looked out their windows with a mixture of fear and dread. Had the bandits returned? They had nothing of value left to give them! However, as the sound grew closer, they began to be able to make out shapes, and then the people they made up. These were no bandits; these were workers from the royal government, the one that'd won the wars. Their fear was replaced by a new, and similar one. Had taxes been increased?\n\nHowever, the new arrivals greeted them amiably as they passed, and one man even ruffled the hair of a boy with his head sticking out of the window. As the villagers watched in amazement, these workers set about repairing the damage the conflicts had done to the village, repairing holes in walls and shattered windows. These men were not here to take from them; they were here to give to them the help they had so badly needed for so long. Some of the villagers cheered as they worked; others wept with joy. All thought the same: luck had finally returned to their lives.\n\nSome semblance of hope had returned to their hearts."

Said Rurik, in a booming voice. "I'm glad all of you excepted my invitation. As a great and kind leader, I am wise enough to understand there can be much that can be learned from your enemies."\n\n"Wise!" Shouted a man in a sleek suit, looking very different compared to Rurik's ministers in large robes. "You're insane, not wise! You declared yourself Tsar after you had too much to drink!"\n\nRurik smirked. "At least I am wise enough to defeat your armies in battle." The group grew quiet, almost hostile. "As I was saying... I invited you here today for your ideas. Central Siberia is hard to govern, and our economic situation is less than positive. Your salons were among those who governed Central Siberia when Russia first fell apart. We are all Russians, and this is our home."\n\nThe room remained quiet until a man with glasses broke the silence. "Rurik, we may have our disagreements, but I can tell you are a caring man. If you truly want to make the lives of the people better, I implore you to consider greater welfare for the people. War has ravaged Russia, and they need hope of a better future."\n\n"Who needs welfare!" Shouted a small man in a tie that reached down to his waist. "We don't have the money for that! What the people need is education, only then will they be able to improve their lives themselves and serve their country. No man can just throw money into the air and expect their problems to be fixed!"\n\nAnother man, slender and wearing a formal looking hat stood up. "The people will not have satisfaction without democracy! As long as you continue to be a tyrant, Tsar, this place will see only despair!"\n\nAs the shouting match continued and more men began to speak over each other, Rurik was reminded of his children's own petty bickering. No wonder Tomsk fell, its own government couldn't agree on anything."

 kemreg.44.t: "The Arteries of a Nation"
 kemreg.44.desc: "A large crowd gathered had gathered before Lev Voznesensky, who wore a practiced smile on his face while flanked by armed guards. "Today, I bring to you people of Russia great news!" He proclaimed. "The great highway connecting Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, and Novosibirsk has, as of yesterday, been completed! Rejoice, for now nothing will hinder the free movement of trade and of you, the people!" The crowd murmured among themselves, though for the most part they seemed unsure what to make of the finished development. No matter. Worst comes to worst they'd have to come around. After all, whether they liked it or not, the highway would play a large part of their lives from now on.\n\nOver the next few days, traffic on the highway increased at first slowly, then exponentially, with reports of booming trade arriving at Voznesensky's office. It was just as he had thought; with any obstacles removed from their path, people couldn't resist the allure of traveling elsewhere to sell their wares for more. It was astounding that the old government in Tomsk had never thought of this, but then, he had never placed much stock into them anyways.\n\nYes, he thought, lighting a cigarette between his teeth, this was going to make a lot of people a lot of money.\n\nMost importantly, of course, himself."

 kemreg.45.t: "Back to Work"
 kemreg.45.desc: "Gavril stood among a throng of his fellow workers, the scent of sweat and the sound of conversation hanging heavy over the group of 50 or 60 men. Hard hat on his head and hammer slung over his shoulder, Gavril squinted against the morning glare as he gazed upon the factory complex he had once worked in. It certainly had been refurbished, and this gave him and many others preparing to enter the building hope that the mad old King had actually kept his promise.\n\nSome foreman out of Gavril's view blew a whistle and the mass of working men suddenly shifted forward. Gavril found himself swept along with the tide and into his new workplace, his heart full of cautious optimism as he and the other workers crossed the broad threshold. That optimism was quickly crushed as, while the exterior had been decorated with fancy trappings calling back to eras long gone with a modern, safe undercurrent, the interior of the foundry wasn't that different from what it was before. The furnace that had unexpectedly belched out flame like some ash-caked dragon and sent 4 men to the infirmary. The rickety stairway up to the second level that had been broken and repaired dozens of times, and with it many of his coworkers' legs, ribs, or skulls. The busted casting ladle that periodically leaked molten metal, burning the flesh of the operator.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, however. The doors, for one, could be opened from the inside in case of emergency. The wiring that kept the lights on was safely sealed inside the walls. There was a list of safety protocols, first aid tips or other useful information on every wall. But what relieved Gavril the most was the presence of enough gloves, masks, aprons and other safety tools to protect every man in the building. The machines may still be dangerous, but the madman has at least made a token effort towards safety. Still, Gavril did not feel much safer than he did before the city changed hands."

 kemreg.46.t: "There is Power in a Union"
 kemreg.46.desc: "Rurik was woken up from a peaceful nap by the ringing of his telephone, residing on the table just beside his bed. Grumbling, he sat up and fumbled for the phone, lifting it to his ear and sighing.\n\n"Hello?"\n\n"Hello, your highness. This is Boris Kelchev, I spoke with you the other day."\n\nRurik thoughts wandered to a question: How did this man get his personal number? That question was quickly answered for him, however, as the union boss carried on in his gravelly baritone,\n\n"Your son, Yuriy, gave me the number at the meeting, if you're wondering."\n\nOh, that's right, thought Rurik. He loved that boy, and understood the cause and the pain of the kingdom's working class, but damn if he didn't jump the gun every time there was an opportunity to help. "Too nice for his own good." Muttered Rurik inaudibly.\n\n"Oh yes, yes. It was wonderful meeting you - what are you calling to discuss?"\n\n"Well, really, I'm calling to thank you. I wasn't so sure about how sincere you were when you said you'd be strengthening the unions, but your reforms have really paid off! The boss is treating us far, far better, and accidents are down 20% because they're keeping the equipment clean and repaired. The union thanks you, King Rurik."\n\nThat put a smile on the old King's face; perhaps Yuriy had been right after all. The workers are the lifeblood of the kingdom, and they're better off than ever. Following a short exchange of goodbyes, Rurik put down the phone and laid his head back on the pillow, one thought on his mind."
 kemreg.46.a: "Maybe I should listen to Yuriy more often."

 kemreg.47.t: "The March of the Worker"
 kemreg.47.desc: ""Up with the workers, down with the bosses! Long live the union!"\n\nAs striking unionists marched outside, a few police officers watched, unsure of what to do. This strike was the latest of a series, and easily the largest. The union had paralyzed the city of Krasnoyarsk in their demand for better pay and working conditions. Business leaders weren't happy with this situation, that much was clear, but they had been ordered not to disrupt strikes, and orders were to be followed. Their hands were tied, and there was nothing to be done about it.\n\nAfter hours of agonizing shutdown for the city, business leaders finally came to the strikers to negotiate, being greeted by boos and jeers and leaving with their heads down to the sound of cheers. Clearly, they had earned themselves few friends, and much animosity, among those who worked for them. Even so, looking at all the people who hadn't been able to simply carry on with their lives, one had to wonder... was there really no other way to a better world?"
 kemreg.47.a: "The needs of the people come before all else."

 kemreg.48.t: "Rise of the Guilds"
 kemreg.48.desc: "As Princess Lydia Krylova stood on the platform, arms crossed and face fixed in a slight smile, which he had come to recognize as her expression of victory, Minister Lev Voznesensky stood by.\n\nIn front of them was the first gathering of the first Royal Guild, one of the Princess' largest initiatives to date, which were intended to centralize and replace the workers' councils that had, until this point, been permitted within state territory. Long considered, by the Princess and her faction as politically suspect and unreliable, the dissolution of the councils was a clear victory for Lydia in the ever-continuing conflict with her brother.\n\nWith the Guilds so empowered, production and efficiency could be emphasized instead of worker discord and agitation, and at this Voznesensky could not help but feel content. The state was still surrounded by enemies and that, combined with the revolutionary sentiment that seemed endemic within Central Siberia, was something that had to be addressed, and not permitted to fester in established organizations.\n\nYes, he thought as he looked out over the long lines of workers standing and waiting to re-register, this was the better choice. Yuriy's counterproposal might have had value, but it also had more risk, and such risk could not be entertained.\n\nHe only wished that the Princess did not take such savage, and obvious, enjoyment in her 'victory.'"
 kemreg.48.a: "It is for the better."

 kemreg.49.t: "Which Side Are You On?"
 kemreg.49.desc: "Boris Kelchev had come as fast as he could as soon as he heard the telltale hissing of a tear gas canister from across the street, where there once had been the raucous but ultimately nonviolent sound of a strike. Rising to his feet in his modest worker's apartment in Krasnoyarsk, the union boss had made the trek down 5 flights of stairs in a panic. His breathing heavy and labored by the time he got to the bottom of the steps, he stumbled out the front door of the building and stared across the street at the local steelworks in horror.\n\nThe setting sun tinted the sky around the square orange, and ochre shaded tear gas rose like a smokestack as striking workers scrambled in the street. The men cried out in pain, staggered in their blindness, held their soot stained shirts over their faces and coughed dry, bitter coughs. In front of the mass of terrified workers was a group of about 20 or so men- thugs, really, clad in makeshift riot gear and faceless gas masks. They formed a line around the area where the orderly protest had once been, but Boris noticed something shocking in particular. While some of those there were clearly strikebreakers hired by the guild that owned the factory, judging by the symbols plastered onto their gear, Boris also counted at least a dozen local police officers in the midst of the crowd.\n\n"How the hell can they let this happen?" Spat Boris, turning around to go into his apartment. As he climbed the stairs, still shocked from the site, he continued to mutter to himself.\n\n"That lying fat bastard, the madman pretends he's for the people and then lets this happen," Boris fumbled with his keys, got into his apartment, and walked over to the window and stared out into the city in a simmering rage. In some futile gesture of anger, he leaned out the window and shouted into the infant night:"

 kemreg.50.t: "The New Siberian Woman"
 kemreg.50.desc: "Standing beside her father as he waved to the soldiers below, Princess Lydia Krylova did not even attempt to suppress a savage grin. Because each and every one of the soldiers was a woman, a member of the first expansion division of the Shieldmaidens. And there would be many more to come.\n\nIt had been hard, very hard, to convince some of the old generals and men of power in the state that the Shieldmaidens even had a legitimate purpose - let alone that they should be expanded - but she had prevailed. As usual. The proof was in front of her, and it heralded a great future, for with women being openly welcomed into the armed forces, the state's available manpower had nearly doubled.\n\nSuch expanded reserves had uses far beyond simply fighting on the front lines as well, as proven by the presence of General Anna Kotsur on the dais beside Lydia and the King. There would soon be more like her, the opportunities now available making sure that the potential of half of the state's citizens would not be wasted.\n\nYes, Lydia thought, this had been an important victory. More soldiers and more troops meant that the state could continue to expand and consolidate its territory, and subsequent security threats could be more easily addressed without compromising strength at the front.\n\nOf course, it also helped that all of the new Shieldmaidens well knew who had fought to afford them this opportunity, and how easily others might conspire to take it away. Who could truly tell when such an understanding could prove critical?"
 kemreg.50.a: "They have, and will continue, to prove themselves the equal of any other soldier."

 kemreg.51.t: "Bigger and Better"
 kemreg.51.desc: ""I trust this design is to your liking, Your Majesty?"\n\nRurik eyed the blueprint before him carefully. Detailed within was an improved, modernized model of the tried and tested T-55 main battle tank. Something about it, however, wasn't quite shaping up in King's eyes. "This looks... adequate."\n\n"Erm, 'adequate'? What do you mean?" The designer maintained a courteous smile, but there was evidence of exasperated panic in his voice.\n\n"Well, it's not very different from the old model, is it? All you did was fix up the engine, when you should be thinking bigger! I want you to see if you can fit a bigger gun and more armor on this thing."\n\n"Well, uh, all due respect, Your Majesty, but that wouldn't be practical for us at the moment. Tanks in this day and age tend to rely on speed rather than blunt force, and-"\n\nSuddenly, the King put a firm hand on the designer's shoulder, and he felt as though his heart stopped for a small instant. "Oh, nonsense. You're going to put more armor and more firepower on it, and you're going to make it work. Stop worrying about minute details and work with the same ethic that built this kingdom. If I was able to get this far without compromising in favor of practicality, so can you!"\n\nThe designer gulped. What the King was asking for was not within his design bureau's current means, but who was he to turn down royalty?"
 kemreg.51.a: ""Yes, Your Majesty, I will try my best...""

 kemreg.52.t: "A Tank Fit for a King"
 kemreg.52.desc: "Rurik II looked on with childlike glee as the new and improved model of T-55 rumbled onto the proving grounds. Despite the design bureau's excuses and objections, Rurik's ideal modifications had made it into the final draft, and now his creation was coming to life before his eyes. As he had requested, the vehicle was equipped with a larger 115mm gun, and had rather characteristic composite armor kits along the turret.\n\nThe King turned to his son, with a smile on his face. "You see, Boris? I told you they'd make my tank. Look at it go!"\n\nBoris Krylov was much more reserved. "It is quite an impressive vehicle, Father, but aren't you concerned about the added price? The new additions aren't exactly cheap..."\n\n"This again? Those metal boxes are already ludicrously expensive as it is. A few more Grivna isn't going to kill us." Rurik said, turning back to view the tank be put through its paces.\n\n"If you say so. Anyway, on a more pleasant note, I've heard the tankers have already given this thing a nickname. 'His Majesty's Eyebrows', they call it."\n\nRurik began to laugh. The name was no doubt referring to the bulky armor kits on the turret. "Hah! Isn't that somethingl? My legacy shall live on, even in the form of a tracked war machine!""

 kemreg.53.t: "A Meeting with Kamov"
 kemreg.53.desc: "The call had come at about midnight last night, rousing Nikolay from sleep, expecting some manner of emergency but instead hearing Rurik II himself on the other end. Apparently, Rurik had taken an interest in his work with the Kamov Helicopter Design Bureau and wanted to meet him the very next day around noon. After an exchange of niceties, Kamov put Rurik on hold while he scrambled in the wee hours of the morning to schedule a last-minute meeting with the King. By 2, he had failed to book any kind of meeting space at the Bureau office, and instead would be meeting Rurik in the workshop. This was why, at noon, Nikolay Kamov was putting papers in order and a model on the table in a dusty workshop to meet a goddamn King on 10 hours of notice.\n\nRight as he made his last preparations, the door swung open and the old King hobbled his way in. Nikolay snapped to attention but was quickly dismissed by Rurik, "At ease, friend. I'd like to keep this informal, all I need is for you to tell me about your wondrous flying machines."\n\nNikolay raised an eyebrow at the term, but shrugged it off. The King had seen better days, surely. Offering the King a seat, Nikolay began taking His Highness through the workings of the Bureau's latest design. Rurik was friendly and cordial, but quite frankly confused, as the craft, as well as its expenses, was explained. Almost every sentence, the King asked something absurdly ignorant, but Nikolay humored his questions with slight annoyance. Then, once done, awaited the King's response, who had been stroking his chin for the last few minutes of the pitch.\n\n"Fine work, young man." Rurik said, to the nearly 70 year old aeronautics engineer. Rurik smirked to himself, watching Nikolay's bewilderment, "Anyways, I think your Bureau would benefit from some funding from the crown. I'd like to put a few million Grivna into this project, what do you say?"\n\nNikolay lit up, drumming his fingers across the table with excitement at the prospect. "We would welcome it, sir! Anything else before you leave today?""

Her fluffy, garishly embroidered garments made her appear all the more ravishing on this fine day.\n\n"Did you read the paper this morning, Igor?" She asked, finishing a sip of her own. "They say the price of petrol is going up. I'm glad we don't have to drive everywhere, but what about folks who don't live in the city?"\n\nIgor cleared his throat as he brought his cup to his mouth. "I'm sure they'll be alright. It's not like cars and whatnot are very common here, anyway. We've got a lot catching-"\n\nSuddenly, an incredibly loud roaring sound filled the room, startling Igor and causing him to lose his grip on the cup. "Fucking hell!" he yelped as scalding hot liquid splashed onto his lower torso. Shoving the chair back, Igor quickly grabbed a tissue from the table and cursed under his breath as he began to wipe himself down.\n\nNatasha found herself stifling a giggle. "You need to be more careful, Igor! What was that sound, anyway?"\n\nThe cacophonous roaring was still audible, albeit getting much quieter as second passed. Igor tossed the soggy tissues aside and took a peek outside the Cafe's front window. In the distance, a trio of fighter jets were soaring off into the horizon. "It's the goddamn Air Force again. Why'd we have to move somewhere so close to a military base, anyway?""

A massive military parade was being held in the capital today, but the guest of honor had yet to show up.\n\n"This isn't the first time he's been late, Yuriy," Princess Lydia called out to her brother, "There's no need to panic. I'm sure he'll turn up at some point..."\n\nYuriy continued frantically pacing, undeterred by his sister's words. "No, no, he's been late before, but not THIS late! Where the hell is he?!"\n\n"Sit down and stop worrying, Yuriy, you're going to miss the parade!" Boris Krylov pleaded to his brother as a loud rumbling became audible from the street. "I think the armored units are rolling out now. Look!"\n\nYuriy turned his attention to the road below, where a column of tanks were making their way down the street. In front of the column was a particularly colorful and ornately decorated tank, and a familiar figure was standing out of the hatch gleefully waving his arms. The prince's eyes widened as he realized who it was.\n\nThe prince gave a sigh of relief, and felt a cautious smile overtake his face as Rurik II turned to wave at him and the rest of the spectators on the balcony. "He really has gone mad, hasn't he?" Yuriy said under his breath. Deep down, he wouldn't have it any other way."

 kemreg.56.desc: "The day of Tsar Rurik's 'salon' had arrived. To many the exercise seemed mad, but then again, such was most fitting for the Mad King.\n\nThe fall of Tomsk to the Principality's armies had allowed the Tsar to tour the city that he had once served, and curious to see how they had occupied themselves in the years since, he had 'invited' several of the defeated nation's intellectual theorists to court in Kemerovo.\n\nThere under the careful watch of the Kingsguard, he had asked them to debate how they would act to improve the Principality's finances.\n\nOne by one each made their case, speaking of how they would unify the people behind an economic initiative to promote industrial expansion. This took many hours, and at the end of it all Rurik was sure he had heard the same argument numerous times.\n\nWhen he asked them why this was, they reacted with horror. Each of their positions could not be more different than that of the other, they all claimed, saying they merely needed several more hours to make the distinctions clear. That was the wrong answer.\n\nAngered by what he now knew to be a colossal waste of time, he dismissed them back to their city and, within several minutes, signed a decree implementing his heir's suggestion. The decision was made without dissent, and without days, or potentially weeks, of delay.\n\nDemocracy, Rurik thought. He had made the right choice indeed in his style of rule."

Moreso than the other squabblers and plotters throughout the vast Russian lands, Rurik II, known many moons ago as a Marshal of a greater Soviet Union bearing the name Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov, has born the name of conqueror past these frozen lands, allowing man, woman, and child to feast upon their glories and victories they've rightly earned. Just as Rurik intends to do so tonight.\n\n"My Lord, the guests have arrived!" said the Captain of the Guard as two Russian men bearing snow-laden coats walked in. One bore a steely set of glasses and a sharp mustache and goatee, whilst the other cared less for appearances, bearing grizzly scars across an equally grizzly, unshaven face.\n\n"The two Alexanders, greater than any great conqueror of Greece, and greater friends than any Tsar may ask of!" Cried the Tsar, as he hopped down his steps and embraced the two tightly in his warm coat.\n\nAnd thus, Tsar Rurik the Second was joined by Alexander Sevtsov and Alexander Kazartsev for a night of hardy laughter, belly-warming drinks, and glorious stories. It was true: each of these men had to think constantly each and every day, making plans centered around the very survival of their people, whilst the haunting poltergeists of a war lost long ago crept upon their shoulders, rousing them to an awakening each and every night as the screams of fallen comrades plagued them.

A Tsar, in glistenting, iron armor, his sword, sheathed but always at the ready for battle, and, the most important piece of the collection, the cape, with the crest of the royal family.\n\nBut for some in the crowd, the appearance of modern day rifles, men in old military fatigues, clashed with the appearance of the great man as he led them in marching formation. The vast majority, however, did not notice any incongruity with the current reality they had been living in.\n\nThe armor had been the talk of Novosibirsk ever since Tsar Rurik II had been seen, protected by his royal guard, at the local blacksmith. All citizens of the Tsardom had speculated of specially made armor, for the leader to ride off into battle on horseback, but no one had expected it to be so authentically traditional.\n\nAs he strode through the street, his men and tanks at his back, there came a moment where he stopped. He signaled to his men, and they, in confusion, did as they were told. The Tsar, mumbling something under his breathe, called for his horse, and, as the whole crowd of loyal subjects watched in worry, rode away without further explanation.\n\nThe day afterwards, the Tsar gave a decree that he had a mystical experience and wished to be left alone, as he needed time to 'understand and contemplate the reason for my feelings that day.'\n\nThe armor was never seen again."

The sled came to a stop, and King Rurik now stood before him, an ornate sword in hand. The mayor knelt before him and pledged his eternal loyalty to the Tsar.\n\nThe King in a booming voice declared the mayor Lord of Magadan, and declared Valentin Tsvetkov the head of a new noble house. Following his ascension to nobility, Tsvetkov was granted his official coat of arms, and a ceremonial sword. In celebration of the event, several of Rurik's retainers participated in a somewhat impromptu jousting tournament located upon Magadan's largest street. Several more hours of entertainment followed, until it was time for the small private dinner the King had Tsvetkov prepare.\n\nThe dinner was fairly quiet, with the two men discussing the more mundane aspects of Valentin's duties. They discussed things like army recruitment quotas, tax policies, Magadan's port, overseas trade, and the hypothetical revival of Russia's Pacific Fleet. Throughout the dinner, however, the King seemed distracted, as if something was deeply bothering him. As they were finishing their meal, the Tsar let out a deep, depressed sigh. Tsvetkov was too nervous to directly ask what was bothering the monarch, and instead silently wondered if his hospitality had been unsatisfactory. As he was about to speak up, the deafening silence of the room was broken by the arrival of several servants, accompanied by guests. Tsvetkov dismissed his worries, and stood up to greet the new arrivals."

Now the second most powerful man in the kingdom, Yuriy had much to think about.\n\nHe had fought tooth and nail to secure his place at his father's side, and it had come at a terrible cost. Yuriy couldn't stop thinking about the look Lydia had given him that day in the Zemsky Sobor. This wasn't just a professional rivalry anymore, it was pure disdain- simmering hatred for the man who had deprived her of her destiny.\n\nYuriy achieved his victory, but did not feel the relief he was expecting. He still had work to do. The people of Russia now looked to him for guidance, eagerly expecting Yuriy to make good on his bold promises of reform, and the prince had no intention of letting them down. His efforts would begin as soon as possible, a herculean quest to reshape the kingdom from the bottom up. Yuriy cherished the thought of creating a nation that genuinely cared for its people, but he wondered how many more enemies he was going to make before that dream would become reality.\n\nThe prince was committed to making things right. His father would rest easy knowing that he made the right choice, the people of the realm would rejoice once Yuriy brought them the liberty he had promised so much, and perhaps, he could work towards repairing the tattered relationship he had with Lydia."

Nearly a decade of proud service to His Majesty, cast aside in nearly an instant. Yakov cursed the name of Prince Yuriy. What right, he thought, did this upstart have to rip up a prestigious institution like the Kingsguard? The sound of his door opening disrupted his ruminations.\n\n"Sir, they're here! They've come to disarm us by force!" The commander's aide had a frantic look in his eyes.\n\n"Who's here? Is it the army?"\n\n"I'm not sure. I didn't recognize their uniforms. I suspect it might be our replacements." Yakov had suspected that the upstart prince already had a paramilitary force of his own ready to take the place of the Guard, and this news merely confirmed his suspicions. Not only was the Kingsguard being disbanded, but their successors were to have their baptism by fire. Yakov turned away from his aide to peer out the window. Armed troops wearing uniforms not unlike those of the Kingsguard were fanning out through the barracks. It wouldn't be long before they'd find their way to Yakov's office.\n\nSuch a brazen display of authority insulted the proud commander. Not only were the noble Kingsguard to be disbanded, but the prince clearly did not trust the Guard enough to allow them to do so on their own terms. Yakov dismissed the distraught aide, and took a seat at his desk as the sounds of running boots became audible from downstairs. Pouring a shot of vodka, he took a wistful look at the picture of himself and his comrades framed on his desk, taken on the day of the Kingsguard's formation."

 KEM_yuriy.3.t: "The Winds of Change"
 KEM_yuriy.3.desc: "Something was different about the Zemsky Sobor today. The tone of the subjects being debated had been almost entirely positive in nature, and the members of the council felt entirely free to speak their minds. The ominous presence of the Kingsguard was gone entirely, as the masked men who coldly stood vigil over the chamber were absent. An air almost warm in nature began to take hold in the Zemsky Sobor, far different from the intimidating environment it presented in the past.\n\n"It is my belief that the formation of proper political associations would go great lengths towards ensuring healthy political discourse within the realm. With my father's blessing, I have already begun to work with several of my fellow council members to build the foundations of a truly democratic, parliamentarian kingdom. For too long we have lorded over our people, who were no better than slaves to royal authority. My friends, believe me when I say that we are on the road to creating a kingdom that serves the people, rather than ourselves."\n\nYuriy's speech, unsurprisingly, was met with overwhelming applause. There was little opposition to his plans of reform these days, and most of the Zemsky Sobor had already been convinced one way or the other that the prince had their best interests at heart. As the clapping continued, Yuriy glanced across the chamber at his sister. To the prince's surprise, Lydia had remained present through the entire meeting.\n\nLydia had clearly not shared the rest of the council's enthusiasm, but did not appear to have the usual look of quiet disgust. Yuriy's heart sank as their eyes met. She still appeared unconvinced of her brother's intentions, though, to his relief, the hatred was gone."

 KEM_yuriy.4.desc: ""So that's it, then? You're going to send me away so that I won't trouble the capital with my presence any longer?" Princess Lydia's voice was practically dripping with venomous sarcasm.\n\nPrince Yuriy brought his hand across his face, contemplating what to say next. His sister was to govern the province of Magadan, a desolate icy hell far from the capital. "That was never my intention, Lydia. Magadan is in need of a governor, and you have proven yourself a highly capable administrator in the past..."\n\n"What difference does that make? Magadan is a frozen wasteland! There's so few living there, the place practically runs itself!" The princess' passive-aggressive attitude was now teetering on the brink of blind rage. Her brother's excuse clearly was not what she wanted to hear.\n\nYuriy went silent for a moment, choosing his next words with care. "Lydia, listen. I know you must despise me for what I did, and there's nothing I can say to change that. At the end of the day, though, we are siblings. I still believe we can work past this political mess, because blood bonds are stronger than any ideological differences. We can come together again, but first I just need you to work with me. Can you find it in your heart to do so?"\n\nHer brother's words gave Lydia much to think about. "I suppose. I'll try my best, Yuriy, just don't forget about me." The prince responded by offering a handshake, which quickly became a hug.\n\n"I still love you, sister. Nothing will ever change that.""

 KEM_yuriy.5.desc: "Shocking news has reached Japan today. Confirmed reports state that the so-called Kingdom of Siberia announced their intentions to cut ties with the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In a speech today, King Rurik II stated the following:\n\n"For too long has our glorious kingdom been beholden to the whims of the Japanese. I had personally offered my hand in friendship to them, and those sneaky samurai decided to shake it on one hand and stab me in the back on the other. No longer will I stand by as their greedy Zaibatsu siphon the wealth from Russia! From this day forth, all relations between the Kingdom of Siberia and the Co-Prosperity Sphere shall be divided in twain! The Japanese have only themselves to blame. Had they been more honest in their dealings with my subjects, perhaps they wouldn't have been shut out like this!"\n\nThe self-proclaimed King went on to praise the United States for their "courtesy" and "good nature," hinting that his realm would seek closer ties with the OFN rather than the Sphere. It is currently unknown how the Imperial Japanese government will react, as their foreign office has yet to make an official statement, but it wouldn't be hard to guess. Japan has historically held great interest in allied regimes, and this news would surely come as an unwelcome surprise."

Can you really call your Reich a civilized state if it was built upon the bones of so many innocent lives? I think not!\n\nYour 'Greater' Germanic Reich is the culmination of every single thing that is rotten with this world. All over, German children are made to sing your praises in the schoolhouses and German men are made to chant your name in the streets.

How much longer do you expect to prattle on about meaningless boogeymen like 'subhumans' or 'Jews' before the people of Germany grow tired of the charade and realize that their true enemy is the ugly man whose face is plastered all over the walls?\n\nWe Russians have not forgotten about our true opponent, however. This nation was once a thriving center of culture and civilization, cruelly ground into dust by your raging horde of barbarians. The truth is, you fear us. You expend so many resources trying to keep our people down because you know that, given the chance, we would annihilate your poisonous regime without mercy.

The intensity of the lights caused the King to bring a hand to cover his eyes as he stepped down the exit stairs.\n\n"So, this is America. I'm glad they appear to realize the significance of my visit!" Rurik said as he waved enthusiastically at the press. These curious men and women were to be his first meeting of the trip, and the ensuing press conference was to be the subject of considerable media attention.\n\n"Mr. Krylov! Do you really think you are the King of Russia? What kind of claim do you have, exactly?" asked one reporter.\n\n"No, no, please! Call me Rurik. You could also use 'Your Majesty' if you prefer. As to your question: yes, I am the rightful Tsar and Autocrat of all Rus', and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! One does not need a claim when their heart is as focused and impassioned as mine." This answer only caused the press to fall into a frenzy of questions. The King was overwhelmed, but eventually pointed to one of them. "Yes, you! You have questions?"\n\n"Your Majesty, do you think the strange way you act or dress causes people to not take you or your cause seriously?" The crowd went silent, and the reporter briefly wondered if his question was offensive.\n\n"Whether they do or do not, it is of little consequence. I do not let the opinions of the rest of the world about my mannerisms weigh heavily on my conscience when so many deeper issues are at hand. I seek only to follow in the footsteps of my forefathers, is that so wrong?" The press went into an even more furious uproar of questions than before. This curious old man had piqued their interest like nothing else."

 KEM_yuriy.9.t: "Elderly Reflections"
 KEM_yuriy.9.desc: "As he hobbled down the palace corridor with his son Boris, Rurik II could almost feel himself getting slower with age. The old King was not nearly as mobile as he once was, and found himself relying on his cane more often. "I do not enjoy being old, Boris, not when there is so much left for me to accomplish. I fear I'm running out of time..."\n\nBoris Krylov looked over to his father, an eyebrow raised in concern. "You shouldn't speak of such dark things, father. You've already done more than enough for Russia, for all of us."\n\nThe King went silent for a moment. "Boris, what do you make of your brother? Do you think he'll be able to finish what his father started?"\n\n"Yuriy? Oh, father, you know I don't like politics..."\n\n"Oh, to hell with all that nonsense. I want to hear what you think, Boris!"\n\n"Very well, fine. I think you made the right choice, father. My brother is energetic, passionate, and seems to have a genuine care for the realm and its people. I personally think he'll do a fine job, even if he sometimes lacks subtlety." It gave Rurik genuine happiness to hear that at least some of his children seemed to hold the other in high regard. Of course, he tried his best not to show it.\n\nRurik and his son seemed to be in agreement. The kingdom was in safe hands- Yuriy would surely see to that. The King knew that his glory days were now behind him, and it wouldn't be long before his time was up. At the very least, he could rest easy knowing that Yuriy would continue his dreams long after he had passed."

 KEM_yuriy.10.t: "Heavy is the Head"
 KEM_yuriy.10.desc: "Prince Yuriy thought of himself as a patient man. He had been by his father's side for years, steering him towards the best path for all of Russia. He had been the greatest proponent of the Zemsky Sobor. Now, as he sat at the head of that institution he had so readily pushed for, he seemed near the end of his patience.\n\nHe had tried to force the bureaucracy to play nice, to compromise in the name of the people of the Kingdom. Yet, that demand had seemingly blown up in his face. The Sobor had erupted into chaos. The bickering of the ministers increased to absurd levels as men shouted over each other. Those who lent closer to Lydia's ideas looked on smugly as the Sobor degenerated. In their eyes, it proved the necessity of his sister's methods.\n\nYuriy tried to bring order back to the council, his gavel struck thrice, but he was summarily ignored. He looked over to his co-chair only to realize that he was already shouting in the face of another member of the council. Yuriy felt his anger rising as he was ignored once again in his call to order. Few things had ever managed to raise his hackles quite this much, in all honesty, the only thing he had been so angry at before was his sister.\n\nFinally, he could take it no more and his patience snapped. "Shut the fuck up all of you! Sit down and shut the fuck up!" his voice nearly cracked from the force of his yells. The bureaucrats, and even Yuriy himself, were shocked into silence. The remainder of the session passed by in an awkward quiet, but already he could see the whispers of the bureaucrats and the glances sent his way by his co-chair. He knew that soon enough his outburst would be the talk of every bar in Siberia, and then even the lowliest factory worker would hear about it."

The men inside had been some of his sister's closest allies, and even if her influence over both them and the state had been enormously diminished, they were still men of power.\n\nHeads raised to regard and greet him with the proper deference, he remembered each face in turn. Remembered how they had sat there, some nodding, others with dispassion, as Lydia had harangued him in the Zemsky Sobor. But it was a new day, and he needed their help, or at least their acceptance, if the state was to move forward. He returned their greetings as warmly as was possible, and began.\n\nThe negotiations, mostly to secure their votes and support - public or otherwise - across the various ministries, councils, and organizations over which they held sway, were exhausting. The men were, after all, no friend to the common citizen, otherwise they would not have supported his sister for so long. But they were also keenly aware of their own exposure, and were thus motivated to attach themselves to him. And, so, in the end an agreement was reached.\n\nYuriy was under no illusions that the situation was resolved. They would support him for now, but they did not truly believe in his efforts, and more compromises and overtures on his part would be needed to maintain that support. He sighed in frustration. Lydia would have just threatened them, imposed her will upon them.\n\nBut Yuriy was not his sister, and he would prove it."

It was a far cry from what she deserved.\n\nEven though her bitterness, however, she had to acknowledge Yuriy's skill. She had not thought he had it in him, to outmaneuver her so and exile her to this icy hell. But it was not over. Not by a long shot. Already, she knew, he was implementing his grand visions, convincing their father to sign initiatives that would, in the long run, lead to disaster. She intended to be ready when that happened.\n\nMagadan was a place of oblivion, yes. For now. But it was also easily the most well-developed port in all of Siberia, and thus the state's primary method of external trade. And that meant it was a place of power. It was currently small. Unorganized. It would not be once she was through with it. Once she arranged the shipping schedules. Once she replaced the complacent bureaucrats. Once she imposed real hierarchy. Real security. Real control.\n\nShe would turn Magadan into Siberia's economic lynchpin, and in doing so keep herself prominent, relevant, and, most importantly, successful. Ready for the moment where she could pounce, once again and with clarity.\n\nClarity of belief, that she held with every fibre of her being, that Yuriy would fail.

What do you need, Your Majesty?"\n\n"I want you to arrange a flight to Washington. I'm going to visit America, and shake hands with our new friends in person!" This caught Baranovsky off guard. Such sudden announcements were not exactly uncommon with Rurik, but he clearly had little idea of how much paperwork went into such a visit.\n\n"Are... are you sure that's wise, Your Majesty? Relations with the Americans are lukewarm at best. Perhaps it would be prudent to give our ties some time in the oven before making a visit like this..."\n\nHe could hear an audible scoff from the King. "Nonsense. I'm going to make an official visit to America, and you're going to set it up for me. I have full confidence in your abilities to do so, Baranovsky."\n\n"But, Your Majesty-" Click. Baranovsky was left in silence once more. It was clear that Rurik had his heart set on this visit, even if it meant more work for the Foreign Ministry..."

Yuriy wordlessly signalled for him to continue. "It's about your sister. We've received information that she's attempting to rebuild her influence in another try at challenging you." Yuriy sighed internally. He had been very kind to Lydia. In other families, in other states, attempting to seize power so brazenly, after so many second chances, would mean harsh punishment or even death. Yuriy was not like other rulers, however, and had no intention of laying a finger on her.\n\n"Alright. Give me some more details. Let me see if I can work something out."\n\n"She's been trying to rally the villages of the Northeast using religion, as a previous ruler of the area used to, in addition to promising greater state support. Some of the unions are already starting to turn." She had always been good at influencing people, Yuriy thought. Something about her strength of purpose and drive put them at ease. It had been like that since they were children.\n\n"It doesn't sound too serious, as long as we nip it in the bud early. Send a few officers around to the churches and officials. Don't have them do anything besides give a verbal warning. That should be enough."\n\n"Nothing more drastic? This could be a putsch in the making."\n\n"It's the will of the Tsar, and that's final." The aide, sensing the conversation was over, nodded and left. Yuriy put his face in his hands and sighed again, this time more deeply. One day she'd learn to accept his being in power. Perhaps they could be close again, just like old times."

Night had fallen, and the lights of the city appeared as numerous as the stars in the sky. The quiet of the moment allowed Lydia, now the heir to the kingdom, an opportunity to reflect.\n\nHer life had taken a miraculous turn indeed. Once no more than a humble nurse, she had climbed to the very top of the Royal Court to become the most powerful woman in all of Siberia. In the process, Lydia had acquired many friends and an even greater number of enemies, but the latter did not trouble her much. They would all learn to fall in line, one way or the other.\n\nThe only source of anxiety came in the form of her brother, Yuriy. He was once the preferred candidate to succeed their father, but his hopes were dashed with the meteoric rise of his sister. Lydia recalled that day in the Zemsky Sobor, when her brother angrily stormed out the chamber in a fit of rage. Betrayal by one's own kin is among the worst kind imaginable, and Lydia knew that Yuriy was not likely to forgive her any time soon.\n\nLydia made a hard decision when she decided to make a play for the throne: make enemies of your own brother, or abandon Russia to be consigned to the ashtray of history. In the end, the princess had chosen Russia. Yuriy can think what he wants, she thought.

First you bring the Zemsky Sobor to heel, now you exile your own brother. This is not the way our kingdom should be governed, it goes against everything our father wanted!"
