PHI_Jose_Yulo: "Jose Yulo"
POLITICS_JOSE_YULO_DESC: "Like most of the KALIBAPI's upper echelons, Jose Yulo Yulo has the peculiar distinction of having served under both the Commonwealth and the Republic. In his case, the bar topnotcher and lawyer by trade practiced a career of guiding Presidents Quezon and Laurel's legislative agendas through court since 1935. Such a distinguished career informed his decision to retire in 1959, after which he planned to resume his old profession as a corporate lawyer.\n\nSaid plans, like the rest of the Republic, were thrown awry when President Laurel died and the rebels declared all-out war later that November. Deadlock had consumed the National Assembly while cities fell and battle lines inched closer to Manila. After weeks of contention between the Greater East Asia Ministry and the KALIBAPI's predominant "Laurelist" faction, Yulo became seen as an acceptable compromise - and so he was hastily sworn on Christmas Eve as the Second Republic's second, if temporary, President.\n\nAlthough the rebels have been stymied since his ascendancy, President Yulo has a long way yet before he can declare "mission accomplished". Vast swaths of the country remain under rebel hands, and those the Republic does control fare little better. But the 14th Army will take care of it in due time; for now, Yulo has preoccupied himself with abolishing the late President's less popular policies until he inevitably steps down."

PHI_National_Assembly: "National Assembly"
POLITICS_PHI_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC: "Article III of the post-war Constitution of 1947 established that the Republic of the Philippines is a democratic republic governed by a unicameral legislature known as the National Assembly. Every four years citizens from 46 provinces and 8 chartered cities elect two assemblymen registered with the Kapinsan ng Bagong Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas (KALIBAPI), the country's sole legal party. The Constitution further granted the 108-man Assembly the power to appoint a President among their ranks, who will serve until either recalled by a no-confidence vote or deceased.\n\nSpeaker Benigno S. Aquino hence presided over an extraordinary session of the National Assembly following President Yulo's untimely assassination. As constabularies searched high and low for his killer, assemblymen convened within Session Hall to choose his replacement. Hopes for a speedy resolution were dashed by the Constitution itself; while it delegated appointment to the Assembly, none of its articles prescribed any schedule or procedure thereof. And with the specter of insurrection having fled seemingly for good, the old fissures it had suppressed resurfaced as negotiations stumbled along listlessly.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that KALIBAPI unraveled like a ball of yarn not one week after bullet holes riddled Yulo's corpse. Fists were raised and insults flung as factions settled old scores: Laurelists and reformists, reformists and securocrats, patriots and traitors, Filipinos and foreigners, men of one label and men of another. Government has effectively halted with its members so preoccupied, and inside sources say they might remain so for the rest of the year."

PHI_Quentin_Paredes: "Quintin Paredes"
POLITICS_QUENTIN_PAREDES_DESC: "Caution and initiative are the two backbones of national politics, and balancing both is a game Quintin Paredes has shown himself as an adept time and again. Consider his tenure as Minister of Public Works and Communications, in particular his role in creating President Laurel's ambitious National Development Plans. Despite budget hawks on one hand and grifters on the other, industrialization continued apace with the right people appeased - and with a shoestring budget at that.\n\nParedes' achievements and political acumen made him a kingmaker within the KALIBAPI, a position he first truly wielded during like-minded President Yulo's appointment. The proverbial king's inadvertent death suddenly cast his reforms' lastingness in doubt, with the likes of the firebrand Recto and despot Osmeña aiming for his seat. Their candidacies dispersed all reservations the former Speaker had harbored.\n\nSeveral favors and one landslide later, and Quintin Paredes now presides over his predecessor's oathsworn duties. The arduous task of rebuilding, healing and reuniting the country falls to the "industry shogun" and his close advisors. Perhaps an old, capable hand like his will guide the Republic through the night before dawn."

PHI_Claro_Recto: "Claro M. Recto"
POLITICS_CLARO_M_RECTO_DESC: "Lawyer, poet, and nationalist firebrand - Claro Mayo Recto is many things, but most of all he is more alike to Jose Rizal than his detractors claim. Like Rizal he possesses a keen mind and mastery of logic, which served him well in the courts and the Assembly. Like Rizal he writes eloquently on love of country. And like Rizal he harnessed both tendencies towards opposing the imperialists who had plundered his country. The results speak louder than those who question his sincerity: a free Philippines, aided in no small part by his decades-long tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nTherein lies the contradiction beneath the "Great Academician". For a nationalist and former Senate Minority Leader under the Commonwealth - and is that not an indictment in itself? - he seemed far too eager to trade one overlord for another. The man agrees in part. Make no mistake: the Japanese Empire is no different from the Americans they replaced, whether in their seductive rhetoric or in their rapacious, self-serving intent. In his quieter moments Recto wondered if freedom was worth abetting the many, many crimes the 14th Army had committed against his people.\n\nIn the end, Recto concluded that nothing else mattered more than his motherland's freedom. No mean is too distasteful for such an end. Hence he shackled himself first to the Quezon government, who promised freedom in ten years; then to the Greater East Asia Ministry, who promised freedom forthwith. He shackled himself a third time to the Laurelist sycophants with the Presidency in sight, and in doing so the Assembly appointed him the Philippines' second most powerful man next to the General of the 14th Army. For the first time in his storied career, Recto the idealist has superseded Recto the pragmatist.\n\nModernization, centralization, and true independence - beloved Pilipinas will have them all, he swears, lest he had compromised on his principles in vain."

PHI_Sergio_Osmena_Jr: "Sergio Osmeña Jr."
POLITICS_SERGIO_OSMENA_JR_DESC: "Sergio Osmeña y Veloso is a businessman by trade rather than a politician. He speaks a language disdained by the Tagalogs of Manila. His ideas deviate more from KALIBAPI orthodoxy than the most principled reformist's. His family had left for America with President Quezon and never looked back. He has few friends in a city where connections decide how far up a man can get; indeed, his fellow KALIBAPI claim he wouldn't be one if President Laurel weren't so hard-pressed for Cebuano assemblymen. Not for nothing, then, do the Manila press corps call Osmeña the "black sheep of Philippine politics".\n\nNevertheless, "Serging" is an Osmeña and a businessman before he is a wayward lamb. An Osmeña makes do with what he alone has; a businessman pounces on every opportunity he finds. When the 14th Army sought contractors for its supplies he became that. When assemblymen sought donors for their campaigns he became that too. His machinations eventually earned him an advisor's seat in the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and from there he and his newfound industrialist friends grew inseperable. No jealous rival could prevent him henceforth from becoming the party's chief financier. Soon enough, no one at all could prevent him from becoming President.\n\nOsmeña enters Malacañan buoyed by the alienated, whether it is the businessmen who chafe at the government's overbearing reach, the loyal dissidents unwelcome in the KALIBAPI, or the Bisaya endangered by Tagalog assimilationism. Which voices his administration shall project remain known only to himself. Amid the tumult the new President leaves behind his wake arises only one certainty: the businessman at heart knew business all his life, and he will run the country like one until he no longer can."

#UPH_Dwight_Beach: "Dwight Edward Beach"
#POLITICS_DWIGHT_EDWARD_BEACH_DESC: "Prior to the Philippine Conflict, the most service in the Pacific Dwight Edward Beach could claim was Guadalcanal and New Guinea, as a field artillery officer. He had no history in the region otherwise: no investment in any one of its long, grueling wars, no connections with the natives to draw from, nor the magnetic charisma holding insurgencies together like glue. A MacArthur, Wainwright, or a Fertig he is most decidedly not. Nevertheless, the Pentagon chose this Army man as the fourth Commander of the United States Army in the Philippines.\n\nWhat the 45th Infantry Division's general did have, however, is more firepower than any of his predecessors ever had. The increasingly desperate Joint Chiefs of Staff approved limited escalation before the decapitated USFIP bore the brunt of Japan's reprisal; in other words, they handed Beach a blank check for equipment heavier and more blatantly American than the "deniable assets" already in theater. M55's, ATGM's, Pattons, honest-to-goodness Skyraiders - he names it, he gets it.\n\nBeach may be no MacArthur, come to return with his corn cob pipe, aviator shades, and the full might of the US Army. He may be no Fertig, so trusted by his men that they would follow him to the ninth circle of Hell. Then again, the actual MacArthur's an invalid in a military hospital. The actual Fertig's six feet under. What good would aping those failures do him now?"

UPH_Carlos_Romulo: "Carlos Peña Romulo"
POLITICS_CARLOS_ROMULO_DESC: "Made to choose between two masters, men would inevitably hold to one and despise the other. Carlos Peña Romulo disagrees; after all, his two masters are one and the same. This was the epiphany he reckoned with as General MacArthur's personal aide, and it had only evolved during his exile. For he found in lively, orderly San Francisco not just a second home, but an example his first home should emulate.\n\nNot that it could have after the Akagi Accords ended the Commonwealth. To his credit, Romulo counted among a handful of its officials who remained publicly active thereafter. The former Resident Commissioner of the Philippines offered his expertise to the State Department's Division of Far Eastern Affairs in late 1945, who hired him as an advisor. Since then the accomplished journalist had used his position primarily to garner support for the liberation of his old patrimony: an ambition which even he would admit was a fantasy by the turn of the 60's, as his influence waned and as the Manila government trundled onwards. After decades of fruitless service, the old warhound was ready to retire.\n\nFour years later, the Filipino people elected Romulo as their first legitimate President in more than twenty. How things change so radically in so short a time. Some things never do of course - in Romulo's case, his unwavering belief that the Filipino and the American, the two masters whom he had long served, are brothers across an ocean. With a nation's resources on his fingertips, Romulo now commits himself to applying that belief until the Philippines is every bit as prosperous and alike as its sibling.\n\nYet one can only wonder: if Romulo is building a new America in the Pacific, then does he truly love his two masters... or does he despise his first for falling so short of his second?"

UPH_Carlos_Garcia: "Carlos Polistico Garcia"
POLITICS_CARLOS_GARCIA_DESC: "The Bard from Bohol, or Carlos Polestico García is a rather quiet and serene career politician. Behind this veneer of a poetic virtuoso lies a man of cunning and ruthlessness that has led him to the arduous duty of leading the last vestiges of an ostensibly free Philippines away from both the boots of the Japanese and the hands of the Americans.\n\nGarcía grew up with politics, and would start his journey to the office of the President by climbing from one post to the other; first as congressman, then governor, then senator. Yet his anticipated tenure in the Senate would never come about, with the invasion of the Japanese forcing him underground into guerrilla activities.\n\nAs the dust cleared over the Philippines, the hastily abandoned remnants of Commonwealth and American forces scattered down south to stake it out on their own when it became clear that MacArthur would never return. It is here that García's shrewd opportunism would take him all the way to the presidency through payoffs, intrigue, and aggressive politicking.\n\nNow, he stands as the head of a crumbling house with weariness from near-constant war taking its toll, anti-Americanism spreading, and a serious decline in his own effectiveness as president thanks to the corruption and sycophancy that brought him to power. The question now stands: Can García weather the coming storm?"

UPH_Lorenzo_Tanada: "Lorenzo Martinez Tañada"
POLITICS_LORENZO_MARTINEZ_TANADA_DESC: "No matter how his story will unfold from here on, Lorenzo Martinez Tañada will forever be remembered as the one man who openly defied the Laurel regime and lived. Head of the Civil Liberties Union of the Philippines, the lawyer-activist's crusade for the Filipino's freedoms continued into the Occupation, earning him the Kenpeitai's ire and charges of sedition. To their surprise he successfully appealed his case before the Supreme Court; in a rare act of clemency, and despite considerable pressure from Japan, then-Chief Justice Jose Yulo personally acquitted Tañada of his charges.\n\nThose who had hoped the experience would cow Tañada into irrelevance would be proven wrong in the 1949 elections, when he would set yet another precedent by winning one of Manila's two assemblyman seats despite owing no allegiance to the KALIBAPI. The Assembly's sole independent then used his seat as a pulpit for speeches decrying the Laurel government, and as a conscience vote for the reformists' occasional good bill. This quid-pro-quo lasted a decade before Tañada alienated his on-and-off allies by denouncing Yulo's "illegitimate inauguration" in 1959. Sensing opportunity, the Kenpeitai drew their knives anew and acted - and if the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive had struck any later, then perhaps Tañada today would be sleeping in a cell in Shonan-to, rather than in Malacañan Palace.\n\nAs it is, the Coalition found the ideal compromise candidate: principled, universally beloved, but unaffiliated with either half. "Ka Tanoy", for his part, has plans beyond leading a progressive coalition to total victory. He envisions nothing short of a grand revival for the country he loves so dear. The schemes of men seem paltry before such a vision - but if he must walk their tightropes a fourth time to bring it about, then walk again he shall."

UPH_Ramon_Magsaysay: "Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay"
POLITICS_RAMON_DEL_FIERRO_MAGSAYSAY_DESC: "Among those who answered the Commonwealth's clarion call was a humble mechanic from Zambales. As fate would have it, the mechanic would come to her aid decades later as a beloved general, against a threat far more insidious than even the 14th Army itself - but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nRamon del Fierro Magsaysay, Sr. fixed trucks in the Army long before he earned his stars. When Bataan fell, he escaped and formed a guerrilla band in his home province. The newly-minted captain's first campaign lasted until the Akagi Accords; like most resistance groups, Magsaysay began his second after the massacre at Kawit. He ruled Zambales from its hills until the 14th Army proved too much to bear. Faced with either retirement in seclusion or cooperation with Jose Lava's communists, Magsaysay chose the former. It would last until 1959, when Russell Volckmann, his old superior and friend, convinced him to participate in the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive as a fellow general. He found some accommodation with the communists when Taruc took over, who agreed to a desperate truce as he retreated.\n\nThe preemptive strike he had planned after the liberation of Manila would be precluded by none other than the President himself - and so the fervent anticommunist watched, unable to act, while left-wingers sabotaged the post-war government the liberation had given them. As they too proved too much to bear, so too did he and his men retire a second time. Ballots were counted thereafter; disgraced, Tañada stood down his post to Magsaysay.\n\nNow "Monching" sits atop the short-lived Coalition's corpse, inheriting from it a war-torn land blooming with the red cancer. It won't be long, he swears, before it is excised in full - and from there shall arise a nation reborn, a people enriched, and a land forever unsullied by false prophets' taint."

UPH_Diosdado_Macapagal: "Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr."
POLITICS_DIOSDADO_MACAPAGAL_DESC: "Nobody could have expected the rise of Macapagal and the new guard in the Liberal Party. But considering how he started, perhaps they should have seen it as inevitable.\n\nSon of a poet, raised in a home of boarders and a yard of pigs, the Poor Boy from Lubao saw education as his only way out. And with a little financial help from his relatives he excelled, coming out top of his class in elementary, high, and law school. He landed a top job as the assistant to President Quezon, then the collaborationist regime. Of course, the discovery of him being a spy for the resistance necessitated a narrow escape down South, but a man of his talents had no problem fitting in with the FPR. There he remained an unremarkable member of the Liberal Party, until once again an opportunity in Avelino's resignation presented itself. And as always, he grabbed it.\n\nMacapagal brings a new type of freedom to the ones the Filipinos have fought and died for. This is the freedom of opportunity, a freedom without ceilings and fits plowshares as well as swords. No longer a colony, the Philippines welcomes all, will trade with all, let all be able to compete and thrive in this nation. And let its President prove how much an opportunity can mean to those who take it."

POLITICS_SHINOBU_TAKAYAMA_DESC: "The Emperor's men march to wherever He decrees they are needed most. As He would have it, Takayama Shinobu departed Tokyo for a reunion with the land of the dead.\n\nFor the Philippine Islands now, as it had then, offers nothing but death. This lesson he'd learned as a lowly colonel under General Masaharu Homma. He'd seen better men than he succumb to its jungles and the bandits within. Heard their pitiful wails in the hospitals and the medical tents, teenagers-turned-conscripts begging for aspirin, their parents, a quick and painless death. Held their coffins before planes carried what remained of them home. No glory awaited the Empire's sons here, and such a place was worth only purgation, through and uncompromising, lest any more of them fell.\n\nIf only its generals learned the very same, rather than vaciliating between half measures for decades. Then the 14th Army wouldn't have died far away from home. Its commander, Masazumi Inada, wouldn't have gutted himself in shame. Alas, Takayama returns with an army reborn and directives no clearer: pacify the Islands, by any means necessary.\n\nHistory shall repeat before it turns page anew. The Empire, its servant swears, will not be so lenient a second time."

PHI_Masazumi_Inada: "Masazumi Inada"
POLITICS_MASAZUMI_INADA_DESC: "Masazumi Inada is the latest in a long line of 14th Army commanders and protégés that had benefited handsomely from the Philippines' old status quo. Its underlying system, insofar as it can be called that, was inseparably intertwined with natives playing patronage politics. Thus, the experienced hand eased its successor into the convoluted web of friends, allies, and acquaintances taking "ignorable" slices of the Republic's wealth.\n\nMuch to the detriment of the bureaucrats whose funds buttress the country's growth, or the conscripts bereft with proper housing and equipment. Then again, did it really need the money? Anything more than a skeleton force? Not in the last decade, so surely neither in the next.\n\nThen came 1963, when it suddenly did. Yasuda's collapse upended the status quo, as the Philippine economy nosedived after Tokyo stopped writing its checks. The Blitz crippled its system through its flaws, as ill-equipped conscripts died helplessly before the rebel hordes. The Manila Incident ended the system, and much of its participants, for good. Now the capital's skyline glows cherry-red with fire; meanwhile, Tokyo has entrusted Inada to quell it. Or else.\n\nSquirreled away in Baguio with the government he had disbanded, a grifter in uniform counts his days as his golden goose chokes to death on its own blood."

SPH_Ferdinand_Marcos: "Ferdinand Edralin Marcos"
POLITICS_FERDINAND_MARCOS_DESC: ""What immortalizes men into the annals of history? Their virtues and vices? The sheer weight of their deeds? The reverberations thereof? Or is it something as mundane as chance - being in the right place, with the right deals, at the right time? Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos's experience suggests a pinch of everything... but mostly the last three.\n\nFor the Marcoses were the kingpins of Ilocos when Japan struck its blow. Rather than reach out to the southern resistance groups after the Kawit Incident, then-Major Marcos withdrew with his father Mariano to their home province, fending off government forces with a sizable private army. The Marcoses' insulation from Tacloban placed them closer to the AFRSR than most nominally-FPR aligned formations: a fact which the elder Marcos dealt with force of arms. Free to deal as he saw fit after his father's death, "Ferdie" instead found his enemy's enemy in Luis Taruc. So began a bargain that held even after Marcos' compatriots further south died beneath the red onslaught.\n\nSaid bargain ended the moment Taruc became king of the Philippines' ashes. With the victory-drunk reds purging the landlords in their closet, Marcos rallied everyone right of the Huks - former FPR, former KALIBAPI, the lone Japanese expat - and struck out of self-preservation. One firefight later, Marcos proclaimed himself President while Taruc's bullet-riddled corpse cooled beneath his feet.\n\nThe thrice-right man has won the musical chairs for a land that has seen more war in ten years than it had in a hundred. Its people tire of games yet their new master does not. What will he do now?""

#POLITICS_WENDELL_FERTIG_DESC: "When Bataan fell and MacArthur fled, those who had escaped the Death March formed guerrilla bands to resist the Japanese invasion. One was Wendell Fertig, who by the end of the war had formed the largest such group in Mindanao. The man they call "the Colonel" or "Father" thereafter assumed control of all American-affiliated guerrillas within the country when the post-war ceasefire collapsed.\n\nHis leadership since has been instrumental in ensuring unoccupied Philippines remained unoccupied long after the Accords. Fertig had reorganized once-disparate groups into close facsimiles of the former Commonwealth Army with the local families' assistance, and out of gratitude gave the latter the right to govern their own affairs. Normalcy was reestablished and victories against the once-invincible 14th Army delivered thanks to his many reforms... but twenty years of war takes their toll on any man. On the arbiter of the fates of so many men pining for home, moreso.\n\nSometimes the old man wonders if he had made the right choice staying with his men in 1946. Part of his mind would say he had no choice to begin with; between a short life in the jungle and an even shorter life in a chain gang at Camp O'Donnell, the massacre in Kawit picked for him. Manila turned the POW ships back, Dewey surrendered twice, and that was the end of that. Another would flash glimpses of Mary and the kids like a kaleidoscope, taunting him from afar with happier times.\n\nAnd yet a third would remind him of debts owed to his men. To his native brothers-in-arms. They had stuck by him for decades; the least he can do is win both their freedoms for them. This he swears."
POLITICS_WENDELL_FERTIG_NEW_DESC: "An engineer by trade, a guerrilla by circumstance, and a leader by will; Wendell Fertig has embraced his role as a Man of Destiny, no matter the consequences.\n\nFertig came to the Philippines as an American military engineer, working to halt the Japanese advance in World War 2 by demolishing bridges. The advance swept past his efforts, and he was trapped behind enemy lines, forced to retreat into the mountains alongside the remnants of his unit and fellow Filipino fighters. Abandoned by his country with the Akagi Accords, Fertig was the first American in the Philippines to renounce his citizenship and declare his intent to fight for a Free Republic with his own signature on the Leyte Proclamation.\n\nAnd what did he get out of this? Fertig has been stuck in the role of an oft-forgotten advisor, a man of talent wasted in the dusty little corner Carlos P. García shoved him into. Fearing that García's lack of strategic knowledge would render all his sacrifices worthless, he launched a coup to install himself as supreme leader. Now he works to transform the Free Republic into a weapon aimed at the heart of Japanese occupation. He will step down when they are victorious, of course - he is no despot, merely an engineer who seeks to fix a broken system.\n\nBut when he is done, they shall all know that it was Wendell Fertig that brought the Philippines into the light of freedom."

UPH_Jose_Avelino: "Jose Dira Avelino"
POLITICS_JOSE_AVELINO_DESC: "Following the death of Elpidio Quirino, the Liberal Party was left with no leader. In the chaotic politicking that followed, many promising candidates rose and fell. It wasn't until American exile Wendell Fertig lost his patience and put his fingers on the scale that the party consolidated around a single man: José Avelino y Dira.\n\nDespised as an American puppet by his people and holding little sway among his party, Avelino has no grand ambitions to remake the Philippines. A functionary and former Speaker of the House, he understands that his role is to serve as a bench-warmer, a pleasant and inoffensive leader that with an air of legitimacy. His own liberal, democratic ideals have become secondary to shepherding the nation through this moment of crisis after the deposition of Carlos García—at least that's what he tells himself.\n\nFor now, he works hand in hand with the man who made him ruler, Wendell Fertig, and tries to go about his duties in a quiet and efficient manner. He ignores the protests in the streets and the rumors of growing dissatisfaction in the army. He prays that his American handler has the ability to quell all this unrest so that this whole wretched business might have been worth it in the end."

POLITICS_LUIS_TARUC_DESC: "Many questions assailed the exiled partymen of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas following the Great Paddy March. What happened to the Offensive? When and where did it go wrong? Above all, who is to blame? Finger-pointing became pointed words, then became ruptures which threatened to sunder the Revolutionary Republic in a tasteless parody of the old Soviet Union's dying days.\n\nIn the chaos stepped Luis Mangalus Taruc, Supremo of the PKP's armed wing the HUKBALAHAP. The firebrand general's word now carried even more weight after the Party's fighting retreat, and he leveraged his magnified standing by launching a scathing critique of their then-General Secretary Jose Baltazar Lava. Had Lava not held his men back so many times, he accused, then perhaps the fascists wouldn't have compelled them to cower in the Cordilleras. Lava's dogmatism and caution have cost the Revolution far too much to overlook; perhaps now they should correct course before their chance is lost forever.\n\nWith desperate, frenzied applause it was decided: Lava shall go, and Taruc shall take his place. Like caesar and pope in one, "General Alipato" now commands the totality of the revolutionary struggle. Yet some still wonder if an effort so herculean is enough to snatch victory from defeat... or what tenets of the Revolution he will carelessly discard in its pursuit."

SPH_wounded_revolution_desc: "A "workers' and peasants' republic", the Lava brothers would describe their creation in 1945. It would be the first of its kind in Philippine history, unique among the islands' governments both past and present for paying attention first to the bonded masses rather than elites within or without. For a time it lived to its ideals; liberated farmlands were parceled to its tenants, villages were freed of onerous taxes, mouths were fed three meals a day and hands were paid their labors' worth. It seemed as if socialism at its most idyllic found purchase in the land of the landless.\n\nThen came the Offensive of 1959. Whatever the cause, victory came not for the Revolution but for the fascist. Heavily wounded, it was salvaged only by the Huks' heroics and an arduous march to the base areas of the Cordillera Mountains, where partymen hoped to bide their time for another strike. But wounds left untreated invite sepsis - and with the defeatism gripping the PKP's ranks, who can spare the time or the energy to mend them?"

Thusly-assembled, Congress shall oversee national reconstruction until all provinces are capable of participating in nationwide elections, after which one such election for all seats must be held forthwith. From its very conception, the Philippines' post-war government was built with compromise in mind.\n\nReality came crashing not hours after its inauguration, when no less than ten bills either died in committee or failed on the floor by double-digit margins. Age-old arguments on the nature of capital escalated into fistfights before the sergeant-at-arms intervened. Congressmen entered their first session with optimism and left it half-despaired, half-incensed, and wholly in need of a stiff drink.

PHI_Blitz.1.t: "The War on the Philippines"
PHI_Blitz.1.desc: "1945 was the end of an era in many respects. For the United States it signaled the steady return to the bad ol' days of the Depression, brought about by its first humiliating defeat since 1812. The unbridled optimism and invincible aura which had carried her people through civil war and penniless peace alike went alight with Pearl Harbor, seemingly for good. And while America grieved for her losses, their murderers in Tokyo gloated of a new order built atop their carcass. What else can a mother bereaved do but grin and nod until the desecrators bade their leave?\n\nSo went the same for her dominion across the seas. The Rising Sun was swift and thorough with its blows, and by war's end had claimed the Philippine archipelago in its entirety like one pile of ill-gotten spoils among so many. A people promised freedom in ten years' time greeted the eleventh under another empire's jackboot. Resigned to another century of servitude, much of the old Commonwealth had laid down their arms and asked for clemency in the days following Akagi.\n\nSome, however, fled to the jungles north and south of sprawling Manila, where the foliage proved too thick for both the Laurelists' hawkish gaze and Tokyo's piercing rays alike. Here flourish a resistance defiant and convinced that good endings await their side of an unsung war. For the Filipinos await their freedom, fought and earned by their own two hands; for the Americans left behind, a ticket home. Two kinds of men, their differences stark as night and day, yet both pine all the same for something dear but not quite near. Not yet... or if fate is unkind, forever not.\n\nWhose story shall we follow?"

Lesser nations may scoff at such a boast, yet had we not made conquests of every realm our brave warriors had trodden since? Had we not leapt from victory to victory, at times against overwhelming odds? And had we not ended war itself with light so radiant it scorched men with a single touch, made permanent their shadows on the ground beneath their feet? The rich swathes of land we have claimed, the many new peoples under our aegis, and the bloody due we had dealt for both -- far from idle boasting, they were facts the sons of Emperor Jimmu had welcomed with utter aplomb.\n\nAlas, even victories so overwhelming are ephemeral. Much like the solstice, our sun had inched downwards with every day that followed. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Philippine Islands, which had seen little peace since it was supposedly struck seventeen years ago. Rebels yet roam the countryside and ransack villages beyond Manila's grasp. Unruly dynasts and cliques yet hamstring the republic's day-to-day affairs, undoing bit by bit the legacy of their departed President Laurel. Our own 14th Army is yet to recapture the fearsome strength it had ended the Liberation War with. Assailed by threats from within and without, and embroiled by war since its founding, the Empire's brother Republic might not live to celebrate its eighteenth birthday.\n\nBut whatever awaits us and ours, know that the Emperor has willed the Philippines to live long and prosper.

For most of the war they spotted movement without being spotted themselves. But this morning their greatest strength became their greatest weakness; most fell silent before they could tell the Army something was afoot.\n\nNext were the villages and barrios along the front. Any other day and the villagers would wake in the early hours to prepare for the harvest. Men with guns by the hundreds forestalled their daily routine as houses and fields were captured without a shot. Some runners evaded notice enough to make for civilization.\n\nThird were the city outskirts, better defended than the backwater hovels of the provinces. It is here where armed men met other armed men and traded bullets and shells as the sun peeked above the horizon. Precincts received the outposts' distress messages and the village runners - right as explosions claim the lives of a dozen constabularies. Death himself had roused the townsmen from their sleep.\n\nLast to receive them all was Manila, the Pearl of the Orient. From a distance, pillars of black smoke arose with the morning sun. Gunshots and explosions intertwined and formed hollow, echoing staccatos so far away yet so close all the same. Only now did the Army receive its reports: positions overrun, casualties reported, barrios lost, and cities besieged from Pampanga to the Negros.\n\nIn the span of four hours, both rebel groups were less than a hundred miles from Malacañan Palace."

Maidens met their princes, children laughed and trotted, and elders watch the follies of youth with stolid, yet warm complexions. Years preparing for war had fostered restraint among Manila's denizens; with war's spectre banished for good, the energies restraint held bay had cast it aside and engulfed the city by storm.\n\nAnd at its eye stood the Republic's beloved savior. Gone was the recalcitrant old relic of the late Laurel's ministry. At its place emerged an equal who had snatched victory from the twin jaws of communism and imperialism. Millions held firm to his wizened helmsmanship and were rewarded the lasting peace their fathers sought, and so they cheered his name from the rooftops and windows along the 19 de Junio, whereupon his Mitsubishi motorcade ambled at leisure's pace. Better then for the President's adoring legions that he had eschewed a roof -- reach close enough and one may even catch a glimpse of his fiery gaze.\n\nThen thunder clapped beneath the cloudless, daylit sky. An instant later, the fire was gone. Its cauldron shattered into stains of red and grey against the asphalt.\n\nAs sirens and shouting reverberated throughout the city, as truth dawned to the millions who'd denied what their eyes had seen, newscasters hours later made fact out of truth and announced somberly:\n\nWe regret to inform you that..."

It could even have been fatalism, widespread as it was before the Blitz. The communists then seemed much farther away than Manila; if red and blue both died in the "one last push" regardless, then at least brass would spare themselves from shelling out a clear-cut answer.\n\nWhatever the case, said brass had deferred it so often it became a sardonic in-joke among the grunts. Step on a landmine then answer "The Question". Outlast a tank in a knifefight then answer "The Question". Raise Old Glory over Manila Bay then answer "The Question".\n\nThey aged about as one expects when Manila did fall. This time Taruc asked for the punchline himself. With the thinly veiled ultimatum looming over their heads, the brightest minds of the Commonwealth brought "The Question" out of the grapevine and into the 18th floor of the Manila Hotel.\n\nPredictably, personalities clashed, egos butted heads, and principle waged war on pragmatism from sunrise to sundown within the penthouse's walls. Only pointed reminders of the Commonwealth's precarious situation (and many a shattered cup of coffee) prevented escalation beyond repair. Nevertheless, the men assembled were still men of flesh and blood.

Drill-like repetition saw to that. Meet at the table, sign the paper, and shake hands. Should be simple, right?\n\nMinutes passed. Nobody moved.

Jet bombers left their carriers by the dozens and darkened the sky with their silhouettes, punishing the guilty from their empyrean dais. Neither man nor nature were spared from the onslaught: not the hut from a salvo, not the copse from a napalm bomb, not the edifice from both. However minute, a parcel of the devil-infested islands died at Emperor's command.\n\nThe blaring of a hundred hundred klaxons cut the following respite mercilessly short. From the transport ships disembarked just as many landing craft, carrying each a company of the finest marines honed by men. What paltry resistance was offered melted when the Special Naval Landing Force made landfall, and before long they answered the partisans' impudence with quick, painless deaths. Veterans of wars from the Qinling Mountains to the Strait of Malacca followed suit as the Kyokujitsu-ki fluttered once more over its most unruly subject.\n\nSo unfolded our greatest amphibious operation since the Liberation War.

Some caskets had bodies pristine and whole; others had just enough to resemble a man with a mortician's help. For far too many, only photographs and dog tags of their departed souls remain. The imperialists and their toadies allowed us those if nothing else.\n\nWhere was the Army's vigor now, you ask? Their all-consuming vengeance which had once salted the earth with fire and shell? Six feet under or in pieces, one would say, like the men they were sent to avenge. Japan's haste in vindicating its dead brought no vindication and only many more dead. And that, perhaps, stung more than suffering their first unequivocal defeat -- that all they have sacrificed to this point was for nothing.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon and the last coffin boarded the transport ships, foghorns sang their dirges, guns saluted their farewells, and half-mast Sunbursts lowered on the graveyard of Empire one last time."

Soon his voice grew hoarse and the clicking stopped, and his pistol fell by his side as he exhaled like his soul went with his breath.

The cryptanalyst baseside later said it showed a man and a woman, her belly bulging with child."\n\n"In the name of vengeance, the American then died with a bullet lodged to his head."\n\n"Days later we were sent into the countryside, prowling for rebels. The flyboys were thorough with their work; by the time we arrived at the nearest village there was no village worth the name, only flaming huts, craters, and dead bodies. At the center of the carnage stood a native with a machete and tattered fatigues. Behind him, mounds of dirt with a wooden cross each. One mound could fit the largest five times over. The delirious native ranted every which way, but the message was clear: come any closer and he'll part our heads from our necks."\n\n"In the name of the honored dead, a machine gun burst sent him with his family."\n\n"Then there was the expedition to the hills.

Instead he paced around his desk wondering how the careerist, of all people, called his bluff. Showed him he weren't the wily operator he thought he were.\n\nThe army men were leaving their trucks now, arranging in neat rows on Palace grounds. No wonder then - the AFP, supposedly in charge of keeping the peace, loved Magsaysay to pieces. They hung to their golden boy's every word, asking how high when he tells them to jump, how far when he tells them to walk, for how long when he tells them to disobey orders and return to their barracks, leaving the capital oh so vulnerable to robbery, murder and rape...\n\nKnocks across the room, then the grand oaken door yawning open.

PHI_flavor.1.desc: "The proprietor of the aptly-named Taste of Manila was kind enough to offer Mr. Carlos drinks in the house after his little speech in the I-Hotel. Not that it was anything so grand, mind; in fact his quaint audience was more of the same old manongs and veterans of a war gone by. Fortunately the watering hole's owner was both, and so now he was nursing half a glass of tubâ in the same room as day laborers, ladies of the night, and his good friend "Mr. Bottom".\n\nSaid friend quaffed his own bourbon before saying, "It's times like these when we wonder if you're intentionally making our jobs harder."\n\nQuirking a brow, Carlos said, "I don't follow."\n\n"The Chronicle quoted nothing from the transcript you sent us." The American brought out a folded newspaper from the insides of his suit, splaying it on the table between them. "What part of 'Don't make promises you can't keep' don't you follow, Frank?"\n\nAh. "But everything I had said was true, was it not? The war has pushed Manila to the breaking point. The rebels are mere hours away from capturing Yulo's gang. With just the right push-"\n\n"And I'm saying the President never said that 'push' of yours will happen!" At some point Bottom had stood up and raised his voice enough to resound through the dinky bar, turning everyone's heads their way. Most shared Carlos's healthy brown skin, and most wore faces that said they couldn't quite believe what they had heard.\n\nCarlos P. Romulo asked the same question on everyone's minds, feeling slightly smug as he finished his taste of home. "Care to repeat that, Mr. State Department?""

 PHI_flavor.2.desc: ""-and you better get the right damn copy or I'll roll it up and maul you with it, so help me God!"\n\nThe nurse scurried away after his outburst. Benigno Ramos breathed rasping sighs. That should show the dumb broad. Before the old man could relish his victory, another hacking fit knocked him to his pillow. Groaning, he rolled over quarter-ways to his left.\n\nRamos's doctors told the old man he only had a few days left at best. That was fine. If all this blasted hospital was good for was storing live corpses, then maybe he should've asked for a prescription of bullets long ago. As it is his decrepit carcass could do nothing but think.\n\nAnd think he did. He had months to ruminate on several decades of failure. His measly "revolt" against Quezon the dictator. His blind eye - figurative, not his glaucoma-riddled right - for every massacre the Filipino had suffered under the Rising Sun's watch. His "legacy" brotherhood, reduced to glorified gangs and a race-traitor's repute. The once-firebrand assured himself that such betrayals were righteous and just.\n\nNow look at him. Rail-thin, wasting and senile, spending his dying days in an institution and not the glorious battlefield as heroes are wont. Stupid, stupid, stupi- ack!\n\nRamos clutched his chest. His breathing stilled. The world felt as light as a feather. The sound of footsteps grew distant until he heard nothing at all. His eyes rolled up; they would never again move."

 PHI_flavor.3.desc: ""I leave you incompetent fools for three days and everything's turned to horseshit already!" High Consul Takayama Shinobu sidestepped an aide carrying his luggage to his office at the far end of the hallway. Would if he no longer spent an hour more in the Manila Hotel - but alas, someone had to dispose of the now ex-President of the Philippines while he was away.\n\nAlongside him paced Foreign Minister Claro M. Recto, with bloodshot eyes, an untucked suit and the hair to match. "Your Excellency, I can assure you everything's under control."\n\nBoth men stopped in their tracks as an explosion resounded from the distance, followed by the telltale rattle of traded gunfire and loud, wailing ambulances. Takayama pierced Recto with an annoyed stare, before sighing and resuming his gait. Recto scurried behind him.\n\n"Speaker Aquino's already mustering the delegates as we speak. The Assembly will convene tomorrow at the latest to choose Mr. Yulo's successor." More explosions, one close enough to rattle the windows. The footsteps ahead and in the floor below grew faster and more frenetic.\n\n"If I had my way then there would be no Assembly to speak of." Recto's blood chilled as the general glanced at him askance. Neck hairs rose with every second Takayama seemed to pin him where he stood. As if begrudgingly finding what he sought, the High Consul harrumphed and said, "But the Emperor's writ supersedes my own. You shall have your elections, for all the good it will do."\n\nThe Minister let loose a breath he didn't know he had held. At least there's still a chance."

 PHI_flavor.4.desc: "Captain Takamatsu Kazuo stares at the gold oak leaves surrounding the Imperial Gold Star on his cap. The leaves he worked so hard for. The leaves that he thought he could use to protect himself from getting KIAed. And the leaves he no longer has use of.\n\nA war orphan himself, Takamatsu feared having his life taken away by the military ever since graduating middle school. Though he was clearly not the brightest student among his peers, he worked extra hard to secure an admission offer from the Army Officer Academy, in an attempt to avoid being drafted as a lowly soldier and dying a likely death in Manchuria or Indonesia. While his scores were not high enough for the staff officer program, the golden ticket to a KIA-free life, Takamatsu made it to the artillery corps, a relatively low-risk job where all he needed to do was to calculate firing angles. He did quite well in his new career; years of calculating his chances of being drafted surely have paid off.\n\nTakamatsu could never forget the day he got assigned to the 3rd Guard Division. It was the climax of his life; the Guard Divisions were to protect His Imperial Majesty-- only with the Emperor's permission could they be sent overseas to the wilderness of no return. Never could he forget his unwillingly patriotic act before his superiors, years of salary he bribed his regimental commander for a recommendation letter, or the girlfriend he broke up with just because she hated Tokyo where the Guard Divisions are at--all for the gold oak leaves on the cap that only GD members can wear. And now, with the upcoming deployment of the Guards to the burning islands of the Philippines, it all meant nothing to him."

 PHI_flavor.5.t: "Memorandum - Report on the Philippines"
 PHI_flavor.5.desc: "CLASSIFICATION: SECRET\n\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY | DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nSubject: Conflict in the Philippines, Update\n\nWhile the situation in the islands has stabilized after the 1961 ceasefire concluded the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive (see Memorandum - 1959 Philippine War), succeeding developments may force another, more decisive confrontation in the near future.\n\nThe power struggles within the fractious Communist Party of the Philippines (PKP) culminated in General Secretary Jose Lava's ouster by Luis Taruc, commander of the party's armed wing (see Memorandum - Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon), following their retreat from Central Luzon to the Cordilleras Base Area. Reports from surrounding villages suggest that the hardliner is marshalling resources to rebuild his depleted forces ahead of a second offensive.\n\nSimilar efforts are being undertaken by the Philippine Department (see Memorandum - Free Philippines Republic) further south, aided by overt and covert shipments received in Davao City following its liberation. Having likewise regrouped their forces before the ceasefire, [UPH.GetLeader] has since reinforced the FPR's hold over the region while his forces recover. Optimism for the islands' total liberation remains unabated by recent setbacks.\n\nIn contrast, agents in Manila describe the prevailing mood as fatalistic. Government reassurances belie a record number of both arrests for "seditious behavior" and luxury liners leaving port. After years of repression, faith in the Yulo regime has plummeted to an extent where its lastingness is being openly questioned."

 PHI_flavor.6.t: "Memorandum to: William Colby (Chief, Far East Division)"
 PHI_flavor.6.desc: "SUBJECT: Imminent Communist Offensive on FPR. The ceasefire between FPR forces and the All-Filipino Revolutionary Socialist Republic has been tenuous ever since its ratification in 1957 (TAB A). Despite their many points of contention, however, leadership on both sides tacitly agreed that the status quo will remain as-is until the reclamation of Manila. Having done so before the communists, a large segment of the Philippine Department then voiced its discontent over ongoing negotiations with Luis Taruc. The fate of the peace mediated by Gen. Russell Volckmann of FPR-Northern Luzon (TAB B) became increasingly untenable.\n\n2. The situation escalated on Monday, 0526 Zulu Time, when the Phil. Dept. suddenly lost contact with Gen. Volckmann's headquarters in Ifugao Province. This coincided with Taruc's hurried departure from Manila premises, likewise ending negotiations unilaterally. Frantic communiques from the capital were either unanswered or rebuffed.\n\n3. This state of affairs persisted until Friday, 1210 Zulu Time, when Taruc issued a public ultimatum by radio (TAB C). While he reassured the Phil. Dept. that Gen. Volckmann and his charges were kept safe in an undisclosed location, he also demanded the withdrawal of FPR forces from Manila to secure USFIP-NL's safe passage into Bicol. Shortly after, Gen. [UPH.GetLeader] issued mobilization orders to units stationed along the Demarcation Line.\n\n4. Analysis concludes that Gen. Volckmann's situation is unsalvageable. War will re-engulf Luzon weeks before the Japanese 14th Army returns, severely depleting USFIP's capacity to resist a qualitatively and quantitatively superior force. For all intents and purposes, it will have to fight alone."

 PHI_flavor.8.t: "Death and Duty"
 PHI_flavor.8.desc: "A hotel in Tottori-ken, one day after the 14th Army's remains returned. The door is ajar in one room at the far end of the hallway, and the fluorescent lights within reflect off the varnished hardwood with a dim, eerie glow. Inside lay yen bills next to disheveled clothing, shards of glass, and empty cans of cheap sake. Water seeps from beneath the bathroom door; the tap is open, its muffled, rushing flow obscured slightly by the loud, crackling static of a dead radio. The air is laden with cigar smoke and alcohol. Though they did their level best to make it unlivable, someone clearly lives here.\n\nMetal grinds against metal like a sword unsheathed. Shaky breaths, then a yell cut short by something sharp ripping through flesh. A soft thud - the yell became sobs, then whimpers, then rattles. Someone no longer lives here.\n\nSomeone was Masazumi Inada. Someone was a general once. Someone will be remembered by someone else, maybe - but not now, not while the lives someone had doomed were still so keenly missed.\n\nThe next afternoon, in a temple ground further east. Services which began at the crack of dawn end just as the sun dips below the glimmering orange sea. Plumes of ash-smoke trail upwards from a furnace; a dozen more from a dozen other furnaces in the city climb with it towards the silver terrace-clouds above. The crowd has thinned into clumps idling about, yet the wails of the bereaved linger like echoes from six hours ago.\n\nFrom within the temple emerges an army man, sharply dressed. He allows himself one last moment to reflect. Then he leaves the temple grounds just as quickly, gloves clasped around a letter with the Chrysanthemum Seal.\n\nTakayama Shinobu has learned to treasure such moments now, for in the coming months he will have no time for reflection, or for grief. The 14th Army dead demand only justice."

 PHI_old_soldier.2.desc: ""Fancy seeing you anywhere not in a mess hall," called out Evan Tyson to the pitch black night. Grass shuffled as footsteps neared up to some paces behind the sergeant. Though the intruder's face blended with the midnight murk, Chester Brannen's lilt was unmistakable.\n\n"It's gotten unbearable even for me," said the Irishman as he sat next to Evan. "Ever seen the Captain choke on some dead baby chicks?" He shuddered. "Wish I hadn't." The sergeant stifled a snort, but otherwise took another silent drag from some homemade cigarette. When a man's odds of surviving the next week are so small he'd need lenses to see it, of course he'll let loose before a bullet does him in.\n\n"Say," began Chester, "you never told me about your kid before."\n\nNow that was out of left field. What was even there to say if he hadn't seen the kid at all? "Well, we had some names prepared. Both if it was a boy or a girl."\n\n"Five bucks says it's a boy and there's at least a Dick in there somewhere."\n\n"My wife bet on a girl, and it's either Ruby, Jade or Crystal. Not even close, Chet."\n\nThe two men shared a laugh under the moonless night. Times like these will be few and far between soon enough, and by then there won't be enough to spare for reminiscing.\n\nWas that a bad thing or not? The old soldier couldn't tell."

I was worried our rather capricious mailman would single mine out for this reason or that, even after he pocketed some of my spare yen easy as you please. Let's hope it hasn't come to that.\n\nHQ sent our battalion and some others to (REDACTED) some time ago. The name's hard to pronounce but, then again, nobody bothers besides our CO. A cluster of huts lodged deep in a jungle a ways off from a dirt road to nowhere? It might as well be our last ten deployments in a row. Nothing worth writing home about, certainly - if it weren't for what we found in the village itself.\n\nHuts with guns and ammo, huts with shells, huts with barrels of fuel all lined up as neatly as you can get them without heavy machinery. A nearby tunnel led down a cramped space with honest-to-goodness tanks and artillery pieces parked like in a motor pool. Matsu called it an ammo dump at the least. One so far away from civilization the Army had caught wind of it on a whim, and one with abnormally heavy ordinance at that. No doubt many more hide beyond our reach.\n\nI'll be long gone from this malaria-infested swamp before brass seeks them out, Heaven willing.
