ENG_Harold_Macmillan:0 "Harold Macmillan"
POLITICS_HAROLD_MACMILLAN_TFL_DESC:0 "Absolutely nothing brings Maurice Harold Macmillan more joy than to be back in his beloved isles. After almost two decades in exile in Canada, "Supermac" is back - and better than ever.\n\nBorn to a very well-off family in 1894 and educated in Eton College and Oxford, Macmillan is the archetypal Edwardian gentlemen. A pragmatic man of sharp wit and strong character, he was one of the key opponents of appeasement in Parliament - fending off the cowardly "pragmatism" shown by the likes of Rab Butler. This made him few friends amongst the Nazis when Sealion struck, however; Macmillan was on the list of select people to be "dealt with" upon occupation.\n\nFleeing to Canada along with his compatriots in both the Conservative and Labour parties, Macmillan has been one of the collaborator regime's strongest opponents for years on end. What was once a life of spirited debate and fiery passion became an ever-more wintry existence, as the iciness of the north began to freeze his hopes for a free Britain.\n\nAnd then, the Resistance won.\n\nReturning to his home a new man, Macmillan is the archetypal "One-Nation" Conservative, intent on unifying a broken nation, regardless of class or creed. The challenges he faces shall undoubtedly be great. However, if there was ever a man for the job it is Supermac - and once he's through with her, Britain will never have had it so good!"

ENG_Michael_Foot:0 "Michael Foot"
POLITICS_MICHAEL_FOOT_DESC:0 "A fellow MP once said that Michael Foot was a man who belonged not to the parliament of the 60s, but to the days of Disraeli and Gladstone. To an uneducated man, this may seem ridiculous. How could Foot, the radical, heir to Attlee and Bevan, leader of the exiled Labour movement, possibly be a man of the Victorian era? Yet, behind that radical exterior, lies an intellectual, a man who can rattle off critics of Swift and Harper as easily as describe the plight of the working class.\n\nFoot, unlike many of his contemporaries, was not born to the working class. Raised Liberal, Foot would only subscribe to socialism after bearing witness to the inequalities across Britain, most clearly in Liverpool, where he first committed himself to socialism. Throughout the 30s, Foot would dedicate himself to the Labour Party, most commonly through his journalism, through which He would write scathing criticisms of the appeasement policy followed by the Conservative government, concluding the book Guilty Men, a scathing critique of appeasement.\n\nFoot, upon the outbreak of World War Two, would attempt to join the military, but was unable to fight owing to medical conditions. Despite this, He would continue to support the war effort, even despite the failure of the National Government, and would continue to note how Conservative governments had left Britain unprepared for war, and had collaborated with the very enemy they were facing. In another timeline, this rhetoric may have led to his death by the German occupiers, yet thanks to an intervention by Lord Beaverbrook, whom Foot had developed a close relationship to whilst working at the Evening Standard, Foot would be evacuated to Canada, forced to watch the occupation of his thousands of miles away.\n\nEven in exile, Foot, ever the romantic, would not give up. He would continue in activism abroad, becoming one of the most influential exiled leaders. This continued dedication to Britain would eventually lead to his election to Labour leader, a role he would excel in. As Labour leader, he has marched with MLK, dined with Nehru, and has constantly fought no just for the liberation of his own home but for the freedom of the world as well.\n\nNow, Foot has finally returned home. Winning the post-war election on a program of a new Jerusalem, Foot has a daunting task ahead of him. Thousands starve, millions lie in poverty and the British people cry out for aid, made weak by the decades of German occupation. The work will be hard, yet if Foot is successful, the red flag will fly in Britain forevermore."

ENG_Jack_Jones:0 "Jack Jones"
POLITICS_JACK_JONES_DESC:0 "What can be said to describe Jack Jones? One half of the Terrible Twins. Bogeyman to every large business owner. The man who has shepherded the Left of the Resistance since before most of its members were born. Jones is a living legend amongst socialists - a true titan of the movement whose star only seems to shine ever-brighter.\n\nA school-dropout turned dockworker, Jones has been fighting fascism wherever he had seen it since the Battle of Cable Street and the Spanish Civil War. As expected, he fought tooth and nail against them during the war, and his efforts only grew when the blackshirts came home. Founding the Liverpudlian branch of the Resistance and coming into leadership of the Left in 1956, Jones became a figure of hope to those who dreamt of a Britain free of Fascism, and a thorn in the side of many a government.\n\nAfter an unexpectedly quick victory over the collaborators in the civil war, the British people's desire for change is clearly left unquenched. Being swept into office, Jones and his United Front of Socialists now hold an opportunity that precious few within their movement will ever hold - the chance to turn Britain into a genuinely socialist republic - with ties to the OFN, of course.\n\nOf course, all is not well. This will not sit right with the more conservative populations in Britain, and already his United Front is starting to feel the strain of the ever-present spectre of left-wing infighting. However, Jones is undeterred. He fought for the working man for almost three decades, and he'll continue to do so forever, if that's what it takes."

ENG_Mick_McGahey:0 "Mick McGahey"
POLITICS_MICK_MCGAHEY_DESC:0 "From the coast of Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands the Red Flag flies over Great Britain, the workers have stood up and cast off the dual chains of Capitalism and Fascism. The workers saw through the reformist lines of Jones' lies, and as they did in Russia they united and overthrew the liberals, revisionists, and reformists and established a proletarian Republic.\n\nAnd it's head is Mick McGahey a miners son from the Scottish lowlands, a resistance fighter plaguing the Fascist menace in his native Scotland, the man who lead the Workers to power. The son of one of the founders of the Communist Party of Great Britain McGahey was raised in Marxist knowledge, raised looking across the North and Baltic Seas to the Soviet Union as the one true hope for mankind. Then came the Fascist menace in Germany, the jackboots of the Reich ground Europe under their blood coated heel. As Britain fell, and the Soviet Union screamed McGahey went underground joining the Left Resistance.\n\nThe Germans lie gnashing their teeth across the channel, the reactionary exiles complain in Canada, and the Americans grudgingly welcome Albion into their nuclear fold. The Red Flag has risen, and beneath its glorious shade the British people will at long last live free."

ENG_Keith_Joseph:0 "Keith Joseph"
POLITICS_KEITH_JOSEPH_DESC:0 "Around a decade ago, the idea of a Jewish man governing Britain would seem utterly untenable. Too much harm had been done Britain's Jewish community, and the idea that any one of them could ever become Prime Minister would be dismissed as utter nonsense. Keith Joseph delights in dismissing these words in turn.\n\nFrom his early life, one would assume that Joseph was always destined to go far. Born to a rich Jewish family and studying Oxford, he was well-positioned to lead an easy and satisfactory life - especially due his exemplary service during the Second World War. Unfortunately, the victory of the Nazis and the coming of the collaborator regime meant that this was not to be. All too aware of what would happen to people like him, Joseph joined the resistance.\n\nAfter fleeing to Canada after the failed uprising of 1956, Joseph joined the Conservative Party and became one of its rising stars. His future as a key member of the party was only cemented upon the victory of the resistance, when he was nominated as the Tory candidate for the election after the shock retirement of the well-known and loved Harold Macmillan.\n\nNow as Prime Minister, Joseph finally has room to implement his vision of a Britain governed not by archaic etatism, but by a perfect harmony of government, employers and the trade unions - this, and his opposition to Germany means that Britain's future will be one heavily intertwined with the United States."

BSO_Christopher_Lee:0 "Christopher Lee"
POLITICS_CHRISTOPHER_LEE_DESC:0 "A direct descendent of Charlemagne on his mothers side, a SAS Commando, a polyglot, a veteran of the Second World War, and now the leader of the Special Operations Executive Christopher Lee is a man who cannot be summed up with ease. Born to a veteran of both the Boer Wars, and the First World War Lee grew up with knowledge of modern warfare around him. When the Second World War broke out Lee turned to the Royal Air Force. Sent to South Africa, and then Rhodesia for training his future in the sky was seized from him when his optic nerve failed. From there he joined the Royal Air Force's Intelligence Branch. During the war he served in the North African frontier, fighting during Operation Market Garden. As Britain was occupied, he slipped away, seemingly forgotten to the world.\n\nA few years later he would resurface in Great Britain as a member of the SOE opposing the Fascist government oppressing his homeland. During the Uprising he fought under Maxwell Knight's failed attempt to free Britain, but Knight was defeated. Fitzroy Maclean fell in battle and Lee ascended to the head of the SOE. As Jordan ascended to power Lee led the SOE to fight against mass murderer now leading his country. Then Jordan's government collapsed, and the SOE secured the Highlands. Now Lee looks south with the dedicated aim of freeing Britain once and for all."
 
BCP_Kim_Philby:0 "Kim Philby"
POLITICS_KIM_PHILBY_DESC:0 "Colin Jordan's Britain lies in bloody ruins, from the Highlands, to the English Channel the British people have risen up to cast off Fascism from their shores. Some might argue that it is the fault of Jordan's insanity, others might claim that the British People would always stand up for a free Isle. All of these claims are correct in one form or another, but all miss the crucial role played by Kim Philby head of MI5 since the treason of Maxwell Knight, and the new leader of what remains of the Left Resistance.\n\nEver since the brutal victory of the Collaborationist Government Philby has been working to undermine the government he theoretically served. Then Colin Jordan that inbred incompetent fool seized power and Philby knew his time had come. To say it was easy to undermine the state with Jordan's deranged personality at the helm would be an understatement.\n\nNow Philby leads the last of the revolutionaries, the men, and women, who have dedicated themselves to a free socialist Britain. No matter the cost."

BTO_Jock_Haston:0 "Jock Haston"
POLITICS_JOCK_HASTON_DESC:0 "Jock Haston has seen his friends, and his homeland fall to the cruel grip of Fascism. From the 1930's onwards he has done his best to fight against Fascism, at home and abroad. When the CPGB backed down from the threat Haston stood up against Fascism, splitting from the party and joining the Militant Group. Over the next two decades he would ascend to the leadership of the British Trotskyite movement.\n\nIt could not have come at a worse time, as German boots marched down the streets of Britannia Haston slipped into hiding, even as Great Britain was occupied by the state he despised so much. It was he who began the major Trotskyite force within the Left Resistance, a force he would lead until 1949 when he stepped down to allow a younger generation to lead the revolutionary forces.\n\nThen Colin Jordan and his inbred lackeys seized control of Britain. The leadership of the Revolutionary Communist Party were slaughtered and Haston was the last one left to lead the Revolutionary forces.\n\nNow Britain is a battlefield for the third time in thirty years, and Haston is here to lead the Revolution, to victory or to death he will fight, for a free Britain, to give Fascism a bloody nose, and to bring the Revolution to Albion's shores."

### England starting ministers

ENG_Andrew_Fountaine_hog_desc:0 "§YHome Secretary\n$fascism_british_fascism_1_subtype$§!\n--------------\n§LThe British Fascist movement is not confined to stuffy halls and stately manors. It lives in the streets, marching in unison and wearing a blackshirt uniform and decrying the evils of global finance. And at this mob's head stands Andrew Fountaine.\n\nBorn at the close of the Great War in Norfolk, Fountaine lived a life filled with conflict, growing up with an Admiral for a father and having fought on the side of Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. When the Second World War began, he would go on to enlist in the Navy. But when he returned home, Fountaine would find a much different Britain from when he left.\n\nFrom here, he rapidly rose through the ranks in the BPP, with his unrepentant support for a Fascism that spoke to the working man rather than the Baron, eventually becoming the biggest opponent of Butler and the Pragmatists. With his distinct base of support and undeniable competence, Fountaine was the ideal selection for Home Secretary. Now as one of the most powerful men in Britain and Domvile's right-hand man, Fountaine can almost sense the flame he has been stoking for years about to burst free and consume what remains of the Old Order - if only Domvile would allow him to do so.§!"

ENG_Ronald_Nall_Cain_for_desc:0 "§YForeign Secretary\n$fascism_british_fascism_1_subtype$§!\n--------------\n§LRonald Nall-Cain is not a particularly remarkable man by himself - a well-read, bookish man known for little more than being the Foreign Secretary. But it is less Nall-Cain himself that is remarkable, but the men he holds company with.\n\nBorn into wealth in 1904, he went into politics with a stint in the Commons before joining the House of Lords after his father's death. It was in the Lords with his fellow members of the Old Guard where he became well-known as a keen ally of the Reich; he joined pro-German organisations, became a personal friend of Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop, and even attended Hitler's 50th birthday. While this stalled his public career in the immediate lead-up to the war and during it, his fortunes rose once again after Operation Sealion succeeded and Germany occupied Britain. After the occupation began, he was made Ambassador to Germany at the wishes of Berlin, wherein his friendship with the regime grew even stronger. After Domvile's ascension to Downing Street, Nall-Cain's ardently pro-German alignment and tendency to get the job done quickly and efficiently made him Domvile's first choice for the foreign office, wherein he quickly became his favourite - or if not, least reviled - member of cabinet.§!"

ENG_Rab_Butler_eco_desc:0 "§YChancellor of the Exchequer\n$paternalism_controlled_democracy_subtype$§!\n--------------\n§LThe tale of Richard Austen Butler is one that invokes the old adage that all roads to hell are paved in good intentions. Elected to Parliament in 1929, Butler would be a key supporter of appeasement from the very begininng. This was less so out of love for Germany as was the case for some of his peers, but more so out of the genuine belief that Britain should never go through the hell brought by the great war ever again. Sadly, his efforts were for naught as the Second World War consumed the entire world. And as German boots set foot on British shores, he sealed his fate by choosing to stay rather than flee.\n\nIn exchange for collaboration, he was allowed to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, charting out a path for partial economic recovery by allowing the German corporations to do as they pleased. He stood by, accruing a following of like-minded individuals who advocated for a more pragmatic approach to collaboration rather than the dogmatic idolatry of the rest of the party. As 1962 begins, Butler can feel the years starting to weigh on him, as the dream of a Britain both free and safe that he has held for so long seems all too distant. But he cannot give up yet, lest the vultures start to pick away what remains of British democracy.§!"

ENG_Edmund_Veesenmayer_sec_desc:0 "§YReich Plenipotentiary to Britain\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LWho governs Britain? A simple question with a simple answer; the German plenipotentiary in Britain. Whenever the Reich needed a conquered people exploited, someone to keep unruly puppet governments in line, they turned to one man - and that man is Edmund Veesenmayer. With experience managing the integration of Austria, ties to business circles, and as the Reich's envoy to Slovakia and Croatia along with his role in Ireland, he was the perfect fit for the troublesome child that was Britain.\n\nEver since he arrived on these rainy shores in 1955, he has done his job to the letter, keeping the government down and ensuring Berlin's wishes are fulfilled. However, there is an oppressive stillness in the air - one that was not present when he first came. The Terrible Twins cannot be found, rumours of secret armies are being seen spread, and remnants of the war are still being dug up. All while the government squabbles, it is beset by internal division, corruption, and instability leading it unable to do anything as the knives come out of the shadows.

ENG_Abolished_Parliament_Act_law_desc:0 "One of the most important pieces of legislation in British history, the £GFX_commons_texticon  §OParliament Act 1911§! was introduced following the £GFX_TFL_ENG_Peers §sHouse of Lords§!' rejection of the §YLiberal§! government's "§xPeople's Budget§!" in 1909.

ENG_BPP_Constitution_law_desc:0 "Founded following the German liberation of Britain, the British People's Party is the sole legal political party allowed to operate in the United Kingdom. The party constitution transforms the state into a benevolent apparatus that acts as the sole custodian of both the welfare and right to life of the British people, in order to properly protect them from the threats posed by usury, speculation, and their ilk. In practice, this provides dictatorial power to the government alongside the ability to punish and kill political opponents at will."
ENG_Renounced_War_law_desc:0 "How the mighty have fallen. With the twin humiliations posed by defeat in the Second World War and the crippling loss of the empire, it is clear that Britannia no longer rules the waves - or indeed, much of anything. The nation's days of conquest are well and truly over. Now that the British Isles find themselves sandwiched between two superpowers at opposite sides of the Atlantic, it is unilaterally agreed that the nation will only ever take to the fields of battle in self-defence - or to come to the aid of an ally."
ENG_Conlcuded_Deportations_law_desc:0 "It is well-known that the subjects of the Reich must join their master in subjugating and deporting those considered 'untermensch' - and Britain is no exception. Under the watch of several successive ministries, the Isles are now almost - if not entirely - free from what the Germans consider to be impure, with the precious few that remain or have not yet fled live a fearful existence - eking out a living in the quiet corners of society, hoping that the government will not return to finish the job."
ENG_Speculation_Ban_law_desc:0 "The hoarding of land for the sake of one's own enrichment against the nation's common good is considered one of the seminal crimes against morality in BPP doctrine, and is often seen as the most widespread of all of global finance's crimes. It is only by the will of the state that this wretched flower has been prevented from taking bloom across the nation. With land speculation illegalised, a homeowner cannot legally own any more than one property - unless they have proven residency for up to four months in any other dwelling. It is through this that nobody can grow fat and selfish merely through owning land."
ENG_Monopoly_Ban_law_desc:0 "Global usury and finance often finds itself a comfortable home in large conglomerates and firms - in those glittering towers and smoke-filled rooms, the great spiders in the web of degeneracy plot away. Ergo, the government has taken steps to prevent such a monopoly forming in Britain. A series of harsh antitrust laws applying to the morally bankrupt corporations and firms that dwell in both the East and West prevent them spreading their bile here - and all the while, encouraging investment and cooperation from our friends in the Pakt in their place."
ENG_Partified_Civil_Service_law_desc:0 "During the early days of the BPP regime, it was ruled that all members of the civil service must hold BPP membership. What started as a simple bureaucratic trick designed to help solidify the new party's power quickly grew into one of the regime's greatest assets; compromises of interest, funnelling of electoral patronage, and the knowledge that the bureaucracy will loyally go along with whatever is asked of it has helped many a government work its way through a crisis, and it will doubtlessly continue to do so unless something was changed."
ENG_National_Purity_Act_law_desc:0 "To safeguard the youth of our isle from danger more insidious than any Resistance bomb, the National Purity Act decrees that possession of any "anti-British" materials is hereby prohibited by law, and punishable by either severe fines or in extreme cases, prison sentences. The definition of anti-British materials can vary considerably in nature, ranging from possessing Marxist literature to listening to American songs on the radio. What is consistent, however, are provisions stating that any such materials must be turned in to the authorities immediately, and those who consume them should be reported at once."
ENG_The_Imperial_State_law_desc:0 "The trappings of the old Britain remain, covering Parliament and the people she governs and shielding them from our vision. This will be rectified. Holes are already being cut in the broken remnants of our fallen empire to clear the way for a grand reformation into a new and perfect empire. One indivisible, unconquerable and fascist Imperial State."
ENG_NHS_Early_law_desc:0 "In order to carry out the duties of the Minister of Health to promote a culture of health and sanitation, a national, governmental body will be set up to make fit the lives of the citizens of England, Scotland and Wales. This body's purpose, amongst others, is to primarily improve the prevention, diagnosis and suppression of illnesses, diseases and epidemics. In it, and the Minister of Health's duties', the service will provide the proper provisions necessary to care for the sick and injured citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain."
ENG_The_Workplace_Organisations_Act_law_desc:0 "Of the many evils of Bolshevism, few are so vile as the means by which they corrupt unions to turn a worker against his own nation. To ward against such treachery from within, the unions of Britain shall commence the process of reorganization into a collective administration.\n\nSuch a process cannot be done overnight of course. To this end, the government has taken steps to add additional supervisory roles to each union, and establish further regulations around union activity. On top of this, a number of government liaisons shall be established between the different unions of Britain to ensure a harmonious and most importantly loyal leadership."

ENG_Oil_Reserves_desc:0 "Oil, that black gold, runs thin. With the ongoing chaos that has gripped the Reich and its oil fiefdoms in the East alongside the inherent difficulty of trade in our current predicament, we are left with only our current reserves of fuel and nothing else. We must be cautious in expending any of these reserves in any scenario, for even simple air and naval patrols now come with a drastically high price tag. If we are to win this battle for the fate of the Isles, we must be cautious in how we our supplies, or else our Government shall be cast away into the annals of history."

ENG_A_Mere_Puppet:0 "A Mere Puppet"
ENG_A_Mere_Puppet_desc:0 "Despite all of our efforts to portray ourselves otherwise, our government is seen widely both locally and internationally as little more than a glorified Reichskommisariat; a mere extension of the Reich ran by power-hungry vultures desperate to cling to whatever embers of popular support that can be found.\n\nWhilst this is obviously nothing more than widely disseminated propaganda, it is nonetheless the prevailing notion amongst many an average Englishman. We must show our people that we are not only the best option for the British Isles, but the only one. For at any display of weakness the forces of global finance will descend like a pack of vultures waiting for just the opportune moment to strike us down."

ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_Low:0 "British Free Corp Influence - §GLow§!"
ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_Low_desc:0 "The British Free Corps are perhaps the most dedicated collaborators currently at our disposal, initially formed out of German POW camps in the middle of the war, the Corps is made up of our most devout supporters, from pre-war British Fascists, opportunists hoping to escape the mundane life of captivity, or criminals with a waning loyalty to the cause of the Empire. From the ashes of our defeat, the Free Corps have grown massively, and are, to some, our most useful tool in dealing with certain... rebellious elements in our society.\n\nWhile they are certainly useful, many have noted their unwavering brutality in dealing with such threats to our government. Sometimes causing more harm to us than to the resistance we despise. We must remain wary of their continued presence, for if they decide that they are more capable of governing the isles than us, we might face a crisis of a different nature. But surely it will never come to that. Right?"

ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_Medium:0 "British Free Corp Influence - §YMedium§!"
ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_Medium_desc:0 "With the chaos and confusion of war ravaging our nation the British Free Corps have swelled considerably in strength. From an effective albeit brutal policing force they are increasingly being used in active combat against the rebellious forces. As such they have been given increased priority in equipment and food compared to our other forces.\n\nNot only is this causing contention within the rest of our armed forces, it is also giving the impression that the Free Corp is the only thing keeping our government from collapsing to rebellious forces. If we continue to utilize the Free Corp as our main tool against the Resistance we risk them swallowing us whole, alongside any legitimacy we may have garnered before then."

ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_High:0 "British Free Corp Influence - §RHigh§!"
ENG_British_Free_Corp_Influence_High_desc:0 "As the chaos of the British Civil War continues to drag on, the Free Corp have grown into an army in their own right. They hold major influence over our current government to the point where we risk sparking a three-way civil war shall we go against their wishes. Atrocities committed on the field have sparked outrage among not only our government, but the international community as a whole.\n\nThe rest of our armed forces have become increasingly concerned by their presence, and should we grant even a modicum of power more to the Corps we risk a complete governmental collapse. We must tread carefully for the future, for the question of the Free Corp's future must be answered inevitability."

ENG_Garrison_Support:0 "Garrison Support"
ENG_Garrison_Support_desc:0 "Despite the ongoing chaos in the Reich, our Garrison has stayed loyal to our government through-and-through. For two decades now they have assisted us in keeping peace and security within Britain and even now, at our lowest moment, they continue to assist in our endless fight against chaos and anarchy.\n\nThey are the best equipped and most professionally-trained force stationed on the isles, and it is pivotal we do not lose them, whatever the costs may be."

ENG_Chaos_in_Production:0 "Chaos in Production"
ENG_Chaos_in_Production_desc:0 "The utter collapse of our economy, flight of the conglomerates and the loss of our professional workforce has led to complete chaos in the factories. Factories are left completely empty, their workers slipping away to join the Resistance, while the needs of our military goes unanswered.\n\nIf we are to provide a steady supply of equipment to our boys on the frontlines it is pivotal we remedy the situation before it's too drastic to change."

ENG_Simplified_Designs_1:0 "Simplified Designs"
ENG_Simplified_Designs_1_desc:0 "The harsh conditions brought about by the civil war necessitated several measures in order for us to continue fighting. One of these measures is the simplification of our firearms.\n\nThis process will allows us to produce more equipment to arm our troops with despite the growing lack of materials. Like the Sten of old, British ingenuity is needed once again to turn the tides in our favor."

ENG_Simplified_Designs_2:0 "Efficient Designs"
ENG_Simplified_Designs_2_desc:0 "To make a design simple is one thing, to make it efficient is another. After all, a tool can only be called successful if works flawlessly.\n\nAfter receiving incident reports from both the factory and the battlefield, the BSA committee were put in charge of performing quality checks on these mass-performed guns. Hopefully, with their guidance, both the process of manafacturing the weapon and its usage in firefights can be likened to that of a well-oiled machine."

The tiny island has proven a tough nut to crack, with German garrisons holding a dagger at our very throats. The taking of this Island will be crucial to our struggle."

ENG_Union_Supply_Line_Open:0 "Union Supply Line - Open"
ENG_Union_Supply_Line_Open_desc:0 "With the Isle of Man having been liberated and the Kriegsmarine accordingly being driven out, our plans of a well-funded route of supply between Belfast and England have survived and will now be implemented in full force.\n\nExactly as we envisioned, supplies from wellwishers across the free world will now come to our hands through Belfast and the Isle of Man."

For us, a large percentage of the tax base have been killed during the uprising. For the people, the majority of our infrastructure has been shelled into rubble.

Highly corporatocratic, the intended "Imperial State" ironically bears precious little resemblance to the British Empire of old in either its nature or purpose.

And indeed, many still believe Wallop to have gone completely mad. If he wishes to prove them wrong, then he must ensure that he is not alone in his delusions of grandeur.\n\nLike a mighty Oak burrowing its roots into the earth, the new Britain can only survive by drawing sustenance from that which is below it - or, more specifically, by calling upon the strength of his benefactors.

Despite positioning himself as a reformist, he is less so a man wanting to bring about new change but a man wanting to bring back the old. Fundamentally, he is still a man of the past, clinging onto the old British tradition of liberal democracy.\n\nBut the light and vigour that he had held in his younger years has been largely burnt out by both old age and the decades of bargaining with German corporations. His bones ache and his mind yearns for rest. But God works in mysterious ways - and now the only man that can create anything resembling a bright future for Britain is one that belongs in its past."

ENG_The_Three_Musketeers:0 "The Three Musketeers"
ENG_The_Three_Musketeers_desc:0 "Angus Maude, Reginald Maudling and Harold Wilson. Three men that are Britain - and Rab Butler's - greatest hope. Between the three of them, they carry the acumen, political connections and reformist zeal to keep their mentor's vision for a new United Kingdom alive.\n\nYet as they gain more comfortable with their newly-acquired power, an unspoken, frightening change seems to be coming over them. Their ideological differences become clearer every day, and their old alliance is breaking down in favour of new ones designed to give them each their own independent powerbase.

Therefore, it is very important that the State's helmsman is powerful, singular and undisputed.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case currently. Two men, Hamm and Bean, lay claim to control over that position, and constantly wrestle for power, causing the State to rock and damaging its navigation to its Fascist future.

Just less than a year ago, Britain was a fascist dictatorship that fit snugly in with the rest of the tinpot tyrants that litter the continent - this is an ugly truth that strains the very fabric of our newly returned democracy.\n\nWhile our nation holds a strong democratic tradition, it has been eroded by both fascists and their enablers for far too long, and the damage they have wrought onto the Westminster system will take years to be undone. But this is not a hopeless endeavour. Like all wounds, Britain must give it time to heal.

ENG_Revolution_of_the_Right_desc:0 "For the first time, the right wing of British Conservatism has come to power. A loose coalition of Free-Marketeers, Traditionalists, and Nationalists with a mandate to launch Britain into the modern world. Taking inspiration from the continental concept of "Liberal Corporatism" to bring a distinctly liberal form of capitalism to Britain. Whilst some in cabinet push to go even further, they are a clear minority. For now."

ENG_A_Motley_Government:0 "A §hMo§!§Pt§!§el§!§Pe§!§Vy§! Government"
ENG_A_Motley_Government_desc:0 "We've crushed the fascist collaborationist government. We've fought back Knight's attempt to extinguish our democracy in its crib. But as the Left Resistance now transitions into a force of governance rather than a fighter for freedom, the lines of divisions within it are starting to rear their ugly heads. Jones must now fight to keep his rowdy band of socialists together if he wants to rebuild Britain into a nation that serves the many, not the few."

ENG_20_Years_in_the_Making_desc:0 "Two decades spent skulking in the darkness had left many in the Labour Party demotivated and depressed. Many believed that MacDonald had been our one and only chance to bring any meaningful change, and that he had squandered it. But as Michael Foot enters Downing Street, there is an air of hope; he is eager to prove that he is no Macdonald - nor a Chamberlain, for that matter. Britain will finally hold a truly socialist government for the first time in her history."

ENG_A_Socialist_Romance:0 "A Socialist's Romance"
ENG_A_Socialist_Romance_desc:0 "Michael Foot is many things; a poet, a scholar, and most of all, a romantic. Whilst he is an avowed Democratic Socialist, Foot still holds a great deal of nostalgic love for Britain's old institutions. The Commons, the Monarchy, the Civil Service - through his time in exile, Foot has missed them so. As such, there will be no sweeping Bolshevik reforms in his ministry, but a return to a kinder past."

ENG_The_Gentlemans_Government:0 "The Gentleman's Government"
ENG_The_Gentlemans_Government_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan is first and foremost a Gentleman - one could picture him as having stepped out of the old Edwardian era. While he remains a staunch One-Nation Conservative in the proud tradition of the Tory Party, would it not be ungentlemanly to accept new ideas from across the pond? Macmillan has learnt many a lesson in firm, clear leadership from Washington, and now more than ever his country is in need of a single uniting leader. Britain shall have Gentlemanly government once again, with an honourable cabinet and civil service loyal to their Prime Minister, to Crown, and to Country."

ENG_An_Electric_Manifesto:0 "An "Electric" Manifesto"
ENG_An_Electric_Manifesto_desc:0 "Macmillan has done what no Conservative leader has done since Disraeli's time, a complete redefinition of the party for a new age. The Conservatives are social conservatives of course, but also liberally unafraid of change and progress, not to mention more than happy to work with our proud unions and workers to run a more statist economy. This is the new vision of Conservatism we have presented to Britain, a manifesto of unity to heal our wounded nation, and they have accepted it."
 
ENG_Socialist_Nationalisation:0 "Socialist Nationalisation and Planning"
ENG_Socialist_Nationalisation_desc:0 "To free the British people from the exploitation of the corporations requires the nationalisation of their assets. Not the limited Tory or Labour method of nationalisation which stops short, but a thorough socialist nationalisation which extends to all large-scale industries, landowners, and banks. Only socialist nationalisation can finally end capitalist exploitation; to finally place industry into the hands of the working British people."

The sun never set on her domain.\n\nLook at her now: beaten, bloodied and broken. Britannia is little more than a slave whose chains hold her to a ruined home. She broke them once, and though she fought valiantly, the Reichsadler defeated her and wrapped her in new chains. She no longer has the strength to break them twice.\n\nDeep down, she knew it was foolish to hope for something more than this."

Where the people are blessed by his presence, a legion of unblinking eyes watches over the people. Every word is recorded, every action tracked, every movement restricted. Outside these boundaries, there is only violence. A horde of arms beat the unruly lands into submission. One day they will be afforded his protection, his legion of eyes, once their defiance is beaten and bled out.\n\nBut what rewards shall the Lord-Protector's many eyes see at the end of his crusade? Only starvation, immiseration and despair."

POLITICS_BARRY_DOMVILE_DESC:0 "Throughout the long and storied history of the British Isles, it has frequently been sang by millions across the globe that Britannia ruled the waves. And yet, it was not until she was conquered that a sailor was selected to rule over her. But Sir Barry Edward Domvile is no great hero of the waves, nor a conqueror of fair lands like his ancestors were. No, in fact, Domvile is perhaps the most hated man on the British Isles; a traitor of the highest order, and the captain at the helm of nothing more than a shackled Kingdom.\n\nBorn in 1878 to Admiral Sir Compton Domvile, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined the navy in 1892, commanding ships during the First World War and being further promoted afterwards to serve in a variety of different offices, including Director of Naval Intelligence. But Domvile's true purpose came with his infatuation with the far-right, which would begin after his visit to Germany in 1935, wherein after being impressed by the Nazi government he was invited to the Nuremberg Rally as a guest of Joachim von Ribbentrop, joining numerous Anglo-German organisations soon after. At the outbreak of war, Domvile spoke of the need for "a bloody revolution", leading to his internment in 1940.\n\nYet the 'revolution' would come with foreign arms, as Wehrmacht soldiers stormed the British beaches. While being overlooked by the Lloyd-George government, he would be placed in key governmental positions in the subsequent ministries, becoming something of a titan of the British People's Party's establishment. Following Chesterton's failures and the upswing in resistance activity, Domvile's good standing with almost all factions in government and perceived competence made him the natural selection for Prime Minister.\n\nNow, after 6 years of steering the ship through dangerous waters, the consensus seems to be that he has done a better job than most could in his position. The economy seems to be steadily recovering, the nation seems to grow more and more unified by the day, and the ghosts of the past grow ever dimmer. And as for the resistance, Domvile's methods seemed to have worked - after all, their activity has dramatically declined since the 1950's. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new age.\n\n§xOr perhaps this is just the calm before the storm...§!"

POLITICS_GERARD_WALLOP_DESC:0 "God, King, Country. Those are the words that Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth has sworn by, and those are the words that Britain had forgotten. The church had been torn down from the position of protecting the soul of the English stock. The King had been betrayed by the people he led to glory. The country that nourished them all had been despoiled and destroyed by the creeping grasp of industrialization and finance. Yet Wallop stands to reverse this doom.\n\nThe traitors might claim that England was destroyed as Sealion swept across her rolling hills. They are wrong. Sealion saw England's rebirth. As the British People's Party slowly consolidated under Lord Tavistock, Wallop joined his old allies from the English Mistery and Array, placing him as one of the key leaders of the Old Guard of the party. After only rising higher during their brief zenith of power under Chesterton, Wallop was one of the few who retained their post in the aftermath of 1956. As Leader of the re-empowered House of Lords, Wallop held a high position in the ministry, and for eight years England lay at peace under Domvile's ageing eye. And when the fires of another uprising were at last put out, once more it seemed the Old Guard stood triumphant, with Lord Portsmouth their new leader.\n\nBritain now lies at the mercy of this man - a staunch believer in Social Credit economics and an obsessive ruralist who dreams of a near-feudal society without a care for popular approval. Whether or not he pursues his own impulses or follows the legacy of his party, Britain's fate rests in the hands of a new, terrifying master."

POLITICS_RONALD_NALL_CAIN_DESC:0 "Arthur Ronald Nall-Cain did not want to be in this position. No sane man ever would - least of all the man who enjoyed little personal popularity or recognition beyond his position as Foreign Secretary under Domvile. But fate has a cruel sense of humour, as do the treacherous dogs that populate the resistance. When news of Domvile's assassination by none other than Maxwell Knight came to light, the fragile order that the British People's Party had carved out over Britain's fair shores came crumbling to a swift and brutal end.\n\nRapidly installed as the interim Prime Minister due to his ties to the Reich and lack of genuine partisan alignment, Nall-Cain is now faced with a nation in flames. His task is to restore order and crush HMMLR at any and all costs. A daunting task that most would shy away from in fear. Ironically, the state of emergency has provided a Nall-Cain a luxury Domvile could never quite experience - for once, the many faces of the party have ceased their constant bickering and now find themselves willing to rally together against the resistance. From Haller-Cooper's men in the British Free Corps to the reformists in the party, the majority of the government is finally united. Unluckily for him, HMMLR is a dedicated movement; a weed with roots so deep into the country that removing them will be an arduous - and some may say, nigh-impossible - task..\n\n§RThe fate of Britain lies in the balance, and it is up to Nall-Cain and his allies to prevent pure anarchy...§!"

POLITICS_MAXWELL_KNIGHT_DESC:0 "The mask has fallen.\n\nFor the past nineteen years Maxwell Knight has kept up a careful façade of loyalty to London and the British People's Party government. In that time, he has led a double life as the oh-so rare boss of HMMLR, a man that the government scoured Britain for, but they never thought to look beneath their own noses. When news of Hitler's death came, Knight knew that the time had come. The assassination of Domvile was the capstone of Knight's work as the head of HMMLR and the begining of his final fight for liberation..\n\nAcross Britain as the people rise up in the name of the country that still lives in their hearts, the dream of a truly free Britannia remains in the hearts of Britons; Knight stands at their head with his fellow comrades of the resistance to his side. As the fragile order that the Reich forged over Europe burns, Knight is determined to see the slaughter done unto Britannia avenged, and if he cannot do that, §Rhe will make the fascists pay with blood for their victory...§!"

POLITICS_COLIN_JORDAN_DESC:0 "Where is honour to be found in the New Order? For some it is found in resisting the evil that surrounds them, others in doing their best to reduce the harm brought by their new masters, others in embracing it in part and working within it for the benefit of those they care the most. For Colin Jordan, his honour is his loyalty, loyalty to Germany, loyalty to the Führer, loyalty to National Socialism, and last but definitely not least, his loyalty to Britain, or at least to his vision of it.\n\nBeing one of the first open collaborators on the onset of the German invasion, his loyalty was eventually rewarded with being put in charge of the British Free Corps, giving him the nickname "The Führer of the Isles", used by both friend and foe. Not content with the BFC being a mere peacekeeping force, Jordan swiftly moved to imbue the organisation with his own personal ideals, a fanatic if idiosyncratic form of National Socialism, hoping to combine brute force with unwavering purity of vision. It was those choices and circumstances that ended up landing him close to the seats of power in the British government, and he seems to not be content in simply working for it.\n\nEvery day he seems to get closer to his goal, and only time will tell if he will succeed."

POLITICS_RAB_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Throughout the history of the United Kingdom, there have been many labelled traitors - the likes of Anthony Babbington, Guy Fawkes and Carl Hans Lody come to mind. But none have done so with as many good intentions as the newest of them all; his Majesty's former loyal Chancellor of the Exchequer and now Prime Minister, Richard Austen 'Rab' Butler.\n\nBorn in Colonial India to an Imperial administrator, Butler was elected to Parliament in 1929. He would go further than most in arguing for appeasement from the beginning - not out of love for the Reich, but seeing no other option. And when the boots of the Wehrmacht marched across the isles, this line of thinking came to its rational conclusion as he chose to collaborate for the good of the nation. As Chancellor, his vision came true, as he charted out a pragmatic course of economic recovery that helped Britain to recover from the twin devastations of the Blitz and Sealion.\n\nNow in the wake of the recent uprising, Butler has beaten back the efforts of his despotic and buffoonish rivals as he rose to the highest office of all. But unlike his peers, Butler does not seek to further entrench the BPP in a one-party state. Much the opposite, in fact.\n\nButler remembers the days of British democracy, and after years of waiting, he finally has the chance to bring it back. With the aid of his loyal allies Reginald Maudling and Harold Wilson, he seeks to revive the failing British economy, revitalize the failing welfare state and chart an independent foreign policy alongside its dependable partner, the German Reich. Perhaps one day Britain will be a land of hope and glory once more - a country in which democracy is praised, not rejected. Yet this dream is a brittle one. Butler is no longer a young man, after all, and Britain has not known democracy in years. It remains to be seen whether the lion will roar once again, or whether she will forever be chained to the boot of the eagle."
 
POLITICS_ANDREW_FOUNTAINE_DESC:0 "The vision of a Fascist Britain has been reborn - no longer in the form of the antiquitated, dusty politics held by old men and has-beens, but under the banner of the young and the new. And at the head of that banner is none other than Andrew Fountaine.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic bloodline, Fountaine was always inclined towards reactionary politics - an inclination that drove him to fight under Franco's banner during the Spanish Civil War. It was there that he first saw a glimpse of the might of the Reich's war machine in action. When Britain marched to war against Berlin over Danzig, he did his duty and joined the Royal Navy, but as the Empire was shattered and the Swastika rose across Europe, Fountaine took the choice no patriot would ever wished to; he turned against his family, nation, and duty, laying down his arms to the Reich with nary a protest.\n\nAs a prominent landowner and one of the earliest collaborators, Fountaine rapidly rose through the ranks of the British People's Party. While it seemed that his public disputes with Chesterton may have doomed his career, Chesterton's failure only propelled him onwards to the office of Home Secretary. History repeated when the rebellion spurred on by Knight, traitor that he was, left a vacuum of power - one Fountaine seized with no hesitance. The resistance lies defeated, with their democracy-loving friends next in line to the gallows as a truly fascist Britain begins to take shape.\n\nAs the shadow of fascism is cast across the isles, Fountaine's vision can finally come true. Britain will lives, and march on!"

POLITICS_WILLIAM_JOYCE_DESC:0 "Ask him how he earned his scar, the one that runs from mouth to ear, and he'll tell you that it was a Jewish communist. Ask around, and you'll hear it was a disagreement with an Irish girl. But Joyce has always preferred a dignified story than an ignoble truth.\n\nAn early supporter of British fascism, William Joyce turned to Germany after a falling out with Mosley's BUF. During the war, he served as a radio host, an English-language advocate for the German regime, making him infamously known as the menacing §RLord Haw Haw§!. After the war, he returned briefly to England as a champion of National Socialism. Such was his zeal that he even denounced John Beckett, founder of the British People's Party, for his long-buried Jewish heritage. He spent the next two decades in Germania as Britain's ambassador, exiled by a vengeful Old Guard.\n\nFor Joyce, his ascension after Sealion II is well-deserved compensation. But the title comes hanging upon strings. England's cruel fate is dictated in the backrooms of the Volkshalle. And whenever he speaks, though clothed with power's trappings, everyone knows for whom he's really speaking.\n\n§R"Germany calling, Germany calling, Germany calling..."§!"

ENG_ghosts_of_1956:0 "Ghosts of 1956"
ENG_ghosts_of_1956_desc:0 "Six years. Six years since the Uprising of 1956 wrought disaster and anarchy upon nearly every part of this nation, as the Chesterton Ministry was paralysed under its weight. Fortunately, chaos was met by the combined forces of order, and with the joint push-back from both our army and our German brothers' garrison, the uprising was crushed utterly.\n\nSince then, an uneasy calm has returned to the nation, and the Domvile Ministry's enlightened rule has caused prosperity to return to Britain, BPP membership to increase, and the extreme ideological splits between fascists and non-fascists in our Party to become workable.\n\nHowever, all reports from MI5 indicate the same thing - HMMLR activity is increasing again, and the terrorists are beginning to reemerge in areas where they have not been active since the Uprising. We must not make the mistake Chesterton did, and thus we must begin to take preemptive measures."

ENG_approach_the_hydra:0 "Approach the Hydra"
ENG_approach_the_hydra_desc:0 "Our Party, the BPP, is by all reports not what it once was. Where once there was unity and strength, factionalism and corruption have taken hold. This is entirely intolerable in a time where we will have to pass new measures to deal with the terrorists. The Old Guard, devout supporters of Prime Minister Barry Domvile, still embody the spirit of Britain and can be fully relied on both for loyalty and competence, but they unfortunately no longer hold a majority in the Party.\n\nThe Pragmatists, weak advocates of demagogic rule, led by Rab Butler, will find a way to object to our measures under the grounds of "tyranny", and the Ideologues, ex-communists in a fascist cloak who stand for much the same mob rule that the Pragmatists advocate for, will oppose these measures for no better reason that the Old Guard supports them.\n\nWe must find a remedy to this constant factionalism and create a totally united Party, or else infighting will consume us before HMMLR even gets a chance to."

ENG_fighting_shadows:0 "Fighting Shadows"
ENG_fighting_shadows_desc:0 "It is all well and good to say that we are planning to fight HMMLR, but in truth we do not really know who it is we are fighting. The only HMMLR commanders we know the identities of are Left Resistance leader Jack Jones and SOE leader Fitzroy Maclean - the lower-ranking commanders, and the leader of HMMLR itself, remain unknown to MI5.\n\nWe also have virtually no knowledge of how many terrorists there are - nor do we know what weapons they have access to, or how they plan to use them.\n\nFighting a borderline invisible foe will be extremely difficult, and we must get MI5 to ramp up their investigations into HMMLR if we ever wish to truly defeat them."

ENG_checkin_with_germania:0 "Check-in with Germania"
ENG_checkin_with_germania_desc:0 "While we do not always agree on everything with our German brothers, they did still liberate Britain, and are the unquestioned saviours and masters of Europe. Over the years, the Garrison has become just as active a part of the government as any other, and Plenipotentiary Veesenmayer has been instrumental in our affairs.\n\nFor these reasons, we will functionally need German approval if we wish to push back against HMMLR - especially since we will require the Garrison to assist us with it. Therefore, we will meet with Veesenmayer and Wulf both, and inform them of our new anti-partisan policies and request approval and assistance. It isn't as though they will have any real objections to fighting the terrorists, right?"

ENG_the_lords_approval:0 "The Lords' Approval"
ENG_the_lords_approval_desc:0 "After our German brothers liberated Britain from demagoguery and finance in the World War, one of their first actions was the repeal of the 1911 Parliament Act, which returned to the House of Lords their ancient right - a veto over any and all legislation passed by the Commons. This means that the Freedom and Security Act will require the approval of the Lords in order to pass.\n\nFortunately, the House of Lords is by far the most reasonable and loyal body of government in the United Kingdom. The Old Guard are still dominant there, and Pragmatists and Ideologues alike are pushed to the fringes. As such, it is highly unlikely that they will have any issue with the Act. However in order to make certain of this, the Prime Minister will meet with his old friend, Lord Portsmouth, a devout supporter of the government and the de facto leader of the Old Guard in the House of Lords. With his backing, the Act will certainly pass through the Lords."

ENG_defining_an_enemy_desc:0 "What, exactly, is HMMLR? It is a question that MI5 have been puzzling over for the past few years, and one that is seemingly no closer to being answered. While the official line from our government is that they are blood-thirsty Bolsheviks tied to the trade unions - and in many cases this appears to be true - that is clearly not the full story.\n\nMany HMMLR fighters are clearly members of the old government, with ties to the Exiles, fighting against our King for the pretender Elizabeth, which would suggest that they are not all communist in allegiance.\n\nAnother, far more worrying theory has gained traction in our government. (Although not in MI5, who fully disagree with it.) Many believe that HMMLR is in fact a tool in the hands of high-ranking members of the government, who seek to use it to increase their personal power, a dagger which they could plunge into our backs at any time."

We've managed to track them to the Scottish Highlands where they've been hiding in the mountains for some time now.

The 'Left Resistance' and their leader Jack Jones are the more insidious side of the resistance - they hide in our factories, whispering their honeyed words into the ears of honest workmen, turning them against us.\n\nThis rot goes deep, and if we wish to stand any chance of beating the resistance wholesale, then we must rip their agitators and unsanctioned trade unions out by the root. Thankfully, the Gestapo have proven more than eager to aid us in this endeavour.

This individual is undoubtedly the head of the snake - and we know them as 'The Boss.'\n\nDespite our best efforts, we have been able to uncover literally nothing about 'The Boss.' He - or even possibly she, for that matter - is a nigh-mythical figure within the resistance. Despite this, next to nobody has ever spoken to the man, and his identity is unknown to anyone - save for perhaps the Terrible Twins. Whoever it is, they are doubtlessly a mastermind of the highest order to help keep the resistance alive after all these years.\n\nThis is, of course, assuming that The Boss is real. We cannot be too hasty in assuming he is not simply a cover for a series of individuals, or simply a story.

We have been far too tolerant and careful in dealing with the rebels still scurrying across Britain. With the momentum the resistance appears to have been gaining as of late, it is frighteningly plausible to suggest that another mass revolt may soon be on its way.

Let them sleep soundly in their silken sheets, assured that the big bad resistance no longer poses any threat to this lifestyle and never will again. It makes our job so much easier.\n\nThat treacherous weasel Domvile and all of his friends may now feel they have bested us. Perhaps they even feel as if they have struck some decisive blow, putting an end to this chapter in their history. How very wrong they are. This has been a misstep of the highest order on their part, and it is one mistake that will come back to bite.\n\nThey will never win. There will always be a Britain, and Britain shall be free.

As 1962 dawns, it seems that we are set for much of the same. However, perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel - the passage of the FSA will surely put an end to one of our woes in the resistance, at least. Perhaps this year will be different."

Since the war's end and the birth of the new Britain, Lord Portsmouth has been a key member of the Bedford, Chesterton and now Domvile ministries, and has come to act as the deputy leader of Domvile's own "Old Guard" faction.

While convincing him will be a great task due to our government requiring backing from those very same corporations, it must be done. Ultimately, while the profiteering corporations may well be outraged, the German government itself may well be convinced of the righteousness of our cause, and allow these measures to be passed with the same spirit that led to the repeal of the Parliament Act."

Unfortunately, Wallop is well aware that many landowners have forgotten their duties, and will happily allow the corporations to operate on their lands for a cut.

These men who prioritise the coin over all else callously poison the land, building sprawling factories housing across once beautiful land - and this is to say nothing of the damage wrought by the bombings.\n\nThankfully, there are many in the government who are both conscientious of nature's importance and willing to defend it. Wallop himself was one of the founding members of the organicist Kinship for Husbandry during the war - it was here that he met several dedicated men and women who shared the belief that Britain's natural beauty must be protected.

It is a shame that such a great man, who in many ways built the state we inhabit today, has fallen into obscurity after 7 years as Prime Minister, with only loyal friends such as Lord Portsmouth bothering to heed his counsel on the running of Britain today.\n\nBut of the two, Chesterton has fared far worse. Once, he was at the very apex of British Fascism, commanding the BPP as it marched forwards to forge a truly Fascist state on the foundations Bedford left us. Alas, how cruel fate can be, for Chesterton was brought down before his time by the combined force of treason without and treachery within, daggers plunged deep into his back by the Uprising of '56 and Andrew Fountaine's backbench revolt.\n\nDespite this, these men remain our most experienced and venerable veterans.

Our Old Guard core remains the dominant bloc, but to secure that position we must court susceptible Crossbenchers and continue to spread the wisdom of British Fascism within the Peerage.

The Old Guard is still on shakier ground than our rivals, the Germans continue to reave as they wish across our countryside, and the matter of inactive, apathetic peers remains unresolved.

In recent years, they have proposed measures to offer a more even, fair handed style of governance.

In response to such a problem, the government's answer was simple, put the women to work. Whilst we may have lost that war, the idea itself is perfectly sound. We may face some opposition from the traditionalists in government, but simply showcasing the dire straits of our situation and reminding them of their fate if we lose the war will be enough to shut them up.\n\nSo as the men go off to war, the women shall enter the workforce. All must work to keep our government afloat or anarchy will rage Britain once more."

Once Germany faced the exact same crisis we do, their workforce out fighting in Russia and Western Europe and thus unable to produce the arms necessary for War. How did solve this? By putting their military prisoners and undesirables to work, and well, it worked. The German economy outproduced us and we were swiftly conquered by their well-trained, well-equipped military.\n\nNow, we must learn from their success and use our own prisoners to fill in the labour gap. Whilst we may have moral considerations over such a solution, it is a method proven to work. To save Britain, we must use all means at our disposal to win."

Because we possess this advantage - however fleeting it may be - it is important that we don't waste it.

Our rifles have played conquests across the world, aiding us from our earliest days in the American continent to our easy conquests in Africa. They have been heralded as great for centuries, and their quality has not weighed even if the status of Britain has. Yet their greatest weakness has always been in time and materials needed to construct them. Once, when we the master of the world, we could afford such time and materials, yet the Britain of today does not possess such luxury. Thus we will simplify, though they might be of lower quality, more guns will be produced to arm our new soldiers. On the battlefield, a quickly made gun is better than no gun at all."

The British Free Corps, led by Thomas Haller-Cooper, is the largest quasi-paramilitary group in the country, under the supervision of the German Police and more importantly the SS. In the wake of the civil war, they have risen quickly in prominence as one of the key loyalist forces. In response to this, we must finalise our policy on corps, and have a serious discussion of whether to give this organization more support in the battle against the rebels.\n\nOn one hand, they are a group of extremists, possessing a mob-like mentality and led by an utter lunatic; in addition, we should keep in mind that inviting a paramilitary group with no government oversight, that only answers to Germania could have unforeseen consequences if they got out of control. On the other hand, the amount of manpower and arms the organization has could give us the upper hand in the war. The choice is ours, the consequences ours to face."

We cannot in good faith give the BFC more power than they already have and evolve beyond a paramilitary force. Whilst we cannot erode their power entirely, in fears of angering the Reich, we have decided for the good of the country to diminish their power, granting them say over occupied territory.\n\nJordan is unstable, a radical even by the SS's standards, and an ever-present threat to our rule. Heavens know what could happen if we grant the fool more power. We must instead look elsewhere for support, and in time, hopefully, the BFC shall be made irrelevant.

Despite our enemy's many advantages, our government has withstood the tests of the past few months and remains to stand, bruised but not broken. Now that winter has passed and spring is rapidly approaching, we will make new strategies to combat the enemy and recapture our lost land.

Luckily for us, we have the perfect man - one who is all too happy to take up the task of using his connections within the party's lower ranks and civil service to assemble a team of agriculturalists to draft our own counter proposals. Harold Wilson, the upstart that he is, will be delighted to take leadership of the Department of Agriculture, so we may tear the Lords from Wallop by the root.\n\nHowever, we must be wary of tethering ourselves too closely to this snake charmer.

Simply put, we're going to subject this detestable Duke to the oldest trick in the book. A good old-fashioned stitch-up.

When the time comes we will remind these lesser peoples of their place.

Of course it is, and like Domvile before him, Lord Portsmouth performs this task with excellence.

These men who prioritise the coin over all else callously poison the land, building sprawling factories housing across once beautiful land - and this is to say nothing of the damage wrought by the bombings.\n\nThankfully, there are many in the government who are both conscientious of nature's importance and willing to defend it. Wallop himself was one of the founding members of the organicist Kinship for Husbandry during the war - it was here that he met several dedicated men and women who shared the belief that Britain's natural beauty must be protected.

Wallop will make sure to meet with the new Archbishop of Canterbury in order to make clear his plans for the special relationship between the Church and his government, and he will also make clear that he wishes to see some cleaning up in the Church, as some godless souls have unfortunately slipped through the net and hold high positions there."

britain_intros.1.t:0 "For Need"
britain_intros.1.d:0 "Chancellor of the Exchequer was hardly an enviable position, even in times of prosperity. Yet Richard Austen 'Rab' Butler was neither foolish nor unpopular if he did say so himself; saddled with a state scarred by war wherein corruption was commonplace, he had kept the economy steady and helped rebuild Britain from the destitution of the 1940s. Yet despite all of his achievements, every so often Butler couldn't help but look back with fondness to the 30s when he worked for an independent, free Britain. He had been a young minister then, yet they were perhaps the only times in his career that he felt free, without regret. But then came Hitler, and it had all came crashing down.\n\nButler did not consider himself a coward, nor any of his contemporaries in the foreign office in the 30s. While men like Churchill baited for war, men like Chamberlain fought for peace. Butler had not fought in the Great War, but he had seen the effect it had had on the British people. Entire towns had been decimated, their male population wiped out in a single afternoon. For that reason, he had sided with Chamberlain and fought to keep the boys safe this time. But it was all for nought. War came, and the graves of England were filled once again.\n\nChamberlain and all the others were gone now too, either dead or having fled across the Atlantic - more than likely cursing him as a coward and a traitor nightly. He was alone, surrounded by sycophants, fascists and fools, left to somehow rebuild a broken isle. More than once he had considered getting on a ship and leaving this godforsaken isle, to leave the fascists to collapse under the weight of their own incompetence. But it was a fool's dream. He had made his bed now, built upon the corpses of the innocent, all he could do now was to make this New Britain as free and prosperous as the Germans would allow."

britain_intros.2.t:0 "For Right"
britain_intros.2.d:0 "Of all the myriad social events and activities Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth, frequently attended, the King's evening reception at Buckingham Palace was by far the most important and the most enjoyable. Surrounded by righteous men of the peerage, esteemed Knights and Dames, and of course His Majesty himself, it truly was perfection.\n\nNothing like the weeping ruin that was Parliament these days, stuffed with money-hungry German stooges, thuggish louts and lying socialists. It had fallen so very far from the initial days of glory when he stood by Bedford's side as the BPP swept to power, now only a handful remained true to the vision they set out with in 1945, and their number dwindled daily.\n\nPlucking a glass of champagne from a roving waiter, Wallop deftly navigated through the packed ballroom. Exchanging smiles and quick conversations with old friends whilst pretending not to notice his enemies, especially the ever-arrogant Germans and that infernal Veesenmayer. Why the King even invited them in the first place was beyond him.\n\nSoon, one of Bedford's ministers, awarded a Barony for his service, approached Lord Portsmouth. Wallop's initial enjoyment of their discourse started to sour, however, as it became quickly clear the ex-Minister was approaching him not as an independent player in the game of British politics, but merely as the leading representative of the Old Guard.\n\nOne excuse later and Wallop was free of the man, sighing in relief. Whilst he was a firm supporter of Domvile's and agreed with the Old Guard in many places, he despised that his own ideas and ambitions were being crushed under the monolithic weight of British Fascism. Quite how he could escape from under it however, remained unanswered, to say nothing of reaching Downing Street in the first place. At that moment however, His Majesty King Edward VIII entered the ballroom, and all gloomy thoughts of politics vanished in an instant."

britain_intros.3.t:0 "For Strength"
britain_intros.3.d:0 "Whenever Andrew Fountaine stood to speak in the House of Commons, everyone had something to say. Whether it was a roar of disdain or a cry of adoration, the man's presence was simply too encompassing to ignore. He knew and encouraged this, of course - he was an ideologue in the purest sense of the word, and such intense emotion was what he needed to succeed. Today, he was to deliver a speech condemning the resistance and to encourage the party to come together. As if. The Old Guard were practically irrelevant and the Pragmatists would do everything they could to weaken the nation from within.\n\nAs he stood, his supporters cheered. Soaking in the adulation for a moment, Fountaine cleared his throat. "Mr. Speaker, with the recent lull in resistance activity, it would perhaps be easy to rest upon our laurels. To allow the fire within ourselves to die down, so to speak. This cannot be allowed to happen. I would remind this House that our enemies are many and they suffuse every aspect of our society. If we wish for the Fascist revolution to survive and continue, then we must act!" A series of jeers and hollers came from the Pragmatists. Good.\n\nHe continued. "Now, while the enemy without is very nearly stamped out for good, I would advise all of those good and true members of this House to keep constant vigilance for the enemy within, for they are amongst the most insidious of our foes!" More jeers from the Pragmatists were drowned out by his own supporters. Of course, neither side knew that the resistance was nowhere near entirely scattered yet, but they did not need to. As long as they took his words to heart and did not question them, he was satisfied. Britain was on the precipice of a new age, and Andrew Fountaine would be at the head of it."
britain_intros.3.a:0 "Is this a Blackshirt rally or a governmental building?"

britain_intros.4.t:0 "The Brown Seneschal"
britain_intros.4.d:0 "Like all good National Socialists, Edmund Veesenmayer felt a cold chill run down his spine the moment he heard that Hitler had been struck. Images of the worst case scenario appeared in his head - the fatherland burning to ash as it was overrun by liberal Judeo-Bolsheviks, whilst he was trapped here, powerless to help stop it. Thankfully, the Führer had survived, and such an event had not come to pass. Nodding at the two men who had brought him this news, he walked shakily back to his desk. Much was on the mind of the plenipotentiary of the Reich to Britain.\n\nHe had spent seven years of his life on this island. Seven long, unforgiving years, that he had spent dealing with the whims and tantrums of these stupid people. The mighty German Garrison had thrown everything it had alongside their puppets in Downing Street to squash the Jewish rats opposing the Reich, and Veesenmayer had been there all the way. It was a harsh and unforgiving job - he wished more than anything to be given the order to simply set Wulf and Wigan's upon anyone even remotely treacherous, so that he could deliver Britain entirely into the Reich's hands.\n\nHe frowned. The Reich itself was starting to buckle. He made it his business to keep up to date with what was happening in the fatherland, and the news he received was almost always negative. Students running amok, the Führer's evil advisors jockeying for power, the butchers under Heydrich growing ever-stronger. If such things continued to happen, and - god forbid - the Führer were to die, then the Reich would be plunged into chaos. What would that mean for Britain? Would the Jew prevail in the end?\n\nNo. It couldn't be so. He shook his head, steeling himself. He would keep Britain very, very close to the Reich. Whether she wanted to be kept in a golden cage or dragged in chains, it mattered little to Veesenmayer. He had almost been doing this for a decade already. May as well finish the job."

britain_intros.5.t:0 "The Queen's PM"
britain_intros.5.d:0 "A vain man is not something many would describe Harold Macmillan as. The nigh-Edwardian sensibility of the old man prevented such a thing. Yet, as he sat in his office listening to the words that he had spoken only hours earlier through the radio, he could not help but berate himself for such an indulgence. "...and now, in these hours darker than ever, we can only keep steady and brace ourselves for what may hopefully be the sunlight, shining through the clouds. Thank you. God save the Queen." The fuzzy sound of applause followed. "And that was Harold Macmillan, Leader of the Conservative Party in exile speaking at the annual Commonwealth Conference," supplied a rather nasally commentator. "This has been the third such speech that Mr. Macmillan has made on the topic of the British government in the last five months. Our sources have no-"\n\nThe presenter was quickly silenced as Macmillan switched off the radio. Did they truly see him as nought but a desperate, aimless old man with nothing better to do than whittle on about the same old injustices ad nauseum? He sighed at the thought. Perhaps they were right. He was king of the exiles, after all. There had been hope at the start - he remembered the righteous, burning anger that each and every Englishman worth his salt felt at their beloved nation being invaded by the Nazi scum. He remembered the fire in the eyes of every one of his fellow MPs that sought to reclaim their birthright, and to see the collaborator dogs flung in jail for their crimes. And by god, what he would give to give that to them.\n\nAnd yet, as the years drew on, that fire dimmed. None of them grew any happier with the situation, but some amongst them simply felt that there was nothing more that could be done to save their country. There had been some hope for change in the 50s, when the fascist idiots inevitably tied themselves into one too many knots, but that was only temporary. When it appeared that the situation had begun to stabilise, the malaise of the exiles got even worse. Sometimes even he began to wonder - was it all worth it?\n\nMacmillan shook his head, getting up from his chair and walking over to the cabinet he kept in the corner of the room. He pulled out a large bottle of brandy and poured himself a small glass of it - by no means did he drink as much as Churchill did. He sipped it gently, letting the bitter drink sting his tongue. He had to keep going. The Conservatives had to keep going. They would all keep going until the homeland was inevitably won back, where both he and his party would finally be able to redeem themselves."
britain_intros.5.a:0 "For Queen and Country."

britain_intros.6.t:0 "The Modern Cato"
britain_intros.6.d:0 "Across all of Britain, on factory floors to old ramshackle houses, the people go quiet, just for an hour, as so many of them listen anxiously on their battered radios; for it is at this time, every Tuesday at 19:00 proto, a broadcast goes out. It speaks of the tireless work of Britons standing up to fascism, of working past the failures of old tired men, and of a new better Britain emerging from the ashes, one not tied down by its failings, but pushed forward by its people.\n\nThat broadcast did come from Britain, it was not from an old resistance general, nor an old politician from the war. In fact, it was given by an asthmatic former journalist, the man who now stands as the head of the exiled Labour Party, Michael Foot. As he finishes his broadcast each week, he could not help but feel a tinge of guilt, for hiding away in Canada, while the brave resistance members continued to fight.\n\nFoot had risen to lead the Labour Party in exile mainly because very few wanted the role, so many of his exiles had given up, after the failures of the 50s, and had simply given up hope for a free Britain. The long wait had destroyed so many exiles' hopes for a better Britain, hopes of the liberation of the Old World. Yet, Foot, even in his darkest days when he heard Beaverbrook, his old mentor had died, never really gave up hope. How could he give up faith when so many Britons continued to fight, to die against the tyranny of the BPP and their Nazi puppet masters? His peers call him a fool, a hopeless romantic, for continuing to dream of a free Britain, but he has faith. History has shown that tyranny does not prosper forever, all great dictators eventually fall to the will of the people. When that day comes, when Britain is finally liberated, it will finally be Foot's time to work for the people of Britain, to repay his everlasting debt to all those who have died, and those who continue to fight, to create a New Jerusalem from the ashes of fascism."

britain_intros.7.t:0 "The Red Bane"
britain_intros.7.d:0 "                    CONFIDENTIAL FILES-FOR CABINET ONLY\n\nSince the conclusion of hostilities in Britain, a large portion of the post war resistance has been made up of the so called 'left resistance' remnants of old soldiers, leftist dissidents and Unions. Despite our efforts to appease and break the unions, they have remained a prominent breeding ground for Bolshevik terrorists, and act a key organisations within the resistance body. Since the seeming disappearance, and suspected death of Ernest Bevin, a previously unknown figure, Jack Jones has stepped up to lead this sect of HMMLR.\n\nLittle is known of Jones early life, bar his past as a Liverpool Docker and shop steward yet it seems he gained his Bolshevism early on, joining unions during this period and acting as a spokesperson for Socialism. It even seems as if, according to reports from Blackshirts at the time, he has been a long enemy to us, acting as an early opponent to fascism, apparently fighting during many of Mosely's rallies. According to one report from a former Blackshirt, he helped rally organised protest-meetings against the fascists in Liverpool, and was beaten up by a group of Blackshirts armed with knuckle-dusters.\n\nOur next reports of him comes from the first victory for fascism of the 30s, the Spanish civil war in which he continued his misguided crusade, fighting in the international brigades against the Nationalist government, most likely fighting in the "Abraham Lincoln" XV International Brigade. It is from this conflict that our last photo of the man comes from (found on page 5), being taken as part of the records from the army. Our Intel for this originates from German intelligence, who Scavenged from the ruins of the Kremlin, within the records kept on international allies. Unfortunately, most of the file on him was lost in the battle of Moscow.\n\nNot much is known of him from this point until the late 50s, where he seems to mysteriously reappear as the leader of the left resistance. It is my opinion that killing Jack Jones should not be a priority of the government, for the man himself is not the cause of our issue, we should instead seek to root out the infrastructure surrounding the unions leaving them unable to organise. With this, the serpent will be unable to regrow, and we can move to crushing the body once and for all."

britain_intros.8.t:0 "Bonnie Prince Charlie"
britain_intros.8.d:0 "                    CONFIDENTIAL FILES-FOR CABINET ONLY\n\nSince its formation by the Wartime Government, the SOE has acted as a permeant thorn in the German Reich, continuing their activities against the Postwar government. Unlike their left resistance counterparts, the SOE is seemingly a small, highly professional organisation, consisting mainly of former soldiers from the war. First commanded by David Stirling (Profile can be found on page 16), the role as commander has been taken up by Sir Fitzroy Hew Royle Maclean, a clansman out of his depth.\n\nBorn to Major Charles Wilberforce Maclean in Cairo, he was descended from the Macleans of Ardgour, a sept of clan Maclean. He was brought up in Italy, going on to be educated at Eton and Cambridge, finishing his studying in Germany before going onto join the diplomatic service, posted to Moscow in 1937. Maclean was present for much of the failures of the Judeo Bolshevik regime, seeing the economic failures of Bukharin first hand, as well is meeting with numerous Communist figures during this period; Maclean was able to travel the union extensively. It is rumoured by some German sources that Macleon made a few key contacts during this period.\n\nOnce War broke out, Maclean resigned from the service to join the military, serving with distinction in North Africa in some of the first actions of the SAS in 1942, later effectively crushing the German network in Persia. He would be chosen by Churchill himself to lead a liaison mission to Yugoslavia in 1943, linking up with the Bolshevik partisans led by Joseph Broz Tito. Not much is known of their relationship, but records from Italian, Croatian and German troops in the region seem to suggest that he took part in Partisan activities, seemingly learning from their techniques. From this point on, records seem to imply that he left in early 1945, yet instead of going into exile, it seems he returned to Isles, joining the SOE under Stirling.\n\nSince taking over the SOE, he has seemingly learnt from Tito's own partisan strategy (whose summary can be seen on page 8) Maclean has shifted the SOE strategy from Stirling's 'mad bomber' attitude to a protected warfare strategy to maintain SOE's strength in the long term."

He had been called into a meeting room, alongside three of the other newer members. A funny looking man with a thin, white moustache sat at the head of the table, which itself was occupied by several other older men. Martin recognised the man as none other than Harold Wilson. He nearly frowned upon seeing the man. Many in the family spoke of how he was far too left-wing, despite being so high up in the BPP.\n\nWilson smiled at them. "Fresh blood, I see. Come in, please, sit. We were just about to start." Martin nodded, assuming that Wilson would be handing the stage over to one of the other civil servants so that they could chair the meeting. But what happened next shocked him. "Alright then, gentlemen, let's get started. It's been a hard couple of months for everyone here, and it will only get harder with the workers getting agitated. However, we cannot stand to let standards slip and fall behind us. I believe you had a plan, Colin?"\n\nMartin blinked. He and the other civil servants in the room had only just sat down, yet Wilson seemed to have taken the executive decision to chair the meeting. The junior civil servant almost scoffed. The other men in the room were several times his senior. Surely, they would soon remind him of his place. Instead, he was shocked as the man Wilson addressed nodded his head respectfully, going into detail.\n\nHe was in shock. Wilson was able to simply get away with this. How? Martin's shock only worsened as Wilson asked for a copy of the Fisher Report - something even Martin knew was above his station. And yet, another of the men whipped a copy out and gave it to him. The entire meeting, he moved them around like puppets. By the time it ended, Martin was almost catatonic as Wilson opened the door, and they all followed behind him."

Amongst these pencil pushers, conmen, and swindlers, however, sat a figure who was larger than life.\n\nSitting on the central table right next to Hermann Josef Abs of all people was a large, stocky man with slicked back hair and a pair of square horn-rimmed glasses. This was Reginald Maudling, Rab Butler's right hand and a rising star in the BPP. He was chatting animatedly to the magnate, his piggish eyes laser-focused on the man.\n\n"...So as I said, Herr Abs, it is a fallacy to support Fountaine. His ideology is entirely based upon anti-growth protectionist nonsense, which would frankly be abysmal for business. Don't you agree?" the other man nodded.\n\n"I must say, Herr Maudling, you do seem very much in favour of Mr. Butler's policies. But is he not perhaps rather... old?"\n\nMaudling chuckled - a low, brassy thing - and took another sip of his brandy. "Well, we all get old, don't we everyone?" he said to the onlookers, who all politely chuckled alongside him. With a twinkle in his eye, Maudling slapped Abs on the back, as if he was an old friend and not one of the most powerful men in Europe. "Let's just say that even if Butler is old... well, he has good taste in friends. I'm sure whoever he picks will be... satisfactory, so to speak.""

For him, the only solution lay in the past, in the face of the Great Martyr of Fascism, Oswald Mosley, shot by the cowardly and treasonous government as the Germans made landfall. They thought that his death would snuff out the fire he lighted long ago, but to their dismay, the fire grew and engulfed them, purging Britain of its rotten "democracy" and the parasites that subsisted on it.\n\nFlipping over another page, Jeffrey let his thoughts subside for a moment, it was true, fascism had finally come to Britain, and it had come quicker than he expected, yet he still couldn't see the people in charge as anything other than opportunistic hawks unable to do anything but steer his nation to fruitless paths, it was no coincidence to him that as the government strayed ever further from Mosley's vision, the more problems seemed to arise. But hope was not lost, as Hamm knew the only way for orthodoxy to be restored, and that was through Andrew Fountaine, the charismatic rising ideologue among a party of conservative leftovers and indecisive moderates, through him he could finally implement his uncompromised vision.\n\nHe allowed himself a moment of rest and looked up to gaze at his modest office, above the door leading to the rest of the building, there was a hanging portrait of Oswald Mosley, Jeffrey allowed himself to drift looking at the ageless features and the immaculate suit of his martyred leader. In a few moments, he was back in the packed halls where Mosley would give his grand speeches, he remembered how the crowds would roar and hang from his every word, how through only gesture and tongue he could command the crowd like Neptune commanded the sea. But those halls were empty now, and the voices had long since stopped echoing. To him, there was no life before the BUF, and now that party had long been disbanded and left to the annals of history, there was little to do but fight to keep the flame alive so that it may one day light up the whole world."

It really was ever so petty.\n\nAs Prime Minister Domvile finished his speech, Birdwood joined in the applause, some measure for more German investment, no doubt proposed by that little rat Butler who was sitting next to the PM. The House of Commons was simply too... Common, for a woman like her. It had been all so wonderful when she was elected in 1953, getting to meet such titans like Chesterton and Domvile, back when the proper sort of people still held dominance in both Houses. And then it had all come tumbling down.\n\nFountaine. The name echoed venomously through her mind when she saw the traitor stand to give a speech of his own. It was men like him and Butler, along with their packs of cretins, who dominated the Commons. Most of her old friends had either moved up to The Lords or simply died. Now, it was just her and a small clique around Domvile left.\n\nWhen the time came to vote for the bill, Lady Birdwood dutifully walked into the "Aye" lobby, along with nearly the entire House. It was her duty as Education Minister after all, even if she was surrounded by these leeches, and she still clung to hope that one day, the Old Guard would take back what was rightfully theirs and regain control of Parliament. Until that day, however, she would keep on as ever, voting as she was meant to and save her biting criticisms for private discussions in the lounges."

These parties were their lifeblood in more ways than one, integral for the intricate system of patronage core to the faction's health, but also a nostalgic display of Britain's glory days. Here, in these gilded halls, the fantasy of a Fascist empire ruling the waves in perpetuity seemed almost real enough to hold.\n\nDrifting deftly through the crowd, Lady Birdwood soon caught sight of her target. The Foreign Secretary, Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brockett. Her fellow cabinet member was deep in conversation with a pair of backbench MPs whom she recognised as old ministers from Chesterton's ill-fated Ministry, nothing too important she would be interrupting then.\n\n"Ronald! I didn't know you were coming tonight, it's like you practically live at the Foreign Office these days!" She said, Nall-Cain's smile informing her she'd been correct in assessing the importance of the previous conversation.\n\n"Lady Birdwood! Always delightful to see you outside of work, I do apologise for being so tied-up in things lately, Barry's taking the recent attacks very seriously and has me in constant meetings with our German friends on security matters. Not to mention Gerard's agitating about the corporations again." He replied, picking a glass of champagne off a roving tray.\n\n"Does he now?

The other paramilitaries quickly formed a shield of sorts around the group of harassed fascist MPs, protecting them from the projectiles hurled across the Thames from Westminster bridge by the rioters.\n\nAlmost running to the nearest entrance to Parliament now, held open by terrified clerks like the portcullis of a besieged fortress, Birdwood struggled not to scream.

It took everything she had for Birdwood to not fall to her knees in sheer relief.\n\n"Minister Birdwood! I need a moment to talk."

The Old Guard would see it done, and she would be the one to present its successes and cover up its failures to the world.\n\nBut there was even more to it than that. The power dynamics of the BPP had dramatically shifted once more, and she found herself as a key card in Chesterton's deck. Whilst the unity of the government was assured given the very nature of its composition, the details of their plans still had to be filled in, and any of the three new cliques within the Old Guard could be holding the pen.\n\nThat however, was for the future. Opening up her new ministerial box and getting to work, Birdwood's first order of business would be a trip to Germany to lay the foundations for the future equal partnership the Old Guard envisioned. Calling in her private secretary, she began to dictate a telegram to the British embassy in Germania to start preparations for her trip."

Yet now, it plays host to a cabal of fascists, traitors and cowards - easily Britain's most despised Cabinet, and led by a man who is the worst of the lot - Prime Minister Barry Domvile, the arch-traitor.\n\nToday, he was meeting with Maxwell Knight, the head of MI5, about the ongoing rebel activity throughout the nation.\n\n"So, Mr Knight, I expect a full analysis of these "Terrible Twins", their goals, and what forces they can call upon to upset order."\n\n"Of course - we have already been gathering intelligence on these two men, and once we have gathered enough we will prepare a full report on each."\n\n"Excellent. There is another matter, as well. I've heard rumours that these two men are coordinating together, and are being led by some sort of go-between who is taking charge of a united resistance command."\n\nKnight jerked involuntarily at that, and then recovered, responding quickly with, "That would be highly unlikely in my view, sir. One of the Twins is a known Bolshevik, whereas the other is a supporter of the Exiles over in Canada. I don't believe that they would have either the mental capacity or the political will to be collaborating with each other."\n\nDomvile eventually nodded in agreement, and Knight went off to prepare his report."

Though the highlands still acts as a hotbed of resistance, the mountains serving as the perfect hiding places for the resistance, the southern regions have remained stable.\n\nThe most noteworthy activity this month was in Glasgow, where a cell of SOE members seemed to have been attempting to disrupt an arms shipment, en route to Glasgow from a factory down south. Though they successfully stopped the shipment, the extra squad I recommended on the shipment seemed to have caught them off guard, leading to a quick retreat by the forces. From here, the squad was whittled away as they fled through the city, eventually holding up in a pub near the centre of the town. Inside the building was the owner of the pub, alongside several patrons of the establishment, all of whom were seemingly taken as hostages by the four remaining terrorists. Luckily, however, thanks to the brave actions of a certain Sergeant Thomas, the terrorists were shot dead with no civilian casualties.\n\nMy recommendations are thus continue our current approach, which seems to be working at stabilising the region. The carrot and stick method appears to be successful, as the population warms to our presence while resistance activity in the regions steadily decreases. In time, the south will be stable enough to act as a launching pad, from which we can route the SOE out of the hills once and for all."

With their shared passion and revolutionary fervour, they had decided to join the "Workers Armed Forces", a small Trotskyist sect which belonged to the fast network of the British resistance.\n\nThe couple took their new affiliation in stride. They organised clandestinely among Newcastle university, they had co-written propaganda, and had even constructed a small bomb to use against their local police depot. Although these actions would draw them great respect from their comrades, it drew the ire of the state in equal measure.During the small hours of the morning, whilst they were asleep in each other's embrace, they had been apprehended by officers of MI5, and were drawn up on charges of sedition against the crown and England."

They hadn't attacked yet, however, and frankly, he was among those willing to bash a few heads if some of the pigs had gotten any ideas.\n\nWhat he hadn't expected was the balding pudgy stooge of the arch-traitor emerging from behind the police line. He waved off a few attempts to follow him, going alone through the crowd. With confidence that he wouldn't be attacked... Of course not, the man didn't have anyone defending him, but the government would hunt every last one of them down if they laid a finger on him.\n\nButler tried to walk confidently, but Phillips could see the bead of sweat on his person as he walked up. The man was nervous, scared even. Hesitantly, he grabbed the man's hand, and gave it a firm grip. Start off strong.\n\nTo the toad's credit, he got straight to the point. "I will concede we've failed in our duties to you. But tell us what we can do now to make it right." Now it was Phillips caught off guard. If there was a time to give a list of grievances it was now. "For starters, the rate of work has been getting more and more intense. We're expected to work ourselves to the bone, for barely a fraction of the pay our fathers would have received. Our working conditions are shite as well, the boss wishes he had bought slaves and instead he's trying to turn us into slaves."\n\nA simple nod from him. "Tell me everything." Slowly, over the course of a long conversation, and solution-oriented suggestions from both parties, the strikers and the BPP built a comprehensive list of workplace reforms. All that remained at the end, was Butler presenting it to Domvile, in such a way as to make the BPP look like saviours, rather than capitulators."

domvile_flavour.10.d:0 "Gas. Fire. Screams. The police had come in suddenly, without any sign, simply a declaration of restoring order to the city. Many workers, some being grim radicals, other angry youths, plenty had fought. Madison thought he was one of those youths too, he stood with them at first.\n\nThen that white gas started flooding them. The crowd scattered, police charged in with batons, beating them, and bloodying others. He could see several of them bleeding out on the ground, their skulls colliding with the pavement, as their bodies were walked over in the assault. His line had broken, and he along with them, turning around as the police charged in, bloodlust in their eyes.\n\nThe strike had devolved from an orderly protest into a chaotic riot. Sometimes the strikers would catch a cop out of formation and beat him with all the strength they could muster before they too were struck down by further police. Those who had fortified themselves would find themselves choking on the gas. Some had broken lines by throwing Zhdanov cocktails, while others had stubbornly planted themselves to buy time for the others to escape. By the time the strike has been broken, several people had died.\n\nMadison couldn't stick around, but the screams stayed in his mind. As he ran as fast as he could. He could still hear them. And as he ran, though he was terrified, he could feel something else as well. A seething, dark, RIGHTEOUS hatred of the police. Of the Bourgeoisie. Most of all the Prime Minister and his party of snakes. He wouldn't return home, the police would certainly search it for stragglers. No, he had another place in mind... In hushed tones and corners of the factory, they spoke of it. A recruiting station for those sick of the BPP. For those who wished for revolution."

domvile_flavour.11.t:0 "A Crowned, Caged Bird"
domvile_flavour.11.d:0 "He should be smiling, Edward, King of the United Kingdom, thought, as he stared down at his half-empty Champagne glass. He had his beautiful wife by his side, all the drinks a party could ask for, and the highest lords in Britain. And yet, Edward couldn't help but feel an emptiness in his stomach. He looked at the wall, where a painting of his father sat, from the height of his reign at the end of the Great War and the zenith of the Empire. His father had been a great King, leading the Empire through the turmoil of the War and the post-war years. Calm and serious, he had been truly dedicated to the crown, Albert had been just like him.\n\nAlbert, he'd always been his father's son, as dedicated to the crown as George had been. He had not heard from any of his brothers since 1944, he had not heard Henry laugh, and John and George had been taken far too soon, and little stuttering Albert, so stern and weighed down by responsibility. He was the better King in the end, a serious, caring man, a King perfect for the war.\n\nOh, the war, the infernal war; it was a war wanted by nobody but the militarists within the cabinet, all so eager to draw Britain towards another bloodbath. He had seen the carnage of the First World War, all those young boys marching pointlessly to their deaths, mowed down in the prime of their youth. Besides, Hitler was not that bad of a chap, and time after time offered Britain fair peace deals, yet the war went on. In the end, the war had dragged to its fated conclusion, and the isles faced the rages of war on its land. Wasn't that why he had taken the crown, to stop unneeded bloodshed from occurring?\n\nA voice sprung him from his reflection, "Eddy, come on you haven't finished your first drink yet". He looked up at his wife, dressed in the most fashionable clothes of the season. Oh, Wallis, perhaps all this suffering was worth it to see you on the throne, a place denied to you for such unjust reasons. Yet as he stared across the drab London skyline, inside a cage of his own making, only one thing came to mind..."

domvile_flavour.12.t:0 "The Vanity of Nations"
domvile_flavour.12.d:0 ""What in God's name is happening down there!?" Domvile was apoplectic with rage. "Everything was going fine, the streets were calm, the next day and apparently the streets are flooded with protests! And why do I see Labour banners being flown all over?" Butler, thankless job that he had simply had to work to calm down the Prime Minister. "I understand, I've already sent out men to see what is happening. Despite all the grandstanding, it seems to be a labour dispute."\n\nDomvile took a long and heavy sigh. He really was so tired these days. "Butler. Hand me the report on their demands, let us read through them." And so it was, Domvile looked upon these demands. Utterly unreasonable, but not so beyond the pale that a compromise was impossible... The best way to get them to moderate their demands was then... "I'll go in myself and talk to them. Surely the Prime Minister himself answering a strike will encourage them to negotiate."\n\nButler privately cursed himself for his sloppiness. He had redacted the several insults and frankly aimless calls for a new government from the protests. Any mention of those being shouted out by the strike leaders would surely have brought down the hammer upon them. And yet now leaving them out gave this man the impression that they had anything but hatred for the BPP. He wasn't willing to take a chance that Domvile could convince them to stand down. He'd be lucky to get a word over them.\n\n"Mr. Domvile, please allow me to go. I've had plenty of time dealing with the rabble. I'm sure I could convince them to moderate their demands. A leader like yourself going would only embolden them to demand more." Domvile looked at Butler with a raised eyebrow. Butler could only hope it meant he was considering his words."

domvile_flavour.13.t:0 "The Old Admiral"
domvile_flavour.13.d:0 "Sometimes, it felt like Barry Domvile never got a moment's peace. His life seemed to be a revolving door of reports, issues, dinner meetings, and bad news. He had supposed that this was what he was signing up for when he became Prime Minister and had long since come to terms with it, of course, but even so. It had been so long since he had left the smog-choked streets of London and set out to sea, where his true passions laid. Where he could feel the breeze in his hair, the salt on his tongue... But still, the work carried on. Even into bedtime.\n\nA habit Domvile had long ago acquired was to sift through reports of resistance activities before bed. He had found that if they had increased, somehow, then it set him up with something to deal with the day after. If it had gone down, then he could rest easy knowing that Britain was growing safer under his charge. And thankfully, it was good new tonight. Left Resistance activity had been all but suppressed in East Anglia, and the BFC had pre-emptively stopped an SOE bombing in Lancashire.\n\nA small smile formed on the admiral's wrinkled face. If only every night bought such good news with it - god knows it would do wonders for his health. It wasn't like he was getting any younger, after all. Perhaps after a few more nights like this, then Britain would finally be able to truly embrace Fascism, and he could hand the reigns to some younger, more dynamic figure. Then maybe he could finally set sail once again. Shaking himself out of his stupor. One day, the HMS Domvile would set sail again. For now, he had to finish these reports."

domvile_flavour.14.d:0 "Butler strode into the meeting room smiling at the men sitting around the table. All three were dressed in the traditional robes of their role as Members of the House of Lords. Butler sat down in front of the men with a sigh and stared across at them.\n\n"Good day gentlemen, I think we all know why we're gathered here today. Lord Portsmouth." Butler began the meeting he was in no mood to beat around the proverbial bush and the danger that the man who somehow led the House of Lords represented was one of the largest threats within the government.\n\n"The man is insane; his ideas are deluded." Lord Williams grumbled, the scowl only growing as the conversation contuined. "We'd be more than willing to work with you against that manic if that's what's needed to bring Britain into a secure future." The other lords all nodded as Williams finished. Butler leant back into his seat. Securing the support of the Lords' backbenchers would require a lot more dealing and wrangling. If he managed to secure the support of these three, then his aim of returning Britain to her democratic past would be empowered.\n\n"The road to rebuilding Britain is a long one." Butler began there'd be more wrangling required but this was the beginning of him securing the Lords."

domvile_flavour.15.d:0 "The counter said 4-2 once the match had ended, Liverpool had given a valiant performance after the first two goals by Aston Villa, but they were ultimately defeated near the end with two consecutive goals. Predictably, not everyone was happy about the results, and a series of arguments, shovings and fights broke out between the fans of the two teams, a brawl that would soon spill out of the premises.\n\nHowever, the hooligans would end up having something else to chew upon as a bunch of off duty German Garrison soldiers who were posted outside the stadium as unofficial guards of the whole match attempted to impose order upon the rabble. With batons and military discipline they tried to beat the raging fans into submission, but it soon became apparent that they were outnumbered and faced with a now united front against their very presence. In a short time, the English ceased focusing on beating each other's teeth out of their mouths and began taking notice of the foreigners in their midst.\n\nWith chants of "Fuck off, Germs!" the soldiers were soon forced out of the stadium and into the streets, dragged and beaten bloody by knuckle dusters and crumbled newspapers. People who didn't even watch the match were gathering around and cheering as the whole brawl slowly turned into a roaring anti-German protest, with it reaching the mayor's office before promptly being dispersed by native police forces.\n\nLater, the papers spoke of a "football match gone too far", and how the perpetrators would be punished for their misdeeds. Unfortunately for the injured Germans, there wasn't much they could push for when it came to prosecuting the ones responsible, as it was only an unofficial job, some of them thought that perhaps it was purposefully arranged so by the bookers of the match. Nevertheless, arrest warrants were pressed by the German Garrison government as well as by the Reich itself, leading to arrests of over twenty people suspected for inciting the riot and committing violence against the German soldiers. As the weeks and months went by, the match became the talk of the town, used as both a gesture of unity and an insult to the German occupiers."

domvile_flavour.16.d:0 "Of the many things Butler was doing to amass support for his growing Pragmatist coalition and eventual leadership bid for the BPP, having tea on the House of Lord's terrace was by far one of the more pleasant ones. Though the stakes were high as ever, it was a far calmer atmosphere than the riotous Commons or tribal BPP Headquarters. Nothing but tea, biscuits and a vital front in the war for Britain's soul.\n\n"Look Mr Butler, a lot of us would quite frankly prefer you to win over that glorified thug Fountaine, but you have to admit that your proposed reforms have made us... Uneasy. Do you really have to strip our power in such a way? I don't see anyone else arguing for such drastic action." Said one of the influential Lords present, a leader in the moderate faction Butler had to court if he wanted to win once Domvile kicked the bucket.\n\n"I recognise that you all may have some... Trepidation, about my proposed reforms, but please my Lords, they are vital to restoring our people's trust in us and faith in Parliament. You will still have the powers of delay and amendment, whilst not as strong as an outright veto, they are still powerful, and more than enough to check the Commons if they do something stupid, as quite a few of my fellow MPs so often do."\n\nThe joke went down well with the Lords, who seemed to be warming to Butler's idea. Seeing his opportunity to secure their support and turn them against Fountaine for good, Butler struck whilst the iron was hot.\n\n"Do take for instance, some of the proposals brought forth by some of Fountaine's gang recently. That Bean fellow sounds almost like a communist in his rhetoric. Not that the others sound less moronic mind you, the other fellow, Hamm, was going on about the need for a "Syndicalist economy" too, with quite alarming implications for our social status quo."\n\nThe Lords nodded in agreement, with the Peer who spoke before raising his voice again. "I think I speak for us all when I say it is better to give away some power to decent chaps than risk it all on some unpredictable louts, very well Mr Butler, you have our support.""

britain_lesbians.1.d:0 "Emma would always miss school, in an odd way. Her parents had said they would be "the best years of her life" all the time, and after graduating, she couldn't help but ruminate on those words. There were bits of it that she'd always detest, of course - she cringed internally, remembering how Mr. Donahue would drone on and on about how all of history was a precursor to "inevitable German dominance". Were teachers paid more by the government to glorify the past?\n\nThe girl's reverie was interrupted by a pair of arms gently wrapping around her neck. "How's adulthood treating you, Miss newly-graduated?" She smirked, turning around to see none other than Elizabeth. Emma remembered the day they met. It was back in her third year, and she had been paired up with the pretty blonde girl she'd been too shy to talk to. They got chatting, and the rest was history. Soft touches exchanged when nobody could see, moments shared behind the bikeshed at the middle of the night - it had to be a secret. She did not want to see herself or her love in prison.\n\n"Oh, it's going splendidly, dear. Yourself?" she responded coyly. Elizabeth giggled, and her heart melted. "All the better with you." They fell upon Elizabeth's bed, holding each other. They talked for what felt like hours, reflecting on what adulthood would hold. On what their future would hold.\n\n"...you know, I've spoken to Old Bill a lot lately. Y'know, the man at the bar?" Emma said, cradling Elizabeth's head. "Oh? Whatever for?" she asked, looking up. "He's not happy with the government." Elizabeth snorted. "Who is these days?" Emma rolled her eyes. "That's what he thinks. And it turns out... that he has some other friends, who also aren't happy with 'em." Elizabeth's eyes widened, and she sat up. "You don't mean...?" Emma nodded. The other girl gasped softly. "I said that you and I could possibly meet up with 'em, soon. See what it's like." A beat passed. Then Elizabeth nodded. "Alright then.""

She liked to think that if he knew, then he'd be supportive of it, the same way she privately hoped that her parents would support her and Elizabeth's relationship if they were ever caught. That was an issue for another day, however. Today, she would need to convince Old Bill that she and Elizabeth had what it took to join the resistance.\n\nOld Bill was the spitting image of what one imagines when seeing a grizzled Great War veteran. Wrinkled and liver-spotted skin, thinning white hair, and a stormy look on his face. The man smoked his pipe, sitting across from the couple. A moment of silence passed. "So," he began, after taking a drag "what makes two lovely ladies such as yourselves want to join up?" he said, his voice raspy.\n\nEmma cocked an eyebrow. "I told you last time we spoke. I hate Domvile and all his cronies, and so does my... friend, here." Bill nodded. "Then I should perhaps rephrase - why, young lady," he said gesturing a pipe at Elizabeth "would you want to join?" She gulped, before collecting herself. "I want a better future. For me, and for Emma here. If that means having to go up to Downing Street and kicking Domvile in the knob myself, then so be it."\n\nEmma's eyes widened slightly as Bill laughed. "You've got spirit, girl. I like that. Alright then. If you both want in, then who am I to object, eh?" he extended his hand, and the two girls both shook it in turn. "Now. Sometimes we meet here, sometimes we meet in the old silk mill uptown. We aren't the only cell in Worcestershire, nor even the most important one, so don't expect to give it to Downing Street right away. What you'll be doing is small-scale stuff, enough to disrupt things. Meet me here this time next week so I can show you where to go. Is that clear?" The couple nodded dutifully.

"Well done, love," Elizabeth said, hugging her from behind. "But your technique could use some work." Emma scoffed incredulously. "Come off it Lizzie, we're both beginners. It's not like you could do much better."\n\nElizabeth only smiled sweetly, and gestured for Emma to pass the rifle. She complied, replacing the shattered bottle and gesturing at the stump. "Fire away." she shouted. Elizabeth then aimed the rifle at the bottles, pulling the trigger.\n\n*BANG!* *BANG!* *BANG!* *BANG!* *BANG!*\n\nEmma's jaw dropped as Elizabeth turned around to face her. She had shot all of the bottles on her first try. "How's that for a beginner, hmm?"\n\n"I-.. wh-... how?" Emma spluttered. She took Elizabeth to be many things, but an avid rifle user was not one of them. The other woman simply giggled. "Father used to work with some rich men, and they went on hunting trips together. Sometimes he would take me and show me how to do it. Can't say he would have expected me to be using those skills like this, though." Emma was simply stunned. "Can you... teach me?" she asked."

That left Roy, Harry, Cal, and Bob. It was probably Cal. Ratty little bastard always looked suspicious.\n\nElizabeth ran through the streets, desperately ducking and weaving in and out of alleyways. She could hear the telltale police sirens nearby, and the rapid movement of the police officers. She hadn't seen anyone leave the same way she did, but she could only hope that they were all safe. "Well, well, well. What's cracking off here then?" Her blood turned to ice as she turned around and saw a ruddy-faced, balding man in a police uniform with a toadlike smile stretched across his face. Shit. "Looks to me like you might be running away from something. Mind if you come back to the station and answer a few questions?" She spat on his shoes, making his smile turn into a look of seething rage.\n\n"You stupid little b-" the officer never got to finish his sentence, as a rather beaten up old car emerged from behind the officer, knocking him over. Taken aback, Elizabeth only realised who her saviour was when she heard Emma calling her name from the car. She scrambled into the car, and the couple took off into the night.\n\nAs soon as they were far enough away from the danger, Elizabeth hugged her lover as hard as she could. "You saved me. God knows what he'd have done." Emma only gently kissed her on the forehead, only briefly taking her eyes off the road. "Bill contacted me. We've got a new place sorted in the old cigarette factory uptown. I'll get us there and then we can relax." Elizabeth nodded, falling asleep on Emma's shoulder."

All of a sudden, however, Bobby jumped into the room with a look of glee on his face. "He's dead!" the young man yelled. "He's finally gone and corked it!"\n\nEveryone was silent for a moment. They knew who "he" would be. Who else? It was Hitler. Hitler had finally died.\n\nEmma was the first to say anything. "He's... he's really gone? The bastard is gone?" Bobby nodded. Elizabeth slammed her hand onto her mouth, stifling back a sob of joy. "He's gone. He's gone!" She stood up, laughing. "He's gone! The bastard's dead! He's fucking dead! BURN IN HELL, WANKER!"\n\nAt this point, Elizabeth stood up and hugged her partner, and they began to jump for joy together, giggling ecstatically. "How about that, Bill? D'you reckon he shat himself? Or that it hurt? It better've bloody hurt, I'll say!" Bill didn't respond, only looking on with a thin smile. It was a relief to see him dead, of course. But it wouldn't bring his comrades back from the dead. And as he saw those two girls and that other boy celebrating his death, Old Bill couldn't help but wonder one select thing."

And it would be one Emma and Elizabeth could live in without fear, as they did now.\n\nThey stood next to each other, both wearing protective vests and holding rifles. They were due to roll out to the local constabulary in a few short moments, seizing the area of Worcestershire for the resistance. And from there, well... it depended on where they were told to go. Where to fight the Nazi-loving bastards. It would be a long, bloody war, but the couple knew that they had to win at all costs. Nothing could stop them.\n\nEmma looked at Elizabeth, her Lizzie, and smiled. "So. How're you feeling?" she asked. The other woman said nothing, only gazing off into the distance. "...like I'm about to storm P.C. Jenkins' constabulary and kill anyone who tries to stop us." she answered. Emma grimaced. "...yeah. Yeah, I know. It'll be hard.

The spectre of defeat and death loomed over them. Moments passed, and they shared a wordless conversation. Elizabeth kissed her lover softly on the cheek. "Whatever happens, I'll follow you. I'll always be with you. Forever."\n\n"Alright troops, get moving!" Old Bill yelled, waving his cane into the air. "It's time for us to get the job done. God bless us all."

Nobody was saying much, until a man with ratty beard and a sour expression raised his hand. Bill nodded at him. "Yes, Martin."\n\n"If this plan is meant to be as important as you say, then why is it being done by those two?" He said, pointing at the two women. "Excuse me?" Emma said, instantly defensive. Martin scoffed. "Look, no offence sweetheart, I'm sure you're both lovely, but this is a war. It's no place for either of you." The others in the room looked aghast. Years in the SOE made Martin a bit insensitive at times, but they didn't realise he would come out with something like this. Elizabeth stormed over to him, a face like thunder.

Of course as she grew older, there was less frolicking around in the snow and more sneaking in illicitly gained bottles of beer, but the spirit remained the same.\n\nThis Christmas was very different, to say the least. For one, she was not gently roused from a comfortable bed, but awoken at five in the morning by a loud screeching noise. She shot up, blearily trying to reach for the gun she kept at her bedside. Elizabeth was quicker, leaping out of bed and looking around. "What is that? Emma! Wake up Emma, what the hell is that?" she asked as her partner shook herself awake. "No idea." she said, running outside. As it turned out, they had all been equally as confused - Old Bill later clarified that it was a faulty air raid siren that had been triggered by the snow. He hadn't seen this as a downside however - as the de facto leader of their cell, he had gotten everyone to participate in a gift-giving exercise, and the early get-up only meant they could do it earlier.\n\nSo, there Emma and Elizabeth sat, drinking the lukewarm mugs of tea and trying to fight off the bitingly cold air that threatened to come into their tent. "So," Emma said, chuckling nervously. "I couldn't exactly scrounge up much this year, but..." she paused, before producing a necklace. "It was my mum's. It's not worth much but I swiped it before we ran away."\n\nElizabeth immediately began cooing over it, draping it over her neck. "Oh it's lovely, darling! You shouldn't have." she said, starting to rummage through her bag. Then, she produced a small picture, passing it to Emma. "Here's mine. It was less costly of course, but I did have to bribe Ginger with a few cigarettes." As Emma looked at it, she realised what it was - it was a picture of their cell in that old cigarette factory, grinning and smiling. She had meant to ask for a copy but they hadn't had time. Her heart melted, smiling at her partner."

britain_lesbians.10.d:0 "War, death, and chaos had become as much of a companion to Emma as Elizabeth had, she mused. It felt as if every time their cell gathered together to discuss local matters, things only ever got worse. She tried to keep up a positive attitude - it was all she could really do, frankly - but every time she learnt of another cell of resistance fighters getting lit on fire and left to die, her view of the future dimmed ever so slightly.\n\nThat day, she had found out that yet another nearby resistance village had been captured by the government. Old Bill had encouraged them to not be disheartened by the news, and yet Emma was sitting as rigid as a plank of wood in bed as Elizabeth softly cuddled her. How that woman managed to brush past the existential dread was a mystery to her.\n\nShe shifted slightly, knees jabbing into her back. Emma sighed, trying desperately to settle down. "What's the matter, love?" Elizabeth asked. Emma almost wanted to scream - she had woken her up. "Don't worry about it, jus' go back to sleep." She could practically feel the stare boring into her side. She shifted, moving to look her lover in the eye. "D'you think we're gonna win this?"\n\nThere was silence for a while, before Elizabeth responded. "I dunno, sweetheart. I dunno. Worst case, we can run away. D'you want that?" Emma wasn't sure. Could she truly leave her country behind after all she had done to try and save it?\n\n"I don't know. Whatever it takes to keep you safe, I'll do it," she said, clutching Elizabeth tightly. "I mean it. If I have to shoot Colin Jordan himself in the head, then so be it. I'll always be there for you, Lizzie." Seemingly pacified, Elizabeth hummed gently and snuggled even closer to her lover. They could sleep soundly tonight, no matter what the bastards in the government tried."

Emma and Elizabeth kept their vigil over Old Bill, who had been caught by a stray gunshot. He had tried to insist that they left him behind, but they weren't about to let that happen. Not after they lost Madge and Harry last week.\n\nTheir cell shrank by the day. It was just them, Bill, Bobby, and Tom left now. The collaborators had pushed them back all the way into the woods, but they kept fighting. It wasn't as if there was much else to do.\n\n"...d'you think they followed us here?" Emma asked to nobody in particular. "We weren't as quick as usual. They could have been lying in wait."\n\n"We've no way of knowing," Elizabeth said, squeezing her hand. "But I certainly hope not."\n\nEmma looked over at her partner, seeing tears rolling gently onto her cheeks. She said nothing, only squeezing her hand back, silently comforting her. They both knew exactly what they were terrified of most, and how real that fear was.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot in the distance broke the silence. Elizabeth's head whipped in that direction. "Shit." She whispered, letting go of Emma's hand and running off into the darkness. Emma's eyes widened, before she ran after her partner."

The way her body quickly tensed and then crumpled to the ground would be seared into Emma's eyelids as long as she lived. She screamed. The boy who had shot her gawped at her, before running away, like a coward as Bobby and Tom chased him away. She ran over to Elizabeth, cradling her gently.\n\nShe was still breathing, but it was laboured. Her usually rosy cheeks had faded to a white, as the blood dripping from the wound darkened the camouflage jacket. "Lizzie?" She asked. Elizabeth looked up at her, smiling and stroking her cheek. "Hey there, gorgeous. It's me. It's Emma. You're gonna be ok, alright? Let's just... get you up." She said, trying to lift her up.\n\nSuddenly, Elizabeth's arm fell to the ground, and her chest stopped moving. Emma's heart stopped. "No. No, no, Lizzie. Lizzie!" She said, shaking her lover's body. Warm, salty tears began to pool around her eyelids. "LIZZIE!"\n\nElizabeth said nothing. Her glassy eyes stared up into the night sky, that same smile etched onto her face in death.\n\nThe tears were unstoppable. She lowered her face into Elizabeth's chest, sobbing heavily. She forgot entirely about the possibility of other soldiers being nearby, as she wailed for the loss of her entire world. "Emma?" Came a gruff voice from behind her. She did not look up, but she knew it was Old Bill. Nothing else mattered at the moment. "EMMA!" He repeated, shaking her. She finally looked up, seeing him hobbling along. "We have to go. If they found us here, they'll be back."\n\nShe shook her head, sniffling. "No I can't. I-I just... I can't leave her here..." Old Bill put his hand on her shoulder. "Emma, she would want you to carry on. To keep fighting. Please, Emma." He said, his own eyes beginning to water. "I can't lose anyone else."\n\nLooking into the old man's eyes, she nodded. But before leaving, she closed Elizabeth's eyes, and kissed her on the forehead."

britain_lesbians.14.d:0 "The waves gently lapped at the side of the boat, as sunlight began to break through the clouds. It was on the smaller side, only able to carry around 20 people at a time, but it served its purpose of ferrying away refugees from Britain. Emma felt the salty tang of the air on her tongue, huddling herself into the blanket draped over her shoulders. Her exit from her home had not been a smooth one - she had been rushed onto the boat in the dead of night by Old Bill alongside the other passengers, gunfire echoing in the background. It was possible that the old man could have caught another boat, she supposed. Perhaps they would meet again one day.\n\nA child on the other side of the boat began crying, his mother desperately trying to comfort him. Emma didn't know any of their stories, although she had gleaned from the scant conversation that had been made that everyone on the boat was affiliated with the resistance in some way or another. A fine lot they must have looked like - bedraggled, bereft, and defeated.\n\nIf Elizabeth was here, she would have had something comforting to say. She would have been chirping about all the possibilities their new life opened up for them - how they could live together away from the burdens of their old one. Or maybe she could have alleviated the bitingly cold sea air by holding her, getting lost in her arms. But that was not to be. Suddenly, a large dark silhouette could be seen in the distance. Everyone on the boat immediately perked up. As they drew closer, it became clear what the figure was.\n\nIt was the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThey had arrived in New York. Muted elation could be heard across the boat - most were too drained to get too physical. Emma smiled, taking out a wrinkled photo. It was one they had taken just before the uprising had begun, where they were still hiding in the attic of that old factory. Lizzie's greyscale face smiled back at her, alongside all the other comrades she knew were no longer with her. Emma held the photo to her chest, whispering softly."

And so say all of us!"\n\nThe raucous collection of youths sang away, stomping around the local pub. Half of the regulars had been driven off by this display, while the other half had joined in, merrily clapping their hands to the tune. The barman could only look at them with a weary smile - he knew that these lads had just finished school, and were celebrating like only young men could.\n\nOne of them stumbled up to the bar, a couple of loose coins in hand. The barman grinned, recognising the boy. "Ayup Ben! How're you handling being a grown man now, eh?"\n\nThe boy was a slender, dark-haired youth, his cheeks rosy due to the alcohol. He cracked a smile at the old man. "Ah yeah, I'm doin' wonderful mate, yeah. Had a great time tonight, got my mates, you know 'ow it is. Another pint please?"\n\nThe barman chuckled, moving to make another drink for Ben. "D'you have any plans for what you want to do? Maybe work in the factory like your dad? I know he'd be proud of you. Him and your uncle." This comment appeared to give the youth pause.\n\n"Not quite sure yet, honestly." he answered, staring vacantly. Shaking himself out of it, he paid the barman and went off to rejoin his friends. The barman smiled again."

britain_ben.2.d:0 "Ben quietly shut the front door, not wanting to wake up his mother at this time. Shifts at the factory were getting later and later, which meant she often ended up falling asleep before he got back. Slinging his raggedy bag on the kitchen table, he walked over to the pantry, feeling absolutely famished after a day of nonstop labouring. Those German taskmasters did not like to let up for anything, it felt like.\n\nStill, money was money, he pondered, taking out some bread, margarine and preserved meat from the cupboard. He was a fit and healthy lad and it was just him and his mum. If he didn't bring in any money, then nobody would, and the bills would go unpaid. But as he spread the margarine onto the bread, he couldn't help but wonder one thing.\n\nHow many more nights like this? How long would it be until he went onto bigger and better things? Or would he stay in this city until the day he died like Dad did?\n\nShaking his head, Ben sat down and tucked into the sandwich. The ingredients were all extremely cheap, but after his shift, it could've been a five-star meal in his eyes. It would be the same again tomorrow, and the same the day after that. Maybe on Sunday he'd be able to properly relax, for once."

britain_ben.3.t:0 "Putting Yourself On The Line"
britain_ben.3.d:0 "When Ben told his mother of his intention to join the army, a flurry of emotions swam through her eyes. Shock, fear, and sadness were all visible, before they finally settled on anger. His face was met with a sharp slap. "What the HELL do you think you're talking about, you stupid boy?!" she shouted. "You can't join the bloody military! You're barely out of school, for goodness sakes!"\n\nKnocked off-kilter by the unexpected smack, Ben quickly snapped back. "Oh, and I'm old enough to work in some dingy old factory all day, am I? At least this way I'm not wasting my life, and I'm actually doing something for once!"\n\nShe scoffed, folding her arms. "A waste of a life is it? Is that what you think about your dad? Did he waste his life then?" Silence fell over the mother and son, as the unspoken presence of the missing family member made itself known. She put her hands over her eyes, and began to sob gently. "Not you too, Ben. I can't lose you too. I just can't."\n\nBen's expression softened, and he pulled his mother into a firm hug. "Mum, I swear that I'll be back, I promise you." he said, lightly patting her on the back. "I'm gonna come back home, and we'll be much better off. Alright?" She could only sniffle in response. Regardless, he had already signed up. He was due to be heading to basic training in a few days."

britain_ben.4.t:0 "Out Of The Frying Pan"
britain_ben.4.d:0 "The words 'panic' did not quite convey the levels of sheer chaos and fear that had engulfed Ben's platoon. They had been in basic training just a few weeks ago when all of a sudden, they had been ordered to ship out to the capital and that it was a state of abject emergency. There had been no direct confirmation of what was going on just yet, but rumours would always spread. And these rumours were shockingly consistent.\n\nIt was being said that Downing Street had been blown up with the Prime Minister inside.\n\nBen didn't quite want to believe it - he neither looked up to nor disliked the Prime Minister on a personal level. Indeed, how many Englishmen of his age could genuinely claim to hold much in common with the likes of Barry Domvile? But he was still the man who lead Ben's country alongside the King himself, and when he joined the army Ben had sworn to defend both King and Country. To have the resistance attack both so brazenly like this could only mean trouble, and he did not like it one bit.\n\nAs the old military transport trundled down the road, few of the men were speaking. Usually they would be joking around with each other by now, or at least exchanging words with each other. But instead, it felt as if they were gathered at a funeral. Hushed whispers were exchanged as many of them stared vacantly onwards. They all knew what they had signed up for in joining the military, but none of them would have expected for anything major to occur this soon.\n\nIt was at this moment that Ben could suddenly remember what his mother had said to him when he told her that he had signed up. The sentence echoed in Ben's head as the prospect of combat dangled over him."

britain_ben.5.d:0 "It was in the ruins of a bombed housing estate where they found her. The troops were advancing through a ruined suburb when they heard a soft cry coming from the inside of one of the wrecked houses. They readied their weapons and stepped in, only to see a nine-year old girl sobbing on the floor, clutching a dirty doll and sitting next to a pile of rubble. Underneath it, a single pale hand was sticking out.\n\nThey just stood there, shocked at the sight. Swallowing, Ben decided to be the one to talk to her. "Hello," he said softly. "What's your name?"\n\nThe girl didn't respond initially, only looking down, clutching her doll for dear life. "Are mummy and daddy going to be alright?" she asked, looking up at him. Ben felt something deep inside him waver. The girl had to know on some level that her parents were never coming back, but that would never make it easier to tell her.\n\n"No. I'm sorry, they've gone to heaven now." he said, as calmly as he could. The girl's face plummeted even further, and she began to sob. Panicking, Ben put his hand on her shoulder. "Shh. There, there. I know you must be very scared and sad right now, but if you come with me and my friends here, we can get you somewhere safe. How about that, eh?" He extended his hand.\n\nShe looked at him warily, before taking it. Ben forced a soft smile. He knew that she would probably be shipped off to an orphanage as soon as they got back to base - hopefully she'd find a good family. But the pain would never leave her. She had lost everything in this war. As they left the ruined house, he turned back and looked, coming to one realisation."

britain_ben.6.t:0 "Just Stay Alive"
britain_ben.6.d:0 ""MEDIC, MEDIC! WE NEED A MEDIC NOW!"\n\nBen was almost paralysed with panic as he desperately shouted for aid amongst the din of the battlefield. The soldier he was cradling was bleeding heavily from the his shoulder, a bullet having just gone straight through it. It was almost impossible to hear whether any help for the poor man was coming or not over all the screaming and shouting, as his comrades charged onwards into the gunfire. The soldier coughed, breathing heavily. "Just stay with me mate, yeah? Help'll be on its way soon. Do you have a name?"\n\nA moment passed, and Ben feared that the soldier had just passed away in his arms. "Adolf," he said, wheezing. "Mein name ist Adolf." Ben sighed with relief. That explained the German military insignia on his clothes, at the very least.\n\n"Adolf, eh? Well, I s'pose it's no great wonder who you were named after then." He joked, trying to lighten the mood. The German looked to be around his age - a youthful face with only wisps of a blonde moustache growing. Ben briefly wondered whether he had even chosen to join the Garrison like he had the army - and that he probably had family at home as well.\n\nHe let out a wet gurgle that could be construed as a laugh. "Well, that is what many of you Englishmen think," he said, a strained ghost of a smile on his lips. "But it was actually my uncle Adolf-Hans, not the Führer." A loud bang came about five metres away, and that smile faded. "Go. There is no use dying for me."\n\nThere was a grim determination on his face, but Ben would not be rattled. "I'm not leaving another man behind. I don't know how they do it in Germany, but over here we take care of our soldiers. It's just a flesh wound, anyway. Now, MEDIC!" he shouted once again, his throat searing in pain. Eventually, one did arrive, dragging Adolf away on a stretcher. Shaking himself, Ben charged back into the fighting. He had a job to do."

britain_ben.7.d:0 "It was usually against regulation for a pair of soldiers to be up as late as Ben and Adolf were that Christmas night, but they could hardly be singled out - their officer had arranged for a few kegs of fine German beer to be smuggled into their encampment, so they could make merry as best they could. Of course, as the night went on, activity began to peter out. But Ben and Adolf had remained out, sipping their beer and looking at the sky.\n\nThe two men had remained close after Ben had rescued him. He had requested to be transferred to their unit from his own all-German one, forever grateful that Ben hadn't left him to die. They could often be seen with each other, cracking jokes and such. Ben decided that he liked it. He had friends back in Birmingham and obviously respected his brothers-in-arms, but it was good to have someone he could confidently call a close friend.\n\n"You know," Adolf said, breaking the silence. "My father didn't want me to join the army." Ben sat up - Adolf hadn't mentioned his family before.\n\n"Really? I would've thought that you Germans would be... well, a bit more eager to help with serving your country, given the... well..." Ben gesticulated vaguely.\n\nAdolf laughed. "Ha! I can understand what you mean. But no, he was an accountant and wanted me to stay and help with the firm. But it was my mother who told me I should do whatever I wish to serve the fatherland. And here I am." He said, waving his mug in the air. "Merry old England!"\n\nBen laughed in turn, shaking his head. "It's funny you should mention that, actually. My dad died, so it was just me and mum, and she wasn't too keen on me leaving her. But I had to do something. It was either this or the factory, you know?" Adolf nodded understandingly, the fire crackling away. He raised his mug again."

Ben privately wondered if this was what the men who spent months upon months in the trenches of the Somme felt like - to be mere inches away from the target and covered from head to toe in mud. "Charming weather, ja?" a familiar accented voice said beside him. Lo, it was Adolf, covered in as much crap as he was.\n\n"Yeah, bloody wonderful innit." he scoffed. "Perfect weather for a picnic, don't you think? Why don't we get the lovely lads over there for a nice cuppa, and we can settle this peacefully." The "lovely lads over there" in this case were an enclave of SOE operatives that were holding a village hostage. He had already heard two shots from their side, and seen a few bodies dumped on the outskirts - presumably because they weren't "cooperating" nicely enough with their captors. It was their job to chuck them out.\n\nAdolf let out another hearty chuckle, shaking his head. "You know, I have been thinking. When my grandfather was last in a war, it would have been against your grandfather. When my father was in a war, it would have been against your father. And now, here we both are! Standing right by each other. It is funny, no?" Ben snorted.\n\n"I s'pose that's how we get 'round world peace then. Mind you, not sure either of us are ever going to be able to stand the bloody French..." Adolf laughed again, only for their attention to be called away by their commanding officer whistling. It was time to go over the top and take the rebels out. The two boys - no, men - looked at each other, a gleam in their eyes."

They had been sent there to try and root out a group of resistance fighters who had been sighted coming in and out of the woods for the past week.\n\nHe wasn't too familiar with these three men - Adolf and the rest of his usual comrades had been assigned to the city, where they'd be doing much of the same, only in an urban environment. Ben could have used a break from the inner city for a while, he supposed. 17 years there does that to a man. Seeing a faint plume of smoke in the distance, Ben held up his hand, gesturing for the men to stop. "Alright," he whispered. "Looks like we've found them. Now-"\n\nBefore he could speak, a bullet went through the head of the man at the back, his blood spraying over the two in front of him. Chaos erupted as two men from the resistance burst from the trees, each firing indiscriminately at the other two men. Ben moved to try and dodge out of the way, but before he could, he felt cold steel press against his neck as a strong, slender arm grabbed his torso.\n\nHe struggled, desperately trying to keep his neck away from the knife. He reached for the gun holstered to his waist and pulled the trigger, firing twice behind him. Whoever was holding him fell to the floor, choking, He turned around, seeing that it had been a blonde woman dressed in camouflage clothes. A scream came from further in the forest. Ben looked up, seeing that it came from a dark haired woman further in the woods.\n\nBen's life flashed before his eyes. All the other men were dead, and the other resistance fighters were bound to be closing in. He ran, trying not to let the image of the man's blown-open head or the blonde woman's face haunt him."

Except for the roof - there was a large hole in it that had certainly not been here last time he had checked. Clutching his rucksack, he approached the front door, hearing people chatting with each other inside. It must have been a family get together. He was lucky that their unit was to be stationed in Birmingham for the next few months before they went back to camp - he needed to know everyone was alright.\n\nHe knocked three times, and he heard what sounded like his mother approaching. "I'll get it!" she said, and the door swung open. "Hello mum." Ben said, not quite knowing what else to say.\n\nIn the brief moments before she recognised her son, Ben's mother looked weary, a strained smile on her face. It was clear that she was trying to play the dutiful hostess for whoever had come over. But when she saw her son, the facade dropped - alongside her jaw. She nervously approached, reaching her arm out. "B...Ben?" she asked, caressing his cheek. He smiled, feeling tears starting to well up.\n\nIn an instant, her arms wrapped around his torso. She began to sob into his chest, and all those days on the battlefield couldn't have hardened him enough against this. "Yeah, it's me mum." he said, hugging her in return."

This time, it was men - soldiers who had fought and killed and been through hell for their country. And along the way, they had become brothers. Ben cheerfully clapped Adolf on the shoulder as they went up to the bar. It was a younger man this time - poor old Michael had been killed in the uprising. "Hello there, what can I get you?" he asked.\n\n"Ja, I would like to order two pints. On me!" Adolf said. His accent received a slightly odd stare from the barman, but he went ahead in making the drinks without a word. That had happened once or twice with the other local patrons that night, but neither man had the time or energy to comment on it. As far as Ben was concerned, Adolf was his closest friend, and always would be.\n\nTaking their drinks, they went back to the crowd of former soldiers. Almost all of them had come from this part of the city, and the newcomers were rapidly getting used to the climate. They were all drinking, talking, and swapping war stories. Ben sat down, joining in just as Dickie began an anecdote of what happened when he stole their officer's cap and wore it into battle.\n\nLater that night, the mood would grow more somber, as the men remembered their friends who had not made it. Doug. Steve. Martin. Chris. A toast was made to their fallen comrades, and to a better future. And in their honour, they got straight back to celebrations."

With a few strokes of a pen, a good two thirds of the farm that had been in Giles Matthews' family for generations had been signed away - for well below mortgage rates. He had been driven to the local council earlier that day by those men in their brand new suits and plastic smiles, where they tried in vain to make conversation about what the land would be used for - to build a large new airport, apparently.\n\nGiles hadn't much entertained them. The land was worth much more than what they were offering in not just monetary value, but memories as well. The fields that his father had taught him to till in, the pastures that he and his wife would stroll through, all of them - blitzed down in favour of an endless concrete expanse.\n\nAs the car trundled back to his home, Giles mentally weighed up how many more months his family would be able to survive off of the money that they had given him - a month or two more, not counting taxes and tariffs, and whatnot. How much more would he have to sell? Why did he bother selling in the first place? He had heard of similar stories from other farmers in the Stoke area, yet he carried on anyway.\n\nArriving back at his farmhouse, Giles dully thanked the driver for dropping him off, and he walked inside. He resisted the urge to collapse upon the sofa and made his way to the shed, where his rifle was kept. Thoughts of his wife and children flashed through his head, before he selfishly pushed them away. This was a problem he could not solve."

"I brought them all, Mr. Wilson!"\n\nHarold Wilson looked up from his desk, upon which was an avalanche of papers. Phillips set them on the table; the two took a box each and sorted through the papers. They rattled off suspicious lot numbers, compared recurring names, circled and underlined and highlighted everything suspicious. In an hour, they had reduced this pile to a folder full of damning conjecture.\n\n"Damn it all," he muttered. "The bastards were undervaluing the land, forcing a cheap sale from the owners and pocketing the remainder. And now a man's dead because of it." It had first come to his attention via his driver, an old family friend of Giles Matthews' widow and a pallbearer at his funeral. Wilson had long known such corruption was rife, but it pained him to see it so clearly.\n\n"But we can't prove any of it," said Phillips, more to herself than anyone else. "We have plenty of speculation, but there's nothing actionable about it. Nothing-"\n\n"Rachael," he hissed, "get your typewriter."\n\nPhillips sprung up from her seat and grabbed her typewriter, glaring at a few of the lesser functionaries who were hanging around the door of the Minister's office to see what the commotion was about. Armed with the tool of her trade and a new stack of papers, Phillips wrote what Wilson dictated."

They think themselves above the proper authorities and seek to sneak such ridiculous legislation past the rest of the government! It is a disgrace!"\n\nFountaine's reaction to Wilson's ombudsman bill had been greater than Butler had expected. If he wasn't careful, this would give the man an opportunity to babble on for hours on end about why greater local autonomy surely spelt the end of Britain as they knew it - and worse still, there was a chance Domvile would listen. "If I may," he said, raising his voice. "I think it might be best if Harold had some time to speak, don't you? I'm sure this was in no way meant as an intrusion onto your authority."\n\nDomvile nodded towards Fountaine, causing the man to angrily slump onto his chair. Butler turned to Wilson, who looked up from his notes, pausing to inhale his cigarette before speaking. "Well, I simply did not see there was any reason for you to be informed. This act was something I felt came under my purview. Looking after the average working man is rather the point of my job, is it not?"\n\nFountaine stared at Wilson, his eyes gleaming with disdain. "And is looking after the working man something I am unable to do without your interference? I did not realise that the powers of the Home Secretary were subject to the Ministry of Labour." he replied coldly.\n\nWilson was unshaken. "Of course not Andrew, it just seemed as if you had overlooked this specific case. Not that I blame you, of course - I'm sure managing your blackshirts leave you quite occupied."\n\nFountaine launched out of his chair, preparing to launch into another shouting match before Domvile stood, rendering the ministers silent. "I do not care whose foot is being tread on, this argument ends now. I will not have his Majesty's government handicapped by pointless argument over petty reforms. This Act is dead." With that, he looked at both men."

britain_projects.4.d:0 ""What on God's green Earth have you done, Wilson?"\n\nThere was a silence, only punctuated by the short, sharp beat of the clock. Still stuck on three past two. As it has been for the last three months. Butler caressed his brow and looked down at his desk, full of complaints about this morning's incident. All from Fountaine's gaggle of imbeciles, of course.\n\n"Chancellor, did you hear what the Home Secretary called it? A "naked power-grab"? Fountaine cannot even comprehend any action that would bring about a pos-" Wilson was cut off by Butler, jutting a hand up in exasperation.\n\n"Enough, enough, man!" Butler cried out, whether from the fatigue of Parliamentary debate or his protege's seemingly boundless energy. "You humiliated me out there, you realise that? Five minutes before I called you up here, I had Greene blabbering down the phone about 'overstepping boundaries'. Even a broken clock can be right twice a day. Or millennium."\n\n"The bill would have d-"\n\n"The bill would have done wonders, I agree! You think you're the only one who's aghast at what happened in Norfolk? I spoke to the poor widow a few days ago. I rarely...well, ever since the war, I've tried to keep my anguish down..."\n\nThe silence returned again. As it always did in this office, Butler mused. London - former Capital of the World - now just the World's largest collection of coffins and empty streets. Wilson took a glance at the floor, not daring to peer upon his mentor. He put a hand into his trouser pocket to clumsily offer Butler a tissue, but thought against it and let his hand rest.\n\nThe bill was out there now, at the very minimum. There was nothing to lose from this proposal and he had everything to gain. The worst-case scenario is that nothing happens. Life goes on as normal. The best? Wilson looked upon Butler, still lost in sombre thought about the general state of affairs."

Uttering a word of thanks to his wife, he relaxed back into his armchair, and steeled himself for whatever Bean was about to say. For his part, Bean left the ornate, china teacup alone and remained standing.\n\n"This could be a real movement, Home Secretary. A real movement that would show that we're not just a bunch of loons." he said, almost muddling his words up in just how fast he was talking.\n\nFountaine glanced at the write-ups that his Undersecretary had scrawled and then up again, in complete silence. A bemused smirk played over his wrinkled profile, as if a blind beggar had told him that he was his long-lost relative. Funding like-minded local councils was marvellous and all, but Bean was jabbering like Lenin on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n"I'm sorry, John," he scoffed. "But a few shillings more to Suffolk or Herefordshire or whatever, is hardly going to mean that I - and it is I that you should be worried about - will become the next Prime Minister. Not with such, such a large, gaping hole in our budget!"\n\nThe Undersecretary paused, just for a moment. Searching for the words - some magic sequence of phrases or code that could convince his superior to go along with his stratagem, his tongue played silent over his teeth. No, that wouldn't work. This would.\n\nBean gently placed the tea-set on the floor, prompting an eyebrow raise from Fountaine. He unrolled a map of Great Britain, an anachronistic relic where the Kingdom still held the Channel Islands and damned Ulster. Divided into its counties, Bean pointed toward Yorkshire.\n\n"Yorkshire alone may not win you the Premiership, Home Secretary. Nor Suffolk or Herefordshire," Bean dragged his finger in time with the monologue. "But if we - you - give the order to start funding councils, the local ones. That's where we're at our strongest. Start infiltrating the ones not at our beck and call, and soon...we have the possibility of fielding candidates in every by-election in the country."\n\nFountaine's smirk collapsed into an intrigued frown. After what happened with Butler, his chances of seizing the Throne were looking slimmer, by the day. But this?"

The crowd looked like how he felt, a torrent of glum, bored-looking locals whose only purpose of attending this little get-together was pure obligation. The clouds above him rolled over each other, casting various shades of dull violet and muted magenta, as if to shield the setting sun from the unworthy eyes of Man.\n\n"This plant...this coal plant...is living proof that Britain has not only recovered from the savagery of War, but thrived in its absence." Domvile studied the faces of his captive audience, not one even attempting to look the least bit enthralled. Fools, the entirety of them. In France, the Petainists would have just sold their people to the Huns for enough change to renovate their mistress' apartments. At least he was doing good work.\n\n"Ever since the age of Arthur, we have attempted to tame nature for our own purposes. First the humble mill, then the horse and then the Age of Sail. Who could have thought that we could harness the power under our feet for something greater yet?"\n\nWhat was he saying? Arthur? Did he really think that these - these coal miners - would know anything of Albion? He should have referenced something more earthly, like Punch and Judy or whatever rubbish the radio was putting out in their lurid dramas. He was almost glad that he was going to retire, anything to put some distance from him and this lot.\n\n"I shall finish this grand renewal of Britain, with a tour of the site itself. Here we will examine just what exactly this monument to our ingenuity lies within, how it works and how it will benefit you, Britain."\n\nDomvile leaned away from the podium, just far enough to make sure that the microphone didn't pick up anything he said. He took the hand of an aide of his, clearly as unamused as the rest of the crowd, and walked off, mumbling something."

He couldn't remember the last time he slept, at the very least, the last time he had even rested his eyes. London wanted a large, legacy project. Nobody told him that he had to be the one that set up said project.\n\nThe guest seats lay covered with papers too. Piles of specifications, data and information. Throwing this much money, this much amount of manpower and time and all to come to the conclusion that the barrage they intended to put over the Severn would produce...\n\nMildly positive results.\n\nIt would produce energy, of course. Maybe enough for Domvile to consider the Severn Barrage a success. Perhaps even enough to "get them in the history books" as the representative quipped to him during a lunch, whoever knows how many days of tireless work those were ago.\n\nBut it would do too little for the amount of work put in. Maybe he had an engineer's brain, but efficiency was always the point here. If something saved £10 million in energy costs but cost £11 million to maintain, then who gave a toss?\n\nHis secretary came in holding a cream envelope, as haggard as she was. Poor Lizzie, she'd need a break after this. They all did. The moment of truth had arrived, what was the magic number that the government was going to have to conjure from a black hat, like one of Crowley's assistants?

The breeze around RAF Woodbridge had been a little - let's say - livelier than he had expected. Butler forced his pinstripe trilby back onto his head, after an especially violent gale had nearly blown it off.\n\n"Who are we meeting today, Messerschmitt?" Domvile blustered, trying to get a word over the wind. Inconveniently, the German representatives of the bidders had chosen to land in East Anglia rather than somewhere closer to London. They expected the Englishmen to come to them, not vice versa.\n\n"No, Prime Minister! This is, let's see..." Maudling snatched a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it, squinting. "British Aerospace wants to make a bid too, sir."\n\nBritish Aerospace? That threw a wrench in things. Domvile could not remember the last time that an English company had made a bid on such a large infrastructure project like this, certainly not one as flagship as the Thames Airport. Maybe wrench was the wrong word to use, actually. This was interesting, a showcase on how far the British economy had come.\n\n"British Aerospace? Why haven't we picked them already?" Domvile snapped. "For God's sake, they're the only company from these fair isles that have the gumption to bet against Berlin in the last fifteen years!"\n\n"What then, Prime Minister?" Butler replied, audibly starting to fray at the edges. "Heinkel and Deutsche Bank have put the largest offer down, by a factor of ten, at least. If we go with our own men, their suits can go up to the Economic Ministry in Berlin and whine that we're not being 'cooperative enough'."\n\nThe black, shifting mass in the air grew larger, to the point that the wings of the cargojet were now discernible. Everyone was silent. That's right, it's been fifteen years. Each and every one of them could still remember the bombs over London, Birmingham, Manchester. The insistent sound of gunfire in the night. The endless parade of stretchers holding the dead and dying. As much as they pretend otherwise, Germany would do the same thing again if we stepped out of line. Again and again and again."

All existing work was to be dismantled, and the site was scheduled for demolition. The jobs lined up after the new project would evaporate into nothing. The land they had worked on for months would likely be sold to a German corporation for practical pennies.\n\nAgain, he read the words clearly, but they still didn't make sense. It was government mismanagement that was primarily responsible for the project's failure. His boys worked as hard as they could, but they were never given the resources they demanded time and time again to meet deadlines. You ask for a digger, and you get a shovel. Typical.\n\nNow, there would be no power station. Well, there might be one, but one for German power. No, they are going to bring in virtual slaves from Germany's eastern territories to produce the station to their own liking. Once finished, the products will be sent back to light up Germania's street instead of the houses of Northumberland.

britain_budget.1.t:0 "The 1962 Budget Statement"
britain_budget.1.d:0 ""The theme of this year's budget is sound expansion: expansion of the British economy's strengths without expansion of the British economy's flaws. In this spirit, it is the Government's goal to achieve 3% real annual growth by the end of 1962..."\n\nThe clock ticked to six. Rab Butler folded away his reports. A lit cigarette burned out on the ashtray. He has triple-checked the numbers every day for the past week, and found them sound. Sensible, practical economic policies were neatly arranged in his head and on the budget he was about to hand to Parliament. He had no doubts; he could not afford them.\n\n"However, as we pursue a growing economy, we cannot allow inflation to destroy all our efforts. Therefore, it is also the Government's goal to restrain inflation to under 3%..."\n\nThe clock ticked to seven-thirty. Butler exited his car, thanked his driver, and lugged his heavy attache case across Cromwell Green. He saw a gaggle of journalists around a podium, atop which was Andrew Fountaine. Butler stopped to watch the commotion. Fountaine spoke of prosperity, cooperation, greater rewards for the British worker; Fountaine spoke of promises that were not his to fulfil. Butler turned his head and walked away.\n\n"Above all, it is the Government's chief aim to provide prosperity and employment for all Britons. Therefore, it is also the Government's goal to create 500,000 new jobs by the end of 1962..."\n\nThe clock ticked to eight-thirty. In the halls of Westminster, a few corridors away from the House of Commons, Butler reassures an increasingly nervous Domvile. Prime Minister, we've had our finest civil servants on the job. Yes, we checked the numbers. Yes, I checked the numbers. Butler felt the pressure which lay on top of Domvile: pressure from above, pressure that was Butler's to alleviate."

britain_budget.2.d:0 ""Mr. Speaker, honourable members, I am proud to announce that the Government has met its economic targets for 1962. We have achieved real economic growth, kept inflation to sustainable levels and guaranteed over half a million jobs for the British worker..."\n\nBarry Domvile looked around the House of Commons, and saw on the faces of the Pragmatists pride and satisfaction. Frankly, thought Domvile, they had bloody well earned it. The results spoke for themselves: economic progress had occurred just as Butler and his lot planned, all laid out in their reports, tabled and indexed and cross-referenced. Rhetoric backed up by results.\n\n"Our work will not end here. The Government is committed to continued economic prosperity, with the overarching goal of full employment for all British citizens. In the coming months, we shall put forward our 1963 budget..."\n\nAcross the chamber, the faces of the Ideologues were more muted. Fountaine, in particular, wore a smile that seemed strained. None of them found this objectionable—it was their economy, too. Indeed, they were quite happy that it was improving. But it was not their victory. When the papers reported on economic growth and new jobs for Britons, it would not be their name they praised.\n\n"With the assistance of our friends in Germany, whose contributions to our efforts have created countless opportunities for Britain, we have the potential for even greater economic growth..."As for Butler himself, he could not keep the pride from his face, and Domvile did not want to wipe it away. The man had proven himself to be an asset, despite the whispers of dissatisfaction that had circled around him for years. If such things were true, he could have tanked the economy and called for greater reform. Instead, Domvile saw an honourable man, a loyal man, and a man who might one day lead this country."

britain_budget.3.d:0 ""It is with great regret that this Government reports a number of shortfalls and setbacks in the implementation of our economic plans for 1962..."\n\nAndrew Fountaine barely paid attention to Butler's excuses. Whatever he said, the numbers from his department spoke more plainly: he failed to meet his precious goals, and now the economy was weak. Though he remained stone-faced, projecting an aura of determination, all around him were frustrated colleagues. Half of the backbenchers in front of Fountaine wore frowns so deep they looked like the corners of their mouth had been weighted.\n\n"The Government pledges to redouble its efforts to meet new goals, which we will outline presently in the 1963 budget. Nothing less than a shake-up of our department will be necessary if we are to deliver on our promises of sustained growth and full employment..."\n\nFountaine's eyes briefly locked with Domvile, who sat behind Butler. There was a mutual disappointment there, sealed by a single shrug from the Prime Minister. Finally, thought Fountaine, he's starting to realise it. The glance broke away quickly, and both men returned to Butler.\n\n"The Government further pledges that we will revisit and deepen our existing relationships with industry leaders, particularly those from the German corporations, to ensure that prosperity remains an achievable state..."\n\nButler was cooler than Fountaine expected; he was anticipating a waterfall down the Chancellor's shamed face. Perhaps he still thought he had the situation under control, that next year might right the wrongs of this year. But all those numbers he relied on to prove his worth said otherwise. In this, there was an opportunity for Fountaine. If the so-called Pragmatists were also empty rhetoric, then why not sign up for the more exciting rhetoric?"

Our economic position has increased by last year's efforts, and so too should our ambitions. Therefore, I will state upfront that it is the Government's goal to attain 4% economic growth by the end of this year..."\n\nThe morning papers said this was achievable; Rab Butler had read with particular interest the Financial Times before work. There was a general sense of optimism about the potential success of this year's economic goals—though a gnawing doubt about the freedom of the Times to voice any opposition kept his mood from ascending too high.\n\n"While our ambitions have increased, our commitment to a sustainable ability has not changed. This Government will maintain our goal to keep inflation below 3%..."\n\nOn the drive to Westminster, Butler's driver tuned the radio to the Home Service. Squawking over the airwaves to some second-rate journalist was Andrew Fountaine, talking about the confidence he had in the upcoming budget. Beneath all the usual rhetoric was some muted praise for Butler; the Chancellor thought he was just hedging his bets.\n\n"In keeping with our focus on increasing our expectations, we believe that now is the time to shift our perspective from creating jobs to reducing unemployment. To that end, the Government will now work towards a new goal of reducing our current rate of unemployment to 4%..."\n\nUp the stairs, towards the House of Commons, Butler saw in the hallways the Prime Minister in conference, surrounded by businessmen. He recognised them as representatives of the German corporations, the men for whom this budget really served. Butler passed by them and opened the doors to the Commons."

They sat down with cigars and talked about what it took to reach this point. They talked about what new heights the British economy could reach. They talked about tensions in the south, in the north, but both were in an elated mood. They knew that England could soldier on.\n\n"The success of the 1963 budget is not the Government's alone. It is thanks to the British worker who laboured for his country and increased productivity. It is thanks to the British employer who doubled their efforts to grow his businesses and increase employment. It is thanks to the British consumer, who recognised the value and quality of British products..."\n\nAs for his next set of visitors, Domvile was less congenial. While closer in thought to these men than Butler, they had not produced results like Butler. Pragmatic perspectives were achieving real results, and all the Ideologues seemed to do was put their spin on other men's accomplishments. He held his tongue for now, but Domvile hoped that this lot might do something more than bash in the heads of strikers in the near future.\n\n"Finally, we have achieved what I consider to be our most important yearly goal: we have reduced national unemployment to 4%. Thanks to the continued investment of our partners in Europe, British industry continues to grow, and employment opportunities for British workers have followed..."\n\nDomvile shook the hands of his final guests and wished them a pleasant evening. He sat down, poured himself a congratulatory scotch and toasted the departing German industrialists. The Siemens man in particular was glowing in his praise for Butler and, by extension, Domvile. Under his stewardship, England was becoming a stabler, more appealing market for European capital."

He was here to bear witness to the Prime Minister's frustrations at Butler. The two sat down in the Prime Minister's office and discussed Britain's lacklustre economic performance. The low mood descended further when they discussed matters on the continent and in the north.\n\n"These minor shortcomings will be resolved presently, pending further planning of the 1964 budget. While we were unable to achieve full employment this year, the Treasury will continue to work diligently so that the goal of full utilisation of our labour pool will be accomplished..."\n\nFountaine set his tea down and broached an uncomfortable subject. The Pragmatist's promises and planning for the economy had failed; to him, that much was clear. He spoke of his own ideas, ones that he, Bean and Hamm had shared on long nights in their offices. He spoke of new directions this country could take, and Domvile steepled his fingers as he listened.\n\n"This Government will persevere, despite the recent setbacks. We will continue to work for prosperity, stability and security. We assure these honourable members that we shall meet all economic goals to be determined in our 1964 budget..."\n\nAfter an hour, Domvile dismissed Fountaine so that he might deal with the rest of his busy schedule. Fountaine lingered in the doorway before properly leaving. He turned to Domvile, and left him with words of warning: Butler's failures would have greater consequences than an economic downturn. Should Butler fail again, they might earn Germany's ire."

But of course, now was a time to expect the unexpected.\n\nHowever, one thing he was very much expecting was the briefing he was receiving in the Cabinet Room regarding the nation's finances - which were, as he also expected, beyond saving.\n\nButler, being the Chancellor for the Exchequer, was giving a full report on the absolute financial destruction the nation was facing. "Attempting to collect taxes currently will be simply impossible in most cases. Massive price rises have been reported in nearly every industry, and strikes over pay rises have started in nearly every industry-"\n\n"If you think that we should yield to these strikes, Butler, you may think on. With the claws of Bolshevism present in every trade union, we cannot afford to show weakness to those rats for even one second." This was Fountaine, who was making an uncharacteristically good point, in Nall-Cain's eyes.\n\n"If you had allowed me to finish, Andrew, I would have agreed - not simply because of the obvious communist influence behind these strikes, but also because we cannot afford to do so. Indeed, not only can we not afford to grant pay rises, pay cuts and freezes are an absolute necessity right now in order to balance our spending to some degree. I would suggest countermanding the effects it will have on the people by introducing price controls. We also need to introduce a system of rationing, for which I would suggest modifying the old plans from the war."\n\nFountaine struggled to think of something he would disagree with there, and couldn't. Butler's plan, surprisingly, sounded just like common sense to him at this critical stage. He wasn't pleased that Butler's two cronies, Wilson and Maudling (also present in the room) were to be given charge of implementing this, but the actual plans seemed sound enough."

We'll need to cut some sort of deal with them on it or else they'll stop us from doing it. I'll speak to Reggie about our options for that, as he understands the way the German corporations think far better than either of us."\n\nMaude nodded his agreement while trying to hide his distaste for Maudling and his shadowy dealings with the Reich and its corporations.\n\n"This will, obviously, result in a great deal of initial inflation, which I would counteract by starting a massive program of council property purchasing."\n\n"We also need to get rid of the wartime price controls. They served their purpose, distasteful as it was, during the uprising, but now they're a complete burden to our economy and are causing widespread shortages of virtually everything."\n\nAfter Maude had finished, Butler finally responded with, "You've been reading my mind throughout, Angus - I don't really have anything further to add to that, because it is exactly the plan I would have proposed in your place.

It all sounded rather sensible to him, and it seemed as though he knew what he was doing.\n\nBean himself couldn't be more pleased at how the meeting was going - he had been called there to prepare the budget, and Fountaine seemed likely to simply accept all his proposals.\n\nContinuing, Bean said, "We also need to prepare the ground to fully transition to a corporatist worker's economy. As such, I would suggest the foundation of corporate bodies to govern manufacturing, farming and forestry, with expansion of those bodies and the creation of them for other industries our principal economic goal for the future...""

Whilst Bedford held the red box that marked his office as Chancellor and was the one presently speaking to the assembled Cabinet, laying out the detailed plans for a steady economic recovery in tandem with widespread restructuring to form a centralised, corporatist economy to mirror the state they were crafting, he was not the one the ministers paid attention to.\n\nNo, that was the man sitting next to him.

Said Chesterton, flicking through pages of his own copy of the new budget, notes in dark black ink covering the pages. "My Ministry stands ready to provide all the assistance the Treasury needs in its new projects and in handling our "guests" from across the channel."\n\nA small chuckle went around the room at the implications of Chesterton's statement, and Bedford moved to his conclusion. "To summarise my lords, ladies and gentlemen, we aim to form several new large conglomerates under our control to work in harmony and co-ordinate their various sectors of the economy. A rural revitalisation initiative will be initiated to restore our precious agriculture and new restrictions upon the foreign corporations shall be negotiated, returning to stable and positive GDP growth by the end of the year shall be our measure of success."\n\nAs the meeting ended, Chesterton gave a slight nod to Greene from across the table. The new budget was perfect, it was in fact almost word for word the same as that which had been proposed in 1953. And that was just how Chesterton wanted it."

Secondly, he was a very inexperienced and junior parliamentarian, and was generally only seen as having been promoted because the Prime Minister wanted someone who would echo his own thoughts on economics. Even the Old Guard of the party were outraged by his appointment, seeing him as an incompetent upstart.\n\nThey were right. Rolf Gardiner was indeed not a competent Chancellor, and did not have any real economic knowledge. Yet he was the man Gerard Wallop turned to today, to build his "Budget to Destroy Usury".\n\n"First of all, Prime Minister, I would suggest building a system of subsidies for rural areas. First and foremost, of course, agricultural subsidies, but also subsidies through the form of credit vouchers for small businesses willing to move away from the cities."\n\n"Secondly, we need to get rid of price controls. They never should have been introduced, and they're a tool of banking which will damage our stock more for every day they remain."\n\n"Lastly, and most importantly, we need to start creating more money in order to give our people the right to debt-free purchasing power. I've written a list detailing our targets for this year."\n\nWallop nodded his assent to all of this. The ideas were ones he had proposed on many occasions, and Gardiner may as well have been speaking with his own voice - which, of course, is why he was appointed in the first place."

"You should have told me earlier that Oliver was appointed as Deputy Finance Manager at Volkswagen! This is a great opportunity for him and I am truly happy for his family. They will serve the company spectacularly."\n\nBennett held the knob to the door, "Sir, that is great to hear. I am right in the understanding that no action should be taken to replace his position here?" Maudling shook his head in agreement.\n\nBennett would shake his head as well, shutting the door to Maudling's office.

Why was it that when the time came for our island to be liberated, our leader Mosley was murdered? Why did they kill him then?"\n\n"The Jews knew their time was up!" bellowed a voice in the crowd, met with clapping and roars of agreement. Hamm nodded.\n\n"Exactly. They were afraid.

Running his old, somewhat shaky, hands over his face, Domvile let out a pained sigh as he looked down on the report before him, a report which had mockingly devoured the past 4 hours of his life and all but ensured he'd be getting no sleep at all tonight. This had to be the third time he'd read it from start to finish, but the sheer trepidation and dread he had felt when first turning the pages never left, and only intensified.\n\nHer Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. The name alone was enough to send a disgusted shiver down the Prime Minister's spine. He remembered when he first heard it, in this very room no less, as he was meeting his old friend and then Prime Minister, A.K Chesterton, in 1954. He remembered how they had both laughed at the ridiculousness of it all, the very notion that some wide-eyed idealists and bitter remnants of the past could possibly pose a threat to the resurgent Britain and her watchful German allies. He remembered how the reports continued in the years that followed, telling of secret meetings and covert raids, warning of a ticking time-bomb ready to explode at any moment. And Domvile remembered when it did explode, and the world came crashing down.\n\nNow, that very same report he had once laughed at sat in front of him again. Setting the report aside, Domvile reached for his telephone and dialled the German embassy. He would not make Chesterton's mistake and pay the price he did, oh no. Now was the time for action, to man the guns and prepare for battle. The Admiral had one last war to fight, and he intended to win."

domvile_focus.2.d:0 "Barry Domvile had long since grown used to the headache that seemed to appear in his head whenever Rab Butler and Andrew Fountaine were in the same room together. Sometimes, it appeared as a heavy thump. Other times, it would be a high-pitched whirring. Whatever it was, it seemed that his body had developed an instinctual intolerance for the senseless, endless bickering that filled the room whenever the two men were forced to interact.\n\n"Prime Minister, you simply cannot abide by some of the measures here, it is obscene! A gross violation of the British people's privacy and personal safety!" Butler said, forcing Domvile to zone back in. Of course he took issue with the Freedom of Security Act - he wouldn't ever turn down a chance to illustrate how much more decent and reasonable he was from everyone else. "I mean, some of the methods are grotesque! Increased usage of the BFC? Greater surveillance in public? A year's prison for curfew-breakers? Insanity!"\n\nA humourless chuckle from across the room signalled that it was time for Fountaine to speak - as if Domvile hadn't heard enough pseudo-Bolshevik filth that day already. "Oh, this act is insanity alright - how can you call it a Freedom of Security Act when you barely increase the funding of the security agencies? And how are they meant to get anything done without authorising use of extraordinary force to interrogate suspects? You're practically begging for another uprising!"\n\n"Oh, you would love another uprising, wouldn't you," Butler spat. "Another chance to gratuitously brutalise your fellow countrymen is practically a gift to your lot."\n\nFountaine twitched irritably. "Why, are you impugning on my character, Butler? I do believe that would come under Section 7, Paragraph 6 of the penal code. Not a good look at all, is it, you gish-galloping moralising twit-"\n\n"CAN BOTH OF YOU BE QUIET FOR TWO SECONDS SO I CAN THINK, IF YOU PLEASE?!" Domvile snapped, slamming his desk for emphasis. Butler and Fountaine both stopped, looking at Domvile. "I will consider SOME revision to the bill, as you have both so helpfully suggested," he said, feeling that all too familiar thumping in his head. "In the meantime, I am going to ask both of you to get out of my office so I can think this over, if you please.""

domvile_focus.3.d:0 ""I'm going to be quite honest, I think he's a load of bollocks. It's too convenient of a scapegoat for them to blame everything on."\n\nHannah and her friends often met on nights like this. They would all wait until they finished their respective jobs before creeping out of their houses and meeting up for a smoke and a quick natter. More often than not, their discussions turned to the various political questions that dominated the nation. On this evening, discussion had turned to the identity of the ever-elusive man behind the Resistance - 'The Boss'.\n\nThe discussion tonight had started over a recent failed police raid of the docks, only minutes away from Hannah's house. This raid, according to Gloria's husband who worked at the docks, aimed to arrest a wing of the Left Resistance operating in the city - she had remembered the outraged shouting of the woman as they had arrived. Yet as the jackboots rolled in, the operation went horrifically wrong; details were scarce, but supposedly 5 policemen were dead and the left resistance members escaped without a single man dead or captured. And so, just as it had time and time again, the local government was left embarrassed and people were left to wonder once again how the resistance, thought dead after 56, was still able to survive after 20 years of persecution?\n\n"You know, things really do seem to be reaching a boiling point," Gloria said excitedly. "I can't wait to see how things will end up. You know, we can't miss this like our fathers did." Hannah paused before replying. She knew Gloria's father had been a conservative before the war, as Gloria was now, and yet she was supporting men she would see as radicals in more peaceful times. She wondered silently, could this kind of unity hold out in peace, as it has in this time of troubles?"

domvile_focus.4.d:0 ""Of course, I'll make sure you have the votes you need." Domvile felt the crushing weight of the world lift off his shoulders for a brief moment as Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth and the BPP's leader of the House of Lords spoke, dispelling the cloud of worry and doubt that had plagued the Prime Minister since morning.\n\n"Good, good that's excellent! Thank you Gerard, this act will be the key to ensuring our safety - I'm sure of it!" said Domvile, his old friend nodding in agreement from the other side of the table.\n\n"I quite agree, these... vagabonds need a damn good thrashing from our boys. One final proper kick to put them down for good," replied Wallop, stamping his cane on the ground for emphasis.\n\n"And a damn good thrashing they shall get, don't you worry." Domvile stretched as he spoke, standing up and making his way over to the drinks cabinet to pour himself a glass of port. Whilst Wallop's news was good, there was still the concerning fact he had even needed to hold this meeting at all. Domvile remembered back in Bedford's day when the Lords would largely obey without question, the great mass of abstentions that always met their bills made redundant by the lack of real opposition. But things had changed since then, and not for the better. The Pragmatists were getting bolder, it seemed that every bill saw a cluster of abstentions turn into votes against, leading to meetings like this becoming a necessity.\n\n"Something the matter, Prime Minister?" Wallop asked, as Domvile turned to face him. No, no, nothing was the matter, he thought, shaking his head and tipping back the port with a slightly wobbling hand. All was well, the votes were assured, the problem of the loyalty of the Lords could be handled some other time."

domvile_focus.5.d:0 "The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary gracefully walked into the specified meeting room with the Reich Plenipotentiary and the Commanding General. It started off cordial, not really getting on topic until ten minutes after Domvile and Nall-Cain entered the room. Nall-Cain started, hoping to update the Germans on the rebel situation, "Well, thank you, but the Prime Minister and I came here to address both of you on the topic of the increased accounts of rebellious activities within Britain. I'll let him handle this..."\n\nDomvile cleared his throat, "Gentlemen, let us make one thing clear. What is happening now will never, under my leadership, escalate to something seen under the leadership of Chesterton or any former governments. There will be no widespread rebellion. What the people of Britain are experiencing now is just simply bandits and thugs bringing havoc across the nation. I assure all of you, this will not escalate."\n\nBoth Germans nodded their heads. Veesenmayer seemed satisfied, granting Domvile a handshake. Wulf, on the other hand, was hesitant. "You seem exceptionally confident, and I would be willing to pledge the support of the Garrison to your government. However, in return, we expect the Wehrmacht to be granted command of the Garrison's officers."\n\nDomvile's face fell, but he tried not to let it show. Another area of governance relinquished to Germania was nothing new. "Of course, this is not to imply British officers are incompetent," Wulf continued, a smug flicker in his eye. "German soldiers require German leaders, after all. I trust this is acceptable?" Domvile sighed internally, knowing he had little choice."

domvile_focus.6.d:0 "Barry Domvile sighed as he leant down into the chair at the head of the briefing room table. Opposite him, Maxwell Knight stood, silently staring down the table. With Domvile seated, the remainder of the cabinet sat down almost at once, their faces carefully blank as they all settled. Veesenmayer stared down the table from beside Domvile his carefully composed face revealing nothing but a slight aura of distaste, and with that Knight began.\n\n"Gentlemen," he said, addressing the room. "It is no secret to all of you that Her Majesties Most Loyal Resistance, or as they are commonly known, 'HMMLR', is the largest known internal threat to our government. Following the Prime Minister's orders for me to expand our understanding of them and their weaknesses," Knight nodded towards Domvile. "I have handed this task to my most capable subordinate, Mr. Kim Philby, who will be briefing us all today. Mr. Philby?"\n\nPhilby stood to his feet. "Thank you, sir. Now I'll be honest, the resistance run a tight ship. I have been unable to find much that we do not already know. Nonetheless, I shall lay out the facts we have established. They are a loose alliance between the Left Resistance led by Jack Jones, and the Special Operations Executive under Fitzroy Maclean. There are two things uniting these incredibly diverse groups, the first is a figure who we only know as 'The Boss', the second is their desire for a 'Free Britain'. That is all we know about them on a broader scale. We have more information on the local scale, but nationally, that's it."\n\n"What do you mean more on the local scale?" Veesenmayer asked leaning forward in his chair, raising his eyebrow in interest. "We are currently looking into some of their cells in Essex but nothing is for certain at the moment." Philby replied. Veesenmayer looked dissatisfied, shaking his head."

John had been leading them on a merry chase from Loch Leven, and now their plan was coming to fruition. Worming his way back through the scrub, Roger signalled to Will to radio off to the second Squad further north. A brief staticky murmur filled the radio and all was ready. Smirking at Will, Roger popped his head above the heath, and gave a sudden holler. The Free Corps men almost squawked in surprise, swinging their hand-me-down Gewehrs around to face Roger as he ducked down below the heath again and began to sprint north. As the hail of rifle fire filled the air, Roger ducked up again. For nearly half an hour, he lured the Free Corps men north the old bank of the heath serving as a perfect cover for his movement. All the while Fort William road drew nearer.\n\nSuddenly, Roger sprinted out onto a bare stretch of ground. The road was right ahead of him, and behind him he could hear the Free Corps bundling forwards. This was the most dangerous stretch of the plan. Roger threw his entire body into the sprint running at full force towards the concealed foxhole. A sudden crack of a rifle behind him, forced Roger even more into the long run. Then he passed the safety line and he hit the ground.\n\nThe sudden scream of a trio of machine guns filled the air as the first and second squads opened fire. Roger could feel the power of the guns thudding through the earth as he dug into the dirt. A lonely rifle shot was fired and then all fell silent. Pushing himself up, Roger looked behind him at the steaming corpses of the Free Corps men.\n\n"Really effective, crackdown eh, Roger?" John snarked as he strode over, steam rising from the Bren gun he cradled in his arms, "Aye, Domvile's just killing off the Free Corps ain't he?" Roger replied as he dusted himself off "Hey, it could just be a crackdown on the Free Corps." The laugh from the two squads was suddenly cut off, as the drone from a helicopter filled the air."

domvile_focus.8.d:0 "A stuffy storeroom in a damp, ill-lit warehouse beside one of Manchester's numerous Reichswerke steel factories was hardly a pleasant location for a clandestine meeting, but it was a secure one, and for the senior members of Manchester's underground industrial union, that was worth more, far more, than comfort.\n\n"So how's it looking John? All your lads on shift A in?" asked Steven, the unofficial leader of the unionised drivers responsible for taking the produced steel to the docks before it was shipped off to feed the endless hunger of the Reich's military.\n\n"Aye, that they are," replied John, a floor manager for the main factory right opposite the warehouse. He'd been slowly recruiting workers to their cause for years since taking up the mantle from his predecessor, dead in the uprising of '56.\n\nThe room fell quiet as the man at the head of the table moved to speak. Unlike the others, the union's General-Secretary had no position in Reichswerke. He was, in fact, currently wanted for high treason, but instead worked solely for the union and the Left Resistance. "Then we are set to proceed when called, I'll tell Jones that Manchester stands ready for the revolution," he said, passing around the report he'd been reading with a smirk.\n\n"The fascist bastards have lent us a helping hand it seems," he joked as the paper was passed from hand to hand, drawing a mixture of reactions, but all positive. "Our recruitment rate has soared since they called in those Gestapo buggers to try and root us out, random interrogations and intimidation don't seem to be working too well for the Krauts."\n\nFinding its way back to the General-Secretary before long, the meeting soon concluded and its attendees vanished back into the night. The following morning, most returned to working and faking contentment under the arrogant gaze of their German overseers, but one thought was on all of their minds, and it was a thought spreading across the minds of every worker chafing under a Nazi yoke."

domvile_focus.9.d:0 "Domvile sat in his office, stewing away in his own paranoia. Day after day, more reports came in reporting new attacks from the resistance, where the culprits struck in an instant and then seemingly melted away into the shadows. With the brutal massacres he was seeing from sunrise to sunset, the Prime Minister was starting to reach a breaking point. He needed the man at the centre of it all. The Boss, the Leader, whatever they called themselves - they needed to be gone. There was only one man he could trust to properly settle the matter.\n\nThree hard knocks rapped upon the door. He stood up, inviting none other than Maxwell Knight in. The man smiled thinly, nodding his head. "Drink?" Domvile asked. Knight shook his head. "Very well," he said, still standing. "Maxwell, you are here for only one reason. And I am sure you can understand why."\n\nKnight shook his head. "Everything on the paper you sent that could've been related was redacted for my eyes, I'm afraid. So no, I am unaware."\n\nLetting out a cough, he started again. "Maxwell, these reports of resistance activity that keep on appearing on my desk must stop, and there is only one way to make that happen. You and the MI5 have only one objective - look into the existence of the individual leading them. 'The Boss', he's called. If they do exist, you find them and hang them by the neck for the British people to point and laugh at. You hear me?"\n\nThe Director-General's face was impassive until the mention of the resistance's supposed leader, wherein he began to look much more interested. He stood up. "I must admit, Prime Minister, I have been blighted by the existence of this individual as much as you. I swear to you, I will track 'The Boss' down. And by the time I am through with him, the entire nation will know exactly who he is.""

domvile_focus.10.d:0 "Over the course of a single day, Britain saw the most radical transformation of her law and order legislation since the establishment of the German garrison, something unthinkable in the Parliament of old. But this wasn't the parliament of old. The outcome had been decided long in advance, MPs from all factions of the BPP said their agreed upon pieces and all eventually voted in favour at the appointed time, true opposition voices in both chambers left completely powerless.\n\nThe entire system was a sham, a farce. A pantomime where the actors stayed on script and performed their assigned roles night after night, all dispute kept hidden behind the curtain to an audience who no longer bothered to watch the inevitable conclusion of the performance. The corpse of democracy, shambling along at its directors' request.\n\nBut not even the producer of this morbid play left the theatre happy. Domvile had every reason to celebrate the closure of another act, all his efforts had paid off after all. Finally, the chains restraining Britain's guardians had been broken, and Domvile could fully unleash her defenders upon those who would do her harm. A perfect victory, but something was still... off.\n\nDomvile couldn't quite place it as his motorcade sped through the quiet streets of London, had he given too much away to Fountaine and Butler? Had he not been firm enough with the Lords? Had he kowtowed too quickly to Germania? The source of his troubles eluded him.\n\nIt was only as his car swung onto Downing Street and he saw Knight standing outside, a grim look on his face and a report in his hand, that Domvile realised what gnawed at him. It was fear. Fear that this Act wasn't enough, that it was just a piece of paper hurled at an oncoming hurricane, one that would tear apart all he had built with nature's righteous fury.\n\nOne that was coming for him, and coming soon."

It would only do to be timely, given the man he was due to be meeting. However, it had been ten minutes, and the man still had not shown up. But just as Sterling was beginning to wonder whether he had misread the briefs, a man sat down next to him. "Wonderful weather, isn't it?" he asked the man, knowing full well who it was.\n\nRecognising the codewords, he responded in kind. "I'm not so sure. It looks like rain." Satisfied that protocol had been followed, Sterling turned to face none other than the spymaster himself - Maxwell Knight. "Apologies for the wait, Sterling. You can never be too sure who'll get their hands on the reports. I'm sure that you understand." Knight said, a polite smile on his face. Sterling rolled his eyes. Knight always had a way of making others accept his many quirks like this.\n\n"Yes, well, I can hardly blame you. The resistance seems to be planting its people where one least expects it, nowadays."\n\nKnight raised an eyebrow quizzically. "I wouldn't say that. They can't be everywhere at once." Sterling scoffed. It was hard to not be pessimistic over the state of the resistance nowadays. They were growing bolder and bolder, and the government seemed to be doing less to contain them. A moment passed as his silence spoke for him. Knight adjusted himself on the bench and turned, looking Sterling dead in the eye. "Sterling," Knight said, placing his hand on the man's shoulder. "We're closer than ever before. I am giving you my personal guarantee that the Resistance are nowhere near as powerful as you believe, and that we WILL get them. Understood?" Despite his misgivings, Sterling found that Knight's words had gotten through to him. The resistance would fall, eventually. Especially with Maxwell Knight on the case. He nodded."

And now he was here, constantly trying to fix what felt like a leaking ship. He could swear, the end was in sight, but he could not know how close it was. The people were beginning to accept him. Perhaps history would look back on him as a hero.\n\nFor now though, he could only look upon his party. Butler seemed to be more active than ever lately. It felt like he couldn't avoid him as he continued to nudge his way in. An ambitious snake, surely, Domvile could understand the look in his eyes too well; he aimed to replace him, once he stepped down. It seems not even a decade under the new order could not wipe out careerism from this blasted country. Still, he couldn't deny that Butler did good work...\n\nYet he looked back upon others. Butler was a naked careerist, but if there was anyone who understood the necessity of strength within Britain, it would be Fountaine. The man had always fought for the fascist cause, in Spain, and here. He was one of the first men to join him. But the men he surrounded himself with... He could hear how they talked when his back was turned... They considered him weak, he could tell! But they never voiced their ire towards him, no.\n\nThey kept it quiet. Side glances, insinuations, the occasional muttered comment. Ah, to be young again. Perhaps he could straighten out things. Today however...

They smiled placidly, vapidly even, nodding along to their PM. Neither of them could see the other, but they could very well guess what their most gracious ally within the party was thinking.\n\nButler could imagine Fountaine, probably gelled his hair too much already, looked more like a helmet than an actual hairpiece. Over eager, as if he would become PM the very moment that the old admiral finally croaked his last bleating speech about unity. He could imagine it all too clearly, even as he saw the Commons politely listening to the man.\n\nFountaine could see Butler in his mind's eye. The old, fat, balding geezer, simply standing there with a glazed look. Perfectly content in the assumption that Domvile would hand over the British People's Party to him simply because he followed the man around like some sort of dog. Britain has no need for dogs however, they need a man, a man like Fountaine.\n\nThe speech ended; they both clapped of course. Perfect uniformity among them, smiled around as the cameras took pictures of yet another successful meeting within the Commons. Yes truly, what a wonderful united party. Butler and Fountaine shook hands, a firm grip in both as they looked into each other's eyes. No one would notice anything but a nice firm handshake, but Fountaine and Butler could feel the squeeze as they attempted to put their hand over. Fountaine would never back down on this, but Butler was not so willing to hand over even the illusion of power to Fountaine. The act was for the Commons, it was for Domvile, it was for the public.

domvile_focus.14.d:0 "To be the man who rules the United Kingdom, one must accrue the support of the many key institutions that hold the nation together. There are two of these groups that are the most influential in answering the question of who governs Britain; the rank and file membership of the British People's Party, and the aristocrats and peers who sit within the House of Lords.\n\nThe Party membership is a widely diverse group. As the BPP is the only legal political party, it is where every up-and-coming bureaucrat, businessman, lawyer, doctor, and aspiring politician throws their lot. Indeed, this tendency of using the party simply to advance one's own career is an issue that the more ideologically-minded amongst the leadership find to be a concerning trend. Nonetheless, as a mass party, winning the support of the membership requires the use of the age-old tactic that can be deployed against any large group with differing ideals - something to unify them. Perhaps at the upcoming BPP conference, an aspiring candidate for future leadership could sway the membership to their side?\n\nThe other, much more difficult group to win the support of is the House of Lords. Whilst the mostly aristocratic upper chamber had started to become politically irrelevant at the beginning of the century, the powers returned to them by the Germans through reversing these reforms made them yet again an important force in British politics. If one lacks the support of the peers, then it is unlikely that he will get very far - their support is needed within any government. This means that to win them over, the prospective candidate must attend to their many needs."

And for its eyes and ears, who else could possibly take up the role other than Veesenmayer, Germany's most trusted representative, and the face of the Reich in Britain? Veesenmayer had been appointed to Britain only a decade ago, appointed alongside Domvile to restabilize Britain after the revolts of the 50s. In their decade of working together, He had come to respect Domvile and admired in some ways the work he had done to save Britain. Domvile had been a fine leader on the whole, keeping Britain safe and working hand in hand with the Reich.\n\nYet it wasn't Domvile, whose encore seemed ever closer by the minute, who currently preoccupied Veesenmayer, but his all too likely successors, Andrew Fountane and Rab Butler. Fountaine offered to keep the flame of fascism burning in Britain and to finish the work of transforming Britain, yet he also offered instability, a young and inexperienced element who could bring Britain back into chaos, just as Chesterton had. Butler had experience, he had that in spades and could offer a calm and moderate hand to guide Britain into the future. But Butler was no fascist, and would only abandon the work laid down by his predecessors, his entourage was also full of untrustworthy elements.\n\nTwo people to lead Britain, both of whom would almost certainly leave their mark on Britain. If he were to meet one, it would certainly help them in their struggle, but who was he to choose?

This year, the two main contenders for the position are the two strongmen in party politics - Rab Butler of the Pragmatist faction, and Andrew Fountaine of the ideologues. Whichever of the two makes the speech, their respective faction will surely be empowered. Now, who shall it be?"

Yet as Domvile observed as he read through the suggested speakers for the BPP Conference, this reputation did not seem to have deterred Wilson rise, considering his suggested role in the Conference.\n\nReading on his history, Wilson had seemingly been a Civil servant during the war, serving with great distinction, supposedly writing half of the Beveridge report himself. Even with the invasion, Wilson stayed loyal, becoming a key figure in the reconstruction of the civil service, eventually becoming a MP in the 50s. But even with this work, not much is known on Wilson's own beliefs, beyond his support for Keynesian economics; it is perhaps because of this he has been christened as 'Snake'.\n\nYet as Domvile looked back to the report, he was still conflicted on Wilson's role in the conference. Wilson was an efficient, seemingly loyal public servant, dutifully acting in Britain's best interest, working to help reconstruct Britain from the misery of the 40s. Yet Wilson was unpredictable, mistrusted even by Butler and if we were to promote Wilson just because he's the best person for the job, it would create a lot of resentment throughout the whole of the Civil Service and within the BPP. With all this in mind, and with a tinge of apprehension, Domvile finally decided upon the fate of Wilson."

Yet every time he read a report on Haller-Cooper, head of the illustrious British Free Corps, he couldn't help but curse them for forcing him to deal with antics.\n\nJordan had been in power as long as Domvile had, rising within the BFC due to his ferocity and efficiency in dealing with Stirling's revolts in the 50s. He'd even end up replacing Amery as the head of the BFC, drunkard that he was, after his incompetence at managing the force was revealed. Hell, according to some, it was Jordan's own squad that finally slayed the demonic Stirling, and brought to an end those dark years.\n\nAnd now Jordan still remains one of the most powerful and controversial figures in Britain, to some a proud representative of a strong Aryan, fighting for both the Reich and the United Kingdom. To others, he is a madman, carelessly murdering innocents on his own wild goose chases, he is best summarised as, in the words of one unnamed MP, "fucking insane". And to Domvile, he is a massive headache.\n\nHe could be placed as a speaker at the BPP conference, which would be a clear show of recognition for his efforts, or we could reject him, and give a clear repudiation of his methods. We could perhaps allow one of his moderates to represent him for the party, but I suppose it would be difficult, like asking which lunatic should run the asylum. In the end, it is up to Domvile to do what he thinks best."

Sensible governance preserved and finessed through generations like the world's finest sculpture. Britain is the birthplace of democracy, brought about not through the fires of revolution, but reform, bit by bit over time. A law is formed not from any single document but formed over thousands of years of experience.\n\nIt is that tradition that is celebrated today. As Butler delivers his speeches to rapturous applause. Fountaine and his small coterie silently seethe at the sight. They had time to speak of course. But their speeches were only politely given their due attention and applause. Those men didn't even say anything particularly remarkable, only reaffirming the previous beliefs of the "pragmatists," filled with corrupt officials, snakes, and moderates.\n\nAnd yet, evidently. The motley band, in a den of corruption, had struck out the fanatics. Their fiery rhetoric and calls for national renewal fell on deaf ears. And why would they not? Britain was doing remarkably well under Domvile. It is only natural that policy would be outstretched as a continuation of his dealings. And that meant doing the sensible thing.\n\nButler was finishing up his particular speech. "Britain carries with it a standard to uphold. Behind us lays more than a thousand years of good governance, let us toast to a thousand years more!"\n\nThe room thundered with applause, drowning out even the loudest grumbling."

And yet for some reason, he had expected the party to get along. The conference was a disaster, scarcely anyone could get a word out without being almost drowned out by the cacophony of arguments. The simmering tensions had finally boiled over, and neither had felt the need to contain themselves to good decorum.\n\nInsults, even a few small objects had flown across the room as speeches degenerated into shouting matches. Butler and Fountaine themselves seemed to contain themselves, just barely, limiting themselves to merely arguments and declarations. But one could barely hear them over the rumbling of arguments.\n\nSome poor men, bless their souls, were simply trying to get the parliament under control. The Speaker of the House of Commons, bless his poor throat, was constantly yelling for "Order! Order!" Eventually, they quieted down, if only because the speaker was speaking so loudly that no one could hear themselves speak.\n\nThe conference at least ended quietly. Fountaine and Butler gave back-to-back speeches, to polite applause across the aisle. They were after all one party. One united party.\n\nLord help him if this was what the next few conferences would be. He thought back to the earlier days. As much as he didn't want to return to the days of the Tories and Labourites, he had to admit despite being opposed to parties, things never broke out this badly in his day."

The pain was immeasurable, and the cost was great, but the British people were resilient folk. Out of the ashes of the old order, would come to a Britain, renewed, reinvigorated, and looking towards the future.\n\nIt is that revolution that is honoured in this celebration. Fountaine speaks to deafening support, as Butler quietly sags, his eyes full of jealousy and resentment. But the revolution had won out over tired old men. It was a natural evolution, why did Butler ever think he could make a message of returning to the old days when it was so clearly evident that this was no longer 1900? No, the people want a revolution, and a revolution is what Fountaine would give them.\n\nOne need only take one look at the world to see why the people would support it. The nations that clung to tired liberalism found themselves conquered, on the back foot, or in an unstable mess. The fascists? These last decades have had the fascist world faced with constant challenges, and yet the world order was undoubtedly that of the new order. The Germans, Italians and Japanese had done within decades what Marxists could not achieve in centuries. The choice was obvious and simple as could be.\n\nFountaine spoke with finality and pride "The past century has been hard on every one of us, but it was not the end of us. And as we survived, we rebuilt and purged the weakness of our society! I thank you all, and swear to every British man, the best is yet to come!"\n\nThe corrupt den of snakes and reformists could only look on as the room applauded."

I know we sidestepped the issue last time we met about the Freedom of Security Act, but we simply cannot afford to ignore it any longer. The House of Lords needs a good cleaning, and you'll be the one holding the duster."\n\nAt this, Wallop couldn't help but smirk. Finally, those pencil-pushers in the Commons had at least realised the mortal peril the House of Lords - and by extension, all of Britain - was in. The corrupt sycophants who let Abs and his ilk pillage their land for mere bribes. The apathetic disgraces who shamed their ancestors by not even bothering to turn up. The flagging spirit of those who were supposed to be defending Britain from the Judeo-Bolshevik menace. It was disgraceful, truly, but not unsalvageable.\n\n"Thank you, Prime Minister. Rest assured, I'll get the Upper House back into shape soon enough." Replied Wallop, drawing a relieved nod from Domvile. But the strained look on his face did not leave, even as he tipped back a glass of freshly poured whiskey.\n\n"Good, good. See if you can't clip the wings of that upstart Fountaine and that weasel Butler whilst you're at it. The BPP is our Party Gerard, ours. We made it. and we'll bloody well keep leading it, no matter what the others think."\n\nTo that, Wallop could only smile, and raise a glass of his own in agreement."

A philanthropist, an agriculturalist, a folk dancer and a writer. But to the Earl of Portsmouth, he had and always would be one of his truest friends. It was all too fitting then, that when he needed advice on the troubled state of Britain, he could turn to the same friend who had hosted him here so often. As the car pulled into a small estate at Springhead, he couldn't help but smile a little at the familiar face waiting outside to greet him.\n\n"Gerard!" Gardiner cried with delight, giving his hand a firm shake. "Please, come in, Marabel will be overjoyed to see you. How have you been, old bean? I hope London hasn't been treating you too poorly?"\n\nWallop chuckled, "As well as it can, with the company one's forced to keep there." His face turned serious, "Though it certainly seems they've treated the country poorly. To tell the truth, I came here as much for your advice as anything."\n\nHis friend nodded, suddenly sobered. "I was hoping you'd say so. You must have seen Fontmell Magna as you drove in?" Wallop nodded. "Half the houses are in disrepair, London's completely forgotten parishes like it in favor of urban cities. Sometimes, Gerard I feel like you're the only one there who truly cares and focuses on the right things."\n\n"Such as Douglas's theories?" Gardiner had always been passionate about the subject, recalled the Earl and in truth Social Credit had made a great deal of sense to him as well. Had it been practical, he might have pushed for it further, but with Arthur's downfall the time had never seemed quite right.\n\n"It's the only way, old friend," insisted Gardiner, fervently.

Yet Brunke found the inspector's attitude to be perplexing.\n\nHe walked around with a clipboard in hand, but he wrote nothing down. They walked along a catwalk with wobbling railings; workers attended to their stations with missing fingers; only half of the employees here had proper protective equipment. Even as he was confronted by numerous workplace safety violations that would make a foreman in Guangdong blush, Shaw did not mark his form.\n\nOf course, thought Brunke, this was just a fundraising drive. By the time they returned to the entrance, Brunke wore a knowing smile. "Thank you for your time, inspector," said Brunke in his harsh continental accent. He held out an envelope with a smile. "I trust that you've found everything satisfacto-"\n\nShaw swiped his clipboard against the envelope, flicking it away from his fingers. "The council is very displeased to see the level of irresponsible management in this factory." Brunke's jaw hung open. "Soil samples taken from the area surrounding this property show an unacceptably high level of chromium. Have you been burying waste illegally?" He sighed. "No matter. This factory is shut down, effective immediately, until the waste has been removed." As Shaw walked back to the factory to shut it all down, Brunke slid in through the side door, raced up his office and immediately placed a call to the Royal Mail, demanding an urgent telegram be sent to his employers in Germany."

He knew Vogel's reply letter would be coming soon. The up-jumped little bean-counter from Siemens was a welcome source of funds to maintain his estate, but it was long past time to remind him just whose land the Germans made their little toys on. A land evaluation proposal letter in line with recent legislation had seemed just the very thing to make Vogel squirm.\n\nAs he entered the dining room, he was greeted by the perfect sight of his wife, son and a truly delicious breakfast. Ruffling his son's hair as he sat down, he turned to his wife with a contented grin.\n\n"You look lovely today, dear. Morning-"\n\n"Excuse me, milord," interrupted a servant who'd just entered the room. "A letter for you from Mr Vogel."\n\n"Don't you ever interrupt me again!" he snapped, causing the servant to pale. Gesturing for the man to approach, he plucked the letter as well as a letter opener from the man's grip. Slicing the envelope eagerly, he opened the letter and began to read. Then he began to chuckle.\n\n"What is it dear?" asked his wife curiously.\n\n"Mr Vogel is eager to reassure us that he was fully unaware of any misconduct on behalf of the facilities on our land, and that he wishes to avoid a formal land evaluation commission" he recited from the letter, chortling.

But how empty it was.\n\nInside was even gloomier than the grey exterior, a hollow house for a hollow man, attended to by a small cadre of apathetic servants and no-one else. Lord Portsmouth felt nothing but pity when he saw the gaunt figure of Lord Tavistock sitting in the living room. The man who had founded the BPP and been Britain's first proper post-war Prime Minister, reduced to a miserable husk of a man.\n\n"Lord Tavistock, Britain needs you now more than ever. The BPP is aimless, drifting without meaning, mired in infighting and intrigue. Please Bedford, we have to act now!" Pleaded Wallop, hoping that somewhere deep within was still that bright beacon he followed so faithfully in years past.\n\n"I appreciate what you're trying to do here, Portsmouth. I really do." A.K Chesterton said, having arrived a few hours before Wallop. He produced a silver flask from his pocket and tipped it back down his throat with a shaky hand. The stench of alcohol filled the room. "But tell us honestly, do you really think we have a chance once Domvile joins us in retirement?"\n\n"Yes, yes I do." Wallop replied, getting up from his seat. He stood before the dilapidated image of his old allies, memories of rousing speeches and excited gatherings rushing to the fore. "England lies at her lowest point since Cromwell. Our land is mutilated by foreign conglomerates, the people sit uncaring at the dangers to their homeland, and arrogant upstarts are on the verge of destroying everything we have striven for. We cannot afford surrender, such an act would be treason in the face of this mortal peril. I ask you, both of you, to pick up your swords one last time and rejoin the fight for Britain's very soul!"\n\nBedford and Chesterton glanced at each other, and when they turned back to face Wallop, he could see some of the old fire flickering away again in their ageing eyes."

"Ah, Gerard. Do you have something interesting for later perhaps? I haven't seen that look in your eyes for a long while."\n\nWallop would completely block Chesterton out of his mind for now. After officially leaving the gates, Wallop would quickly look around and bring the two to the side of the corridor. He soon addressed the two, "Gentlemen, alright. I am sure both of you know that I will host the workshop tonight. However, in preparation for tonight's event, I need both of your help." Chesterton finally got his words in although different than what had previously crossed his mind, "Gerard, I would be glad to help you in whatever cause you serve, especially for the workshops. But I am unsure what would be different than before."\n\nWallop turned his head back and forth, watching the others around the three to check that they weren't listening in. "I hope that both of you listen very carefully because I will not say it again. I need your help, especially in the regards of reaching out to the Lords, especially if the importance of English soil and character is to hold true."\n\nBedford would bring himself to speak up, "Arthur, as much as it may cut into your time today, you have to help us out. It is vital that we bring everyone together here."\n\nWallop patted Bedford's back in affirmation. "Exactly, Hastings. As tonight is a major date for the British people, we must help bring the Lords closer to the people, and it is up to you now to do so.

Burnham quickly pushed himself up off the cushions to look at the floor where Wallop was now making his way to the Speaker's podium. He paused once he reached it, contemplating the room with an unreadable expression. Then, he spoke.\n\n"My lords. This venerable and ancient institution has stood as a beacon of guidance for all Britain since its foundation. As the upper house, it falls to us to distinguish laws of good character from bad," he said, a number of claps following. "I ask you then, how can we do that when the character of this House itself has been plagued by decay and corruption?"\n\nThe clapping immediately dwindled to a halt, replaced by tense murmuring. Wallop was sneering disdainfully at several lords now, including him. Burnham squirmed, reluctant to meet the Earl's stare. Finally, Wallop looked away, "I vow that I shall not let this continue. To remedy this, a commission shall be founded with new investigative powers to restore the honour of our grand institution."\n\n"It's a bluff," whispered Anderson confidently, leaning in. "It's our support he needs, he'd never be so bold as to really do it."\n\n"Of course. Yes," whispered Burnham back. He made a mental note to meet with Vogel to tell the German to keep his mouth shut. So long as he did that, the crazed soil fanatic that was Gerard Wallop would leave him alone.\n\nA full week passed.

"Is something the matter Gerard? You seem awfully low for a man celebrating a triumph." He asked.\n\n"It's just..." began Wallop, setting down his cutlery. "I just can't stop thinking about how much more we could have, we should have done. The Germans still own half the countryside, we haven't even had a chance to make a new English character, and Germania still treats us like a vassal state! We need to do more Barry, we have to!"\n\nTo Wallop's surprise, Domvile's reaction to his tirade was laughter, the first real laughter he had heard from his friend in years. "You've still got the old fire in you eh? Not an old battleship like me quite yet are you! Things may be far from perfect, that is true, but it could still be worse. After all, I don't think the elders of zion are in any state to orchestrate our downfall anymore are they?"\n\nNow it was Wallop's turn to laugh, the victory over usury had been a sweet one yes, but his mind soon became clouded once more as he pictured a grinning Abs rubbing his hands from atop a pile of looted English coin. "Still, I want to do more, I can see all these problems blighting our land and its infuriating not having the power to do anything about it, it's like I'm always stuck in the 30s."\n\nSeeing Lord Portsmouth's zeal and passion was as alive as it was thirty years ago, a question suddenly occurred to Domvile that he had not seriously considered in years, having resigned himself to having no say in the answer at all.

Brian, at first, believed that this was due to the Prime Minister asking for advice following the restructuring of our armed forces, but with commander Wulf appearing at a more consistent rate, the sombre truth dawned upon him.\n\nBritain was nothing more than a glorified puppet of Germania in general, and the garrison in particular.

The National Socialist vision, now permanently etched upon the face of the earth in immutable rock, granite, and glass.\n\nHe had never truly bought into the idealistic side of things in that way, like some others in his party had, but he could understand where the crowds' joy came from. Constant propaganda tended to make one view the erection of a sprawling, ideological monolith to the greatness of their own country as nothing but a good thing.\n\nBut as Barry Domvile put up his umbrella as he walked through the streets of Germania, that fire was gone. In its place was a heavy, stagnant malaise that filled the air. It was similar to the coming of a thunderstorm, he mused. There was something deeply wrong with the city that all the towering spires and grandiose monuments could never truly mask.\n\nArriving at his destination, Domvile shook off his umbrella and entered. There would be a few days of wining and dining with the German elite, and then it would be business. Briefly looking back out at the increasingly dark city, he suppressed a shudder.

He thanked his lucky stars that he wasn't one of the poor sods down in the mines, at least. But the work was still mind-numbing, tedious, and long. So, so long. He barely had time to sustain himself beyond a light breakfast in the morning and a light dinner when he got home at night. The rest of his free time was spent sleeping. The factory was full of men like him. English, working class, born and bred in London with nowhere else to go. So they all just got on with it and accepted whatever the Germans told them to do.\n\nAcross the room, a sharp and angry voice could be heard. It was Herr Funk, the pudgy, balding overseer. He was scolding one of the younger lads for cocking up the assembly. Ernie felt the hatred he had for the Krauts bubbling up to the surface. They were all like that. Unforgiving, uncaring, and harsh for no reason. And yet, they all got to drive around in fancy cars and wear nice suits, while Ernie and the other workers got feck-all. His wages hadn't changed in the five years he'd been working there. Old Bill, who'd been there longest, had said once that the last time he had a raise was 1954. It was all just such a crap situation. But what could someone like him do about it?\n\nAfter clocking out of his shift at 9:30PM, he was approached by a man he'd never seen around the factory before. He said he used to work there, before he left and joined a new business. He then went and said aloud EVERYTHING that Ernie had been thinking that day - about the hours, the pay, the Germans, the lot.

We have received offers of particular excitement from Krupp and Volkswagen, who have offered to set up at least 20 more manufacturing plants across the country each. This will invigorate the job market, bringing further growth and lowering unemployment.\n\nUnfortunately, with the good comes the bad. Whilst Resistance activity has declined drastically from what it once was, they still plague the countryside and the innermost areas of the city. Attacks upon public works projects have increased by three times as much from last year, localised particularly around the West Midlands and the North. In addition, these new investments from the German conglomerates have tethered our economy ever closer to that of the Reich.

domvile_focus.36.d:0 "When Wilson had strode into his office, smiling in that oh so sly way he had seemingly mastered and said he had gotten them a meeting, Butler was apprehensive; he barely trusted Wilson, let alone the unions. Now waiting for the leaders to arrive, he remained cautious. He had a better view of the unions than most of the BPP, though that didn't say much, considering his opposition were those who wanted to ban them and others who wanted to shoot them. He tolerated them, even liking a few of the leaders, but ever since the war, he never could look at them without being reminded of their revolutionary elements, those who wanted to shoot him and stick his head on London Bridge.\n\nRegardless, he still acted as the best connection the cabinet had to the unions, and if this meeting got him closer to N10, so be it. Five men entered his office, all clearly from working-class backgrounds, their faces aged visibly past their years, and their suits tight and ill-fitting. And their eyes, Butler looked into them and saw mistrust, well he'd expected that, but in one he saw visible, burning hatred. He had predicted they would mistrust him, but that kind of hatred was unexpected. Maybe that man was a member of the resistance, barely holding himself back from shooting Butler there and then, or maybe another benign reason. He supposed it didn't matter, and with visible tension, the discussion started.\n\nThe discussions went on for an hour, Wilson sliding in whenever it was clear an argument may erupt. In the end, Butler agreed to work on legislation to improve pay and working conditions in the factory and to negotiate with the companies on their behalf. As they exited the room, giving crocodile smiles, he feared that all this discussion was pointless, that they would turn on him the moment an opportunity presented itself. Butler pushed his worries aside, he supposed these past 20 had made him a cynic but then again..."

domvile_focus.37.d:0 ""Now, can we immediately root Socialism from the minds of these workers? No. But what we can do is..." Barry Domvile nodded blankly as John Bean continued his spiel. In the brief time he knew him, Domvile had deduced that Bean was a funny little man. Fountaine had suggested that he heard his ideas out at their last briefing, and frankly? Domvile could see why the ideologue was so fond of Bean. Sitting across from him, the man babbled at a mile-a-minute, producing paper after paper extolling the virtues of "nationalistic" trade unions - if such a thing were even possible, Domvile was unsure.\n\nThe Prime Minister held up his hand, signaling for Bean to momentarily quieten himself. "So, if I mean to understand all this correctly, you're proposing that we... nationalize the unions?"\n\nBean nodded. "Yes," he said as if it were the simplest thing in the world. Domvile's eyebrow was raised sharply. "But as I have said, these won't be the cowardly, selfish unions we know today. No, these will be patriotic collectives of workers who all work towards the common good of the nation," Bean explained. "Their grievances shall be honest and their needs shall be few. After all, what better way to defeat Judeo-Bolshevism than to purify its ideals?\n\nBean went on for a few more minutes before Domvile found himself unable to take any more. "Mr. Bean... your ideas... shall be considered. Thank you for your time." Bean's eyes lit up with glee, and he thanked the Prime Minister profusely, before leaving his office. As soon as the door shut, Domvile sighed heavily. This was Fountaine's best man? He would have made an excellent writer, certainly, but governing was more than a manifesto. And yet... Fountaine trusted him. That man knew what was good for Britain, and if he believed in Bean, then Domvile supposed he had to as well."

domvile_focus.38.d:0 "The life of Aleksy Zadroga had been a long, hard, and miserable one. Born under the boot and seemingly destined to die under it, his spark of rebellion had all but died out. Born in Imperial Russia, he was only a child when Poland was finally liberated, a free nation once more after 100 years of tyranny. But that freedom was short-lived, a flicker of hope in centuries of misery. By the time, he was old enough to enjoy the freedom of his nation, he was sent to war, fighting a desperate defence against the Germans. It was all for nought, and Poland fell once more.\n\nFrom there, his life remained static, working in a concentration camp for 20 years, upon the ashes of his former country. Day after day, he performed backbreaking work, constructing the weapons that would be used to terrorise his people. Today was no different, except the parts were seemingly a different make than usual, he took a closer look at the label, seeing a foreign label, but it was familiar to him. Then it dawned on him: it was a British label on the product, something he had not seen since he was a minor Polish Soldier.\n\nHe had remembered hearing about the fall of Britain through desperately listening to the muffled discussion between the guards. While he was distraught by the news, he had hope. Britain would not go quietly, the population would not surrender, and they would fight on, never giving the Germans the satisfaction of a victory. Yet there was a British label in the Camp. Britain, who had stood up for Polish independence when Nazi domination seemed certain, was now trading freely with the Reich. If Poland's greatest ally was working with the Reich, what hope was there for Poland?"

She'd protested, of course, but he really did need an excuse to work his old bones. Mind you, he was hardly a spring chicken, at the ripe old age of 72. But it was better than just sitting around all day. Madge had just finished telling him about how his second granddaughter had just gotten engaged to a nice lad from Liverpool when Bill heard a loud voice echoing from the town square.\n\n"Young lads of Britain! Are you tired of your average lives? Would you like to serve your country? Then come on over 'ere and sign on up to the British army! We want you!" A middle-aged man with greying dark hair and a pencil-thin mustache was handing out leaflets emblazoned with what looked to be a bastardized version of Lord Kitchener in a German army uniform. Beside him sat a rather severe-looking man at a table, who was taking down the names of what Bill found to be the most offensive part of the display - a queue of young men who were cluelessly signing up.\n\nMadge, who had long since known when to pick up on her father's mannerisms, swiftly moved to try and assuage him. "Dad, come on. It's not worth getting all worked up about."\n\nBill scoffed. "I'll feel however I bloody well please, Madge. Bloody disgraceful. Don't them lads know who they're really signing up to fight for?" She rolled her eyes.\n\n"You were in the army for both wars, there's no point getting all angry about it." Bill felt his wizened fists clench.\n\n"I was alright! Fighting against the bloody fascist scum that they're about to sign up for! Where's the fight in 'em? Don't they even care what we fought for?"\n\nMadge sighed and shook her head. "Come on Dad. Shop's this way." And so the two walked past the recruiter, but not before the old soldier shot an utterly poisonous look at the man in the square."

Haller-Cooper, based on information gathered by agents in the Glasgow area, launched a raid on the so-called "sons of Wallace" rebel group, burning their hideout to the ground and seemingly murdering their inhabitants. This fire would later spread, burning down a restaurant nearby. While the resistance cell is dead, we are no closer to finding if they were acting independently or part of the larger origination. Activities like these, and his continual collateral damage, led me to suggest once more to reduce Jordan's role in dealing with resistance activity.\n\nUpon finishing reading the report summary, Domvile looked up to Knight, "Maxwell, I've read this kind of report a hundred times before, you know we can't get rid of Jordan. He may be over-reliant on brute force but he is not only dedicated to wiping out the resistance, he's also one of our best connections to our friends in the Pakt, which we need in such dangerous times." After a quick reflection, and a short sigh, Maxwell replied "I'm aware he's liked by some in Germania, especially within the SS, but his methods do more harm than good. He's making my life and the lives of agents harder and the brutality only makes the population fear us more."\n\n"Now, I know you don't like him," Domvile said "but he's one of the main men standing up against the hordes that are trying to break Britain, and I need every hand on deck in dealing with such a threat". Maxwell stayed silent for a minute, before responding carefully "Sir, if I may be so bold, the members of our security service did most of the work here. Jordan merely... finished the operation, and in a rather poor way."\n\nDomvile stood up, guiding Maxwell towards the door "Of course, my friend, we cannot overlook such brave men, especially when Britain finds itself in such a precarious state. I'll pass on your advice to Jordan, and tell him to be careful in the future. We're all on the same side here, after all, fighting for King and Country.""

They had been dispatched by the Garrison to root out the Judeo-Bolshevik partisans they had heard were hiding out near the city's docks. This would be a glorious victory for the fatherland and for their friends in Britain. Yet, the young man could not help but be filled with dread as they approached the docks under the cover of darkness. The men next to him were clearly bothered as well, glancing from side to side at every minor noise. Something was wrong, they could sense it. All of a sudden, their commanding officer held up his hand. "Schnell!" he whispered harshly, commanding them to stop. For a moment, all was still.\n\nAnd then, from the shadows, a Zhdanov cocktail came flying, killing at least 4 men.\n\nAs if they had been hiding in the dingy street itself, several armed men bedecked with various weapons and clothing painted with Communist symbols emerged, leaping upon the German force like a venus flytrap. The sounds of gunfire filled the night, as the discombobulated Germans desperately tried to fight back. Hans could only watch as his comrades were beaten, knocked out, and gunned down in front of him. This wasn't supposed to be how that night went. They were the German army, the greatest military force in the world, the heroes of the Aryan race that were destined for greatness. And here they were, being slaughtered like pigs by mere partisans. He had to leave. He needed to report back to the garrison, so they could arrive with reinforcements. Desperately trying to ignore the cries of his fellow soldiers as they screamed for help, Hans ran back in the direction they had came.\n\nBut before his mind could muster anything other than senseless fear, a sharp, splitting pain travelled through his head, knocking the soldier to the floor. "And where d'you think you're goin', ey lad?" a voice shouted at him from above. Fuzzily, Hans could make out the outline of a well-built man who was holding a large, blunt pipe. His vision cleared somewhat, and suddenly he could make the figure out - it was Jack Jones, leader of the Left Resistance. The man crouched down and looked the soldier in the eyes. "I'm not sure how much English you speak, so I'm gonna keep it simple. I've been fighting Fash bastards before you Germans even entered Britain. We fought you then, an' we'll fight you again. You lot are done." And with that, he brought down the pipe on Hans' head, turning it dark."

Yet, the Union Jack patches on their uniform signified something other, something perhaps worse; they were the British Free Corps, an extension of Germany's hand on the Isles, and staffed by the worst traitors and fascists Britain could offer. Jonathan had heard the rumours about them, government forces struggling to keep things in order, then the BFC came and all was done in a day, leaving nothing but bullet holes and smoke.\n\nBefore he could even turn and plead with the captain for an attempt at retreat and escape, an explosion ripped through the complex. He spun round, baffled from where it had come from, maybe the Fascist poison had seeped even in the deepest parts of the Resistance. He wouldn't have time to take those thoughts any further, as out of the smoke and fire, a man in a coat and no helmet emerged, quickly approaching him. Flanked by four other men, his face was twisted into a seemingly permanent smirk, oblivious to the corpses lining the hall. Jonathan struggled to get up, only just noticing his legs had been buried in the fallen concrete of the ceiling. He could only hunch as the man in the dark coat approached him, a flash of confidence and disgust in his eyes, "Fu-Fuck you, you fascist cun-" his sentence was cut short by a single shot to the head.\n\n"Alright, men."

He had brought an entire platoon of his soldiers with him because they had received rock-solid information that SOE operatives had been seen around this small village. All week, they had searched the place top to bottom, going door-to-door and questioning the locals. And yet, they had been met with no results.\n\nHe glanced behind him. A bunch of tired, restless, and rowdy soldiers met his gaze. Even if by some miracle they did find out where the SOE had scurried off to, there was no way that this slovenly lot would be able to take the battle-hardened partisans. Looking back to the old man, he shook his head. "Well, alright then, sir. Be sure to report any suspicious activity to the police, if you see it. Thank you for your time." The old man nodded, and went back inside. Frank turned back around to his platoon, raising his voice. "Alright lads, we didn't catch 'em today, but they can't hide forever. Back to HQ. Quick march!" And thus, the soldiers marched back to their base.\n\nThrough his window, Davey Stewart watched the soldiers march off, unbeknownst to them. He waited a few minutes, until he was entirely sure that they would not be back. He slowly crept out of his house, walking over to the barn that stood behind his small cottage. He rapped his knuckles twice against the door, and opened it, craning his head inside. Although the barn itself was dark, the small ray of sunlight that escaped in through the cracked door illuminated the many SOE members that had been hiding within it.

When involved in the wild goose chase that was trying to capture Fitzroy Maclean and Jack Jones, after all, it was a constant companion. The Prime Minister found himself growing ever more tense as he flicked through a stack of reports on the status of the two partisans. Again and again, he read the same result - total failure. He threw the stack of papers onto his desk and groaned, burying his head in his hands. How on God's green earth did a deranged Scotsman and a puffed-up union boss manage to evade them in such a way? Domvile had set his best men upon them and yet they still came back empty-handed. He was at a loss. One would think that they knew something that the government didn't.\n\nSuddenly, an awful thought came to mind. His eyes widened. No, it couldn't be possible. The Party had faced instability before, but never on this scale. He shakily picked up the reports and kept looking through them. The one unifying factor that ran through them all was that the Twins always knew where and when the troops were coming. Jones ambushing patrols. Maclean leaving a bomb behind in the barn that he was said to be hiding in. A cold shiver ran down his spine. There was no other way. Someone in government had to be working against him. But who? Who would do such a thing?\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by two sharp knocks on the door. He snapped out of his state. "Come in!" he barked, trying to hide the panic he had been feeling from whoever was outside. Through the oaken doors came Maxwell Knight, clutching a pile of manila folders.\n\n"Good evening Prime Minister. The latest load of reports on the Twins." he said, nodding at the pile.\n\n"Oh, yes, very good. Just drop them on here, Maxwell," he murmured. As Knight put the files down, Domvile placed his hand on his wrist. Knight looked up at him quizzically. A moment passed. "Maxwell... As someone with a background in espionage, I want your honest opinion. Do you think anyone in the Cabinet would betray us to the Twins?" For the briefest of moments, something indiscernible flashed across Knight's face. Then, he responded."

Bean felt almost sympathetic, a working man had a way of feeling out of place sitting in high government offices. He would know that better than anyone.\n\nTheir leader didn't seem to share his empathy. "We've heard your arrangement, Mr. Bean. And we're gonna be straight with you, because you've been straight with us. It's stupid. We don't like it and our people won't like it. You want to end strikes? This isn't the way." A series of mutters from his companions showed the sentiment was unanimous.\n\n"My offer is generous," insisted Bean, flicking a thread off his suit. "You and your...associates will retain positions in this reorganization. The only changes will be around the creation of new positions to streamline national organization, and further regulations around anti-British agitation. Something no good British Union should be engaged in either way."\n\nAnother one of the bosses scowled, jabbing a finger at him. "Now look here, Bean. You can call it what you want, but we know what this is. You keep at this, people could get, let's say, demotivated." The boss's tone made the threat clear.\n\nBean snorted. "Oh a strike, you mean? Why yes, you could do that. And I'd be in quite a bit of trouble. But so would you, once Daimler-Benz caught wind. So here is my offer again, Mr Fredericks. Work with me, or take your chances challenging them."\n\nGrumbling, they gradually assented. Yet as the union bosses got up to leave, one of them turned to him. "I know you think you're clever.

Now the two men responsible for this excuse for an army stood stone-faced in the stuffy military warehouse across from him, General Walker wearing a carefully neutral expression, while Templer openly scowled.\n\n"Everything we have seen today confirms this as necessary, Herr Walker. The British Armed Forces have proven themselves incapable of suppressing partisan activity. This can be corrected, but it will need guidance from those with the proper experience."

He had said that some other science would be more rewarding of his talents - that he 'deserved better'. Yet David had his passions, and he had graduated all the same. Twenty years on, with much less hair and much more bitterness, he often wondered if his father was right.\n\nEven without the added stresses of the German invasion that had almost put David out of job because of employment guidelines, the career was a thankless, joyless job. And on top of all that, funds had been extremely limited. David's two decades of work were unremarkable. None of the groundbreaking discoveries he had set out to make all those years ago, just largely uninteresting weather reports.\n\nAs he pulled up to the office in his cheap car, there was no reason to think today would be any different from the myriad others he had spent wasting away here. And yet, as he looked through the recent data, his brow began to furrow severely. Grim patterns were emerging in forecasted weather for the next year. More and more winds blowing from the east, lower temperatures - the lot. All these scattered reports that led him to one dark conclusion; a truly awful winter was coming to Britain, one the country hadn't seen in a century. He frantically went to work, writing a report that detailed the worsening weather, alongside the measures that could be put in place to avert disaster. As he went to post the letter, he could only hope that the men in Downing Street would take his warnings to heed.\n\nIn London, paper was received swiftly and placed in a ministerial box.

Michael and his squad had already been forced to airlift five people from their frozen-over homes in the last three days alone, such was the state of the country.\n\nWhen reports of snowbound policemen that caught in the snap freeze whilst training new recruits came in, the pilots were once again sent out into the biting cold. He could feel the frost seeping into the rattly machine. Would it have killed the engineers to have added some sort of insulation to these things? As a way to distract themselves from the cold that had them all shaking in their boots, Michael got to talking with his co-pilot Sam, as he often did.\n\n"We were really bloody unprepared for this, you know. I mean, my mother almost froze to death in her home last week, barely survived, she did. The government my Ma grew up in wouldn't have been this poorly prepared."

Said Domvile, relieved that most of the cabinet had been able to come, Fountaine and Butler among them. "Projections show that if we fail to act, hundreds could die of the cold as our energy grid is strained to breaking point. In a worst-case scenario, whole villages could freeze to death as the heating fails."\n\n"We need to move quickly and mobilise our workers to increase energy output," suggested Fountaine, drawing approval from many of those assembled. "With proper motivation, our miners should be able to temporarily increase our coal reserves enough that we can meet the increased demand."\n\n"For once I agree with you Andrew." Said Butler, surprising his rival. "However, we should look to see if our German friends can't help us through this crisis as well. We are in a 'Unity' Pakt after all, they can't exactly refuse to help an ally in need."\n\nOver the next few hours, an emergency response plan was drawn up and sent out to the relevant ministries to implement as a priority. Whilst pleased to see the cabinet working together for once, Domvile knew this was only the beginning of what was needed to counteract the potential crisis before it became a real one.

He wasn't just mining for a paycheck at the end of the day, but for the whole country, to keep the lights on in their darkest hour. But now he felt only a trace of that pride. The old unions had been obliterated in a matter of months, he was soon told that he'd be working for Reichswerke from now on, and then the briefest glimmer of hope was crushed under the garrison's jackboot. So when he was called in once again to work hours of overtime "For the country" he felt but one thing. Anger.\n\nNot that he was helping avoid an energy crisis and saving hundreds of lives, that he was quite proud of and was the only reason he hadn't handed in his resignation already. What made him angry was that if the gaggle of spineless traitors in Westminster spent more time finding solutions to the problems their collaboration caused than shining German boots, they might not be in this mess at all, and he could be at home instead of slogging it out in the mines.\n\nAs Peter collapsed into his bed that night, exhausted, the anger refused to cool. He'd be back on another double shift tomorrow, paying the price for Domvile's ineptitude. He knew most of his fellow miners felt the same way, he'd heard it in their voices and seen it in their eyes. The collaborators might have dodged this crisis through his own hard labour, but something far, far more devastating was brewing in the hearts and minds of people across the country."

domvile.75.d:0 "This is a public service broadcast regarding the practice of coal hoarding, and what YOU can do to stop it in your community. Observe in the graph to the right, the average recorded winter temperatures in Britain from the year 1800 to the present. Temperatures such as the current year's can lead to rapid hypothermia if not insulated, which unless dealt with promptly, will lead to slurred speech, confusion, organ failure and unconsciousness, followed by death.\n\nHypothermia occurs when the body loses the heat it needs to regulate itself, and is caused by prolonged exposure to extremely cold temperatures. To prevent hypothermia in your community, it is critical that your community maintain its local supply of government issued coal, and that your family obtains its regular ration as issued by your community's local council. To ensure a steady supply of government coal for all families, citizens are advised to keep watch for coal hoarders.\n\nWhat is a coal hoarder? A coal hoarder is an individual in your community who, by theft or bribery, attempts to solicit coal not assigned to them, either for themselves or to provide to terror cells operating in cold locations. Coal hoarders and coal thieves operate by taking coal from your community directly, and can be conclusively traced back to the decrease of coal rations in several communities.\n\nWhat can you do to stop coal hoarders? Coal hoarders should not be confronted directly, as a number have been linked to terrorist activity. To keep YOUR community safe, YOU can do the following.\n\n1) Report homes heated in regions deemed non-critical by the government. If there are homes in your neighborhood heated despite non-critical conditions, it is likely that home is being heated with stolen coal.\n\n2) Take only your allotted ration of coal. Coal theft is a criminal offense, and will be met with the harshest legal penalties.\n\n3) Report suspected coal hoarders to your local law enforcement or constable. Only with YOUR help can they identify coal hoarders and stop them from hurting your community."

Which he had bought 2 weeks ago with his pensions, only barely being able to afford a week's worth since prices skyrocketed. He grunted in frustration as he found nothing but fine black powder, extinguishing all hopes of heating his home. He knew he would have to make do, but his main concern was his wife. Margaret's shivering had intensified these past few days despite his efforts to keep her wrapped up. Disappointed. The pensioner started his trek to the bedroom to join his wife. The loss of sensation in his extremities made navigating the home a daunting task, the feeble man had avoided a close shave when he nearly tripped on the stairs.\n\nFinally under wraps, the layers of blankets did nought to stop the bitter cold from biting into Graham's old frail bones. The freezing man looked at his wife, the sight of her pale face and shaking body filled him with a deep sense of inadequacy. She had stood by him - through thick and thin - all his life yet he could do nothing to help her. The husband reached out to hold his wife's hands, yet it was as if he was holding bony icicles.\n\n"I'm sorry dear. I'm so sorry that I couldn't keep you warm." He mumbled to his wife, unable to expend the energy to speak any louder.\n\nAfter several moments she finally whispered back "There's no need to say sorry. This'll pass. I shall always thank God for all you've done."\n\nThey both exchanged one final glance into each other's eyes before finally succumbing to the cold."

ENG_DOM.0.desc:0 "Hitler is dead.\n\nDomvile did not take the news well, it is said he wept for an hour before leaving his study, to give an official statement to the press. To Domvile, Hitler may not have been perfect, but he was the saviour of Europe and the liberator of Britain. And once sorrow faded, fears crept in; without him, what was to become of the Reich, what was to become of Britannia?\n\nTo Fountaine, the news was deeply sorrowful, for one of Humanity's greatest minds was lost to us. Hitler had liberated Europe and allowed the greatest members of British society to rise unrestricted by old morals. Yet beyond this, Fountaine was more concerned for Britain itself, without its great benefactor, what was to become of the BPP and Britain. How was the new order able to survive without its greatest champion?\n\nFor Wallop and all the great lords of the BPP, the news brought upon them fear, overwhelming fear for their future. For though their opinions on Hitler varied, and their support for National Socialism was minimal, Hitler had brought one thing back for them, Power, Power over the great masses of Britain. Without Hitler's eternal support, the death of Hitler may not just be a death blow for the Reich, but old dynasties of Britain as well.\n\nAnd Butler? He gave his deepest regards to the German minister and gave a tearful address to the press, yet Butler felt no sadness for Hitler. Oh, Butler felt fear, fear for the stability of Britain and the collapse of the economy, fear for his own personal future. Yet beyond his false sorrow and fears for the future of Britain, Butler felt a ting of glee, of happiness, for the Tyrant who had destroyed the Britain he loved.\n\nAnd for the public, the great subjugator is dead, and the future of Britannia lies in flux."

Before Domvile could start to politely begging him to say, pleading with him to remain to keep Britain from falling into chaos, Veesenmayer spoke up "Domvile, in light of the instability within both Britain and the Reich, I have been instructed to remain Britain until the situation here and at home passes. In this effort, the German garrison will remain in Britain, and keep order and security, whatever the cost."\n\nIn response, Domvile could only splutter out quick thanks and praise for the wisdom of the German Reich, giving silent thanks to God for his obvious generosity. Following further discussions on the nature of cooperation between British and German forces, it was eventually decided that the German Garrison should be temporarily integrated within the British high command in order to ensure a coercive, efficient military. Before he left, sweat streaking down his face, Veesenmayer gave a final word of warning \"I may not be able save all of the Reich from anarchy, but this island will hold, no matter how much blood is required to do so.\""

ENG_DOM.2.desc:0 "For many British workers, the end of the Blitz had only ushered in a new era of hardships. While German planes no longer rained hell down upon their homes and businesses every night, a more silent, invisible enemy had taken their place. The spectre of hunger and poverty crept across the nation, as the government floundered in its efforts to rebuild the country, too wrapped up in its own internal squabbles and arguments to care.\n\nIn an environment like this, small business suffered, and the greengrocery owned by one Alfred Roberts was no exception. A local alderman with a happy family, his business was affected just as much by the post-war devastation. However, they had still fared better than most had, managing to continue living comfortably. With this in mind, it would thus come as a genuine shock to anyone who knew the family that Roberts' daughter Margaret had been helping the resistance by making bombs for the last five years.\n\nShe had initially done so out of spite. As a woman of ambition stifled by the lack of social mobility provided by the government, she felt it proper to put her unused chemistry knowledge towards a cause that would chip away at the establishment that kept her there. But after having met with local resistance members on and off for the past half a decade, Roberts had slowly began to sympathise with their cause. It was a perfect relationship - nobody would suspect her as the resistance grew in size and strength.\n\nIt was a rainy Thursday morning when she dropped her last package off. She deposited a large parcel wrapped in brown paper at her usual deposit point, before walking away again, acting as if nothing had happened. Little did Margaret Roberts know that she had just set in motion a series of events that would change Britain - perhaps forever."

Alas, that all but a memory now, the London stock exchange crashed and burnt with the rest of the empire, the building scorched by the blitz and decimated by the German invasion.\n\nAnd now, 20 years later, the exchange falls once again, not because of any resistance bomb or German rocket, but as the British economy falls once more, pulled down by the German Eagle. With the chaos of the German succession crisis, the conglomerates that control so much of the once dominating British economy have been forced to pull out, with fears over future conflicts within both British and the rest of the Reich's empire.\n\nWith this, the London stock market has fallen into chaos, stockholders seeking fruitlessly to sell their stocks for whatever price available. All hoping, begging that the meagre funds they get from this is enough to save them from bankruptcy. It will not be.\n\nFor a few years now, there has been a growing hope in Britain that after all this turmoil, after 20 years of slow, tumultuous recovery, that Britain might have finally reached the end of its troubles, and a peaceful future was all that was ahead.

Despite all this, in his 10 years at working there, Harold could not remember a day when he'd see the street void of all bystanders.\n\nOn approaching the building, he first noticed that most of the building was boarded up, its windows covered in steel and wood. The main door had a barricade set up around it, hastily built of tables and chairs from within the building, barbed wire dotted around it. The strange thing was however that the barricade at the front was seeming half done, with a human sized hole offering an entrance into the building, which Harold, with some depredation, moved into the building through.\n\nInside, Harold found the building in a delperated state, chairs and tables dotted around the room in various states of disrepair. Papers were strewn about, a few evidently torn up while most were just left on the floor or desks. Yet the most notable and out of place sight in the large room was the rather large number of men and women, their weapons a mismatch of German, American and even old British rifles from the war. As Harold stepped closer, he was noticed, as more and more heads turned to face him; the youngest one, who couldn't be more than 16, put their old battered gun on him, seemingly anxious to shoot. But then, the oldest man, in his late 60s, turned to him, offering a small smile, before asking him:"

Maclean and Jones were among that trio, yet another man had now finally joined them. That man was before them delivering their life's work. "If you seek proof that our masters are little more than paper tigers, unfit to rule over us, look no further than their inability to catch the man of their greatest obsession, only to find not by their own actions, that that man hid amongst them. My name is Charles Henry Maxwell Knight, and for years I worked in MI5. For years however, I have also led Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance."\n\n"I'm sure those amongst you remember Cable Street. In 1956 when our brightest hopes were dashed by the clubs of Germans. I ask you to remember that day, but not to despair on it. Alexander and Stirling gave their lives for our cause that day, and out of it we moved to cover our resistance in the shadows. I am now stepping forth out of those shadows. Remember not only Cable Street, but remember those across the seas that today resist, remember our own people who were taken from their homes and have never returned, and most importantly, remember what Britain once was before the fascists crept onto our Isle. I ask you to hold these but not to despair, for now we cry out Revolution. Revolution of the highest magnitude."\n\n"We stand at the crux of their New Order, at its moment of shattering. Rise, Rise those of you that truly believe, and hold to themselves a truth that Britain's torch will never be extinguished.

Still, this was why he took the job of Prime Minister. He couldn't trust anyone else with this job, especially since the resistance seemed to be getting bolder. Damn them, damn them all! Didn't they understand that this was better for Britain? And what did they want to accomplish in its place? All this violence, for nothing more than the destruction of Britain.\n\nThe very thought made him sick. But at the very least today, he could start to rest. And if nothing else, it seemed that Maxwell Knight was making progress on the resistance. Thank God for that, with the instability in Europe, it was more important than ever that Britain remain stable. He'd take the red box upstairs, he could read it there. At least he'd end the day with some good news after today.

Following, at Domvile's own request, a minute of silence for the former Führer, the cabinet moved on who they should recognise as the new Führer, the new Master of Europe. Though there was a few minutes dispute, arguing over legitimacy and who'd best serve Britain, it was eventually decided to ultimately support the chosen successor, for at least with him, there was a chance stability may remain at home.\n\nAfter a few more 'minor' problems, such as attempting to stop the British economy collapsing, the meeting was adjourned, each cabinet member scarpering off to their own little holes. As they left, Domvile could only look to his hands, which hadn't stopped shaking since he'd heard the news of Hitler's death.

The commander stared closely at him, before barging past him, moving towards Knight's office.\n\nInside the office, paper was strewn across the room, every document seemingly missing or destroyed.

Back in the 30s and 40s it was a key defense of the British isles; the linchpin of the Irish Sea. Yet now it has been left to decay. The bigwigs in Westminster don't consider renovating the base a high priority, and most folks who sign up for the RAF consider an assignment to this small island as a sentencing to mediocrity.

"We could destroy the base, and prevent HMMLR forces from getting their hands on our weapons and planes."\n\nHawkins shook his head immediately at the suggestion. "No," He said firmly, once more looking over the hangers. "We may be isolated from our forces, surrounded on the coast with the threat of HMMLR attacks, but I will not surrender this base to them unless it's over my cold, decaying corpse. They will have to bomb this island into the stone age if they want it."\n\n"Get out a notepad," Hawkins ordered. Once he saw his assistant holding his pen just above the top of his notepad, he started. "I want a drill before any HMMLR forces decide to attack; get the men ready to defend the island at a moment's notice. I want forces stationed on all major overlooks facing towards the mainland. We'll need bunkers to defend the beaches. And I want an inspection of our armory. I don't want any of our weapons breaking when we need them. I want this base to be as ready for war as it was in the 1930s."\n\nHawkins gave another glance over his base and its hangers.

While still anxious from the evacuation of the Isle, he held his head in shame. It was only natural for him to do so after such a humbling defeat. The pride and confidence in his men alone was enough to shatter his soul to see them succumbing to the HMMLR.\n\nHe had not tracked the time while on the ship, so he was shocked to hear the slipway slam against the cold docks of the mainland. Once he had heard the slipway, another thought entered his mind that eventually overwhelmed him. What did the Government think? After a few minutes of pacing alone, one of his soldiers called him up to the main deck. He sighed deeply and hoped for the best. Awaiting before him was General Edmund Bacon, one of London's most politically connected officers. He formally greeted the general and after a moment of quiet, the General expressed his sorrows.\n\n"Sir, God bless you and your men for what you faced on that isle. You know I probably couldn't have done better myself. Not to offend however with better coordination between your position and ours, we could've maybe crushed them before they ever crossed the sights of even a sniper. But that's just wishful thinking."\n\nGeneral Bacon looked over to see Colonel Hawkins gazing aimlessly at the surrounding port. He scratched the bottom of his chin and tried to help out the seemingly depressed Hawkins.\n\n"If you're thinking that London's wanting to exile you, you're mistaken my friend. I talked to the Prime Minister not even ten minutes ago and he told me that the resistance you and your men against the HMMLR was spectacular by itself. And as a General myself, I can tell you that with the amount of time spent on that isle, they won't be reaping the rewards of their victory until they're all six-feet under.""

Part of him was still mentally occupied with how dire the situation seemed to be on the mainland. Apparently the resistance had been upping attacks as of late, with a small force being sighted further south. A patrol had been sent to deal with them, but he had heard nothing back yet. Hawkins' fears were assuaged, however, when he spotted a familiar armed truck trundling towards him in the distance.\n\nIt came to a stop directly parallel to him, as what looked to be the entire patrol filled out and stood to attention. "At ease," he said, saluting them. "How went the mission, men?" He already knew the answer. Their faces were relaxed and their expressions light. He had faintly heard the sound of jaunty banter coming from within the truck before they had came out of it. It had gone well.\n\nJenkins stepped forward. "You'll be happy to know it was a great success, sir. All 3 boats were sunk, and any of the blighters that made it to land were dealt with. No casualties on our side." he said, not without a satisfied smirk. Hawkins had half a mind to discipline him, but he couldn't. Everyone on the Isle needed a win where they could get one.\n\nHe nodded, grinning back lightly. "Jolly good. You are all dismissed for the day, then. Good work." The troops cheered, making their way into the base to presumably tuck into their rations for the night. Once they were gone, he sighed. That was another day they held out. He dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief, before looking back out at the skyline. How many more perfect victories would they get?"

Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins grinned ear to ear as he approached the plane, looking towards the young pilot by the name of George O'Connor sitting in the cockpit and yanking off his helmet. Only five planes unaccounted for.\n\n"We did it, sir!" George O'Connor shouted, barely able to contain the adrenaline rushing through him and returning the Colonel's wide grin. "Those HMMLR planes didn't know what they were dealing with. We spun circles around them, and once we got in behind them... wham! Shoot them right out of the sky. We lost a plane for every twenty of theirs I bet you, and they couldn't do anything about it. I even saw some rushing back towards the mainland with their tails curled behind their back, hoping we wouldn't follow!" Hawkins couldn't be prouder of his pilots. He jabbed his finger into the cockpit, pointing towards George as he explained, "You've defended this island from that pitiful probing attack like true warriors of the most glorious nation on Earth. The vagabonds and criminals that HMMLR is recruiting will be no match for us. Now go on, celebrate with the others! I'll be along shortly." George saluted his base commander, then taxied his way down towards the hanger on the far end of the runway. Hawkins watched him go, unable to shake the newfound confidence that filled him. They had held off the HMMLR forces in such a crushing victory that it made one wonder whether his prophesied final defence may have been presumptive. Perhaps they weren't facing the inevitable last stand against barbarism. They may even survive this war.\n\n"Send us your worst," Kenneth Hawkins muttered to himself, "and we'll send them back in body bags.""

mann.7.d:0 "Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins watched the shores of the isle with great anticipation. As the hours passed, he had found the beaches of Laxey to be quieting. He had been waiting for any HMMLR pontoon boats to arrive. Yet none had in hours. He let the anxious and curious side get to him, leaving the bunker to watch the Irish Sea with a pair of binoculars. Hawkins usually never left the bunker for a day if not several under the normal circumstances of the HMMLR's invasion. Now however, the skies have been clearing for His Majesty's control over the isle.\n\nColonel Hawkins managed to spot a half-a-dozen boats cruising towards the isle. As far as he could tell, none of them had backup and the boats were very small compared to the ones they had faced before, possibly even civilian sized. Hawkins examined the men approaching the shore of Laxey. He did not directly observe them however he did observe the weapons they were to soon fight with. They were not the average M14's they have usually seen but a rusted variant of StG-45.\n\n"God, has the HMMLR gotten this desperate to take the isle?", he pondered to himself. "If they are struggling this hard here, I would hate to see the blood baths on the mainland." Hawkins quickly dropped the binoculars to rally his men.\n\n"Men, I hope to talk to you for the final time stationed on this isle. Get into position and prepare for the half-a-dozen boats coming towards our position. Win this, and hopefully we won't see another HMMLR flag crossing the sea."\n\nOne of the younger officers spoke up to question Hawkins, "Are you sure this is the last time they'll come, Colonel?"\n\n"Yes, I am sure of it. If I'm wrong, I owe all of you 40 pounds. We've clearly exhausted them. And they are showing their exhaustion.""

Asked the officer, sitting passenger-side to the weary commander.\n\n"No. Not after that. I haven't seen anything like this since Dover." He mumbled back, removing the lenses from his eyes.\n\nOn the beaches below laid a sight unseen since Sealion. Hundreds of bodies strewn out across the sand, illuminated only by the burning ships, ran ashore alongside them. Thick plumes of smoke rose from the island's interior settlements, shelled haphazardly by naval guns and mortars. Rebel units that could make it past the beaches fought to the last man against a mix of conscripted infantrymen and irregular militia forces, desperately holding the line against wave after wave of front attacks, exhausting their scarce supply of shells repelling each bloody attempt.\n\nWhen all was said and done, no Free British rose their flag above Douglas that day. Held back just barely on the wire.\n\n"Lieutenant, another truck of wounded has arrived! I heard the officers wanted to speak with you in person. Something about an evacuation!" Shouted a voice from another car.\n\nHawkins turned his head, squinting his eyes in confusion.\n\n"

The clothes she had been given were already covered in grease, soot, and all the other unpleasant things that coated almost every surface in the factory. She was filthy, sweating, and had never been under such pressure to produce results this quickly before.\n\nAnd yet, Brenda was loving every minute of it.

Rab Butler was shaking like a leaf - he had been one of the first at the scene of Domvile's fiery grave. Andrew Fountaine kept a stoney expression, staring into the distance as if deep in thought when not being spoken to.\n\nWhen he had finished swearing his oaths, simply nodded. "Thank you gentlemen. I am aware that I have arrived at a critical time if we wish to save Britain from Bolshevism. I am sure that we will all strive to crush these upstarts forthwith." He nodded once again, and, having made his somewhat lacklustre speech, shuffled off to another room to be briefed. This left Butler and Fountaine alone in a room together.\n\nFor a few moments the two men were silent. Then, Butler spoke up. "...how has it come to this?" He asked. Fountaine was silent. Butler coughed, snapping him out of his reverie. "Has it come to what?" He asked, rather snappily. "To the point where you and I are going to have to put aside our differences to keep the nation running." Fountaine scoffed. "You aren't immediately jumping ship to join your fellow democracy-loving traitors in the resistance? I'm surprised."\n\nButler repressed the urge to spit on the man. "Well yes, oddly enough. I detest the radicals who put our nation in danger as much as you. And if we want Britain to come out of this with a modicum of stability, we cannot let petty ideology get in the way."

But when he reached the police station, the young officer was met with the sight of Constable Coombes frantically hammering planks of wood over the windows.\n\nThe other man looked over his shoulder, a wild look flashing across his face before he became visibly relieved upon recognising Jeffries. "Thank god you're here, lad, get in. Go on!" He said. When Jeffries didn't budge, his face grew visibly stormy. "I said get the hell inside!" He yelled, violently gesticulating towards the door. Normally, he would have questioned why exactly his superior was behaving like an unhinged maniac, but the look in his eyes told him not to question it.\n\nHe complied, jogging inside the police station. Instead of the usual quiet atmosphere, he was met with every officer he had known hurriedly rushing along, all looking deeply worried. Suddenly, he felt something cold and metallic being pushed into his hands. "Take this, you'll need it." A gruff voice said, disappearing as fast as it had arrived. He looked down, and saw something he never expected to carry in his line of duty.\n\nA gun. He had only been a police officer for four months, and he was being given a gun.\n\nConfused, Jeffries frantically scanned the station for a friendly face. There, he saw Officer Trenway, another new recruit. He strode over, tapping him on the shoulder. "What the hell's going on, mate? We're in the middle of bloody East Anglia, what do we need guns for?"

Right on time, Kim Philby, one of the few senior agents of MI5 still loyal to the Collaboration Government, strode in through the door, seeming a great deal more at ease than anyone else given the country was quite literally collapsing before their eyes.\n\n"Philby, take a seat," said Nall-Cain, gesturing for the spy to sit down. "I take it you realise why you're here?"\n\n"Of course Prime Minister" Philby replied, crossing his legs, "When do I begin?"\n\n"As soon as possible. We need to save what we can of MI5 - and fast. Who knows how many spies that damned communist Knight planted whilst he was in charge? You'll need to do a full purge, make sure everyone's loyal, everyone."\n\nPhilby nodded along, replying "I will do what I can sir, you can rest assured that I and all true sons of Britain in intelligence shall work tirelessly to see the traitors destroyed and their influence cleansed from our shores." Nall-Cain grinned, now there was the fire that he needed! There was the determination and will that would win them this war!\n\n"However sir, such a purge will take... time, I'm afraid. We need MI5 up and running as soon as possible if we hope to achieve victory in this war. I will of course carry out enhanced surveillance of our operatives and other such measures, but for now I believe our focus should be on winning the war."\n\n"Agreed, most of the traitors will have defected with Knight already I'd imagine, but keep an eye out all the same, make sure every one of them ends up dead."

After the long period of stability that Prime Minister Domvile gave our country, this nation was thrown into disarray by these terrorists. Because of their actions, Britons see hardships they haven't seen since the wartime years, and for what purpose? To tear down our traditions. These terrorists want to make Britain slaves of the Americans, whose Anglo-Saxon peoples struggle against an ever increasing encroachment on their rights. The so-called Resistance only wishes to bring race war, class warfare, and anarchy to this esteemed isle.\n\nOur history is a glorious one. Our people, first living as tribesmen in Northern Germany, moved to these islands and tamed their wild marshes to turn it into one of the greatest kingdoms of the medieval world. Not content to sit idle, we spread out to conquer the hills of Wales, and the mountains of Scotland next. With our island completely ours, we turned our eyes to the sea, and from Ireland to America, India, and Oceania we spread our civilization from one corner of the Earth to the other. All this was done under the auspices of our sovereign and the legitimate government which acted in his name.\n\nThese golden years culminated in the Victorian Era. The Pax Britannica. Britannia ruled the waves, and we were the unchallenged ruler of the world. And yet, we allowed subversive elements to create a rot in our society. Under the pretext of liberty, just as the resistance claims now, our institutions were slowly destroyed one by one. These subversive's final victory was achieved in the Second World War, in which our glorious empire collapsed.\n\nOnly in the last few years has Britain been finding its greatness once again, with the assistance of our Germanic brothers. This is what the Resistance wishes to stop. They want to end our national renewal before it has even begun. All in the name of democracy, they'd sooner make us a Republic and tear down the last vestiges of our cherished heritage. Stand with our Kingdom. Stand with our King. Fight for your heritage.'"

And it was certainly not normal to be meeting as the country plunged into civil war.\n\n"Gentlemen, we meet today as our country falls into a crisis beyond anything it has ever faced before in its long and noble history. Should we fail here, then Britain as we know and love her shall fall forever."

General Templer, General Wulf, if you please." The two officers stood and began to read their reports. Wulf began by informing the Cabinet that the German garrison had now fully mobilised and was ready to fight, with fresh divisions already enroute to relieve the battered forces that had held firm against HMMLR's initial assault.\n\nTempler then took over on a grimmer note. Scotland. The complete fall of Newcastle to the rebels had cut off divisions stationed in Scotland, and they were now completely surrounded and besieged in Edinburgh. They were holding firm. For now. But unless relief came, then the entire northern army could be wiped out. "Thank you Generals. This is grave news indeed," Nall-Cain said as Wulf and Templer sat back down. "How do you recommend we proceed?"\n\n"Any kind of offensive is out of the question, we need to outlast the traitors and survive the winter.

Due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of war, industry located in or around the frontlines has been excluded from this report, though we nonetheless feel it presents a broadly accurate picture for all.\n\nFactories and other such manufacturing sites are the most frequent targets of HMMLR sabotage, primarily through agents embedded within the workforce. We believe this to be the work of the underground trade unions the traitor Maxwell Knight assured us were destroyed - plans for the thorough destruction of these groups are being complied with the assistance of our German allies. These sabotage efforts have caused severe disruption to supply lines and have significantly impacted our capacity for military production.\n\nThe German Conglomerates (Reichswerke, AEG, Volkswagen etc) are a particularly troubled spot. The ongoing political turmoil in Germany has spread to their corporate sector, and their offices here are as embroiled in the power struggle across the channel as the rebellion here. Many senior officials within these companies are highly uncooperative with not only us, but garrison and diplomatic officials who are not supporters of their own faction, creating massive logistical problems.\n\nMuch of the workforce has also openly defected to the rebels' side, or simply refused to work. This has caused production levels to plummet and forced managers to dramatically increase working hours on the remaining functional factories, in turn spurring further defections and resignations.\n\nWe suggest temporary nationalisation of un-cooperative German industry and prioritisation of police resources to defend factories. Blackshirt auxiliaries may also prove useful in this role as guards. Solving the workforce problem is much harder, but we suggest a carrot and stick approach of temporarily increased wages along with severe penalties for refusing to work."

Into every hateful little shell he was forced to make on pain of death, he liked to think he channelled some of his own spite. Perhaps the gun they're loaded into would backfire, turning on its user.

Lads were walking away from the line with non-stale looking bread rolls in hand, alongside a box that looked to contain non-dried meat. His eyebrows shot up. Vic tapped the shoulder of Henry, the man in front of him. "Are you seein' this?" he asked. "Yeah, it's new policy. We get better rations now apparently. S'posed to be a way of keeping up morale won't see me complaining!" he said, flashing a cheeky grin and moving up to get his rations. Vic was of two minds about it. Of course he wanted nice food, but was he really going to be bought out by the simple idea of edible food after so long?\n\nIt took about two seconds for him to solve this moral dilemma, as his stomach growled at the thought. Food was food, after all. Who was he to complain?"

Manpower was running low, and thus a decision had to be made in regards to the role the BFC would play in the war. Naturally, Butler was little enthusiastic about it.\n\n"They're lunatics! Mad dogs that'll kill more on our side than they will the Resistance! There won't be a Britain to govern by the time they're through with it!" he ranted, pacing around the room. Several other ministers nodded in tandem. The British Free Corps were certainly not a popular bunch, even amongst the Fascists.\n\nAs if on cue, Fountaine spoke up. "Then we chain them. Spread their members out thinly. Only allow one BFC regiment in for every five non-BFC regiments. Jordan will only ever acquiesce if we give him more guns, so we may as well get him out of the way."\n\nButler was incensed, gawping at Fountaine. "So you'd give them the tools they need to reign terror on our people, then?"\n\nHe scoffed, leering at Butler. "No, we throw them at the most well-defended areas. That way it's a minimal loss of value on our end." The two men continued to argue back and forth, whilst Nall-Cain sank into his thoughts. Nobody liked the BFC, but times were desperate. The generals had been not-so-subtly pressuring him into giving Jordan what he wanted for ages. Could he truly afford not to? Sighing, Nall-Cain made his decision."

"But we stood firm, our soldiers stood firm, our allies stood firm! We have lasted through the Winter and are now poised to reclaim our land from the darkness that seeks to destroy it. The time has come to strike back!"\n\nRapturous applause sounded from the cabinet and assembled Generals as Nall-Cain finished his speech, a smile forming on the PM's face as he looked at the portrait of his mentor and predecessor, Barry Domvile, gazing down on the meeting from above. He would have loved to see this. As the applause subsided, Generals Wulf and Templer stood to address the ministers. Wulf began with a pleasing report on the status of the garrison and British forces, both having endured the winter well and ready to launch counter-offensives on all fronts.\n\nTempler spoke next on the status of HMMLR and their forces, whilst they were in far better shape than they'd hoped, HMMLR had nonetheless been hit hard by the winter, and were now firmly on the defensive. "The tides of the war are shifting in our favour, General Wulf and I recommend we launch concentrated assaults on key strategic regions held by HMMLR, we do that, and we will crush this uprising once and for all." he concluded, with nods of agreement from the general staff and another round of applause from the ministers.\n\n"Thank you, gentlemen. I shall leave the matters of reconquest in your most capable hands. It is time to show Britain that we are united as never before, the Party, the Military and our Allies, united to defeat treason and save our people. We shall triumph once again!""

Would they approve of him, the caretaker PM, only thrust into this position by simple bad luck? It seemed his Premiership was doomed to be a footnote; the tale of a successor to poor unfortunate Domvile and stolen too soon.\n\nHis eyes found itself back to that damned report. Another round of statistics, another approval of recommendations, another advance. He could not decipher their tactics, nor could he find himself the stomach to look through the death list, but he knew victory was close. HMMLR was falling, and fast. Most of their cities had fallen, their people subjugated, and their armies faltering. They were so, so close to victory.\n\nYet this was no Waterloo. This was no Roarke's Drift, no grand British victory. There would be no ode to his valour, no poem speaking of his, or anyone else's grand struggle. This was naught but a desperate fight for survival, a truly British slaughter. And yet, he was glad of the slaughter, and that, he dared not confront that. He took a final sip of his glass, looking again at the portraits.\n\nHistory had judged these men for their actions. How would Pitt have been seen if the situation in North America had turned disastrous? How would Wellington have been seen if Waterloo had been a crushing defeat, rather than a glorious victory? And how would Lloyd George be seen if Cain's government were to fall to HMMLR? Nothing more than a traitor, he expected. History would judge him, for all his actions."

She took a swig of lager, silently flipping Ian a rude gesture before setting down the pint glass.\n\n"You're a twat Ian, you know that? A right proper twat. What's he ever done to you, anyhow?"\n\nShe heard the sound of Ian scraping his barstool across the ground, loud enough that it stuck out even in the crowded Norwich pub. Bringing it across, he plopped himself down on the stool and leaned across the table with his customary smug grin. Maisie rolled her eyes at him, only for him to shrug in response.\n\n"It's not me Maisie, it's you! You're the one who's enchanted him. Here, if you don't believe me, ask Dennis. Back me up here Dennis, big man."\n\n"He was looking at you." whispered Dennis conspiratorially. "Come on Maisie, you told me you fancied him, and who knows how long we'll all be in Norwich? Could be we move out soon and you never see him again."\n\n"Not likely," interjected Ian, suddenly serious, "They say the traitors are regrouping in the South. It's not over yet, not by a bloody long shot. They'll be coming for the city, don't you doubt it. Come on Maisie, it's about to get real nasty. Take your damn shot, ask him! He's too scared to ask you."\n\nMaisie silently stared into her beer. Ian was a twat, but he had a point. Every time they'd pushed, the collaborators had almost willingly pulled back, without breaking. It'd been months and they were still stubbornly holding on. What would happen if they still held on when the Germans got their mess together, was something Maisie didn't want to think about. Maybe she should ask now. Just in case she never got another chance.

How the fuck had they gone from celebrating with drinks to cowering behind tables, surrounded on all sides?\n\n"We have to go!" hissed Ian. "What if the Germans just bomb the place and-"\n\n"Quiet, boy". The voice came from a soot stained older man with an unkempt beard now staggering up the stairs from the cellar. Another company's captain, Maisie remembered. She'd seen him smiling the first night their two companies had partied and drank their way through the abandoned pub. The captain winced as he walked, placing emphasis on his right leg and letting out a grunt with every other step. Ian stared at him, open-mouthed.\n\n"But if we-"\n\n"I said quiet." The captain dragged himself to a bench with help from another fighter, elevating his leg with a hiss of pain. "You so much as take a step out those doors and into that street it'll be a bullet that meets you. The Germans aren't here yet, but the traitors have us surrounded. So steady your nerves and let them come. It'll be a damn sight easier holding them from here than out there."\n\nIan looked like he still wanted to bolt, but gave a shaky nod. Quickly, him and several of the others moved to take up positions beneath the windows.

She refused to look down, to look into what remained of Dennis's face.\n\nHe'd died nearly the second the attack started, a collaborator sniper blowing his head nearly open just after she'd wished him luck. She'd wished him luck. Don't think about it, just don't. There wasn't anything she could've done. Maisie breathed, slumping into a chair and holding her head in her hands.\n\n"You're not hurt, girl?"\n\nShe looked up. The captain she'd seen just before the assault looked back at her, his expression firm, but concerned. Upon seeing she wasn't, he scowled in disapproval.\n\n"Then get up. We bloodied them for now, but they'll damn well be back. Help the medics with the injured, they need all the help they can get." With that he gestured to follow and walked off to the stairs downstairs, still limping from a leg wound. Maisie trudged after him in silence till they came to the beer cellar where they'd set up an improvised field hospital. One of the medics gave them a curt nod of acknowledgement before immediately turning back to his work of bandaging a moaning soldier.\n\n"Captain Lawrence, sir. Can't talk now, there's just too many injured. What's the girl here for?"\n\n"Extra pair of hands" replied Lawrence, grimly surveying the room. "You'll have her, Wellesley and Morgan. It's as much as I can spare for you."\n\nThe medic said something about checking on the boy in the corner, but his voice was muffled in Maisie's ears. Lying quietly in that same corner the medic had pointed out, sobbing to himself was the boy Ian had teased her about. He looked almost shrunken laying in the cot, clutching what was left of his arm. Quietly, she made her way over to him with some painkillers.\n\n"Here, take this. It'll help, promise. Promise. What's your name?""

Adolf thought he had never seen a sky as beautiful in all of Britain.\n\n"Why would they want to spoil such a beautiful land?" he asked no one. They passed by a small hamlet, a shepherd watching the convoy pass by with his herd milling around the field. He wore a stoic mask to hide his fear; nobody could see it at this distance.\n\n"Treason runs in the blood here, I think." The soldier in front of him —Colin? thought Adolf—leaned in with conspiratorial glee. "My cousin was a copper here, always said the sheepfuckers were rowdy bastards." He pet the rifle in his lap.

Half the squad readied their rifles, ready to stagger their shots as instructed. Adolf raised his rifle, and Ben took off once he heard the burst of friendly fire.\n\nBen made it as far as ten metres before a rebel bullet struck him. His right leg felt heavy, then absent; he collapsed, fortunate that he landed near shrubbery that concealed him. The sergeant called Adolf's fireteam to advance. He rose from his prone position and ran straight for Ben, the rebels pinned down by a volley of bullets.\n\n"Ben, Ben!" called out Adolf, who kneeled beside him. He tore off a section of Ben's trousers and tied it tight around his wounds. "Come on, get up, we need to move!" He wrapped Ben's arm around his shoulders and lifted him up. Though they hobbled, the guerillas in the hills could not land a shot. Adolf brought him into the little forest, setting him,\n\n"I'll come back for you," said Adolf, handing Ben's rifle to him, "so don't die until then." The sergeant called all able soldiers to split into two: one to hold the rebels down, the other to sneak around. Adolf joined the latter. Ben watched this fireteam disappear in the trees, as the men on the ground took cover behind the trees, drawing fire from the hill. Another went down, then another. Ben fired off a few shots, but he could see very little in his position.\n\nThese minutes went by quicker than Ben expected. There was another crackling of gunfire in the distance, screams, returning fire; the smell of gunsmoke drifted down the hill, followed by a rebel's corpse.

He was stuck behind the carcass of their truck, firing under its frame with his submachine gun. Burst rounds bounced and fractured off the concrete; he held his barrel too low, but peering down to correct his aim might have earned him a collaborator's bullet. His comrades did not correct him; they were all firing blind, all unit cohesion gone, every man out for his own impossible survival.\n\nOne of the SOE tossed a grenade. It was a lucky throw, igniting just as the machine gunner to the north was receiving a new belt of ammo. One explosion set off a hundred more; the enemy screamed, panicked and broke from their position. Cayo-Evans leaned around the corner.\n\n"Men, now's our chance! Move!" He rounded the corner and sprinted through the flames, over the corpses and across the road. One of those corpses, bisected by the explosion yet animated by spite, held his pistol up and pulled the trigger. Cayo-Evans crashed down, spat blood all over the street.

Please let them not see me.\n\n"Little bastard sure can run," laughed a voice from outside the alley. "Let him," said another. "There's no way out of the city for the little piggy. Come on, the rest of the boys are waiting." Charlie waited in the alley for what felt like an eternity while the footsteps slowly faded away. When he was sure the two men had left, he broke back into a sprint towards the docks. Fred would still be there with the boat. He'd promised.\n\nIt was nearly nightfall when he made it to the water. He staggered towards Fred's boat with his arms raised in the air, "Don't shoot! It's me. It's me." A familiar head poked its way up from the boat, blinking in surprise.\n\n"Charlie?" said Fred. "Bloody hell mate, thought they did you in. Get in then, and keep your damn head down. We'll need to leave soon, so where's the rest of the lot? Thought Elsie brought you all together to meet."\n\nCharlie said nothing, shivering. He thought back to the meeting and how brave Elsie had looked, promising them that they would make it out. Jones had a plan, she said and there were camps outside the city they could hide. He'd felt so brave too, listening to her until he'd heard the rattle of machine gun fire and their brave words had turned to screams. Until he'd had to cower among the corpses, praying the Free Corps would leave him be.\n\nThe rest of the Trade Union men in the boat were looking at him then, but all he did was turn away from them and pressed his face into the side of the boat. Refusing to let them look at him, to see the shame written on his face."

Using an old shipping crate as an improvised stool, he sat down, lit a cigarette, and looked out into the Atlantic. Nowhere to run for the traitors now. They'd pushed them all the way to the sea and beyond.\n\n"Colonel, sir! You're going to want to see this." He looked up, being met by the sight of several of his men huddled around a small skiff covered by a tarp. The soldier who'd called him flashed him a quick salute. He waved a hand, dismissing the man.\n\n"At ease, Corporal. Show me what it is we've got." The corporal nodded, drawing a knife and sawing at the rope binding the tarp to the skiff, pulling it aside. In doing so, he exposed a number of open crates filled with M14 rifles and M20 bazookas. Crowley whistled smugly, picking up an M14 and examining it. Surprisingly good condition, for something that'd come so far. The Americans definitely hadn't spared any expense. He pulled out a cloth, wiped the rifle down and set it back in the crate.\n\n"How many more caches like this?"\n\n"The lads found four more throughout Prince Albert dock, sir, as well as one in Alexandra. We haven't checked Gladstone yet. Lads at Alexandra say that one even had AA launchers, but I haven't been there to check."\n\nCrowley grinned a toothy grin, "Get these onto a truck, corporal.

Normally, the pair ate with the rest of the squad at the mess hall, but Ben was absent. Adolf did not expend much effort tracking him down: he found him on the western incline of a hill, sheltered from the enemy. He sat down next to Ben with his own rations.\n\n"We don't have to stay here," said Elizabeth, who pushed through her own doubt and the veiled disgust on Emma's face. "We can go to Canada. We could be on the first ship out, once they start the evacuations. It'll be safer there. It'll be kinder there. It'll-" The rest of her words were cut off by a choked sob.\n\n"It'll all be over soon," said Ben, finishing his can of curried chicken. "Sarge said we have a few months of this left. Then we'll be discharged. We can go back to our lives." Adolf thought of his own home: Stuttgart, the townhouse; his father, mother and brother.

He served with his childhood friend in an armoured division; the two were tank gunners in a tank brigade. From London they had travelled north on our great crusade to reclaim our isle, and this young man served with distinction in the battle to retake Leeds from the terrorists who, influenced by Jewish cabals from Canada, laid siege to that fine city.\n\n"Had he stopped there, his service would have been honourable. But he did not settle for merely the reclamation of his hometown. He continued to fight, as all proper young Englishmen did, for the reclamation of his homeland. And at the Battle of Edinburgh, when the city came under siege by the same terrorists who fought in honour of a false queen, this young man stood and fought for King and Country. Though his driver had been shot and his friend slain by a cowardly terrorist's bomb, he held the line against three waves of enemy forces, loading and firing his tank's main cannon himself, preventing them from capturing a supply depot within that city. When the fourth wave became overwhelming, he chose not to flee nor abandon the King's arms, but to render his nation a great service and deny the enemy supplies.\n\n"Today, we honour the sacrifice of Private First Class Edwin Layton, who held the line against the traitors. Today, I am proud to bestow upon the late Private First Class Layton the Distinguished Service Order.

He vows even with one battle lost against the fascists, there will ever be more. His men nod, the gloom infesting the church lifting somewhat. Even so, the next day, the unit is four men less. The day after that, two less again.\n\nIn a small village near Bath, an encircled company holds out for days. Cut off from food, home or hope, the men simply hold, unsure of where to go.

Why? Why were these men and women from Barons to Dukes so eager to aid an unwashed horde of vagabonds, communists and cutthroats? Did they not realise the Peerage was doomed if these American puppets won?

Stay home outside work, no close friends, avoid personal conversations and practice stories.

Their home country is currently facing a leadership crisis which would obviously cause chaos in the military. Why would they be more helpful than Britain's very own men?""
britaincivilwarflavour.10.a:0 ""I have to deny you that privilege. They have been here for years and Veesenmayer knows what he's doing, hopefully.""
britaincivilwarflavour.10.b:0 ""When somebody swears on your own life, it's hard to deny them. But you made an interesting point. I'll send them in.""

britaincivilwarflavour.11.t:0 "The London Massacre"
britaincivilwarflavour.11.d:0 ""Get back, we will shoot! One more step from any of you and we will shoot!"\n\nOne of the rioters lowered the bandana covering his mouth and spat at the officers, "Go ahead, try it! You bastards have killed Britain, and I won't be upset if you kill me at this point, you filthy Kraut!" The garrison officer turned to the man to his left, who shook his head. The officer turned his eyes back to the bandana-cover rioter, poking the barrel of his Mauser rifle to his belly. The rioter's blood ran through the treading on the officer's boot, scraping some of it off on the pavement. The rioter's started to run, but nothing could escape the range of the German bullet.\n\nAs scenes like this unfolded all over London, the Prime Minister began to wish he could strangle Veesenmayer for what he had done. "Edmund. You must be fucking joking with me here. Your officers just shot at least twenty-five or so people down there. Do you know how much I am going to hear about this? You jus-"\n\nVeesenmayer raised his hand, causing Nall-Cain to pause. "You are safe, Herr Prime Minister. You are still breathing. None of us are dead. None of your family has been harmed. So our officers did their job - with great efficiency I may add."\n\nNall-Cain scoffed at the idea. Noticing this, Veesenmayer slowly walked up to the Prime Minister, leaning over into his ear. "Now now. I would not disrespect the Reich. I am an Aryan, as you know. And acting like that is surely going to bode poorly for our joint futures. My officers did their job. Do yours." And with that, Veesenmayer left.\n\nThe Prime Minister would storm out of the office, taking a walk across the hallways of 10 Downing Street. The yellow walls stood tall at least, as the majority of London had burnt into ash. The portraits of the many 18th century prime ministers hung with pride across the walls. Those are priceless items across the globe. He adjusted a lamp in the reception room, until a glaring realization hit him."
britaincivilwarflavour.11.a:0 ""Where is everyone?""

britaincivilwarflavour.12.t:0 "The London Rout"
britaincivilwarflavour.12.d:0 ""I command all of you to get back! We will have to take action if you do not! I repeat..."\n\nA bandana-wearing rioter approached the blackshirt officer, starting to wave his hands in front of the officer. "What are you gonna do, ey? You are all little being used as puppets for the Krauts across the sea." The officer slammed the butt of his Mauser against the pavement. The rioter shoved his face into the officer's. "Oh, I'm scared! Do it, arrest me! Fascist little twa-!"\n\nThe officer hit him with his baton, arrested the man, and threw him behind the rest of the Blackshirts. "Move forward, but remember. Nobody dies, guns remain on your back."\n\nAs reports filtered into Downing Street, Andrew Fountaine's blood pressure grew. "What the fuck are they doing? I told my leaders down there that this is the thing they cannot do! I told them all specifically that the guns do not leave their arms and to go as hard as possible."\n\n"Andrew, are people dying out there? Veesenmayer threatened my life if this happened but look. Nobody's dying."\n\nFountaine glared back at Nall-Cain, "Bullshit. I still see new fires sparking as we speak, and I've gotten at least a half-a-dozen reports from commanders on the ground that men have died."\n\nNall-Cain responded with a general distaste in his mouth, "This matter is far out of my hands by this point, I just do not want dead bodies out my window."\n\nFountaine shook his head irritably."

wallop.1.t:0 "The King's Hand"
wallop.1.d:0 "It was strange how one could know a man, but not really know him at all. In theory, Edward should know the Earl of Portsmouth, especially with how often they'd met. He'd even been subjected to a solid ten minutes of the lord's agricultural opinions-and Wallop had no shortage of opinions, at a Balmoral party once. Even so, at the time he'd taken only moderate notice, considering him just another eccentric lord vying for attention. No sooner had he finished that thought than the door swung open and a servant entered, followed by the Prime Minister. Wallop bowed.\n\n"Your Majesty," pronounced Gerard Wallop dramatically, rising from his perfect bow. He gestured to the couch across from Edward, "May I?" Edward nodded.\n\n"Please. My congratulations on acquiring the BPP's confidence, and on your ascension to Prime Minister. It's a relief to have someone I know I can rely on in the office." That last part was a bit of an exaggeration, but Edward figured he ought to start off on a good foot now that he finally had a Prime Minister who seemed to respect him.\n\n"Your words honour me, your Majesty. If I may say so, your confidence means even more than the party's does. We are all servants of the Crown after all." Wallop's face took on a serious expression. "And you have my word, your Majesty, that so long as I remain Prime Minister, I shall never allow the Crown's authority to be challenged again. This last little uprising will be the last of its kind."\n\nMaybe this could be a good thing after all, the King considered. After Lloyd-George's coughing, Bedford's histrionics, Chesterton's dismissiveness and Domvile's disinterest, having a Prime Minister who actually listened to him would be a welcome change. Cautiously optimistic, the King favored the Earl with another nod."
wallop.1.a:0 ""In that case, Lord Portsmouth, I would be pleased to invite you to form a government in my name.""

wallop.2.t:0 "The Old Master's Call"
wallop.2.d:0 "Within the halls of Westminster are little treasures reserved for the highest of the nation's servants: social bars and tea rooms, well-appointed and staffed for their comfort. Guests to these amenities were rarely permitted and strictly controlled. John Bean supposed that was why he was drinking a pint in the House of Lords Bar, on its terrace overlooking the river. The man next to him invited him here to cut a deal. He drank out of decorum, but he had no appetite.\n\n"John," said A.K. Chesterton, setting his pint down, "I wanted to ask you a favour-"\n\n"I already know, Arthur. The answer's no."\n\nChesterton sighed. "John, please. Lord Portsmouth has surrounded himself with the genteel. I want you in our corner, keeping him in touch with the common man."\n\n"So I can be his court jester? So I can speak the truth to deaf ears?" He shook his head. Anyone else might have earned a far more caustic tone, but Bean's respect for his mentor kept it at bay. "You don't think much of Andrew, but I've never met a man who understood what Britain needs better than-" Careful. You're in their house. "-the rusted-on fools who surround your man."\n\n"For the love of God, look around you. Fountaine's done. This morning alone, three MPs whose loyalties were once unshakeable have supported us. Kingswood, Salford, Taunton—bloody Taunton, they're all with Gerard now."\n\n"Good for him." Bean set down his half-finished pint. "But I'd rather fight for Britain than its Lords." He rose, gave Chesterton a pitying look. "Thank you, Arthur, but the answer's no. Tell Wallop my loyalties aren't as flexible as Kingswood's.""
wallop.2.a:0 "Chesterton's frustrations were mollified by the news of another defection."

wallop.3.t:0 "Two Worlds, Two Visions"
wallop.3.d:0 "TRADITION, CHARACTER, VIRTUE read the poster hanging on the wall of the pub in big blocky letters, followed by a second line declaring THE YOUNG ENGLISH KINDRED. Above the letters, a man in traditional folk clothing led a similarly dressed young boy by the hand while both held Union Jack flags. A prettily illustrated forest scene surrounded the two figures, framing them in a wreath of leaves, roots and branches.\n\nDerek cocked his head, giving the poster a once over. He figured it probably had to be a government poster - who else could it be, now that no one was stupid or suicidal enough to be hanging HMMLR ones. It didn't look like a government poster, though, and Derek had seen them all. He knew the one with the German bloke and the English bloke shaking hands, the one with the blackshirts, the one with the shifty looking Jew scaring a kid. No, this poster was brand new, and it didn't look one bit like the ones he'd seen before.\n\nThe chap on the poster looked pretty stupid in his opinion. Looked like a bit of a git really, wearing whatever the hell he was wearing. He didn't know what a Young English Kindred was either, but it probably had something to do with the kid? Derek couldn't really make heads or tails of the poster, and just felt confused the longer he looked at it. Suddenly, a familiar voice from inside pulled his attention away.\n\n"Oi, what the hell was that! The ball's right bloody there you shit. What, your legs stop working?" hollered Frank from inside the pub, followed by a round of laughter and jeers. Derek laughed too, turning away from the poster and opening the door, being greeted by a sea of familiar faces and voices."
wallop.3.a:0 "Within moments, all thoughts of the poster were discarded."

wallop.4.t:0 "A Special Relationship"
wallop.4.d:0 "'To Edmund Veesenmayer, ambassador of the Großgermanisches Reich der Deutschen Nation.'\n\n'I wish to hold a short meeting you tomorrow on matters of the utmost urgency. The meeting will be held at 15:00 at my office in Downing Street. Any necessary questions can be directed to my secretary.'\n\nVeesenmayer read over the note one final time before entering Number 10. A summoning. For him? He couldn't believe Wallop's nerve, summoning his betters like that. Not once had this happened in the time he had held this post. If the man was trying to send him a message, he would respond in kind. Upon his entry, he was directed into a room where Wallop sat, drinking a glass of whiskey with an intolerably smug look plastered on his face.\n\n"Prime Minister," he said, teeth gritted so tightly that he felt he may chip one of them. "What a pleasure to meet with you. I must say, I am confused by the circumstances of this meeting. Why, may I ask, did you choose not to meet me at the embassy? After all, it is tradition at this point. Domvile himself even had his own room there for our meetings, and it would be no trouble to secure one for you as well."\n\nWallop sat silent for a minute, before smiling. "Well, I apologise for any unintentional offence, sir, but a Prime Minister is well within his rights to call ambassadors to meet with them whenever they may choose - be they from France, Denmark, and even Germany. Regardless, I'm sure we can come to an understanding. In fact, that is why I requested this meeting. I hoped to set a... precedent for future discussions. A review over Britain's obligations to the Pakt, I suppose. Previous relations were one sided, and I hoped for a more equal relationship, one beneficial for both sides."\n\nVeesenmayer bit his tongue, seething internally. This was no equal relationship, and yet Germany was in no position to argue with this pompous Earl, especially not after the recent troubles in Britain. He accepted the Prime Minister's proposal and quickly left. On the car ride back, one musing dominated his thoughts."
wallop.4.a:0 "What could Domvile have seen in that pompous aristocrat?"

wallop.5.t:0 "Perception Is Everything"
wallop.5.d:0 "A knock on the door alerted Wallop to the arrival of his old friend. "Hello, Arthur!" He greeted the Home Secretary as he entered his office. The two shook hands and claimed their seats around the circle of chairs centred around the coffee table. Chesterton enjoyed these personal meetings, not only to open the mental floodgates for memories of his time as leader, but also as he enjoyed the Earl of Portsmouth's company.\n\nNo other previous Prime Minister could be more explicit and clear with than the current, and Chesterton often exploited this as a building block for policy discussion as he did here. "You know, Gerard, I've been thinking of the past recently. I haven't even been thinking about the events after the Germans liberated Britain. But past that. During the times of the Empire. It was crushed in the wake of the Second World War, and I've been pondering -how are we going to fix that?"\n\nWallop had not really thought about the Empire in a while, but for whatever reason he was compelled to idly blurt something out. "Well, it was way out of our control, of course. Churchill and the rest of the Tories during that time were being puppeted by the interests of their Judeo-Bolshevik-Masonic-Liberal operators. Some Labour statesmen had their minds in the right place, but they were weeded out by those same operators. It's truly unfortunate."\n\nUpon hearing this, it was as if a bulb had gone off in Chesterton's head. "Absolutely. And I just haven't really been able to find a permanent solution to it." He paused, trying to emulate an improvised stroke of genius, although he had this thought for weeks. "In fact, what if it were possible for us to declare the Empire exiled within Britain in a way, and once the Judeo-Capitalistic collaborators are removed, we will rule the waves once more."\n\nPulling his head out from his book, Wallop looked at Chesterton with awe at such an idea."
wallop.5.a:0 ""Why, you are a veritable genius Arthur!""

wallop.6.t:0 "Perfect Preservation"
wallop.6.d:0 "Normally, before noon would have been far too early in the day to take a break, but today, the two bored men strolling through the sunny beauty of St. James Park figured they could make an exception. The complete lack of work at the Exchequer and the tempting sun slowly seeping in through the dreary office windows had made it an easy choice to make. Coming to a stop in front of a small flower garden, the first man offered the second a smoke which was gratefully accepted.\n\n"Sure this is a good idea, Charles?" asked the first man. "Whittaker'd go purple if he knew we'd stepped out already." The second man took a draft of his cigarette before letting out an amused snort.\n\n"There's nothing to do! Even Whittaker knows it, no one in the office seems to have anything now that Bedford's always busy visiting some MP. It's jolly nice I'd say, getting paid to do nothing. Beats the poor bastards in the Home Office. Hear Chesterton's working them to the bone."\n\nThe first man stared at the water, deep in thought, "Makes you wonder what all that stupid little resistance shooting and shouting was about, now that it's back to the fifties anyways. It's even the exact same blokes."\n\nCharles shrugged, idly flicking off some cigarette ash, "Not all the same blokes, Vernon. Butler and Fountaine are out for good, they say. And Percy says the Prime Minister's a little...odd. Or at least so the rumors go."\n\nVernon rolled his eyes at that "Percy says? Percy says Rolf Gardiner dances in folk clothes in the light of the moon and that Knight faked his death. Don't believe a word out of Percy's mouth, he'd tell you Domvile popped back out of his grave and sailed away."" Charles gave a hearty laugh in response."
wallop.6.a:0 ""Pop out of the grave? Look around Vernon, it's like the old man never died!""

wallop.7.t:0 "A Very British Fascism"
wallop.7.d:0 "The local BPP meeting hall was uncharacteristically lively, for Wallop had handed down a set of directives on the new party ideology. The newly issued decrees had been met with split reception, to say the least - a cacophony of jabs and insults could be heard all the way from the outside of the building.\n\n"Pathetic! That Wallop does not have the spine to wipe away all the degenerates lurking in our nation. We need a man of the streets, not some pampered yankee aristocrat." A young member spat out, red in the face. He received approving nods from the rest of his clique; all of them were Blackshirt members who had backed Hamm and Fountaine. Now, the rug had been pulled from under them.\n\nThe middle-aged man he had been arguing with scoffed dismissively. "As if, boy. Pure and utter nonsense. To think we need jumped up hooligans to rebuild our nation you must be absolutely mad. Britain needs a steady hand to avoid shipwreck, and his Lordship will provide more than enough of one." It went without saying that such a man had supported Chesterton and Bedford through thick and thin - this was nothing new.\n\nIn previous meetings, those who lent support to the pragmatists would confront both groups. But their voices were silent amongst the shouting match. Those that saw where the winds were blowing decided to find new bedfellows, whilst those that were slow on the uptake found themselves pushed out. Their BPP membership had come to an abrupt end.\n\nThe local party chairman, not wanting this to erupt into a brawl, stood up to try and assuage the situation. "Gentlemen, gentlemen. Let us not get so heated. Despite all our disagreements, I think I speak for the rest of us that our party establishing a fascist government that truly fits the character and soul of our nation is a welcome development. No longer are we in the shadows of our continental brothers.""
wallop.7.a:0 "And with that, the temperature of the room finally cooled."

wallop.8.t:0 "The Old Master's Leash"
wallop.8.d:0 "The assembled commanders stood before the empty podium in a great black mass, whispering and murmuring amongst themselves. A keen look at the scowling faces of the blackshirts would have noticed the mood in the room was a tense one, bordering on frustration. Yet the moment the old, weathered figure of the former Prime Minister emerged to take his place on stage, the muttering faded away into silence. Gazing about the room imperiously, Chesterton cleared his throat.\n\n"Long before any of you were born, when I once wore that same uniform you all wear now, there was a saying passed between us. We said that we had gone to war as boys and returned as men. You too now, have seen the fires of war, and the true face-" He paused for a moment for emphasis "The true envious face of organized Jewry, and the destruction they will wreak if given the chance. Therefore, the Auxiliary Constable Act shall declare your men a legal support force to the police, able to assist in existing investigations and arrests, though not to prosecute."\n\n"Taking orders from the police," said a stony faced commander, glaring at Chesterton. An outbreak of resumed muttering followed the remark, with a number of angry looks fixed at the man at the podium. Yet despite being half as broad as the man, with skin yellowed by years of drink, Chesterton met the glare with a smile.\n\n"Why were the Blackshirts founded, young man? Do you remember?"\n\nThe young man scoffed in response, "Hunting down traitors, sir. Not taking orders from coppers." Chesterton shook his head in disappointment.\n\n"As guards, defending those willing to speak in England's defense. Both the Blackshirts and the police defend our society, so who is to say that they must be different things? The police are undergoing reorganization and a fine blackshirt might very well make a fine policeman in time.""
wallop.8.a:0 "The young man's eyes widened as he slowly understood. Then he began to grin."

wallop.9.t:0 "Pyrrhus of Chequers"
wallop.9.d:0 "Even at the best of times, Lord Portsmouth felt something of a distaste for London. The endless smog, bustle and sprawl of the city aggravated him, and of late it had grown outright suffocating. Each night he'd found himself wistfully dreaming of his parent's ranch in Sheridan or his own estate in Somerset. Eventually, Wallop had finally decided he'd retire to Chequers for a few days. Let Chesterton disapprove, he needed this.\n\nWallop closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, letting the country air wash over him. By all accounts, he ought to be celebrating. Downing Street was his, and the Old Guard's legacy was secured. Some of his oldest and most faithful friends stood by his side, realizing a vision that mere decades ago would have seemed impossible. The rabble in the commons had been brought to heel, and the rabble in the resistance crushed underfoot. So if this was victory, why did it taste so bitter?\n\nOpening his eyes, he looked around with a frown. The truth stared back at him from the walls of the study, still ornamented with paintings and decorations chosen by Domvile, not him. The title of Prime Minister might be his, but the party's vision was every bit as much Domvile and Chesterton's as his own. A needed compromise, but one that rankled all the same. What if Gardiner's words about Social Credit had truly had merit to them? If he'd had the courage to try something new? Perhaps he would never know, now.\n\nIt was necessary, he told himself again. His vision would come, once England was ready to receive it. A green and beautiful land, tilled by families worthy of her. Children raised to maintain their homesteads, so that they might one day pass it to their children in turn. A proper English culture, rooted in the producer, not the urban parasite. Perhaps not today, perhaps not tomorrow but one day, for a certainty."
wallop.9.a:0 "The next day, he commanded the servants to remove Domvile's old effects from the stud."

wallop.10.t:0 "From A Birds Eye View"
wallop.10.d:0 "The Earl of Portsmouth and Lord of Tavistock stood together amongst a handful of other Lords, both of their hands hanging over the railing of the top floor as they watched over the Commons. They seemed to be busy having a debate of some description - although the topic did not matter to the two. Indeed, their eyes were drawn to something else far more interesting.\n\nThe seats that had laid vacant for decades declared for the opposition had recently been filled by none other than the former 'pragmatist' faction of the party. Wallop had expelled them, and even with this large chunk of the party gone, the British People's Party still had a supermajority. Even with their attempt against the Old Guard, almost all of the pragmatists knew that because of the nation's election laws, their seats may flip given time.\n\nThe pair watching were very amused by that fact. "You know, Hastings, I've been hearing rumors about all those chaps down there. And let me tell you, there is never a rumor about something good!" The two chuckled harder than they ever had in years. "You see the one on the right side? I heard...heh... I heard his wife cheated on him for a Bolshevik in the HMMLR!"\n\nRab Butler was very involved in debate on the Commons' floor. He was practically the leader of the pragmatist opposition, defending several of the pragmatist members when they were attacked and adopted a fierce demeanor towards his former colleagues. Although more focused on the debate on the ground, he looked up occasionally trying to detect what some of the noise was coming from above. He did not catch Wallop and Bedford just yet. However, after one more successful punchline from Wallop, he glared at both of them with a look that could kill.\n\nThe two noticed Butler's stare and laughed even harder than any of the rumors circulating that the Prime Minister could twist."
wallop.10.a:0 "They both turned back at that moment, leaving to head back for a meeting in 10 Downing Street."

wallop.11.t:0 "The Final Voyage"
wallop.11.d:0 "It was a rainy day - one fitting for the mood of the day, Wallop supposed. Barry Domvile was not a man for pomp and ceremony, yet he was a man that certainly deserved it, especially after being taken from Britain so cruelly. However, he would not have wished to be laid in state, but a state funeral was required nonetheless. It was packed with BPP members - all old friends and dedicated supporters of the Old Guard, wanting to see their old leader off one last time.\n\nGerard Wallop was never a man who cried often, but the speeches his compatriots had given in honour of their old friend had left his face streaked with tears. The unfairness of the situation rang true, when Bedford, Chesterton, and Nall-Cain reminded him of how cruel it was that they were bereft of Domvile. When the proceedings began to come to a close, he strolled up to the podium, eyes lingering on the casket as he did so. It was closed, given the nature of Domvile's death. The Prime Minister cleared his throat and took a deep breath.\n\n"Friends. Party members. My fellows in arms. You all know that Barry Domvile was a great man. He served this country dutifully and without complaint for years, taking the slings and arrows from those who would see our country reduced to rubble. He was all this and more. But above all else..." Wallop choked up, his breath hitching. "Above all else, he was my friend. Our friend. And he will be so very missed. May we meet again one day in heaven, Barry."\n\nAnd with that, three well-armed policemen began to wheel the coffin off-stage and through the sparse crowds that had gathered. He would be taken to a train, which would bring him to his final resting place - a quiet little cemetery near his home."
wallop.11.a:0 "Rest easy, Admiral."

wallop.12.t:0 "Stuck in A Mind Palace"
wallop.12.d:0 "Rain pounded on the centuries-old brick roof covering the Prime Minister's office on Downing Street. Wallop, kicking his feet up on the desk, explained to himself, "I have to clean this office one of these days." The day had left by himself, with his only true constant companions to accompany him - his thoughts.\n\nThe most baseline and predictable of the voices in his head floated the same idea that he had been following - and indeed, had planned to follow - for the foreseeable future; to continue the agendas of his predecessors and finally fulfill the party's decades-old dreams, including continuing the process of eventually building the invaluable 'New English Character'.\n\nBut another less familiar voice brought into play an idea that truly piqued his interest. He had the chance to bring about everything he had ever wanted - the chance to build the dignified agrarian state fuelled by a Social Credit system that he, not the party, had always dreamt of. It was right there - he needed only to take it.\n\nIt wasn't as if this idea had no support amongst the party leaders. Lord Tavistock has promised Wallop his eager support for the latter personally, as he was blocked from enacting such legislation in his own time as Prime Minister - although just as before, Chesterton and a wider section of the party would be left aghast once they heard of the plans.\n\nHe went back to the first idea, considering that the Old Guard's legacy would be at risk and could crumble under such a radical change. If he stuck to the party's baseline, he would be able to keep Britain afloat for much longer under his leadership. But was that false sense of stability really worth it when Britain was stuck in the dirt and he had the chance to change all of it?"
wallop.12.a:0 ""I must take the interests of the party and of the country more seriously than the interests of my own.""
wallop.12.b:0 ""I will not let Britain continue to stagnate into the bloody hands of narrow-minded bureaucrats.""

wallop.13.t:0 "The Eldest Cause"
wallop.13.d:0 ""The difficulties that we have faced cannot be overstated, and we can rightly celebrate having overcome them. However, we cannot rest easy on our laurels, a course must be charted..."\n\nSighing inwardly, the king wondered to himself, not for the first time when Wallop's speech would end. He was used to boredom during Privy Council meetings, which usually consisted of whining about the perception of him doing something or other. The dull, clearly rehearsed speech though, bored him even more. Thank God it wasn't Bedford speaking at least.\n\n"...a new bold course, set by loyal servants of His Majesty and the Crown. To simply continue as we have is to cast England into the abyss, now is the time for action. A return of our land to proper English tradition can only be done by decisive leadership from a newly empowered Crown, free from the bickering that plagues the commons. To that end, this government shall embark upon a number of initiatives, commencing with the issuance of Crown Credit to the deserving, the revival of proper country traditions and the investment of vast sums into agriculture..."\n\nEdward blinked, staring around the room in confusion. The reactions of the men around him ranged from bewilderment matching his own to shocked fury on the face of Chesterton, as well as even excitement in Bedford's case. Had Wallop simply made that part of the speech up on the spot? Or-\n\n"Lovely joke, Gerard," thundered Chesterton, startling him. "But I think it's time we got back to real matters." Wallop raised an eyebrow in response before replying.\n\n"You are to refer to me as Prime Minister, Arthur. And I can promise you that I mean every word."\n\n"Well you must have gone stark raving mad then!" Chesterton snarled, his coarse voice having abandoned its gentlemanly character completely. "None of us will support you when you've spat on our friend's grave like this. Not until you regain your wits." He stormed from the room, followed by a number of men.\n\nWallop watched him go, seeming briefly regretful before shaking his head and resuming his speech. Edward wasn't listening though. All he could do was sit there, still as a statue, terrified of just what madness Wallop would drag him into."
wallop.13.a:0 "God Save the King!"

wallop.14.t:0 "In Proud Tradition"
wallop.14.d:0 "Since the early days of the BPP, cabinet meetings had been a chaotic thing by nature, with howling verbal spats that left all involved red faced being more common than not. Something, Wallop noted with pleasure as he surveyed the room, was not the case here. Instead each man sat orderly, ready to hear his words. He cleared his throat.\n\n"The difficulties that we have faced cannot be overstated, and we can rightly celebrate having overcome them. However, we cannot rest easy on our laurels, a course must be charted..."\n\nWallop could see the men in the room smiling and nodding in approval as he spoke. Arthur, his oldest and longest lasting friend, grinned from ear to ear. The only man who seemed disappointed was Bedford, and even then it was a muted disappointment, given he nodded along with all the rest. They would all stand united behind him, the Earl knew, united in a way that the BPP had never been. No more would they be beholden to a whimpering little rat like Butler, or a screeching would-be Mussolini like Fountaine. After so many years and so many trials, Britain was finally theirs and theirs alone.\n\n"...a course faithful to the legacy of our party, to our nation and to our glorious history. Cruelly torn from us as the empire was by Churchill and his masters from above, its spirit lives on. To preserve it forevermore, we shall raise a New British Character, one rooted in pride, in tradition and in corporatism refit to suit the Briton alone. The empire breathes, gentlemen, and lives on!"\n\nThey were all applauding then, even Bedford. Barry would be smiling as well, were he here thought the Earl to himself sadly. For the barest second though, the thought also drifted through his mind that had Barry gone further he might have still been with them. Could he truly be content to simply mimic those same policies that had led his friend to an early grave? Wallop scowled to himself, seeking to banish the unbidden and unworthy thought from his mind."

wallop.15.d:0 "The Cunningham family, amongst dozens of others, piled into the Ombersley cricket pitch, where rows of chairs and a hastily-assembled podium laid out in the middle. The headmaster of the local school rose to the podium, to inform the parents of the government's new curriculum. Gone were the days of boring books and rote education; proper English stock needed a practical education. The boys would learn a trade, the girls would learn to keep a home, and both would learn to appreciate the British countryside through outdoor recreation.\n\nThe father, Alan, looked nervously at his sullen son. He was a bright lad, pale and bookish, and he was not sure how he would take to this new direction. The mother, Piper, was more concerned about the future. The plan had always been for Elliot and Elise to leave Ombersley for greener pastures: Birmingham, maybe even Manchester. That was contingent on them finding a good school, or at least a better job outside the village.\n\nThe son, Elliot, had always hated sports. He preferred books; he was a regular at the library, swiftly advancing from children's tales to the classics. Now he was expected—compelled, even—to spend long hours throwing himself into the dirt. The daughter, Elise, felt the pain of frustrated ambition. Her uncle was a woodworker in Droitwich Spa. She had many questions about carpentry, and he was keen to answer them. But even she, the youngest member of the family, knew what it meant for a girl's education to focus on cooking and croquet.\n\nSuch were the thoughts that roiled the minds of all parents and children on the field. Even the headmaster read them with some anxiety. They felt as if they were being chained to the village, to a land of half-timbered houses and monotony. Worse, they were told it was their natural state, that this was what the English people needed. As they all went back to their homes that night, everyone had, in their own fashion, the same thought:"

wallop.16.d:0 "Were you to ask any man, woman or child in England how many Prime Ministers the nation can have at once, they would give you a funny glance and note only one man may sit in Downing Street at a time. Yet were one to sit inside the British People's Party today, one would see a curious state of affairs where offices of state are held by not one Prime Minister, but by three. Ostensibly, this triumvirate is a union of equals and bosom friends, restored to their rightful place in governance, combining their influence to become more powerful than ever before. Yet just like the Roman triumvirates of old, three separate heads rarely act in perfect harmony.\n\nThe first head lies distracted, its eyes far from its post. The Duke of Bedford may nominally hold the title of Chancellor of the Exchequer, but the Duke's visits to the Treasury are few and far between. MP's and secretaries alike whisper of his endless visits to Westminster, with MP's trading bets on which of them the Duke will try to cajole for their support next. With its master gone, the Exchequer has slipped into something of a limbo, only broken up by directives from Downing Street itself.\n\nThe second head looks in all directions, torn between countless tasks. Torn from his element in the House of Lords, the Earl of Portsmouth can rarely be found far from his office. As the messages to said office grow by the day, the Earl's own proposals sink further and further into the pile of papers on the Prime Minister's desk. Servants scurry anxiously about Downing Street, eager to avoid the Prime Minister's worsening temper or a tirade about the foulness of London.\n\nThe third head smiles with a ravenous hunger. Called back from his humiliating exile, Arthur Kenneth Chesterton now stalks through the halls of the Home Office, eager to make it his own. Whether Blackshirt, MI5, or Constable, all find themselves summoned to Chesterton's policy meetings, ones inevitably exited by grinning blackshirts. So accustomed to his role is the third head, that its voice is that most heard in cabinet now, almost as much as that of the Prime Minister himself."

There were countless other MPs there as well, resting from the grind of daily legislative work. He too was exhausted, but still had a strong itch to do something. Getting up, he started to move across the lounge, asking anyone he came across questions about how they believed the current ministry was progressing and how it was affecting the nation. This was met mostly with irritated glances and one-note answers. After the member for Horsely told him to shove off, his brow furrowed. This was going nowhere. He needed to do something more bold.\n\nMaking his way to the covered stage, he unveiled himself from underneath currents. This was met with little aplomb, aside from a few confused glance. Noticing there was no microphone set up, the elder statesmen sighed quietly. He never knew how to set one up, because most of the time someone did it for him.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen!" he said hoarsely. This got their attention - although not the kind he was hoping for. "I hope you all are enjoying this occasion. It's not very often we all get to take a rest from work, eh?" Hoping to get a quick laugh out of the crowd, the room stayed eerily silent. "Well, I am up here for a quick announcement. More accurately, a general message I hope most of you keep leaving here."\n\nSomeone coughed. "Almost all of us here are with our different views in life and different views politically. And that's fine. We all need our opinions expressed of course. However, I must implore all of you that today is not the day to have factionalism within the party. We must all stay united under the banner of the Earl of Portsmouth and our Prime Minister, Sir Wallop. Can we get a round of applause for our dear friend and leader?""

Slouching against the Lord's lounger and his eyes barely staying open, he did not make a good look for the camera that was being pointed at his face. Knowing this was his first public appearance in two weeks, he forced himself up and began after the introduction was finished.\n\n"My lords, in this day and age, we have been utterly exhausted - mostly from the multiple uprisings of treacherous cowards unwilling to look at the world around them. And unfortunately, we have also fallen into the same trap as the capitalistic snakes that tore this country to shreds in the first place." He paused, letting it sink into the room around him. "We have forgotten about the beauty of nature, and how reliant people across the globe are to the agricultural industry. Without such an industry, famines will befall thousands of families, and many would have to hunt for a new source of income."\n\nThe silence of the chamber both haunted and empowered the Prime Minister to continue on after a few seconds of pause. "And yet, the greedy, selfish industrialists continue to pump kilograms of toxic chemicals into our dirt whilst tearing through resources faster than a machine gun. They have harmed this nation to an extent comparable to the Uprising! My lords, we must stop this essential tool of the capitalistic nations now. I hope, my lords, all here are in the defence of the nation's beauty and will take a stand against such activities. Thank you."\n\nA standing ovation followed the Prime Minister's proposal. Shocked by such a positive response, Wallop turned to the Duke of Bedford behind him, who in return gave Wallop a wide smile. Turning again to face the opposition, Wallop saw the same story. Everybody on the other side clapped in a quieter manner - although the reason to him is unknown. With this supermajority was its minority, which Wallop saw and chalked it up to pure arrogance."

wallop.19.d:0 "The fireplace crackled, its light bathing the room and the three figures inside in amber hues. Wallop let out a deep sigh of relief as he leaned back into an armchair, idly pushing his cane aside and staring outside at the night sky. Bedford gave him a sympathetic glance, clicking his tongue.\n\n"I know it's exhausting, Gerard. Completely and utterly exhausting, if I do say so. But we'll only need to suffer all our enemies a little longer now. Particularly with that loathsome little Butler gone."\n\nChesterton's face broke into an eager grin, "Congratulations are in order, my friend! You did what Hastings and I never could with him. Here's to it being the first of many debts paid to old enemies. With interest." He said the last part with a vindictive relish, the light from the fireplace giving his face an almost predatory character.\n\nWallop tapped his cane, thinking back to Butler's impotently furious efforts on the floor of the commons since his ascension. "It was a jolly good show watching him bleat, wasn't it? Such a pity he had to be expelled from the party but well, he hasn't quite got the sort of English character the BPP needs." He drawled in a mocking voice.\n\nThe three men all shared a hearty laugh. "You know," said Chesterton when the three men had finished, "This is the same room they told me that whelp Fountaine and his backbenchers had stabbed me in the back. And look at him now! Whimpering like a scared dog that the Blackshirts are mine again."\n\nWallop smirked. "Speaking of whimpering, you ought to have seen Veesenmayer fume and pout when I summoned him here. He knows who holds the cards now with the state Germania's been in."\n\nA shared laugh at the expense of Butler, Fountaine and Veesenmayer followed the remark, after which the three friends continued to trade jibes and taunts at beaten foes late into the night. So preoccupied were they with their good cheer, that when they finally departed Downing Street's staircase, none took note of the portraits of Prime Ministers looking down from the walls, not even their own."

The enclosed leaflet contains further information regarding how Credit Vouchers may be applied, and the circumstances under which they will be accepted. We wish you the best of luck in your productive enterprises."\n\nThe leaflet gave more details, along with assurances that wherever pounds were good, so were credit vouchers. So far as Clara could tell, it was actually trying to tell her that the government had made a new type of money just for people like her. Supposedly purely to help her "diversify her goods and expand her business."\n\nClara scoffed, sliding the letter aside on the shop counter before lighting a cigarette. What utter rubbish. People had no decency - none at all. She knew times were hard, but swindling the desperate with fake government letters was just vile. The idiots could've tried to make it plausible at least - London caring enough to send her money, now that was a riot. Then again, she thought while looking around at the empty shop, the day was going slow. And the address on the enclosed leaflet really was a government office, she knew it well enough. She could at least see what the fuss was about, she resolved, pulling on her coat and flipping the shop sign to CLOSED.\n\nIt was to her surprise that when she actually arrived at the government office, she wasn't alone. A long line of people she recognized stretched past the building. There was Arthur from the pharmacy, and Helena from the grocer's. Each person, she noticed, clutched the same letter she did. Still in shock the letter hadn't been a trick, she silently filed into line. Briefly, she wondered just where the government had gotten the money for all this, but to be honest, she didn't care. Things were hard, and the shop needed it."

A small part of him had agonised over the decision as the bill made its way to his desk; now that he looked at it directly, he realised it was no great betrayal. One little signature, a few strokes of the pen, and Gerard Wallop had sealed a new compact between the cities and the countryside.\n\nThe [GetYear] Industrial Renovation Act laid a framework for his government's future industrial policy, one which concentrated the corporations towards the cities. Corporate taxes on assets in the countryside would be severely increased, heavy enough to drive them from the hills and the plains. In the cities, however, conditions would be far more favourable: minimum wages would be slashed across the board, guaranteeing cheaper labour.\n\nThe stick and the carrot, by which Wallop would contain the German corporations. They could have the cities, with its pollution (environmental and spiritual), so long as they did not touch the countryside. They would know what to do with those concrete prisons and their architects. Wallop cared far more for the country, where the English spirit would find succour and salvation. He planned to see the British economy shift its attention away from the cities to the villages; crown credit would spur on this transition.\n\nOutside his window, the London smog rose to its peak; a grey haze swirled around the cityscape, choking the life out of its inhabitants. Even here, Wallop could taste that pollution in the air. He set aside the signed act and looked out the window. He imagined it worse: smokestacks billowing poison, filling the air and the lungs; the Thames black and green with run-off. He accepted that it would get worse. If it makes them happy, the Germans could have the cities, so long as the English had the country."

The hundreds of German executives staring straight into him as he crept closer frightened him. His disdain for these men had only grown further as he had grown closer to power, and this climbing ascent would not pause this day.\n\nHe found himself at the centre of attention in the room. Finding the queue to speak, he cleared his throat. "Thank you, everyone for attending this evening. I am sure that it has been a long commute here from Germany. I would not make all of you come this way for any bad news, so let me get straight to the point."\n\nHis eyes gazed through the hundreds of heads. He had come to know many of these men - these faces in suits, these blank people - in his own time as the Prime Minister - although many of them simply blurred together. Bedford thought nothing of it. "Our government has been initiating a plan to raise funding to the Department of Agriculture and bring high taxes to corporations in the countryside. However, he has also brought a lower minimum wage to the industrial cities. Very daunting offer, gentlemen?"\n\nThe more Bedford spoke, the more groans could be heard. In some areas, some turned to speak to the man to his side. He feared that they thought this was just a game to settle old scores. Bedford resumed to stop the banter between executives, "I know what many of you are thinking, however those thoughts are profoundly incorrect. The Ministry of Lord Portsmouth only seeks to focus its efforts on the countryside and as a benefit, the cities will be in all of your industrial capable hands!"\n\nBedford soon initiated a vote, where almost every man raised their hand in favor.

The new Chancellor, that Gardiner fellow, was presenting some sort of dancing troupe. Only they were all boys about John's age. And they had swords. Real swords. How very peculiar.\n\n"Do you have any idea what this all is Nicholas? Heard anything at work?" Asked Emily, looking just about as confused as her husband. Nicholas was about to respond in the negative until the boys all started marching across the screen, and it suddenly clicked.\n\n"I don't know anything for certain Darling, but this reminds me a lot of the Hitler Youth group we were taken to see on our business trip with IG Farben back in '61. They've even got the same little armbands and drums." As he said that, the implications of it sank in, both parents turning towards their blissfully unaware son eating his meal in peace before looking up at each other again. No words were needed, Nicholas would be in contact with his friend at the department of education in the morning and see if exemptions could be made.\n\nAs he reached for the remote to change channels, a waving British flag filled the screen as a banner along the bottom read "THE YOUNG ENGLISH KINDRED: APPLY TODAY!"

They sat on the choir pews, Scwabcher behind Wallop, with the moonlight filtered through the stained glass. "Archbishop," he said, "England is in a spiritual crisis. In such times, it has been the Church that led them out of their inner darkness and towards the proper light."\n\n"We shall do our duty for King and Country, Prime Minister." Scwabcher picked up the bible next to him. "As for our sermons, I have spoken to my bishops. We are in agreement: Christ's humble origins must be taught." He opened his book to its freshest annotations. "'Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary?' His followers, too." He turned its pages. "'And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren', 'for they were fishers'."\n\n"Men of the land," said Wallop, "as all proper Englishmen should be."\n\n"Land untainted by decadence. I have another sermon for that." He leafed through a few more pages. "He 'found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.'"\n\nAnother nod from Wallop. "What of the other matter?" At this, Scwabcher silently handed over an envelope tucked into his bible. In twenty-four hours, the priests enclosed would be known to the British Free Corps.\n\n"Your dedication is appreciated, Archbishop." Wallop rose, placed a hand on the Archbishop's shoulder.

He could hear the camera crew upstairs talking in what they clearly thought was a whisper about his nerves. What could they possibly know about nerves, when all they did was operate a camera? Nerves were for men caged in a country that despised them, filled with vile communists that wanted him dead and up-jumped rabble like Domvile and Chesterton who saw him as nothing more than a figurehead. It was a brutal joke that the moment a Prime Minister had seemed ready to acknowledge his importance, it was a madman like Wallop.

"Your Majesty, if you're feeling unwell we can delay-"\n\n"No!" shouted Edward, a little too suddenly. "No," he repeated to the startled servant, "We'll do it now, I'm quite well. Tell them I'm ready to begin". He drained the glass in a single gulp, handing it back before following the other man up the stairs. Every step seemed to take an eternity. Slumping to his seat before the cameras, he thought gloomily of his youthful tours as Prince, and the cheers and adoration that had followed him then. Fickle bastards. How was he to have known Hitler was such a brute, when the man had seemed so reasonable? He wondered what fresh curses they would spit in his name, when he preached Wallop's lunacy at them.\n\n"Your Majesty? Beginning in five seconds.

His Majesty's speech, the way he expressed ideas the country desperately needed to hear. I could tell he meant every word."\n\n"A moment for all England to remember," agreed Wallop.

Second, I caution you against relying on one influence within the Cabinet.

We have worked together for so long, in the Mistery and elsewhere, that I consider it natural that you should join me too in the Cabinet.\n\nYou and I know that British values are but a distant memory these days. It is our sacred duty to revive them, but it is your duty to promote them: within the Isles, through Europe and over the entire world.\n\nBut before we can do this, we must engage in unseemly business. Germany remains supreme, and so long as the continent remains within their control, we will need their support. Though I served only a brief time in your position and under irregular circumstances, I found that half my time was spent appeasing them.\n\nOur charted course, towards the revitalisation of English land, shall put us into conflict with their conglomerates. I have a plan to alleviate this, but I will need your assistance. Expect a meeting from me in the future. Consider this a first trial for you, one of many moments when we must appease this sick man of a master.\n\nGod willing, when the continent chokes on its own bile, England shall reclaim her rightful place in the world. When that day comes, I want you beside me. You have written a great deal about history, but now you have the opportunity to enter it.\n\nKind regards,"

wallopflavour.7.d:0 "Dear Mr. Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford,\n\nThere is a part of me that shall always respect you. You were among the founders of our British People's Party, which has tried to serve its namesake diligently since the war. It is the party which I shall remain loyal to until I am dead. Yet I also mourn the rest of your career, and find your new appointment to this office concerning.\n\nTo be frank: you had an opportunity when you were Prime Minister, and you blew it. Not only did you break under pressure, you let Chesterton into power, whose mistakes you will be fixing for years to come. Wallop's best decision was keeping that old drunk as far away from Cabinet as possible, but among all of his worst decisions, appointing you to the Home Office might be among the highest.\n\nI don't know what Wallop sees in you that he would drag you out of the coffin you should have stayed in. Maybe he still remembers you and your wife's tiff in the press and took pity. Maybe he's gone mad too. Just do me a favour and don't blow your brains out once you break under the pressure yet again; have the dignity to resign first.\n\nRegards,"

wallopflavour.8.d:0 "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nAs a former candidate for Prime Minister denied the office by your arrival, I feel compelled to write to you in the days following your victory. I assume that Fountaine was too churlish to even grant you the dignity of a similar response.\n\nWhen I first heard of your intent to become Prime Minister, I expected a continuation of former governments. Instead, upon hearing of your cabinet, I recalled a conversation we shared just before the civil war. It seems that you have finally become the Mussolini of agriculture, lord and protector of English stock. Still, unlike Fountaine's lot, you at least did Britain the courtesy of appointing men familiar with agricultural matters and not just rhetoric.\n\nWhat concerns me more is your full-throated approval for dangerous economic policies. I have already written at length to your new Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I expect my concerns have been ignored. Therefore, I will approach you directly: your policies of crown credit will be an unmitigated disaster. You cannot purchase economic prosperity in this manner without a great risk of runaway prices and crippling your ability to keep up. It is akin to a man shooting himself in the foot in the hopes that the open wound might make him more aerodynamic.\n\nI implore you, as a former Chancellor who kept our economy stable during moments of great difficulty, to reconsider all these policies which threaten to immiserate the British people and put her financial situation in jeopardy. Whatever you might think of Douglas' theories, they are unsound and untested, and rather than even a measured trial you are approaching this task with a broad brush. For the sake of our country, turn back now before it is too late.\n\nRegards,"

wallopflavour.9.t:0 "Call For The Dead"
wallopflavour.9.d:0 "Philby spun a pen between his fingers as he sorted through the papers in Knight's office. His office. It still took him by surprise; to think that the old boy was gone, to think that he was now in his place. There was still the cuckoo cage in the corner, the third shelf lined with nature books. He was so busy with the necessities of his new position that he had no time to clean up the office itself, to strip away what remained of Maxwell Knight and replace it with what made up Kim Philby.\n\nNo matter; redecoration would be saved for a later date. The clock ticked eleven; through the window, he could see the moon and the stars poked through the black fabric of the sky. Beneath the cold light of a desk lamp, Philby pored over intelligence reports from MI5. His MI5. They spoke of unrest in the cities and the countryside.\n\nIn the former, the British People's Party was tearing itself apart with Wallop's sudden redirection towards his pet beliefs. The Old Guard were split, knives out against traitors in their ranks; the Ideologues were like headless chickens; and the Pragmatists were in shock at the requests from Number 10. In the latter, rapid changes in social and economic policy created rapid social unrest. An influx of internal immigration, citizens answering the call of Crown Credit, were amassing in villages and towns unprepared for their arrival. Prices were rising and falling daily; shopkeepers and traders had no idea how to respond to the new system.\n\nPhilby set about a briefing for the Prime Minister. In these matters, he always felt it best to type the report himself. He wrote about Fountaine loyalists ready to be plucked from his camp like ripe fruit. Butler-affiliated bureaucrats struggling to fulfil their requests. And throughout all of this, rumblings of more resistance—but nothing to fear, Prime Minister. The Civil War has put any thought of further resistance to bed. Dissent in your ranks needs greater attention. No need to worry about rebellion."
wallopflavour.9.a:0 "Knight's rebellion. His rebellion."

wallopflavour.10.t:0 "Mirage"
wallopflavour.10.d:0 "Cheated. That was the right word for it, no matter how petulant it sounded. Standing alone in the Prime Minister's office alone, Arthur Chesterton couldn't help but feel robbed. When Gerard had excused himself to attend another meeting, he'd stayed behind, though he hadn't been able to put his finger on why. He knew now though, it haunted him almost like a ghost. The very same desk where Barry had once brought him a report on HMMLR as Defence Secretary. The empty spot on the wall, where he'd once hung a photo of himself on a South African campaign. The office was his and yet not his, no. Never again his. Not since Fountaine had taken that from him.\n\nOh he was proud of Gerard. How could he not be, when his friend's ascendance meant the triumph of their shared vision? All's well that ends well, as the Bard had once said. Even so...it felt wrong. He ran his finger over a small hole in the wall. Still there, after so many years. God, it was all the same.\n\nVisions passed through his mind's eye. Stirling shot entering the country, or strung up like the traitor he was. Triumphant toasts with Gerard, Hastings and Barry, where they congratulated him on his many successes as Prime Minister. Cursed Fountaine sitting as a nameless, worthless backbencher worthy of being remembered by no one. And most of all, him sitting at that desk, in the knowledge he was still Prime Minister.\n\nAll beautiful lies. He should be happy with how things had turned out, and if he was fully honest with himself, he was. All the same, the cruelest of words ate away at him, refusing to leave him be."
wallopflavour.10.a:0 ""What if?""

wallopflavour.11.t:0 "Patriarch"
wallopflavour.11.d:0 "Each year it seemed as if there was less of them, grimly mused Hastings Russell, Duke of Bedford. He'd never been fond of having many guests in his home-and his appetite for guests had decreased even more with his former wife's constant demands for them. Yet for the oldest of friends, he would always make an exception, particularly for men he shared so much with.\n\nIt had been his idea to invite some old strugglers, so to speak. A little get together, solely for those who'd been with him as he'd founded the BPP. There were so few of them left now, though. What remained of those noble few could be crowded into a few armchairs, waiting to hear him speak. He cleared his throat.\n\n"Dear friends, we have so much to be proud of. We struggled, I-I will not deny that we struggled much, in recent years. In spite of treasonous bolshevism though, in spite of upstarts from below, we have done it! The BPP stands united, and Britain shall march into the future, despite her mis-steps." His friends clapped, with Beckett raising a toast to him. Bedford smiled in appreciation, before excusing himself to go see to the meal the servants were preparing.\n\nIt had only been an adequate speech, he thought to himself, but what else could he do when things were only adequate? He would never say a word against Arthur, but the man had grown so overbearing of late. Remarkably close minded too, refusing to hear a word about Social Credit. Not to mention too concerned with the thoughts of demagogues and public mobs.\n\nThough perhaps he shouldn't be so harsh on Arthur. It was undeniably true that his, Gerard's and Arthur's leadership had made the BPP immortal, and one day synonymous with Britain itself. So he hoped at least. There was that horrible, squirming nagging fear that Britain's children might one day be as dismissive of his legacy as his own had."
wallopflavour.11.a:0 "A ridiculous fear to be sure. But it gnawed, and it gnawed deep."

## Butler Events ##

butler.1.t:0 "The Undying Vines"
butler.1.d:0 "It didn't make sense. It shouldn't have happened. It was supposed to be impossible. And yet no matter how how many times he re-read the paper searching desperately for any mistake anywhere, nothing would change the contents of the paper Rab Butler had been staring at for the past hour now. Over one hundred MPs had backed neither himself nor Fountaine, but a third man, one whose political prospects Butler had believed to have been incinerated along with Domvile. But there he was, a little photo enclosed in the report to really hammer in the danger this man posed by a helpful Civil Servant.\n\nGerard Wallop, The Earl of Portsmouth.\n\nHe was not alone of course. Oh no. That would be too easy. Wallop always had been one of the "Old Guards" in the BPP, one of those sickening, simpering traitors who grinned ear to ear when jackboots marched across London. Butler had watched as their influence slowly waned over the years. Hastings Russell, the Duke of Bedford was a relic of a distant age. A.K Chesterton, that thuggish brute, had seen his own base ripped out from under him by Fountaine. And Domvile was now a permanent resident of Downing Street. They should have collapsed into obscurity by now, but the weeds had persisted, and threatened the garden like never before.\n\nFountaine's ranting and raving in the Commons was an annoyance for certain, but he was powerless against Butler's majority. A majority that meant as much as a petition to men like Wallop, and whilst the Commons was lost to him, the Lords was anything but. Wallop's power needed to be broken. He and the old Fascists of the BPP were a clear minority in the Lords, but most active Peers who could have opposed them were across the ocean in Canada, leaving the Upper House free to be co-opted for their own agenda. The Parliament Act would fix all this, but first it had to be passed. And to do that, Wallop had to be defeated."
butler.1.a:0 "The fate of democracy depended on it."

butler.2.t:0 "Strings pulled, Lords dancing"
butler.2.d:0 ""I'd say it's doable. Granted, it'll take a few visits from me and some twisted ears here and there, but with the right friends with us, the Peers won't have much of a choice." Maudling grinned, taking another bite of duck, followed by a sip of brandy and a satisfied sigh. "You really should try some of this, Rab. The Prime Minister ought to at least enjoy a pleasant meal after the hard work he put into saving Britain."\n\nButler was silent. He thought of Downing Street aflame. Animals like Jordan and Fountaine stalking their way through the halls of power. Britain's boys had been butchered in a bloodbath Butler had spent his life trying to prevent. It was a cold comfort to know that it wasn't all for nothing, given the price. "If only, Reggie. All we've done so far is slap a bandage on the wound... and there'll be plenty more hard work to come. All of which will come to nothing if we have to fear a veto at every step." He carefully set down his teacup and looked squarely at the Foreign Secretary. "You're completely sure that these 'friends' will follow through?"\n\nThe jovial man nodded, sipping his drink. "They'll follow through, they know what's good for the country is good for them, and they're clever enough to know that's what we are. I'll talk to them, remind them of that, and have them whisper in a few ears." After a moment of dabbing at his lip with a napkin, Maudling continued. "My people have plenty of strings to pull, even with the Lords. Just give them a little time, they'll have the Lords dancing to our tune and lining up to back the bill."\n\nHe seemed confident enough. Then again confidence had never been an issue for Maudling. Though Butler had his reservations about who these "friends" undoubtedly were and what promises they might request, it was true that their aid would prove invaluable in making the Parliament Act a reality."
butler.2.a:0 ""Schedule your meetings then, Reggie. See what can be done.""

butler.3.t:0 "Bluster and Spit"
butler.3.d:0 "The Right Honourable Andrew Fountaine, MP for South West Norfolk, rose from his seat in the House of Commons following the directions of the Speaker and took to the floor. His burning gaze scoured the nearly empty building and glowered. The few MPs that had bothered to show up barely even formed a quorum, and not a single member of the Cabinet was there.\n\n"Mr. Speaker it is with a heavy heart that I must give todays speech but it is a needed one. The Government of the Right Honourable Prime Minister is weak. It is a government of degeneracy. This government seeks to return our sceptered isle to when we were at our weakest, a time when Britain was destroyed by the weakness of her own people. Even now the memory of what those degenerates seek to do unto to Britain looms large over us. Lest we forget that only a few months ago traitors seeking to restore this failure of a system had risen up across this isle. Yet this government wishes to appease these traitors, and scoundrels. This government wishes to return to the weakness that destroyed us, to the time when we were under the control of Jewish banking. Well, if that is the desire of this government, I proclaim here that we loyal few will stand for Albion until the very end."\n\nAs his speech ended, Fountaine noted that only the few scattered Ideologues within the chamber showed even the barest hint of support, and the speaker yawned as he sat down."
butler.3.a:0 "He has no effect in the face of cold hard numbers."

butler.4.t:0 "Firefighters of Whitehall"
butler.4.d:0 "Butler surveyed the men surrounding him at the conference table, feeling a note of approving pride. He'd chosen well in subordinates, he knew. Bennings and Chisham were as reliable as party whips could be, and as far as reliability went, Angus, Wilson and Reggie needed no introduction. As instructed, none of the men had brought pen nor paper, and no clerk stood nearby to take the minutes of the meeting. If any of his ministers seemed surprised by the cloak and dagger nature of the meeting, none of their faces showed it.\n\n"I believe we all know why we're here," he began, being greeted by a sea of nods and thin smiles. "Mr. Fountaine's Ideologues are, quite bluntly, a presence that we can no longer tolerate within the BPP. I trust that I can decline to elaborate on why, after all of your many experiences with them. Some of you have offered solutions to this. Reggie?"\n\nMaudling's toothy grin could've passed for that of a shark's. He nodded, whistling. "Yes, sir. It seems Fountaine's pet lapdog and favorite MP, the honourable John Bean has nasty taste in contractors. We can trace surveyors for the Thames Airport implicated in corruption charges back to his office. Not that I think he ever met them, but the press well. Press has a way of not caring about things like that." He let out a hearty guffaw.\n\nAngus frowned, his forehead seeming even larger for the expression. "That could work. Finances are something of a weak point for them. I've had the Revenue Office start looking into Blackshirt clubs. There's potential there, sir. Budgets that could be slashed, property taxes left unpaid. Nothing on Fountaine himself, yet. But give us time."\n\nButler hummed. "Reggie's plan first. Then Angus's. Wilson, you know civil servants better than anyone. You'll start there, I want a report from you on reorganization as soon as possible. Bennings, Chisham, I leave keeping the party in line with you.""
butler.4.a:0 ""God willing, this fire is one we can put out quickly.""

butler.5.t:0 "Cutting The Weakest Link"
butler.5.d:0 ""No comment. No comment." Bean's mantra was as hollow as he felt, racing past the press that lapped at his heels. The scent of scandal had stuck to him, and these animals pursued such fragrances to the ends of the earth. They followed him from his front door to his car, from his home to Westminster, from his car door to the front steps, barking and snapping and harrying him all throughout. Once the doors to Westminster closed shut, Bean let out a long, pained exhale.\n\nBut scandal still clung to him, and everyone inside kept Bean at arm's length. When he walked through the corridors, civil servants nervously stepped away from him, and MPs side-eyed him as he walked by. Nobody looked at him if they could help it. Bitterly, as Bean reached his office, he wondered how long this would last, and how humiliating it would be. If Bean walked through the Channel now, would the oceans themselves part before him in embarrassment?\n\nThere were no reports on his desk, no letters or memos. Only today's paper from the Daily Mail, with an unflattering image of him on its front page. "MP IMPLICATED IN AIRPORT RORT." Ludicrous. He wasn't even involved in that nonsense. He just signed a few papers. He didn't even meet the surveyors, that was bloody-\n\nThe phone rang, shaking Bean out of his pity. He picked it up and slammed it back down on the receiver. There was a few seconds' peace before it rang again. He picked it up and slammed it back down. On the third ring, he tore the cord out of the receiver and let out a pained cry.\n\nAbove him, Butler stared at the front page of the Daily Mail with a devilish grin. The first of many moves in this game. He set the paper down and picked up the ringing phone. "Morning. Ah, Maude! Bloody good job the Mail did, didn't they? Now, about our next step...""
butler.5.a:0 "The first move against the Ideologues."

butler.6.t:0 "The Fraying Black Shirt"
butler.6.d:0 ""...and while they were necessary to maintain stability, we can no longer continue to extensively fund these clubs. Britain is evolving, and internal security is now best served by expanding the funding, resourcing and responsibilities of a professional police force-" Angus Maude turned off the radio and cut his broadcasted voice, giving Rab Butler a smirk.\n\n"Bloody good work, Angus," said Butler, offering him a glass of brandy. Maude gladly took what was offered. "Let's see how the clubs do when they've got no money to mend their black shirts. One less problem, thanks to you."\n\n"One more step towards a better country." He took another sip. "Have you thought about what comes next?"\n\n"I have some ideas." Butler sat down in his chair. "You've checked the estates?"\n\n"My friends have, yes. There's quite a few irregularities. You'll also be interested to know that there's some discrepancies in his campaign funding."\n\nButler's eyes lit up. "Oh dear. Well, I trust that Inland Revenue will give this matter serious investigation."\n\nMaude smiled; the two drank and chatted long into the night. Butler woke up the next morning surprisingly absent of a hangover, energised by another pillar removed from his enemies. He went outside to enjoy the sun and to pick up the morning paper. Unfortunately, below his usual paper was a rag he never recalled subscribing to: Spearhead. On its front page was a crude cartoon of Butler—gawping with an ill-fitting policeman's helmet over half his head and on strings held by a hook-nosed stereotype—running fabric cutters over a black shirt. Blood spouted out from the fabric. Below, in bold print: "BUTLER CUTTING THE HEART OF ENGLAND"."
butler.6.a:0 "He tossed the paper into the nearest bin."

butler.7.t:0 "A Thorned Letter"
butler.7.d:0 "Before it had all fallen apart, before Butler had stolen the office of Prime Minister from him, Andrew Fountaine had frequently fantasized about what he would have done to the insufferable little worm that was Richard Austen Butler once he came to power. The mental images varied. Blackshirts kicking Butler to a pulp. Butler thrown out of Westminster. So venomous were his thoughts, that when Butler's only action against him upon becoming Prime Minister was a letter from the Revenue Department, he'd laughed at the weakness. It was only once he'd opened the letter that he'd paled, called his wife downstairs and summoned his lawyer.\n\n"Dear Mr. Fountaine," he heard the mousy lawyer reading softly to himself. "It is our profound regret to inform you that your estate has been found in violation of... a number of stipulations around BPP private donations." The man let out an irritating little cough. "Furthermore, we have found estate revenues..."\n\nFountaine slammed his fist into the table, causing his lawyer to flinch. "Did no one ever teach you to read in bloody silence!" His wife put a hand on his shoulder.\n\n"Andrew. Mr. Montgomery, be honest with us. What would happen if we contested this letter?"\n\nThe lawyer fidgeted slightly, uncomfortable under Fountaine's gaze. "With Mr. Fountaine as an active MP, it would most likely pass to the House of Lords. Speaking frankly Mr. Fountaine, I think they would rule against you. I'm sorry."\n\n"Andrew..." said his wife, gently. "Perhaps it's time? You've done enough in politics, surely." No, he hadn't. He refused. He wanted to throw something, to scream. To say that he refused to yield like this.\n\nInstead, the next day, Andrew Fountaine did none of those things. He entered the commons, requested permission to speak and formally announced his withdrawal from parliamentary life."
butler.7.a:0 "In the dispatch box across from him, Rab Butler wore a cheeky grin."

butler.8.t:0 "Treading Carefully"
butler.8.d:0 "It could scarcely be worse, reflected Rab Butler as he flipped through Philby's first security report to him directly. The uprising had left MI5 badly hurt by mass desertions, that much he had already known. Even so, Philby's report had somehow managed to paint an even worse picture of an agency left nearly empty. Shaking his head, he closed the folder, before looking up with an expression of disbelief.\n\n"I-Thank you for putting this together on such short notice, Philby. Is this truly all the agents we have remaining?"\n\nPhilby nodded grimly. "Knight's influence ran deep. On Prime Minister Nall-Cain's orders I've verified the loyalty of those who remained but there weren't many to check. It will take a long time to replace his rats with loyal men."\n\nLoyal yes, thought Butler, but loyal to what? Philby had been a fearsome opponent of HMMLR during the uprising, but his family ties to fascist Lords gave Butler pause. Still, he would need the man for dealing with them, nervous as the thought made him. After a brief awkward silence, Butler cleared his throat "I expect you, I, and Mr. Wilson will be of like mind on that then. MI5 will be far from the only service in need of restructuring. National health, welfare, education...if this havoc has proven anything, it's that our civil service needs to be one we - and more importantly the public - can have confidence in."\n\n"Of course, sir," replied Philby, raising an eyebrow curiously. "I've heard that Mr. Wilson advocates for an end to Aryan civil service. Removing the same policy from MI5 would make replacing our losses easier. It certainly didn't stop traitors the last time around."\n\nButler sighed inwardly in relief. Perhaps the man wasn't a fascist after all. Nodding and turning back to the report he missed the shadow of an expression that flitted across Philby's face for a mere instant before vanishing."
butler.8.a:0 "One of contempt, laced with the smallest hint of pity."

butler.9.t:0 "Shoulders Tapped, Experts Assembled"
butler.9.d:0 "The office door creaked as Harold Wilson stepped into the Prime Minister's office. Butler looked up to greet him. "Ah Wilson, just the man I need. Please take a seat, I'd like to brief you on a new role I think you would be fit for." Wilson briefly raised an eyebrow. Then, he smirked. After a short explanation of his assignment as Minister of Agriculture, the Prime Minister paused for a response. The Civil Servant thought for a moment to think through his reply.\n\nHe chuckled lightly, "Well, agriculture was never my specialty but I'm prepared to get my hands dirty. I've already got a few names in mind to act as advisors - this time next week, prepare to have a rural policy report on your desk to read through. We can draft a set of policies that will sap Wallop's base of support whilst at the same time building up a provincial constituency loyal to us."\n\nButler sighed in relief, a grin stretching across his face. "That's reassuring to hear. We cannot rule Britain from Whitehall alone, we'll need both the countryside and the cities under our firm control. The uprising has shown that the trade unions have been a safe haven for radical saboteurs. I assume you have a plan to exorcise this infestation?"\n\nThe newly assigned minister tensed up at the unexpected question before thinking of a response. "Ah yes. No need to worry I got it all under control, a white paper is being drafted that shall pacify the workers once and for all." Wilson then quickly rose from his seat. "Well I best be going now, Butler. Those policy papers don't write themselves.""
butler.9.a:0 "A firm handshake to dispel all doubts."

butler.10.d:0 "Peerage pension fraud investigation\n\nPage 3 of 17\n\nBUTLER: Back to the matter we discussed earlier then. The obstructionism of the lords remains a problem, and their shameless corruption is a blight. To that end, I suggest we kill two birds with one stone.\n\nPHILBY: Understood. If I may sir, my office has in the past carried out financial investigations regarding the peerage, at the request of the Prime Minister Domvile as it happens. Certain irregularities were discovered. We were requested to provide the files to the Prime Minister alone, but with him dead we are the only two men who know of them.\n\nBUTLER: Promising. In that case, I want your agents to pursue this line of investigation. Focus on peerage pensions. After my time in the Exchequer I would be more than willing to wager that a number of tax return claims by the Lords are fraudulent. Focus there, and you'll find our dagger against them.\n\nPHILBY: Very well sir.\n\nBUTLER: We will need to tread carefully here Philby, very carefully indeed. I trust all of this information will be obtained discreetly?\n\nPHILBY: Yes, sir. It'll prove harder than it would've before the uprising, given that a number of my agents with connections in the revenue service are traitors or dead. Still, we should be able to avoid involving the Home Office.\n\nBUTLER: Good. Discuss this with no one but your most trusted subordinates. I want our cards kept close to our chest until we're ready to strike."
butler.10.a:0 "End of Page 3."

butler.11.t:0 "A Step Further"
butler.11.d:0 "Reckless and foolish, thought Rab Butler to himself, pacing behind his paper-strewn desk. Reckless and foolish both. Still, no matter how he turned it over in his head, he found no other solution. The true danger posed by Wallop was not the man himself, but his array of friends in the Lords whom he could call upon to block anything Butler tried to pass. If he wanted to stand any chance of stopping these fascist lunatics from stopping his plans, then he had to get one of their more powerful friends on his side.\n\nHis musings were interrupted by a knock at the door. Butler opened it, hoping that he looked less worried than he felt. "Ah Philby, Please, come in. Apologies for the mess, I seem to be somewhat buried in paper these days."\n\nPhilby peered over his shoulder at said desk. "Well, sir, it looks much better than my desk at Leconfield House. Sorting Knight's old papers has been a nightmare. Can add disorganization to the bastard's list of sins." He gestured to the chair across from Butler's, "May I?"\n\n"Please," Butler replied, "Though... never mind Knight for now. I had a different, sensitive matter I wanted to discuss." Philby quirked an eyebrow at that but nodded. "If His Majesty's government is to have the trust of his people, it must be one that can be seen to act. Paralysis led us to the uprising and-"\n\n"You want me to acquire leverage against the Earl of Portsmouth," said Philby, his eyes twinkling at Butler's expression. "I would be very bad at my job if I hadn't guessed that. But rest assured sir, I serve at the Prime Minister's discretion."\n\nButler smiled then, genuinely smiled. The rest of the conversation passed nearly in a blur, with how light and relieved he felt. This time, when he finally rose to show Philby the door, he shook the man's hand, before glancing out at the street below. Perhaps he should go for a walk."
butler.11.a:0 "The day seemed so very lovely all of a sudden."

butler.12.t:0 "Prices Worth Paying"
butler.12.d:0 "Butler was starting to feel the beginnings of a headache coming on. When Reggie and Wilson had come to him in a rare moment of unity to present their proposal for a National Health Service, he should've known it was too good to be true. Any joy he'd gotten from the two men setting aside their endless verbal sniping had evaporated the moment Angus heard the details of the proposal.\n\n"It's not the principle I disagree with, Prime Minister, god knows I don't." said Maude, jabbing his finger at the document for emphasis. "But we don't have the money for it and that's a fact. Unless Mr. Wilson here wants to conjure it out of thin air, we're making promises to the public here that we simply can't keep." The man glared balefully at Wilson.\n\nWilson's lip twitched. "If Mr. Maude were to carefully review the proposal again, he would see that the numbers do actually add up. I can promise you that Mr. Maudling and I made absolutely sure of that, even if we'll have to borrow to offset the costs."\n\n"By going to Germania and Frankfurt with a begging bowl, asking for change!" exploded Maude. "Just how many strings do you think that'll come with, Wilson? Have you thought about that at all? Has Maudling?"\n\n"Borrowing in the short term only," Wilson replied smoothly. "And if Angus here wants to go out on the streets and explain public health is something we simply lack the money for, he's welcome to. I'm sure they'll be very sympathetic, after the last two winters we've been through"\n\n"You think I don't care? You smug-"\n\n"Thank you, both" said Butler, raising a hand and cutting Maude off. "Angus, I understand your concerns and share them. Borrowing will come with a price, and I hope that you trust I'm not blind to the risks. But Mr. Wilson is correct, if we are to have any hope at all of surviving another winter, they're risks we'll have to take""

butler.13.d:0 "Peter Bishop frowned, adjusting his glasses as he pored over the ridiculous numbers his boss had given him to review yet again. He wasn't sure whether Mr Jenkins was fudging something or really that poor at keeping track of things. Peter couldn't truly find it in himself to be annoyed though, considering the old grocer had given him a job. And for a discharged revenue officer with a bad leg whose only other choice would have been a factory or a mine, that meant the world. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a key turning in a lock, followed by a familiar voice.\n\n"Peter, love! I'm home!" called his wife from the entrance. God was it already so late? If Joan was home that meant David ought to be home as well soon. Jenkins and his numbers could wait then. Rising and wincing slightly at the weight it put upon his leg, he limped towards the entrance, greeted by the smiling sight of Joan setting a bag of groceries upon the table, as well as for some odd reason, an opened letter. \n \n"What's that you've got there, love?" he said, placing a kiss upon her cheek and giving a curious glance at the letter. "Thought we were a bit too much of shut-ins for letters these days".\n\nJoan shook her head, continuing to unload groceries as she did. "Not for us, silly. For David! You know he's still set on the service." Peter grimaced, "The boy's a damned fool if he is then, Joan. How many times do I have to say it?"\n\n"Peter-" she interjected\n\n"A damn fool! What, does he think he has some German bastard ready to call him Aryan and wave him in! I love the boy Joan but-"\n\n"Peter, they took him" said his wife, primly before turning back to the bags. For a moment, Peter Bishop simply stood there, unsure of what to feel. Envy. Regret. Grief, for men he had served with, men who the Germans had simply taken, never to be seen again."

butler.14.t:0 "Honeyed Words"
butler.14.d:0 "The buzzing of the Admiralty's old beat-up television set was a common sound in the pub. Normally this would be background noise at best, overshadowed by dockworkers bantering about their wives, their favored teams or the stupid Heer soldiers always goose-stepping around Portsmouth. What was strange about today, however, was that the men were actually paying attention.\n\n"Oi! Frank. Turn the damn thing up, I can barely hear a word he's saying," whined one of the younger dockworkers, only to be met by a scoff from one of the other men.\n\n"So what? It's always the same shit anyways." The other man adopted a mockingly serious expression. "The gracious trust placed in His Majesty's Government and the BPP has allowed us to triumph over traitors seeking to shackle Britain once more," he recited in an imitation of Nall-Cain's drawl. All the same, he did as the man said and turned the TV dial.\n\n"...and yet some of the blame must be shouldered by His Majesty's government. Had we responded differently to the many trials faced by the British people, the traitors might never have had their lies take root at all. To that end, my government shall oversee an expansion of the civil service, a national health service and the formation of new trade agreements, sanctioned of course by our brothers in the Pakt..." said Rab Butler, his expression somber. "Our nation's people have heard enough talk, so I will make the message of my government a simple one. Never again shall our people know hunger, war or strife."\n\n"It sounds good," piped up the youngest dockworker again, hopefully. "Sure, if he delivers," said a third man. "Least he bloody talks about doing something for us. All Domvile ever did was yammer on about unity."\n\nA fourth man silently sipping his beer alone said nothing. Butler's words did sound oh so good, traitor that he was. He didn't sneer like Domvile, or bark commands like the Germans that had killed his friends. He didn't look any bit like those monsters. When the deserter listened to the man on the television though, the words were drowned out by a single sound echoing in his ears."

butler.15.t:0 "Smile for the Camera!"
butler.15.d:0 ""We're trying sir, we're really trying our best," said the Norwich councilor apologetically, sitting down and gesturing at the crowd of curious refugees attracted by the sights of reporters and soldiers. "There just aren't enough homes to go around sir, we don't have anywhere else to put them".\n\n"Something that will, and must change," replied Butler firmly, making sure to address the full crowd instead of just the councilor to his right. "You have my word, sir that my government shall work day and night until each and every person displaced by these terrorists has been housed and provided for." The announcement was followed by a flurry of flashes and clicks from the eager cameraman.\n\n"Mister Butler! Mister Butler!" cried out a small girl of no more than five, clearly straining to squirm her way through the crowd. Several of the soldiers exchanged looks and one moved to intercept the boy, but was dissuaded by a shaken head from the Prime Minister. The girl was pursued by her mother who made a vain attempt at grabbing her, but she managed to squirm from her mother's grip. "Mister Butler, Mister Thomas says you're important and you can help mummy-"\n\n"Quiet Lucy!" hissed the girl's mother, before fearfully gazing up at him. "Sorry for her, Prime Minister, it won't happen again." She gave her daughter's arm another tug to no effect.\n\nLucy for her part only pouted back at her "But they hurt you! He wants to help, why won't you let him mummy?" Her mother flinched at her daughter's words, recoiling.\n\n"It's quite alright madam," he said, nodding at the still wary woman. "Young Miss Lucy is very right, we are here to help. We will do all we can to see those who harmed you are brought to justice."\n\nThe woman muttered an emotionless thanks, while Lucy beamed by her side, tugging at his sleeve, still talking. "It was the ones with the funny black shirts sir. With the mean faces."\n\nHe had to suppress a grimace at that. Damn you to hell, Fountaine. You and that band of rabid animals. He turned to the woman again, "All who harmed you, madam. My government holds no tolerance for such atrocities, nor shall it ever.""
butler.15.a:0 "The cameras flashed again, and her daughter smiled. But the woman only stared, nodding blankly."

butler.16.t:0 "Solace"
butler.16.d:0 "The Prime Minister was not the sort of man who frequently found himself at a loss for words. Years upon years of orating desperate appeals to sanity in the commons had done that. Even so, Butler found himself unable to find the right word for the strange but almost pleasant sensation that had followed him today from bed to his breakfast at Downing Street with Maude. The other man seemed to sense something was amiss, giving him a worried look.\n\n"Something the matter, Prime Minister? If it's Wilson and Maudling, I understand it's concerning, especially so close to the proposal." Butler waved a hand dismissively in response, taking a bite of toast as he did.\n\n"Just lost in thought, Angus. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Maudling's vocal disagreements do concern me but so long as they keep it within cabinet meetings, open discourse ought to be welcomed, not shunned. Particularly on a subject as sensitive as devaluing the pound."\n\n"I would agree, sir," replied the chancellor, "But they aren't. It's beginning to trickle down to the rest of the party, both in the commons and further. The share of the party without a strong opinion in favour of one man is dwindling by the day, the division will only get worse."\n\nThe problem, Butler considered, was that both men were clever. Clever enough that if he raised the matter with them directly, they would swear eternal friendship and turn their knives on one another the moment his back was turned. This would require a subtler touch. "Focus on the proposal for now, but keep an ear to the ground to see if either of them has been reaching out to backbenchers." Privately, he doubted either man would be so blatant, but it couldn't hurt. "Enough of them for now, we'll have to come back to the matter soon enough. More tea?"\n\nSeveral hours later, long after Maude had left, it finally struck him with a jolt that the feeling had been about Wilson and Maudling after all. Both men clearly had designs on the future direction of the BPP, and a different man might have been nervous that his lieutenants clearly wished to succeed him. As for Rab Butler, he realised he could finally name that strange feeling that he'd carried with him all day."
butler.16.a:0 "Relief that one day soon, he could rest at last."

butler.17.t:0 "An Honest Day's Work"
butler.17.d:0 ""What a ridiculous mess," was the only description Butler could conjure, looking at the folders and reports he and Angus had neatly stacked atop his desk together. The stacks themselves were neat enough, all arranged in rows and marked by Angus's neat annotations and circled comments. The welfare system they covered on the other hand, was an utter mess, filled with clauses, conditions and strict rules about which pensions could be collected. His subordinate agreed with him, judging by his look of distaste.\n\n"It's a byzantine beast of a system, sir, that's the only way to put it. Though that's honestly the point, considering who it's meant to benefit. I've been through the process from top to bottom, and I outright couldn't tell you how to claim a pension sometimes."\n\n"If someone like you couldn't riddle it out, Angus," replied Butler, "I can't imagine how the average person is meant to." He tapped a set of papers spread on the left corner of the desk, away from the others. "I notice military pensions were the only ones that haven't received cuts?"\n\nMaude nodded. "Not once since '45. That and property maintenance but I'm sure you remember how delightfully that proposal went."\n\n"I remember," sighed Butler. "What was it Anderson said in the Lords? An attack on their unassailable rights?"\n\n"Something like that, sir. Shall we get to work then?" Butler nodded, and picked up a pen.\n\nBy the time they'd finished, several hours had passed, alongside countless notes, traded witticisms and requests for more tea to his secretary. In spite of the work, Rab Butler genuinely felt as though he'd enjoyed himself. Angus made for good company, and unlike most people in Whitehall, actually understood how a government budget should work. When it was done, he set his pen down and stretched back into his chair. He smiled at Maude."
butler.17.a:0 ""You know Angus, I do believe we can finally say we did something good today.""

butler.18.t:0 "Prosecution"
butler.18.d:0 ""A nation cannot survive treason from within. So spoke Cicero, and I think we can all understand the truth of those words after Knight almost destroyed everything we've tried to achieve in saving this country from fascist madmen." Said Butler, sipping a glass of whiskey as Maude and Manningham-Buller poured glasses of their own.\n\n"Words of wisdom Richard, but we've got security affairs well in hand. What's gotten you pouring over the classics?" Asked Manningham-Buller, watching Butler attentively as he reclined into his armchair.\n\n"The Duke of Buccleuch, he has to go." Butler replied, glancing over to check if Maude was still on-board with what he was about to propose. The steely, determined look in his old friend's eyes confirmed his full support.\n\nSensing something was off, Manningham-Buller set down his glass without drinking from it and looked Butler in the eye. "That's hardly an objectionable stance, the man's practically a listening device for Wallop, why all the dramatics?"\n\nButler paused for a moment, biting his lip before at last revealing. "I'm going to frame him for embezzlement, he'll be cleared in the end of course with it just being slander, but he'll be out of the picture long enough for us to pass our reforms and save this country. I know you're a man of the law but-"\n\n"Say no more, he and his friends showed no respect for the law when they ripped up the Parliament Act, I see no reason why the law should respect him." Interjected Mannginham-Buller, drawing sighs of relief from Butler and Maude. The Duke of Buccleuch was in for a nasty surprise indeed."
butler.18.a:0 "The only court that matters in politics is public opinion."

butler.19.t:0 "A King's Suggestions"
butler.19.d:0 "Walking into Buckingham palace, Butler had grown oddly fond of his meeting with Edward. The man himself was rather unpleasant, who disguised his selfish reasons for collaboration with the allure of some public duty to end the bloodshed. Yet the man was charming enough, and talking with him didn't feel like a constant battle for political dominance as it often was in the current government.\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, he sat down with Edward, who eagerly started up conversation on the recent revelations. "Well, I just couldn't believe it at first, Wallis had to calm me down after I finally accepted it. He had been my friend for decades, a companion in those dark days, for him to do such a thing, of course that must be why I was forced to live in such relatively austere living conditions in the past few years."\n\nI'm sure he lived fine enough, Butler thought to himself, taking a sip of tea, a party a week whilst Britannia starved. Edward continued, ignorant to Butler's introspection "Now, with that frightful matter dealt with, we must turn to who shall succeed him. I had a long list of suggestions, but Wallis and I thought there was only one man really suitable for the role, Robert Row. A good man, respected by the party."\n\nButler woke from his introspection, turning to Edward with alarm, Robert Row? A known friend to Wallop's circle of zealots. He would be worse than the mere obstruction of the Duke of Buccleuch, no, it could not be him. Butler calmed himself, before responding "Whilst Robert would be a fine choice, I was considering Lord Hailes for the position. Patrick is a good man and is liked more by those currently in government. He would be the best fit for the position at this time with political divides so high."\n\nEdward thought for a second, before agreeing to Butler's suggestion. After some minor discussions on the economic reforms, the meeting was adjourned, and Butler set off, his mind returning to one thought."
butler.19.a:0 "Let us only hope Edward doesn't make any more 'suggestions'."

butler.20.t:0 "An Unseen Hand Felt"
butler.20.d:0 "Energy, precision and enthusiasm were the first three words that Butler had been able to conjure, listening to Evan Durbin since the minister had entered his office. A refreshing change from Domvile's cabinet, to be sure. He hummed, leaning forward.\n\n"Very well, Durbin. So, to clarify, while the details will be left to your office, it is the initiative of this government that the Labour office take a greater role in overseeing pay initiatives this following year, as something of a transitory period. I trust you can concoct a suitable preliminary plan by next week?"\n\nDurbin tapped his pen, thinking. "Absolutely sir. Am I correct in assuming that this should account for a gradual transition to more local pay management, at the regional and eventually factory level?"\n\nButler nodded, pleased his minister was catching on. "Precisely, I'm pleased you understand. So, to confirm. Doable within a week?"\n\n"Very, sir. In fact, we could begin by establishing oversight commissions, particularly in the areas of-"\n\n"Pardon the interruption," cut in Maude, "But those would be the ones proposed by the Labour office earlier this year, correct?" Durbin nodded, surprised. "I see." Butler cleared his throat.\n\n"That'll be all then, I think. Thank you again Durbin." After the minister had left, Butler leaned over to Maude.\n\n"He certainly seemed capable. Was there a reason you asked when the proposals were put together?" Maude folded his arms.\n\n"Those were Wilson's ideas. It may have been Durbin speaking, but believe me Prime Minister, I know Wilson's voice when I hear it. No matter who it comes from." Butler frowned."

butler.21.d:0 "Thursday evening was supper at the Wilsons. Rachael Phillips went home, determined which work could be kept at home and which she had to bring with her, and drove to Hampstead Garden. There, she was greeted by a smiling Mary, gave a curt nod to Harold in his drawing room chair and said hello to little Giles. Dinner was at seven, and Rachael sat with the rest of the family around the table. She always sat to the left of Harold, with Mary on the other head of the table. Grace was said, gravy was passed, pleasantries were exchanged. This dinner was a highlight of everyone's week, particularly for Harold and Rachael, who used the distance from Westminster to discuss sensitive matters.\n\n"I saw Susan earlier today," said Rachael, slicing through a roasted potato. "Durbin's whole office is being run ragged. They get an hour of peace from eight to nine, and then the phones are screaming like—oh, what did she call it..." She drew a pondering slash across her roast beef. "...banshees, yes."\n\n"It's Frankfurt, isn't it?" Harold dabbed away a glob of gravy on his chin.\n\n"Mm, Germany is what she said. Callers on the phone and in person. Apparently, they're concerned about the new factory pay policies possibly causing a drop in the pound."\n\n"The policies that are meant to be temporary?"\n\nRachael shrugged."Whoever told them must have omitted that part." Mary's eyes bounced between the two as if she were at Wimbledon.\n\nHarold sighed. "Maudling..." Rachael raised an eyebrow, but did not press it. It made sense. A dinner with foreign dignitaries, a need to impress them, a few glasses of gin too many—suddenly, German investors line up outside Durbin's door to voice their concerns."
butler.21.a:0 ""I'll talk with Durbin tomorrow." Harold felt the poor chap needed some support."

butler.22.t:0 "It's The Little Things That Matter"
butler.22.d:0 "Something about this meeting felt terribly indulgent to Butler. They were in Westminster, responsible for the responsible government of the whole country. They had millions of souls and the high-level organisation of British society to consider, and here they were bickering about council rates.\n\nActually, it was hardly bickering at all. Buller had a smile on his face as he and Lord Chancellor Gerald Gardiner politely disagreed on what day was best for rubbish collection, whether it should be the day before or after the weekly milk delivery. They discussed how council rates should increase, at what rate and by how much per each tax band. They weighed up how much they should invest in local libraries, and whether it might be worth starting up a fleet of vans for a mobile service.\n\nThey involved themselves at every level of local government for a meeting that ran well beyond the hour which it was assigned. They enjoyed every minute of it. It all felt so quaint, dealing with local matters when national ones hung over their heads like an anvil. Only when they discussed the possibility of local elections could they feel the rope which suspended that anvil slip for a brief moment.\n\n"Well, it has been a while since they had a proper election, hasn't it?" Gardiner did not specify how long it had been; even now, a wrong date might be read as treason. Nevertheless, the two acknowledged him with a nod of the head. "Perhaps we could organise them in a few month's time, once we've settled in and they've become used to more sensible rulers."\n\n"I'll leave it with you gentlemen," said Butler, rising from his seat. "Apologies, I have a meeting with Maudling and Maples," looking at the clock, "ten minutes ago. Good day." He collected his papers and all but sprinted out of the room, feeling the old pressures mounting again, mourning that he did not have five more minutes to discuss hedgerow notices."

Paul, her husband, joined her there, helping pack away the week's groceries. They talked about the morning's events, though there was at first little to report: gossip that Florence and Paul repeated to fill in silence rather than out of any interest.\n\n"Oh, I overheard something on the radio." Florence folded away a new set of towels; their old pair, once hanging on the line one Saturday morning, had been torn by shrapnel from a stray grenade during the civil war, and a new set was long overdue. "They're saying that there's going to be local elections in a few months' time. The mayor's already talked about not standing for another term."\n\n"Really?" Paul hummed, putting away the carrots and peas into their new refrigerator. "Never liked him. The man was a bootlicker. Always said that, always will." He shoved the potatoes into the cupboard with more force than usual. "So was that lackey of his, uh, you know, the bloke from the pub that one time. Douglas something."\n\n"Ward, dear, and I heard that he's running in the old mayor's place."\n\n"What?" Fortunately, he dropped the lamb only on the counter. "Bloody hell, it'll be business as usual! No, no, that's not right. That's not..." He trailed off; dark thoughts hung over his head like a cloud as he stared into the counter. "Honey," he said, looking up, "how would you feel if I ran for mayor?"\n\nFlorence had expected this the moment she heard that broadcast. "I know you're going to do it anyway, and I don't want to stop you. And I think you'd make a great mayor. You know I'll support you in this...""

butlerflavour.1.d:0 "The second that Rab Butler had stepped through the familiar Downing Street archway, he was bombarded by applause, questions and congratulations. BPP strategists and secretaries swarmed him, competing for his time with questions, some petty and some vital. He nodded graciously and said his thanks, he shook hands, he traded jokes and he gave orders. By the time he was done the crowd of well wishers had thinned and he was left with the ones that truly needed his attention.\n\n"It has been a perilous journey that brought us here, and I would like to thank all of you, for what you have done in the struggle that led us here." he said. "Though there will be reorganizations and great changes in the coming days, the work you have all done will never be forgotten." A smattering of tepid applause met his remark, with several of the attendees no doubt wondering which of them would be "reorganized". With that, he withdrew into the study, along with Nall-Cain's personal secretary.\n\nTen minutes later, Nall-Cain's personal secretary had been made aware in no uncertain terms who the first reorganization would be. As he left, Butler pulled out a folder full of draft proposals from Angus and began to read. He would be busy all day, he knew, even busier than he'd been as Chancellor, but it was a good sort of busy. The sort, he realized with a start, that had kept him from thinking of Sydney.\n\nEver since he'd lost her four years ago, she'd always haunted his thoughts, like an unwelcome ghost. Whether it was cabinet meetings, bill drafts or yelling matches in the commons, most days he would see something small, be reminded of her and fall into gloomy thoughts of their first days together at Cambridge. Of that lovely day they'd spent together in Vancouver when he'd learned William Mitchell was stepping aside as MP, and he'd first stepped into politics by replacing him, blissfully ignorant of where that would lead.

It is an initiative that both of us have championed in the House of Commons for years. Were it not for the obstructions of the old guard, a generation of decent citizens would have no need to suffer the predations of profit-seeking healthcare providers and the debt their services incur.\n\nNevertheless, I remain concerned about other initiatives that you and the Prime Minister have been proposing. The British People's Party was meant to promote the public health and welfare of the British people. Initiatives such as those recommended in the Beveridge Report advance this noble goal. Beyond this, your attempts to insert politics into people's homes and lives under the guise of "democratisation" risks bringing the fractious conflict our singular, holistic party was meant to end.\n\nIt is our role to meet the needs of the British people without burdening them with a further need to engage in the political sphere; I fear that Butler's wounds will re-open the old wounds of divisive partisanship we were meant to resolve.\n\nI hope you consider these words with the importance they deserve, and I implore you to contact me should you wish to discuss these matters in further detail.\n\nRegards,"

fountaine.1.t:0 "No Place for Kings"
fountaine.1.d:0 ""Your Majesty, it is my most heartfelt desire that you allow me to form a government. As you know, the Party is behind me fully, and any government of mine will make certain to respect the monarchy and all its rights."\n\nSo Fountaine said, but Edward was decidedly certain that he was being dishonest. He knew full well of Fountaine's rhetoric regarding the old aristocracy's influence in politics, and he saw no reason to believe that it didn't extend to the monarchy as well. In addition, the push against the party's old guard and pragmatists deeply concerned him, and he was fairly sure that it was a prelude to further power grabs. However, there was little he could do, save for attempt to influence his government into better policies - provided they were even willing to listen.\n\n"Your Majesty, I must insist on receiving an answer today. Britain is ailing from the war and years of decay beforehand, and we need a strong, united government to face it."\n\nThis response jolted Edward forcibly out of his speculative reverie, and he was able to respond in kind fairly quickly.\n\n"Very well, Fountaine, but I must insist that your government takes a far less combative tone regarding the upper class, and that you begin to reconcile with the other elements of the Party."\n\n"Of course, your Majesty. I have never intended to upset the natural order of things in Britain, and the disunity of the Party certainly was not my doing. You have my word that your wishes will be respected when I am Prime Minister."\n\nEdward nodded, and gave his assent to forming a government, but he did not have faith in Fountaine's promises at all. He would have preferred virtually anyone else to have gained control over the BPP, and he knew that when Fountaine was Prime Minister, he could do nothing against him."
fountaine.1.a:0 "Empty promises are readily discarded."

fountaine.2.t:0 "An End to Liberalism"
fountaine.2.d:0 "The response of the Pragmatists of the BPP to Fountaine's gaining power over the government was near-universal horror.\n\nSome tried to hurriedly break ranks to the Ideologues, stressing a newfound desire to aid in the development of a Fascist Britain. Some were accepted into the new order, most weren't.\n\nOthers simply left the Party, becoming independents in Parliament and cutting all ties with their old fascist "allies".\n\nAnd finally some simply hoped to stay on in the BPP as Pragmatists despite the new government, but were quickly shown the error of their ways by being ejected from the ranks of the Party regardless.\n\nAs these hammer blows fell, one after the other, on the ranks of the Pragmatists, Rab Butler convened a private meeting with Harold Wilson and Reginald Maudling.\n\n"I... don't really know what to say, gentlemen. I simply cannot continue leading our faction under these circumstances. In fact, I think if I did stay, Fountaine would find some way to put me in prison for it. I have to leave Parliament. It will be for you, Reggie, and you, Harold, to lead whatever the fascists leave intact of our group."\n\nDejected, Butler paused for some time as the weight of the responsibility he had placed on the other two men sank in. He finally began to speak again, in a crushed, quiet voice.\n\n"When I agreed to work with the Germans and join the BPP, I thought I was helping save Britain from fascism. I thought if I worked from inside against the fascists, I would be able to bring back democracy over time and restore Britain as it was."\n\nHe did not continue, and neither did the two respond. They didn't need to. All three were now certain of one thing - it was all for nothing."
fountaine.2.a:0 "They finally knew themselves for what they were - traitors to their nation, and nothing more."

fountaine.3.t:0 "Loyalty is Mandatory"
fountaine.3.d:0 ""Now, let me be clear. We are not here to horsetrade, or to coax you into following our orders. The Prime Minister sets policy, and the Civil Service executes it to the best of their ability. The only reason this meeting was called at all is because we have already begun to notice a disgusting - perhaps even treacherous - lack of loyalty when it comes to enforcing the most basic edicts of this government." Fountaine had been carrying on in this vein for quite some time, and the seniormost undersecretaries and heads of the emergency services were watching him with a mixture of concealed dread and resentment. He then paused, allowing whatever responses they could make to his rant.\n\nOne of the braver undersecretaries said, "We have just survived a major uprising, sir, and our capabilities are strained as they are. How can we be expected to implement your policies when we can barely administer the country as it is?"\n\nFountaine had been expecting - perhaps even hoping - for this response, and immediately began with his own. "The reason that this administration is weak and incapable is due to a lack of Fascist policy, and its capabilities will never improve without its implementation. I know as well as you do that there are very few men in this room who would consider themselves fascists, and that does not matter. You will implement my policy in just the way I want it, with the zeal of any Blackshirt, or..."\n\nHe then gave a nod to Jeffrey Hamm, the Blackshirt commander who had been previously observing the meeting quietly. Hamm was a far more brutal, less refined public speaker than Fountaine, but that did not matter for his planned message. "Let me be short and blunt, gentlemen. I already know where most of you live, and my Blackshirts will find out the locations of those who I don't. You will follow our orders, or pay.""
fountaine.3.a:0 "The civil servants will comply, whether it be through loyalty, or through fear."

fountaine.4.t:0 "The Great Orchestra"
fountaine.4.d:0 "The BPP campaign office was abuzz with noise, the sounds of ringing telephones, rustling papers and rapid conversations nearly drowning out all else. Office workers ran from room to room, passing notes and messages, while Blackshirts and temporary workers rushed around the office bearing posters, leaflets and flyers, while artists sketched design after design. The office was so chaotic it seemed almost impossible to coordinate, impossible for all except the conductor at its center, now overlooking a poster design with a disapproving expression.\n\n"Not this one," said John Bean, pushing the concept paper away in disappointment. "Too repetitive and far too generic. The point is to focus on today's issues, not an uprising already crushed." He pointed towards the Heer soldier on the right of the poster, marching hand in hand with a British one, "This goes for all of you, less soldiers in everything. Our purpose here is to offer an alternative to Bolshevism. So focus on the worker, not the soldier." He stalked off, muttering to himself.\n\nDistribution was equally frustrating. "As protection", he scolded, speaking carefully to the Blackshirt commanders as though to very slow children. "It's simple, the paid workers put up the posters, and you protect them. We want local communities involved in distribution, not outsiders marching in." The commanders glowered at him, clearly resenting his authority. All the same, he knew they would obey. He dismissed them with a snap of his fingers. "Go on now, get your people in line."\n\nBroadcasting for its part, fared much better than design or distribution. In a number of rooms, radio personalities stood before microphones, reciting lines. It had been Bean's own idea to massively expand up the BPP's presence on the airwaves. Television would mostly reach upper class families, and posters, while a start, were not enough. A combined constant presence of posters and radio though, was a step in the right direction. So long as Britain's workers saw their message everywhere, Bean knew it would inevitably sink in."
fountaine.4.a:0 "The conductor waves his arms, and the flames climb ever higher."

fountaine.5.t:0 "England Lives, And Marches On!"
fountaine.5.d:0 "Every man had his element where he felt most comfortable, and for Andrew Fountaine that was in front of a camera or behind a microphone. The sheer invigorating power of being able to whip men into a frenzy, or inspire them to root out degeneracy with just a word was intoxicating. He could barely keep the smile off his face as the camera was wheeled before his desk. Taking a deep gulp of water, he sat down, nodded to the camera crew and looked straight into the lens.\n\n"Good morning, People of Britain. I am speaking to you now not as your Prime Minister, but as a Briton who loves his country. For decades, you have been threatened by uprisings, by terrorists, Jews, and communists. We live in a period where you have been bombed, terrorized, shot at. No more. Hand in hand with our European brothers, we will march forward into a new, glorious future. A Fascist future, free of degeneracy and terror. When the history of our island is written, they will speak of today as the first day of a new dawn. The Fascist revolution begins today!"\n\nCountless ears would hear Fountaine's words, broadcasted through every television in Britain. Blackshirts cheered the pronouncement from their barracks, saluting the television with utter zeal. Fountaine's MP's toasted and spoke of new times coming, of a great revolution long overdue. The nearly leaderless former Pragmatist MP's watched their screens in horror, unable to look away.\n\nFor those less connected to the byzantine world of Whitehall politics, the broadcast drew a more mixed response. Some murmured of how at least the government was now taking action, even if the Home Secretary turned Prime Minister seemed a little intense. Others muttered fearfully of what the word "revolution" might mean, gesturing at the ever larger masses of blackshirts and propaganda in the streets. The few non-British still living in Britain were more frightened still, wondering just whether Fountaine might cast his gaze on them next. Whatever they felt, one thing was certain."
fountaine.5.a:0 "All of Britain would feel Fountaine's will."

fountaine.6.t:0 "All The Devils Are Here"
fountaine.6.d:0 "Looking up at him from down below, Harold Wilson was struck by the thought that Fountaine looked more like a self-important medieval despot than anything else. The Prime Minister had perched himself high up above in the gallery of the Commons, his face bearing a smug grin as he looked down on the MP currently speaking. Kingswood, Wilson remembered. An Ideologue to the core, a toady and a bootlicker who'd jumped ship from Chesterton to Fountaine in '56.\n\n"...it amazes me, honourable members, how members of our very own party can stand in defense of such blatantly anti-British propaganda. It corrupts the youth with self-hatred and noxious ideologies, and leads them to hate themselves, their country and take up the cause of terror." Kingswood finished his speech with a flourish, before sitting back down. The Speaker nodded, turning over to Wilson. He knew how this would end, yet he had to try. Steeling himself, he rose.\n\n"I would like to begin by thanking the right honourable member from West Dorset for his service" he said, sardonically.\n\nKingswood stared at him, confused. "What are you rambling about, man?" Wilson ignored him, continuing.\n\n"Just as our brave soldiers did during the Uprising, he tries his hardest to defend our youth. My only question is this, to defend them from what? The threat to Britain's youth comes from real and threatening Resistance elements, not from vaguely defined 'Anti British Materials.' Is the right honourable member proposing to defend us from children's books? From Punch and Judy?" He sat back down, a series of snickers following from all around the room. Kingswood's face turned red.\n\nIt didn't change anything of course. It hadn't mattered at all. He could verbally out-spar men like Kingswood all he liked, but when the Speaker asked for those in support of the bill to rise, the BPP MP's all rose from their benches as one, Kingswood glaring at Wilson as he did. As the Speaker announced the passing of the bill, he felt a stirring of fear in his chest."
fountaine.6.a:0 "Fear of what Fountaine would do next without him to stop it."

fountaine.7.t:0 "Daggers in the Sheath"
fountaine.7.d:0 ""You know, gentlemen, I've been meaning to have this meeting for a while now. We should have been sitting here weeks ago." Fountaine had the energy and impatience within him to bark at the two men for hours. He wouldn't, his throat would be sore for the rest of the week and he had several speeches to perform. If there was any week to not kill his voice for, it would be this one.\n\n"This... I don't even know what to call it. Powerbuilding between you two? It is a sign of weakness to the entire world. You are lucky none of your screaming matches have leaked to either the Reich or, hell, even the Judeo-Bolshevik infiltrators still running amuck here. Germany hears of any of this? The revolution will be a homicide case, and the blood will be on your hands."\n\n"And to be completely honest, we shouldn't be sitting here in the first place. We are here to help Britain embrace a revolution, the likes of which the world has not seen in decades. Nobody in our ministry needs this petty squabbling between you two, when we have a job to do."\n\nJeffrey Hamm combed his hair back with his hand. Despite all of that Bolshevik and capitalistic nonsense that Bean might've been throwing at the Prime Minister, the revolution must stand united. And Germany? God, if they had ever found out, every member of the British People's Party would find their head in a noose and all because of a vulgar argument between two ministers? [GER.GetLeader] would surely try all of them for treason. To be completely honest, he would have a fair reason to do so.\n\nJohn Bean scratched his cheek. Hamm, with all his flaws, was a very simple and blunt man. At this point, anybody would have to accept it, yet Bean hadn't. It was clear that the man was very narrow minded and he would also have to accept that. The revolution's implementation is more important than anything else, and he would have to compromise to achieve victory for Britain.\n\n"Are we ready, gentlemen?" Both ministers shook their heads in agreement. Fountaine's stress cleared as this was possibly the shortest meeting a Prime Minister could ever hope for."
fountaine.7.a:0 "Only to be unsheathed when provoked."

fountaine.8.t:0 "What's Done Cannot Be Undone"
fountaine.8.d:0 "The synchronised thud of hundreds - if not thousands - of footsteps was akin to a drum signalling the arrival of the Blackshirts. Legions of the men coated the lawn of Parliament Square, as if some great oil slick had been spilt. Scattered amongst these fanatics was a police officer who, officially speaking, was there to maintain public order - although in reality, it was to protect the public from their excesses. Suddenly, all went quiet as the man of the hour arrived to deliver his speech.\n\nJeffrey Hamm marched to the podium, clearing his throat. "It is a privilege for me to speak to so many of you here today," he began. "To be surrounded by so many great men who, instead of asking what they can take from their country, instead asked themselves what they could give. It fills me with such pride, truly. For you men have sacrificed so much to carry the torch of British civilization. With this torch, we shall set alight all those who seek to corrupt the soul of our great people. We are the first line of defence against degeneracy. Let us today proudly rejoice in being the vanguard of fascism!"\n\nA deafening cheer erupted from the crowd, as almost everyone was swept up in Hamm's words. All save for one.\n\nThe police officer felt a cold sweat descend upon him, as Hamm spoke. It was like watching a car crash in slow-motion; these thugs were going to get many, many innocent people killed, and there was nothing he could do about it. The moment of opportunity had long since passed when the uprising was put down. The man's conscience ate at him for not defecting to HMMLR when had the chance. But now, all he could do was watch the oncoming crash."
fountaine.8.a:0 ""Was it cowardice, that I dared not defect?""

fountaine.9.t:0 "Enslaved to the Future"
fountaine.9.d:0 "Ian Fosters strode with many of his coworkers along the cracked brick walkway. Adjusting his Fiddler's cap, something caught his eye as he turned the corner.\n\nWhy should he have been surprised - nothing but the usual. A poster, marked by the infamous flash and circle that adorned anything the Fountaine ministry would publish. Bolded letters encapsulated the outlining of the piece, THE COMMON MAN WORKS FOR A FUTURE, WHY NOT WORK TOWARDS A BETTER ONE? WORK FOR THE GLORY OF BRITAIN AND WORK FOR THE FASCIST REVOLUTION!\n\nIan scoffed at the idea of the poster. Why in God's name would any worker with an ounce of common sense want to work with this Nazi collaborator government? This notion that any worker would be interested and affected by this propaganda nauseated him. He would look over to some of his colleagues, only to see blank expressions. Ian knew them well-enough that most of these men were mentally blocking the propaganda from their mind, something that Ian could never do. However, horror soon filled his eyes as he looked further in the back.\n\nYounger workers butted shoulders and pointed at the posters. Ian looked in their eyes, these interactions weren't the point-and-laugh type. These young boys, not knowing any better, are intrigued by this. The eyes of almost all of them had a certain shine to them, which to Ian was enough to ruin his day. Eyes turned forward. Don't think about it. These posters wouldn't affect that many. There's only one. Surely there isn't more.\n\nHe should have known better. The posters, and mostly the same one at that, lined the walls for the entire way down to the factory he laboured for. The steel door even had a man rolling the poster up as he arrived."
fountaine.9.a:0 "Better days ahead, you say?"

fountaine.10.t:0 "For a Safe and Secure Society"
fountaine.10.d:0 "The House of Commons lay quiet as a tomb, the only interruption the occasional cough. Every BPP MP's eyes lay fixed upon the Speaker, awaiting the man's words. The Independents for their part seemed more focused on the imposing sight of Jeffrey Hamm and several of his men standing near the exit. Not a single man had dared to ask the reason for their presence at the proceedings, and none of the five seemed to be volunteering an answer.\n\nThe Speaker cleared his throat. "Honoured members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Justice has the floor. Please save all discussion until the Secretary has concluded reading out his proposal."\n\nThe minister nearly jumped in his eagerness to stand. "Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, without the valiant service of the Blackshirts, how many of you could have been strung up or shot by some would-be partisan? To ensure our continued protection and that of all Britain, the Security Services Reinforcement Act will incorporate the Blackshirts as a formal security service akin to the British Free Corps, with all the legal powers associated."\n\nA roar of cheers from the BPP members met the declaration, while the Independents sat silently in fear, unwilling to say a word. "If there are no opposing points of discussion" said the Speaker, "we will proceed to-"\n\n"This is an abomination!" cried out an Independent, lurching to his feet defiantly. "Be silent!" bellowed a BPP MP in response but the man shook his head, refusing to be cowed.\n\n"Andrew Fountaine claims to love Britain, and yet he would deliver her into the hands of men who are scarcely better than the traitors. How can any of you, any of you vote for such a bill in good conscience knowing what these - I will not call them men did in Cornwall? In Edinburgh? These butchers have no place in our government, or in any other!" He looked around, despairing, sinking into his seat defeated when no one would meet his eye.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the Speaker announced that the ayes had carried the bill, to a renewed chorus of cheers from the BPP. Andrew Fountaine said nothing, choosing instead to give Hamm a single pointed glance."
fountaine.10.a:0 "The next day, a certain MP was nowhere to be found."

fountaine.11.t:0 "Lessons In Obedience"
fountaine.11.d:0 ""He's here, sir" said the secretary, nervously. The man was afraid, Fountaine noted. Good. If Hamm inspired so much fear by reputation alone, then his men would have done likewise in the task he'd set them.\n\n"Send him in" commanded the Prime Minister, before turning to face the window with his arms folded behind his back. A moment later, Jeffrey Hamm entered, his secretary hastily moving out of the man's way.\n\n"It's done, sir. They'll do as they're told. A few of them were louder than others, so we made examples."\n\nFountaine smirked as he listened, looking out at all the figures milling about in the street below. Bureaucrats, civil servants and MP's alike, all so used to being insulated. Amusing how easily that illusion could be shattered by one man with a truncheon. He cleared his throat and turned away from the window.\n\n"How many demonstrations did you need? We'll need to draw up replacement candidates, and soon"\n\n"Three", answered Hamm. "The rest understood the message after that. Some resignations, but most accepted. They've lost any wing to cower under, and they know better than to go to the police"\n\nThree. More than expected, but old stupid toads like the kind the Old Guard collected had always been stubborn. Still, three less voices in the commons was a message even a blind idiot couldn't miss. "See that the investigations are closed quickly. If anyone from the police complains, have your men deal with it. But softly. Persuasion first."\n\nHamm bowed his head in acknowledgement before continuing, "The Lords-"\n\n"Not yet", Fountaine interrupted. "We can't touch Wallop's people there yet, and the last thing we need is him going to Veesenmayer to whine or Germania questioning our judgment. Fret not, their day is coming, and soon. I have something of an...alternative solution in mind there.""
fountaine.11.a:0 "The Lords would need a lighter touch than Hamm."

fountaine.12.t:0 "A Breakfast Quarrel"
fountaine.12.d:0 "In the early morning, Hamm and Bean would wake up to an invitation by the Prime Minister for breakfast in his office. "A slice of golden brown toast coated in a layer of juicy poached eggs, a savory chicken gravy glaze and trimmings of roasted chicken across the rim of the toast? You're joking, right?" Both silently chuckled to themselves. This had to be a trick. The Prime Minister had never been such a kind man towards the two in his life, something was off. However, like two kids in a candy show, they could not help themselves.\n\nBean, still swallowing his last piece of toast, interrupted the small talk that introduces any political meeting. "Gentlemen, gentlemen, that meal surely was stupendous, and thank you Prime Minister. But I think it's time we stop this chattering and get on to some truly important matters."\n\nFountaine, placing his dish to the side of his desk, focused his attention on Bean. Brushing the crumbs of his black tuxedo, Bean would begin. "Thank you, Prime Minister. I've had plans for a small bit now for a possible route for our ministry and that would be to appeal to the working class-"\n\nHamm almost spat out his cup of tea all over the hardwood table. "Are you insane? Are you seriously trying to present this- this Judeo-Bolshevik nonsense to the Prime Minister?" Hamm almost laughed, but he held back trying to avoid choking on his own spit.\n\nBean felt the familiar headache return. It seemed to always appear whenever Hamm entered the room. "Coming from the man who has been nothing but an upjumped thug waiting to prey on innocent people his entire life, I would hardly expect you to understand!"\n\nBoth of the men stood up from the table with their eyes gazing straight through each other. Fountaine rose as well, only shouting..."
fountaine.12.a:0 ""Both of you calm down! Clean yourselves up and I want you out!""
fountaine.12.b:0 ""Jeffrey, sit back down. John has always had intriguing ideas, let's hear him out.""

fountaine.13.t:0 "Lessons of Fasces' Past"
fountaine.13.d:0 "John Bean stared down at the piles of torn out newspaper pages, worn out books, and the rare intelligence reports that they could glean from the continent. They were all about European Fascism and the many forms it took, but each and every one of them told him the exact same story - division, infighting, squabbling over the pettiest reasons. And when their central authority collapsed, so too did their regime. For a system that had won the Second World War, the decline had set in quickly. Flicking his eyes to one of the newspapers reporting on the crises in Eastern Europe was enough to reinforce that for Bean.\n\nSomething was rotten in those systems. It was an artificial unity if their leader was removed it all went to hell. As Bean rose his pen, to take another note, he glanced out the window over London's dark and deary streets. The fallout of the uprising was visible everywhere. An uprising that had been caused by more than the sudden absence of Germany. No... it was much more than that.\n\nBrushing the stacks of paper aside, Bean stared at an old diagram of the organization of the NSDAP. All power flowed down, from the Führer to the nation. The same applied with the PNF, all power flowing from the Duce. Bean paused, before grabbing a transcript of the old announcement of surrender. Flipping it over he began to sketch something out. Power depriving from the nation, a bottom-up national development. A new fascism, a new light to shine from Europe, a new model for the world.\n\nBean rose from his seat and walked over to the window. Britain would return to her rightful place in the world as a vanguard, a leader, and an example for the world."
fountaine.13.a:0 "A New Fire Burns."

fountaine.14.t:0 "A Thug By Any Other Name"
fountaine.14.d:0 "The day was a pretty one, with sunlight seeping through the wide bakery windows to bathe the shop in rays of gold. Between the weather, the scent of fresh made sausage rolls and the pot of hot tea Graham had put on for himself, it finally seemed as though things were going alright. Ever since that horrible autumn day when the uprising had begun, he'd dreaded the day war would finally come to Peebles. For months, the war had raged, until at last HMMLR withdrew and he had allowed himself to hope things had been over. Then, the BFC came.\n\nIt was over, Graham reminded himself, his hands shaking as he held the oven door open to pull out a tray. After a terrifying full month of BFC patrols, they had left as soon as they'd come, leaving terror and broken bones in their wake. If one was lucky. The shop door bell rang, causing him to sit down and turn around to see two unfamiliar men in black uniforms. Blackshirts.\n\n"Can I help you, gentlemen?" he asked politely, trying his best not to stammer. The men ignored him, with one lazily picking up his mug of tea and taking a satisfied gulp. He felt an instinctive surge of anger, "Put that-" Before he could react, the other Blackshirt grabbed him by the collar and slammed him into the counter face first, causing him to taste blood. He writhed, but the other man's grip was iron. He heard the sound of his mug being flung against the ground and shattering.\n\n"Tell you what mate, I think you can," he heard the first Blackshirt say in a smug voice. "There's a girl who comes through here in the morning. Some of the boys say she took care of traitor rats when they held this place. That true?"\n\nMaisie, he thought. Ted's girl. "I'm sorry, I don't kn-"\n\nHe was cut off by a baton to the head, causing him to nearly see stars. "I don't know! I don't know!" he cried, whimpering. He felt himself being let go, and collapsed to the ground in a heap.\n\n"Useless bastard," said the other man. And with that they left, leaving Graham alone, clutching his bleeding nose and weeping."
fountaine.14.a:0 "All he'd wanted was for things to go back to the way they were."

fountaine.15.t:0 "Fear of The Past"
fountaine.15.d:0 ""It had to be said sooner or later. Bedford, Lloyd George and Domvile have left the nation a wreck and as I look at it, Britain is unrepairable." The room turned silent, with all eyes on Hamm. Exactly what he wanted by making such a comment. Fountaine would rest his hand against hand. This song and dance would happen too often for his liking.\n\nBean perked up at Hamm's comment when nobody else could. "I would be very careful about just shouting such a statement around. They are nothing like what we just fought against in the uprising. None of them are outright socialists like many of the regional leaders in the urban areas were. They were just misinformed and led by the wrong influences like Beckett and Wallop."\n\nHamm laughed, humourlessly, a bitter smirk on his face. "Yes, and you would surely know a thing or two about being an outright socialist, wouldn't you?" Bean bit his tongue. Such comments from Hamm were the norm, unfortunately. "The men who led us in the past were not who we needed to lead a nation," Hamm continued. "That is why we had several rebellions against the government under their leadership."\n\nEyes in the room all closed in on Bean, who took a deep breath. "A Judeo-Bolshevik and capitalistic mentality was going to form within the Resistance no matter what. It would not matter if the American infiltrators were there or not to influence them, there would be heavy resistance against a Fascist Britain. Most of the major figures of such resistance have been executed or prosecuted and now we can truly enforce our vision; something no previous leader of the British People's Party has ever really had."\n\n"I'm unsure you understand the situation, John. They lead us to failure. Who would want to remember the failures in Britain when we are truly a perfect people? Nobody would want that if they understood the British people, which they clearly never did. They should be completely obliterated from history, no exception. Their leadership should be a mere footnote in history that only the pompous academics would care about.""
fountaine.15.a:0 ""Unfortunately for our forefathers here, they must be left behind. We are here to make change, and why remember people who halted such?""
fountaine.15.b:0 ""Such an inflammatory statement shall be used only behind the closed doors of your mind, Hamm.""

fountaine.16.t:0 "An Excerpt from the Journal of Ian Fosters"
fountaine.16.d:0 "Fountaine and his Chancellor John Bean formed the British Workers' Alliance only last night. The first time I heard of this was in the morning papers this morning. It was a little bit of a rough awakening on my part, never expecting anything from Fountaine. They said to be there at 7 o'clock at night, and hopefully about 750 thousand others would be there to accompany you. Unlike most other things, they were not lying.\n\nThe crowd was packed, and I mean packed. It was surely over the estimated number the government gave. Hell, I even had a hard time parking my BMW. Mine is small, and even with that I couldn't find a good spot.\n\nI was surprised when I saw the flame that burned in the union leader's eyes. I think it was something like Ted Budden. There is something special behind them. Personally I was expecting some 70 year old man that could barely spit out a sentence. But no, he was flailing his arms all around trying to punctuate his words with them. And that beaming smile, I'd never seen nothing like it.\n\nThe massive wave of people somehow respected the guy too. I guess Bean is doing some real work to reel these people in. And to say the least, it showed. There were posters everywhere surrounding Budden's podium, the wall behind him had a massive flash and circle, which was also on the podium itself if I remember correctly. With the bloke's flamboyant energy and the massive amount of BPP imagery, you could say it was a rally and you wouldn't be too far off. Budden was also throwing insults at the other workers somehow without being reprimanded for it. He said some things about there were caveats to being enrolled within the program and if those are broken that all of us would be powerless. Again do not expect anything from Fountaine.\n\nAt this point, it just seems like my job as a factory worker has been used as a tool for the state to bully its enemies out of relevance. I go to work almost everyday of the week to give myself and hopefully down the line my relatives stability. But now what? I go to work almost everyday to serve my country?

Such hopes were ripped asunder by the horrors of the war and what came after, as fascism seized power. Yet until recently, the BFC has overshadowed their older companion as the monster under the bed to look out for. But with the coming of Fountaine, it seems that the Blackshirts have begun to retake the streets they once terrorised.\n\nTheir pervasive gaze observes everything. Their boots can perpetually be heard marching through alleyways. They are engaged in constant brawls and street-fights, intent on crushing the last few sparks of resistance. Their terror is not limited to these old British cities - across the fields of the old countryside, roaming gangs of Blackshirts terrorise small villages and towns suspected of harbouring HMMLR remnants.\n\nOne man is pleased with this terror. Jeffrey Hamm looks upon his minions' doings and finds himself happy with them. Mosley would be proud of his most faithful acolyte - transforming the Blackshirts from a gang of thugs into the arm of BPP was an achievement many could only ever dream of doing, and he had made it a reality. Let Bean complain all he wanted - for there was precious little he could do to stop them."

"Gentlemen, to the King, to the Flag, and to the Nation!" he said. The rest followed in unison with him, before sitting down again.\n\nStaring over the hall, Arthur could sense that there was a visible tension in the air - like at any second, something would break. Still, as chair of the local branch, it was his job to advance the meeting. Clearing his throat, he began to speak. "Ahem. Now, welcome gentlemen. You should all know the agenda for today by now, and as such we will move onto the first motion for the day-"\n\n"Traitor!" a voice suddenly roared from the crowd. "We've all seen London's orders!

Yet sometimes, Fountaine instead preaches of the collective; of the nation, and syndicates working together to propel the it forward.

After all, Britain was all his now. No more simpering "Yes, Prime Minister" at relics like Domvile and Nall-Cain. No more hand-wringing and whining from that resistance rat loving Butler about "injustice" every time he fucking breathed. With them gone and out of the way though, he had an even bigger challenge ahead. An entire country that needed a real, strong Fascist vision, one that would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. One moment of weakness or failure and he could go the way of Chesterton.\n\n"What is it, dear?" asked Rosemary. He turned away from her and looked out the window, absentmindedly drumming his fingers on his thigh.\n\n"It's nothing. Have the staff start making breakfast, would you? It's been a long drive."\n\nHe could feel her frowning at his change of subject, even without seeing her. "I'll go tell them. John asked if he might visit while we're here, by the way." She got out of the car and he followed, waving a greeting to the staff at the door before striding upstairs to his study.\n\nThe staff had kept it in good condition, he noticed. Everything was just as he'd left it, down to the portrait of his father in his Vice-Admiral's uniform. He wondered if his father had ever felt half so lost at sea as Andrew Fountaine felt right now. He'd always been a speaker and a doer, he felt at home at a rally, or working in the Home Office to root out enemies. Ideological visionary screeds and plans for the future of shaping Britain were the kind of thing he'd left to John, or to Hamm. He'd need their advice in the coming days, if the great Fascist Revolution was going to prove any more successful and coherent than the old men who'd preceded them."

Most of my colleagues preferred the meetings indoors, but you preferred to go to the streets, meeting and speaking to as many people as you could. That, I suppose, is one of your greatest strengths. But as you spoke out against Bolshevik influence to a crowd of shopkeepers and artisans, I could not help but remember that perhaps fifty kilometres east was the city of Manchester, where Jack Jones would fire his first shot three years later.\n\nManchester is a working man's city, and it was the alienation of the working man that sparked the fires which twice lit that city aflame. It was their frustrations, which went unheeded by our government for so long, that drove them into the hands of the Bolsheviks. No amount of speeches or rhetoric can fill a man's stomach and keep him warm through the winter.\n\nIf there is any lesson which I can impart to you, let it be this: the government cannot afford to speak over the problems of labour any longer. Though our previous government was divided and slow to act when it mattered, it is now your responsibility in a more united government to address these problems. Listen to the workers, hear their concerns, and do your utmost best to meet them. Our failure to address their needs caused two uprisings. I fear that we may not survive a third.\n\nTake care,"

The night had been valuable for him too, giving him an opportunity to leverage favors with a few, and pressure some others.

Not a single one of the small restaurant's occupants so much as gave him a second look, and why would they? To them the MI5 Director was just another middle aged man enjoying his morning paper. He liked this spot, even though it was far from Leconfield House and his office. It was quiet and out of the way, and more importantly the owners were apathetic and didn't pay a second glance to their regulars.\n\n"Full Breakfast?"\n\nHe gave the rushed looking waitress a polite smile. "That'll be me, thank you." She nodded, setting down a plate with eggs, toast and sausage, before scurrying off to another table.\n\nThe eggs weren't bad, although the sausages were a little dry. The food wasn't as good as his old favorite spot, but after he'd visited the place with Knight plenty of times, it seemed suicidally stupid to return now. Hard to come back considering he'd been seen sitting there with a man who'd been the most wanted man in Britain until recently. He missed the old spymaster and his little eccentricities, like his pipe, or that bird collection he was so proud of. It was darkly funny that a man who in another time would've been an arch-reactionary hunting Philby for his socialism had become one of the closest things he had to a friend.\n\nKnight was gone now, along with Jones, Maclean, Alexander and Stirling. All dead, along with every mole they'd painstakingly planted in MI5 over the years. For the first time, Kim Philby was truly, completely and utterly alone.

Knight was done for, Jones and MacLean were soon to join him, half the Resistance was dead or captured. The rest had scattered, broken so badly that the thought of another uprising in the next three decades was now a blissful impossibility. England has prevailed. Nall-Cain handed the report back to Philby. "Thank Christ they're done," he said.\n\nAn impromptu celebration started in Number 10. Civil servants broke out the brandy and special advisors laughed alongside military officers. Nall-Cain gave a speech, praising the loyal sons and daughters of England for putting down the rabble. He noted that there were some staff who kept their heads down into their work during the party, and a few were outright absent. Citing illness, they had gone home early; Nall-Cain made sure that Philby recorded their names.\n\nAs the celebration continued, Nall-Cain felt weighed down by fatigue. He excused himself and sat down on the terrace. He felt his age. He felt it more than most men; sand in the joints, lead in the bones. Had the uprising taken that much out of him? Perhaps an early retirement was not such a bad idea. From Knoydart, he could relax in his final years with his legacy solidified. He would be the man who kept England together, and he would not need to suffer leading its rebuilding.\n\nA burst of nervous energy shuddered Nall-Cain's body. No, he would not be allowed to get away that quickly. There would be a successor, but he would need to keep the country from collapsing until then. He, like England, needed to soldier on. But not just yet. Nall-Cain rose up from his seat, ready to rejoin the party. They had won only minutes ago, and there was plenty of time to celebrate. Nall-Cain stepped back inside Number 10, setting aside the weights for tonight."

Roy Kemp gripped his pistol tightly, his heart racing as he sat in the warm brick-covered basement of the pub, surrounded by his compatriots. His friends. Men he had fought with for so long, who had seen others fall in the struggle for freedom. They fought, through sweat and tears, and shed blood for the rights of the worker and the common man against the fascist pigs who bowed down to their overlords in Berlin. Now, it all seemed pointless.\n\n"What the hell do we do now?" Roy asked those nearest to him, all standing around a large table as some dust fell from the ceiling when another large truck rolled past. "Everyone is on the run. We're out of hideouts. We're out of bases to work from. We've no place to go. We're fucking dead, is what we are."\n\n"If I'm dead, then I'll take as many of those bootlickers with me as I can!" Anderson, a stout fellow who had spent most of the war as an artilleryman, loaded up his own pistol. He looked at the others. "Who else is with me?"\n\nMost of the others nodded in agreement, grumbling about killing as many of the Nazis as they had bullets. Roy wondered if they felt the pounding of their hearts in their chests like he did in his, as he readied his own pistol. "Me too," he said. He may have been terrified of death, but he wouldn't be caught dead as a coward. "Let's move the tables into defensive positions. Place the chairs here, here, and... here, I think." Roy began pointing, and soon the group of rebels were setting up barricades for cover when the government forces eventually came rushing in.\n\nJust as they finished putting the last table into place, the door upstairs was thrown off its hinges as one of the boots of the fascist dogs slammed into the wood and broke it. Soldier after soldier, armed with a rifle, stormed into the basement. The rebels were ready, firing shots into any who came too far down the stairs. The bodies piled up on the last steps, but so did those behind the barricade. Roy only had a few more minutes left of his life, but he'd go down as he had lived."

"I'm sure you and your men want the best for this country, as do we all. But that rabble of hooligans you call supporters... they are a force that few of us want unleashed on our land.

Just as the initial contracts and offers were being laid out on the table however, Abs, silent the entire meeting, struck.\n\n"Just a moment please gentlemen, now I'm not trying to be annoying here, your presentation was brilliant Mr. Butler and Britain does look like a great place to invest."

Under him, Britain would turn away from Fascism for good, instead sailing down an older route, one of pragmatic paternalistic government. But which port would it finally sail into?\n\nWhatever the future held, Nall-Cain was content.

We require a further enhanced security apparatus and continued operations to root out the last traitors and prevent their return. I and many within the Party are in agreement on this, but I fear that some of our colleagues are too hesitant to strike the killing blow required."

Nothing but tea, biscuits and a vital front in the war for Britain's soul.\n\n"Look, Mr Butler, a lot of us would quite frankly prefer you to win over that glorified thug Fountaine, but you must admit that many of your proposed reforms have made us... uneasy.

Cain nodded at the man understandingly. He had made a good choice in picking Philby as the new head of Britain's intelligence.\n\n"To a Britain free of traitors," Cain said, raising his glass.

We are still in dire straits, however, and our economic position remains dangerously precarious." Butler finished his report to Nall-Cain with an earnest plea, one which soon crafted him a glimmer of hope in the look of genuine interest forming on the Prime Minister's face.\n\n"I see, thank you for telling me how it is Butler. Rest assured that my eye is firmly on our fiscal state following this report." Nall-Cain replied, turning over page after page of Butler's detailed report with growing concern, but also resolving to fix this mess. The report had been brutally honest and left Nall-Cain to no illusions as to Britain's fragile state.\n\n"It is my view, and that of the Treasury, that we need a carefully considered, balanced economic programme to stimulate growth and recovery of our broken infrastructure by courting investment from our Pakt allies. This has a lot of support from within the BPP, but some of our colleagues have... other economic ideas, ones which I, in my capacity as Chancellor, must strongly advise against."\n\nNall-Cain sighed as he leaned back in his chair. "You don't have to tell me twice. Some of the things that Bean chap has been proposing sound almost communist, and Hamm? Pah! The man would crash the pound if he ever touched the door of Number 11."\n\nManoeuvring expertly to exploit this rare opportunity to court Nall-Cain's favour, Butler seized his chance "Prime Minister, our economy cannot be allowed to falter in the years to come, if it does then we'll have another uprising on our hands, and as long as I'm a member of this government I will not allow that to happen."\n\nThe PM nodded.

I however, do." Wallop paused then, gauging the reaction from the audience, all Fountaine loyalists whom he judged could be convinced.

But just how would Wallop get around the restriction on him speaking there?\n\nToday, Butler had his answer as a backbencher rose to speak. Proxies. Looking up at Wallop and the host of Lords, Bedford and Chesterton among them, sitting in the gallery above, he could almost see the strings descending down onto the MP about to speak.\n\n"My Right Honourable friends!" he began, as more and more eyes turned upwards to who was really speaking.

Then there is Mr Butler, well meaning I'm sure, but far too influenced by international finance and bankers.

Ironic, she thought, that she should be standing here, ration coupon in hand, under the remnants of his now dead successors. "Let me 'ave a look at those," said the grocer, taking Mary's selection of coupons and checking them carefully for any signs of forgery. That was another thing that had returned in full swing from the last war she thought; the black market.\n\nSatisfied with their legitimacy, the grocer stuffed the coupons in his pocket and began to rummage around the grouping of crates at his feet, picking out the precise amount of food as dictated by the rations. One by one, memories of waiting patiently for her mother to return with the shopping as Home Guard and ARP Wardens kept watch came trickling back, but that was another war, and another Britain.\n\nLooking to the side, she was reminded just how much Britain had changed. Instead of Home Guard and Police keeping a reassuring eye on things, there was instead a gang of BFC thugs lurking in the corner, the Police clutching their firearms with a wary look in their eyes. And if all that wasn't enough, the Swastika flying high from the town hall, repurposed into a Garrison HQ and yet to be returned, reminded everyone whose boot their necks rested under "There you are ma'am, good day to you." The grocer said, handing over Mary's shopping and snapping her out of her reverie.\n\nAccepting the bag with a simple "Thank you," she began the long walk back home, left alone with her thoughts and fears for the future.

But even the Brigadier knew that was a very dubious comment to make, seeing the destruction that had rocked the few towns that his squad had already passed.\n\nEdwards scratched his temple and looked behind him to see his family's home. He placed both his hands on his head in shock. Wooden planks covered each door and window. Dirt and small spots of blood were stained into the exterior walls. Small holes littering the roof. He threw his bag against what was left of the fence and ran into the home.\n\nHe beckoned out for his father, nothing called back. He called out for his mother, this time with success. Leaning his head into the living room entrance, he saw his mother, secluded to her chair, reaching her hands out to her son. Edwards fell straight into her arms.

As he stood there again, alone but for his bodyguards, he wondered what their founder would think were he still alive to see it now. Its streets, once busy and full of laughter, had nearly no people walking them now. Buildings lay in disrepair, with collapsed roofs and holes visible even from his high vantage point.\n\nThe Earl was no stranger to devastation, the horrors he had witnessed in the fields of Verdun and Neuve-Chapelle would remain with him forever. To see it inflicted on England's green beauty though, disturbed him more than he could say. This is why you fight, he reminded himself. He could not simply sit by and watch as the Jew and the Socialist tore nations apart to their very soil, time and time again. At times the struggle seemed futile, and yet it was a struggle worth fighting.\n\n"Sir? Shall I inform the Mayor you'll be delayed?" asked a bodyguard. Wallop waved a hand, dismissively.\n\n"No need. Wait by the car for now." The bodyguard nodded, leaving him to his thoughts and the barren view. Not entirely barren though, mused Wallop. Far down below, near the docks, a few fishermen were still preparing their boats, loading rods, fuel drums and satchels. Come what may, men of English character gathered up their tools and got to work. And now that the parasites had tipped their hand too early with the uprising, England's people would be free to. All they would need was a stern guiding hand in Downing Street. When his colleagues had suggested the thought thirty years ago, he'd snorted bitterly, dismissing it as an impossibility. But now? Now it was nearly within his grasp, all he needed was to reach out and take it. He turned his back to the town, making his way to the car."

But since you are all so keen to hear what I have to say - and I know that everything I say will be recorded - so I to the men running this new government, I say this."\n\nHe leaned forwards, looking the prosecutor dead in the eye. "I have worked amongst you for years. I know everything about you. Your deepest secrets and your worst nightmares. And I know how utterly venal and blackened your souls are. Each and every one of you Nazi-loving bastards is a traitor to this country. You have failed Britain and her people. And while I may be long dead before your house of cards falls in on itself, that day will come." The former head of MI5 leaned backwards in his chair, a vicious smile on his face. "Oh, it will come. Burn in hell.""

postcw.28.d:0 ""I'M INNOCENT! I'M FUCKING INNOCENT, I TELL YOU! I WOULD NEVER BETRAY HIS MAJESTY! PLEASE, GOD NO, DON'T! I'M NOT READY! PLEASE, NO! NO-"\n\nThe sound of a trap door opening abruptly silenced William Joyce's screams, echoing all the way to the cell in which Knight was being kept. He smiled grimly. At least one good thing had come of this. 'Lord Haw Haw' was one person that the world would definitely be better off without, that was for certain. If only he had been salient enough to name a few more of those pigs when he was stretched across the rack, but beggars could not be choosers.\n\nHis cell door swung open, light flooding into the cell. Two guards stood at the entrance, and Knight knew that his time had come. "Is it time already, gentlemen?" He asked, getting up and allowing them to tie his hands together. Knight supposed that it wasn't too late to plan a daring escape - perhaps he could try and incapacity the guards, before making a break for it. But that wasn't his purpose, at this point, so he instead allowed them to walk him across the courtyard.\n\nThere was quite the crowd that had gathered. Many faceless, suited men jeered at Knight as he walked past, and he glanced impassively at them. They would get what was coming to them one day. As he stepped onto the gallows, he couldn't help but reminisce on how he got here. Those early days as a midshipman in the navy, to the infiltration of the Fascisti. His time as head of MI5. The uprising. Failure. Perhaps one day, someone would succeed where he had failed.\n\nAs the noose tightened around his neck, Maxwell Knight stared out into his crowd of executors. He breathed, and spoke his last words."

WORLD_ENG.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Government Prevails in Britain"
WORLD_ENG.1.d: "After months of bloody fighting, the British government has unexpectedly regained control of the isles. As the collaborator regime was widely seen as being caught off guard and woefully under-prepared, a victory for the government seemed to be untenable. However, after surviving a harsh winter and countless lives being spent, order has been restored.\n\nWith the head of the resistance Maxwell Knight being scheduled for execution alongside most other prominent leadership of the uprising, Prime Minister Ronald Nall-Cain has hailed the government's victory as being a triumph for order and justice.\n\nGerman military presence is expected to reassert itself on the isles in the coming weeks, alongside a period of heavy reconstruction. Along with the end of the uprising, however, Nall-Cain is expected to step down as Prime Minister. Whoever will take his place is unknown.\n"
WORLD_ENG.1.a: "Britain is chained once more."

WORLD_ENG.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Resistance Prevails in Britain" #needs fixing
WORLD_ENG.2.d: "After 20 years of pro-German rule and months of painful, bloody conflict, the uprising in Britain has come to an end, with the insurgent forces of the British Resistance triumphing over the Collaborator government.\n\nFinally unchained from the shackles of Fascism, the new interim government - lead by ex-Spy and orchestrator of the civil war Maxwell Knight, seeks to secure a partnership with the OFN as soon as possible, to safeguard this new freedom.\n\nDemocratic elections are expected to be held soon, with the exiled Conservative and Labour parties expected to field candidates. Celebrations have filled the streets of London and every other major city - although not without a hint of melancholy for all the lives lost in the struggle for a free Britain.\n"
WORLD_ENG.2.a: "Britons never, never, never shall be slaves!"

WORLD_ENG.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Channel Crisis"
WORLD_ENG.3.d: "With the total collapse of the German backed government at the hands of the British Resistance, many wondered if Germany would remain too paralyzed by its own ongoing civil unrest to muster an effective response. Those beliefs have been proven unfounded by confirmed reports of an extensive troop buildup threatening Britain despite unresolved insurgencies elsewhere in the Pakt, along with blistering German condemnations of alleged OFN involvement.\n\nThough at present the White House refuses to confirm or deny any plans to expand support beyond diplomatic and humanitarian aid, the publicly known pro-OFN nature of the Resistance has done little to cool tensions. While the situation escalates, many fear just how far Germany would be willing to go to preserve its strategically crucial western bulwark.\n"
WORLD_ENG.3.a: "Cornered, the Reich readies its lash."

WORLD_ENG.300.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Standoff in the English Channel" #stop moving this down, this is meant to be here next to the original channel crisis event
WORLD_ENG.300.d: "As the German build-up against Britain grew larger, it seemed as if the newly free Britain's fate was sealed, an assumption that has been dramatically disproven today. In a shocking move, the United States has openly deployed its navy into the waters around Southern England, clearly in an effort to dissuade any attempt of a 'Sealion II'.\n\nIn response, the Reich has bitterly condemned the act and so far is refusing to back down to the American show of force over what was once considered the inviolable bulwark of the Pakt.\n\nBoth sides are now locked in a standoff against each other in a massive escalation of the ongoing Channel Crisis, surging already high tensions over conflicts in Africa. With the spectre of war now in the air, the world holds its breath in fear to see what will become of the closet confrontation between Germany and the free world since WW2.\n"
WORLD_ENG.300.a: "The world inches closer to midnight."
WORLD_ENG.300.b: "Who the fuck do they think they are?"

WORLD_ENG.301.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Re-Invades Britain"
WORLD_ENG.301.d: "The conclusion of the Channel Crisis, one of the tensest confrontations the Cold War has seen thus far, has led to a development that many feared would occur: the German Reich has decided to repeat Sealion.\n\nWith the US naval force that sailed into the Channel capitulating under pressure and withdrawing following failed negotiations, the German force that faced off against them has been given free reign against perceived threats to the 'European project'; as a final act, Germany has now landed in Britain for the second time in thirty years.\n\nThough the revolutionaries have stated their resolve to fight to the last of their strength, it is expected that the Wehrmacht will make short work of the British, with German troops landing in numerous locations along the coast. It was observed that Fallschirmjägers have seized Gatwick Airport after a short assault, preceding the landing of countless transport planes filled with tanks and personnel.\n"
WORLD_ENG.301.a: "The Isles cry out in despair once more."

WORLD_ENG.302.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Deal Reached Over Britain"
WORLD_ENG.302.d: "The world is relieved as the Channel Crisis, one of the tensest confrontations the Cold War has seen thus far, has been successfully resolved, as Germany, Britain, and the U.S. have come to an agreement.\n\nIn exchange for German acceptance over Britain's new status, America will pledge to refrain from involvement in a defined group of European countries, a security zone is to be established in English areas facing the continent, and American nuclear weapons will be prohibited within Great Britain, among other terms that the British government will agree to abide by.\n\nThough both sides claim to have reached a favourable agreement, there remains a level of tension due to conflicts in Africa, and many wonder what Britain's new realignment, the most drastic change that has occurred in the post-war order since its establishment, means for the Cold War in Europe.\n"
WORLD_ENG.302.a: "Thank god it didn't end worse."
WORLD_ENG.302.b: "We'll be watching you, England."

WORLD_ENG.303.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germans Retreat From the Channel"
WORLD_ENG.303.d: "In a stunning and humiliating move, Germany has unceremoniously withdrawn its forces that were threatening to invade England without any agreement to address its stated security concerns. The retreat has all but signified the end of the Channel Crisis that has gripped the world for the past months.\n\nWith 'Rule Britannia' being heard sung from the Highlands to Dover, celebrations have broken out across not only Britain, but also the rest of the OFN, with America overjoyed at the successful show of its alliance's power and the Commonwealth stating its delight at the reestablishment of British relations.\n\nWith Britain firmly out of its grasp, unrest has soared in German satellites across Northwestern Europe with the renewed hope that one day their countries will be free too. Germania will need to diligently reinforce its iron grip, lest Hitler's empire be doomed to follow its creator into the grave.\n"
WORLD_ENG.303.a: "Britannia Rules its waves again."
WORLD_ENG.303.b: "This is a disaster!"

WORLD_ENG.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Rab Butler Appointed Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.4.d: "Change seems to be coming to the British Isles, as Rab Butler, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been appointed Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following the resignation of his predecessor Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket. A long-serving member of several BPP governments, Butler's ascent demonstrates the triumph of the pro-democratic Pragmatist wing of the BPP, with several liberal reforms having already been announced.\n\nPromising to restore British democracy and "return prosperity to the Isles", Butler has been met with cautious enthusiasm from much of the previously apathetic populace. However, rumours abound that Butler does not intend to occupy Downing Street for long. Many now look to Butler's chief ministers, Reginald Maudling and Harold Wilson, and their greatly contrasting visions to see what the future may hold for Britain.\n"
WORLD_ENG.4.a: "Will Rab's rabble improve anything?"

WORLD_ENG.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Andrew Fountaine Appointed Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.5.d: "Following the resignation of previous Prime Minister Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket, the British government has taken a decidedly more revolutionary bent as avowed fascist Andrew Fountaine is appointed his successor. A rising star within the BPP, Fountaine rose to prominence as the leader of the revolt which deposed A.K. Chesterton in 1956, the zealous wave of the radical Ideologue wing having now carried him into Number 10.\n\nStanding triumphant before Number 10, Fountaine declared that he shall "Ignite the fire of fascism in these isles", which would "Be a beacon for the whole world to follow." Sources claim however, that a power struggle has already broken out between Fountaine's top advisors, Jeffrey Hamm and John Bean, leaving the nature of the "British Revolution" yet to be determined."
WORLD_ENG.5.a: "The old grew weak, and the young ate the old."

WORLD_ENG.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Lord Portsmouth Appointed Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.6.d: "Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth has been appointed Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following the resignation of his predecessor Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket. A long-time friend and ally of former PM Barry Domvile before his assassination, Wallop's appointment represents a surprising resurgence of the declining conservative wing of the BPP - although there are rumours abound that indicate that the Lord Portsmouth may have his own designs for Britain.\n\nIn his first speech, Wallop announced that he would lead a government "true to His Majesty The King," and that he would "heal the wounded spirit of the realm." How exactly the new Prime Minister intends to accomplish this is unclear, though sweeping reforms across all sectors of society are expected, along with a bullish stance against the German corporations in Britain.\n"
WORLD_ENG.6.a: "A triumph of the Old Guard? Or something even older?"

WORLD_ENG.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Michael Foot Elected Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.7.d: "From far beyond London, they said that the Resistance's hopes were futile and fleeting. From far beyond Whitehall, they said that the upstarts could not hope to fend off the Reich. From far beyond Downing Street, they decried Michael Foot as a romantic with no spine and no chance of victory. Three times they made their predictions and three times they were wrong.\n\nIn an astonishing electoral upset, Foot has silenced all criticism of his party, his policies and his personhood. While time will only tell what this former exile will do with his power, international observers predict that Foot will attempt a sweeping campaign of nationalisations and the creation of a so-called "welfare state" in order to uplift the population. Will they be wrong a fourth time? Or has Britain finally come out from the cold?"
WORLD_ENG.7.a: "They kept the Red Flag flying there."

WORLD_ENG.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Jack Jones Elected Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.8.d: "In a stunning turn of events, the first free and fair elections in the United Kingdom in nearly thirty years has resulted in a government formed neither by the Prime Minister-in-waiting, Harold Macmillan, nor the exiled Leader of the Opposition, Michael Foot, but by a socialist radical and partisan: Jack Jones, the feared leader of the so-called Left Resistance, who played an integral role in liberating Britain.\n\nHaving already declared the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of a new republic on the Isles, commentators expect the trade unionist Jones to pursue a complete restructuring of the British economy to bring the means of production - and all political power - in the hands of the workers and the unions, as well as a cautious openness in foreign policy towards the OFN. With worker's councils reminiscent of the Soviets of 1917 being established all over the country, it seems the red flag has been raised high above Britain.\n"
WORLD_ENG.8.a: "We can work with a Red Britain."
WORLD_ENG.8.b: "Britain falls to Bolshevism."
WORLD_ENG.8.c: "Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer..."

WORLD_ENG.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Keith Joseph Elected Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.9.d: "After two tortured decades, the British Exiles have triumphantly returned to the Isles after the capitulation of the collaborationist government to the partisan HMMLR. In the ensuing first free and fair elections in the United Kingdom in nearly thirty years, the Conservative Party won decisively, propelling its leader Keith Joseph to the premiership.\n\nJoseph, previously considered a Dark Horse leadership candidate following Macmillan's sudden resignation in '62, who won on a split vote, is regarded as the Party's prime representative of its right-wing faction. In his first speech, he promised the British people with an agenda focused on growth, a commitment to see every family housed and co-determination within the labour market. Alongside this, he promises nothing but total co-operation with the OFN against the looming danger of the Reich."
WORLD_ENG.9.a: "The Free World creeps closer to the continent."
WORLD_ENG.9.b: "Britain falls to Zion."
WORLD_ENG.9.c: "Heir of Smith, Son of Ricardo..."

WORLD_ENG.10.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Harold Macmillan Elected Prime Minister"
WORLD_ENG.10.d: "After years as a government-in-waiting, stranded across the Atlantic, Harold Macmillan and his exile cabinet have triumphantly made their return to Westminster after the capitulation of the collaborationist government in Britain to the partisan Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and the holding of the first free and fair elections in the United Kingdom in nearly thirty years, which Macmillan's Conservative Party has won decidedly.\n\nMacmillan represents the moderate, "One-Nation" ideological wing of his party, advocating for a mixed economic model based on Keynesian policies and for considerable social reforms and the establishment of a welfare state in accordance with the wartime Beveridge Report while maintaining culturally conservative positions. Whether "Supermac" will be able to realize his vision for a just Britain is now the question in every Briton's mind.\n"
WORLD_ENG.10.a: "First, Prime Minister of the exiles, now, Prime Minister of his home."

WORLD_ENG.11.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Atlantic Handover"
WORLD_ENG.11.d: "After the German invasion of the British Isles in 1944, the Canadian government was hastily declared the trustee of Britain's various overseas dependencies, such as the Falkland Islands and Bermuda. With the recent restoration of the pre-war British government, Canada has transferred sovereignty of these islands back to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a joint statement, Prime Ministers [CAN.GetLeader] and [ENG.GetLeader] referred to this handover as an expression of mutual trust, allegiance, and friendship. The administrations of these territories issued their own joint statement, declaring their interest in working with the restored government and pledging loyalty to the new United Kingdom. This transfer is expected to be the first of many new initiatives in restoring ties within the Commonwealth of Nations, with further plans for summits and state visits to be announced in the coming weeks.\n"
WORLD_ENG.11.a: "The return of the British Empire?"
WORLD_ENG.11.b: "Thanks for holding onto them while we were away."

#Chief Mouser
chiefmouser.1.t: "Peter III, The Chief Mouser"
chiefmouser.1.d: "Walk into 10 Downing Street and you will hear the shuffling of feet on carpet, the vigorous shuffling of papers, the rhythmic clacking of typewriter keys. Clocks in every room tick as civil servants focus their attention on their work. Radios are tuned primarily to the Home Service for the bureaucrat's edification, save for the one tuned to the Third Network in the breakroom, where tea is poured, biscuits are retrieved and bureaucrats gather around for lunch. The garden is a popular place for quiet reflections in which private secretaries take a break or a long lunch, seated on its benches and admiring the delicate garden work. Special advisors meet in its drawing rooms to discuss the business of the day; their conversations are sometimes sober and sometimes productive.\n\nWhat you will also see is a cat.\n\nPeter III, a black cat which skulked these halls, held an esteemed title: Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. Though a relatively recent tradition, the office of Chief Mouser has brought much joy to the bureaucrats and civil servants who work in this hallowed office. His formal responsibility is the protection of 10 Downing Street against rodents and other pests; informally, however, it exists so that the harried and overworked staff of 10 Downing Street have a cuddly little creature to comfort them.\n\nBut it has been impossible to ignore how old Peter III has become. He has served dutifully in this post since 1947, when he was just a kitten, and in 1962 his efforts have noticeably slowed. He labours to jump up on desks that a younger Peter would have exerted little effort towards. He sleeps longer in the in-trays of staff and must be pried off the morning copy of The Times. He eats less liver than his once-prodigious appetite for liver might allow.\n\nNevertheless, Peter III remains a solid companion for Downing Street's civil servants. Until his last days, he shall bring comfort and joy into their lives."
chiefmouser.1.a: "There is so little joy in 10 Downing Street, but Peter III does his best."

chiefmouser.2.t: "Peter III's Great Journey"
chiefmouser.2.d: ""Peter!" called out a secretary wandering the halls of 10 Downing Street after hours. "Pe-ter! Where'd you go?" At each turn and in each room, she turned on the lights, poked her head in and called out for the Chief Mouser. Her hope was that he would emerge from the shadows, a half-chewed rat in his mouth as an apology for his absence. The rest of the office had long since given up that hope. Ever since this civil war had erupted, 10 Downing Street was a chaotic blur of harried civil servants and an ever-growing military presence, partly coordinating the war alongside Nall-Cain's staff. Somewhere in that chaos, Peter III had quietly slipped away.\n\nHer search having exhausted all corners of the office she was permitted to travel, the secretary then expanded to the streets surrounding Downing. When the day was done, she travelled London with a tin of liver in hand, calling for the absent Chief Mouser. Every stray was a potential contact, every chewed pigeon in an alleyway a clue. She pursued her work with tireless dedication, searching for the one thing that made this blasted job worthwhile.\n\nOn the tenth day of her extended search, she went to Soho Square Gardens. It was night, and electric lights bathed the park in warm amber. In this period of national emergency all was still, save the faint whirr of jeep engines and jackboots on concrete. There, between the legs of Charles II's marble statue, Peter III was curled up. Her eyes shone with delight. Liver in hand, she slowly approached the cat. He rose his head, but did not move. She set the liver down on the base of the statue, and Peter III poked, prodded and finally ate the gift. He craned his neck up and looked at the secretary, whose hand was extended towards him.\n\nShe liked to think that she understood what he was thinking. The soft purr, the nuzzling of her open hand, was a final thank you. Then he turned and leaped off the statue, scurrying into the bushes. It was as close to a resignation as a cat could give."
chiefmouser.2.a: ""Peter III spent his final days roaming England, whose adventures are beyond our scope.""

chiefmouser.3.t: "Feline Diplomacy"
chiefmouser.3.d: "Ronald Nall-Cain's meeting with the German ambassador was meant to confirm, with full certainty, his government's triumph over the rebels. The afternoon proceeded as he expected: they each gave a speech affirming their commitment to good governance in Britain and cooperation with the Einheitspakt, then they had afternoon tea in front of cameras. Diplomatic gifts were exchanged. Polite conversation was held.\n\n"We have one more gift for you," said the German ambassador, and their attention was turned to a cloth-draped box brought forth by one of the ambassador's assistants. Lacking a magician's flourish, the ambassador merely pulled the cloth out of the way and revealed a pet carrier. Emerging into the light was a little creature, white-coated and blue-eyed, with wide ears and small, straight whiskers.\n\n"She is a German Rex," recited the ambassador with little intonation as his gift blinked. Nall-Cain looked at the ambassador, then at his staff who lay beyond the crowd, then at the cat. "A product of Aryan breeding born only a few days ago, we give this gift to the English people as a symbol of new life out of the struggles of war."\n\n"Well," he said, "what a lovely gift, Mr. Ambassador." He scooped the kitten up into his arms, who seemed too bewildered to scratch her way out. "You know, we've been looking for a new Chief Mouser." He gave the kitten a little scratch on the head. Some of the civil servants in the crowd deflated; the Reich's generosity precluded their own pets from being selected. The German ambassador had a vague idea of what a Chief Mouser was and did not care to know more.\n\nThe cat looked up at him with those big eyes, and Nall-Cain was struck with a question: what to name her? An answer soon followed, one that would hopefully call to mind a simpler, stronger time. A name that would tell everyone that everything was just like it was before."
chiefmouser.3.a: "Say hello to little Peta, Britain."

chiefmouser.4.t: "Blue Sky Thinking"
chiefmouser.4.d: "Peta paced the length of Andrew Fountaine's office as he signed off on tonight's final work. Most reports requiring his attention involved the growing rivalry between Hamm and Bean. Every day, one or the other received a new source of support, and Fountaine had trouble trying to keep up with who was the favourite in his office.\n\nHe felt claws on his legs and let out a slight yelp of panic. Peta had crawled up his leg, thinking the best spot for a nap was the Prime Minister's lap. "Bloody cat," he muttered. His hands reached out to grab the Chief Mouser but stopped mid-flight. An idea formed in the Prime Minister's head: silly, yes, but alone in his office, none would know and think less of him for indulging it.\n\nWith Peta perched on his lap, Fountaine pulled out some old photographs from files on his desk. He found a less than flattering one of Hamm in his old black shirt, arm raised and shouting at some past rally. Bean's was far less dynamic, a mere front-facing portrait in which he wore a somewhat gormless smile. Clearing some space at the end of his desk, he sat these two photographs at equal distance from each other, their faces towards Fountaine and his newest advisor.\n\n"Come on, girl," said Fountaine. "Which one do you like the most?"\n\nPeta's eyes flicked between the two portraits. Fountaine watched the trajectory of her head with curiosity and trepidation. He could not see her face directly, but in his mind's eye he conjured a facial expression which read as pensive thought in a cat and projected it onto Peta as her head swivelled between the two photos.\n\nThen she turned around, leapt off the desk and wandered to the door. Fountaine could not help but chuckle; he got up and opened the door, letting out the Chief Mouser to return to her duty."
chiefmouser.4.a: "He dared not recount this tale to anyone, lest they think he was mad or desperate."

chiefmouser.5.t: "A Peculiar Pest"
chiefmouser.5.d: "Wallop would never admit it openly, but his first thoughts upon seeing the newest Chief Mouser skulking was whether they would kick up too much of a fuss if he stuffed the mangy rat-catcher in a sack and threw her into the Thames. Perhaps that sounded harsh, but Wallop had never particularly liked urban cats. Separated from a natural wilderness suitable for its development, raised among humans who could not teach these cats what its true mothers might, these little creatures would wreak havoc on natural wildlife. Many smaller animals risked endangerment or extinction because the urbanites of Britain insist on keeping these pests as pets.\n\nWallop preferred the stalwart companionship of dogs to the arbitrary proclivities of a cat, but he admitted that was a hard sell for 10 Downing Street. The staff who he inherited were used to a feline presence, and the staff he brought with them had come to expect it. They had all heard stories about the light Peter III brought into their lives and demanded that Peta bring them the same. Considering the secretaries he caught cooing over the creature in lieu of proper work, Peta had succeeded.\n\nLate one night, when the demands of his new role forced Wallop to stay at 10 Downing Street rather than his beloved Chequers, he kept his head down and his lights dimmed, writing as if under candlelight to replicate a more comfortable experience. His door was left slightly ajar, as he was expecting Bedford to join him later that night, but the door creaked open with nobody there. Wallop looked up, and like an unwelcome phantasm up leaped from behind the desk the Chief Mouser.\n\nPeta meowed, stretched her limbs and lay down on Wallop's paperwork. His mental defences broke under this overwhelming assault. With a liver-spotted hand, he reached out and scratched between Peta's ears. The cat closed its eyes, purred and, having found this act of fealty acceptable, leapt off the desk and back into the light of the hallway."
chiefmouser.5.a: "Peta would be spared the sack and the river this day."

chiefmouser.6.t: "Catfights"
chiefmouser.6.d: "Butler saw Wilson enter the room with a frown; that was expected, a sign of some conflict old or new that he would have to mediate. Maudling frowned—no, Butler blinked, and then he saw confusion on his face. "Mr. Wilson," Maudling asked, "just what the hell have you got on your face?"\n\n"This?" Wilson ran a finger over the fresh scratch on his chin. "Nothing to bother yourself with, Mr. Maudling. Now," opening his briefcase on the table, "regarding the latest proposal from—"\n\n"You haven't been in a fight, have you?" Butler meant it honestly, but Wilson's deepened frown suggested a lack of appreciation for that concern.\n\n"Very well, if you must know. It's that mangy little cat of yours, Peta."\n\n"Peta scratched you?" Butler's jaw slackened in slight horror; Maudling snorted, covering his mouth to suppress his giggle. "But we know her to be a sweetheart! Besides, what were you doing with Peta in the first place?"\n\nWilson sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Mary wanted to see the new Chief Mouser, and she insisted on bringing Nemo along. God knows why, but in a few minutes the two were in a bloody great row." He tried to ignore the tittering that escaped Maudling's grip. "Mary was screaming, the cats were screaming. I tried to pull Peta off Nemo, and the little bugger clipped me on the face. I'm telling you, that monster was out of control, Nemo might have sepsis, and would you stop bloody laughing, Mr. Maudling?"\n\nMaudling cackled like a broken engine, doubled over into the table. Wilson grit his teeth, eyes narrowed, brow furrowed. Butler, with the same mental picture of a flustered Wilson trying to pull away squabbling cats, forced himself to wipe the smirk from his face."
chiefmouser.6.a: ""Okay, Reggie, that's enough. We have business to discuss.""

# William Joyce events
joyce.1.t: "Germany Calling"
joyce.1.d: "Clemens Arneth waited outside London Airport, and saw his passenger emerge from the concourse; a sneering, scarred bespectacled man flanked by a makeshift honour guard. William Joyce, the new Lord Protector of Great Britain, barely paid attention to Arneth as his new bodyguard opened the passenger door of a New Class sedan. He threw himself in as Arneth stepped into the driver's seat.\n\n"It's an honour to meet you, Lord Protector," he said. "My name's Clemens, and-"\n\n"Forgive me, Clemence," Joyce snapped, "but just drive."\n\nArneth did as he was told. Maybe he would warm up later; he was stuck with him. They drove north along the M23, little flags bearing the new national symbol fluttering in the breeze, flanked by military jeeps Arneth had driven in Moskowien. The car shook along the battle-torn road; Joyce scoffed at the sights outside.\n\nThey entered the city at noon, where Arneth saw little plumes of smoke in the distance. The streets were clear save for transport trucks and military vehicles; soldiers outnumbered civilians two to one, and German soldiers outnumbered British ones six to one. Gunshots echoed off the concrete and cobblestone; Joyce flinched and gasped. "Nothing to worry about, sir," Arneth said, turning off the A3. "Just some clean-up." They passed by freshly-cleaned walls with horizontal lines of holes, homes with caved-in roofs.\n\nAs they drove closer to the city they encountered an endless number of armed checkpoints. Some saw the license plate and waved it through; others closer to the Thames triple-checked Arneth's papers. Joyce held his tongue at this delay. They crossed over the river and along the Millbank, passing by iron-frame carcasses towards Westminster. "Here we are, sir," said Arneth, who received nothing more than a scoff. He opened the door and watched Joyce leave with only a mumbled thanks, leading him inside towards his new office."
joyce.1.a: "As the doors to Britain shut behind Joyce, another volley of gunfire echoed along the river."
