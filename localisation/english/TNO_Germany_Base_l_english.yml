 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "How does one begin to define Adolf Hitler, Führer and Reichskanzler of the Greater German Reich, the undisputed tyrant of 19 countries, the architect of Welthauptstadt Germania, Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, Führer of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Time Magazine's Man of the Year in 1938, 1946, and 1961?\n\nA man of humble beginnings, the son of Austrian Innkeepers, he was educated in Munich and Vienna, and served with distinction with the German Army during the First World War. His rise to power was meteoric, none can deny, and even failed attempts like the Beer Hall Putsch served only to further his ambitions. His combination of violence and showmanship drove the communists and democrats out of the Reichstag and placed him into its highest office. Under his leadership, Germany broke the chains of the Versailles Treaty, developed a terrifying new military, and forced the other nations of Europe to their knees until the Swastika flew over all of Europe, from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea. Under his guidance, the Reich built wonders such as Germania, and under his watchful eye, the Undesirables of Europe were viciously exterminated and fed to the flames.\n\nBut the lord and master of all Germany, of all Europe between the Urals and the Pyrenees, has grown old. Where his voice could once command a crowd's rapt attention there is now only quiet rasping, and a cold calculating mind of steel has gone to rust. The hands that penned Mein Kampf constantly tremble now, as he adds the final touches to a watercolor of those long-dead faces slipping from his memory. The greatest conqueror the world has ever known since Alexander and Napoleon is an old and frail man. In 1962, he is 73 years of age, and some dare to whisper that he is not long for this world. The fear of all the world is that once the Führer's funeral pyre is lit, it will spread the great conflagration of war all across Europe once more."
 REICHSTAG_EMERGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Führer has tragically passed, and the Reich was shocked by the news. After all, who could expect such an invincible man to die?\n\nNot the Reichstag, apparently.\n\nDespite the Führer's clear designation as to who his successor will be, many within the government are up in arms. The reformists, conservatives, hardliners, and fanatics are all at each other's throats, and all pretenses of a peaceful and orderly transfer of power are rapidly vanishing. As a result, a group of fence-sitters, no-name bureaucrats, and other Reichstag members too unpopular to be courted by any faction have bounded together to declare themselves the official intermediary executive branch until the new Führer's inauguration, as per a constitution that everyone had collectively ignored for the past thirty years.\n\nThe main contenders for the Führership have all paid little attention to the Emergency Council, viewing them as benchwarmers at best and insubordinate traitors at worst. The only light side is that their presence has given a shadow of stability in Germania, stopping the city from spiraling into chaos so that a more competent leader can (hopefully) take charge. They may have saved Rome from burning, but they are content to fiddle as the rest of the empire goes up in flames."
 POLITICS_HANS_SPEIDEL_DESC:0 "Long has Speidel served proudly in the Wehrmacht and long has the nation been proud to host him. First rising to fame after narrowly staving off a Civil War in the 50s thanks to his quick coup against the SS in the east during the heights of the West Russian War, where he was awarded the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds for gallantry in battle. A rising star, he further rode off the popularity of his old leader and personal friend, Rommel and became one of the most beloved figures in Germany. Later Speidel challenged the Reich's many militarists, namely Ferdinand Schörner, sabotaging Schörner's career and for the second time in Speidel's life preventing a coup in the Reich when he prevented Schörner from taking control of the Wehrmacht for his own gains.\n\nStill, Speidel is not a politician and feels strongly against the increasing ties between the Wehrmacht and the government. Fearing military control of the Reich would destroy it, he has refused all attempts to bribe and cajole him into one of the various factions in the Reich and continues to state that as a soldier his duty will always be to the people. While noble, this means that Speidel is a small island in a swirling sea, and every day the tide comes ever higher."

 #Ministers
 GER_Theodor_Oberlander_hog_desc:0 "§YReichstagpräsident\nIdiosyncratic Nazism§!\n--------------\n§LHighly educated, highly opinionated, and highly controversial - Theodor Oberländer, the President of the Reichstag, is an anomaly amongst the ranks of the NSDAP. Speerites consider him a conservative, even a reactionary. Orthodox National Socialists, however, see Oberländer as a reformer - and a lesser evil compared to Speer - one who would push for a great deal of social change and reform in the Reich's aching structures, yet try to keep the ideology alive.\n\nAfter receiving doctorates in Economics and Agriculture, Theodor Oberländer went on to serve in the Abwehr, eventually leading the Special Group Bergman in Ukraine. Oberländer was, however, eventually removed from this position following a series of missives to the Führer in which he criticized racial policies such as Generalplan Ost as misapplied National Socialism.\n\nFar from killing his career, however, this pushed Oberländer into the political sector. Campaigning from his position as a professor at Prague University, Oberländer managed to secure a seat in the Reichstag. At first one of the earliest members of the NSDAP's reformist faction, Oberländer split with Speer when it became clear to the doctor that the architect cared more about appealing to students and liberals than correcting ideological failings. While no faction loves Oberländer's ideas, it is clear many of the Reich's people do.§!"

 GER_Martin_Bormann_hog_desc:0 "§YParteiminister\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LThe masses cheer Hitler, the army salutes Göring, and the intellectuals admire Speer's oppressive architecture. Yet how many Germans would recognise Parteiminister Martin Bormann, the little grey man lurking in the Führer's shadow?\n\nMen of grand goals often boast humble beginnings. Born to a postman at the turn of the century, Martin Bormann lived through the First World War to become an estate manager of a farm. Violence was never far behind the young man. He was imprisoned for assisting the brutal murder of a school teacher, became a treasurer for the Freikorps, and leapt into the SA with thuggish vigor. An obsessive administrator with bureaucratic finesse, Bormann eventually joined Hitler's Inner Circle as the Chief of the Party Chancellery.\n\nOver the last two decades, the Brown Eminence has weaved a web of deception, bribery, and blackmail, coalescing power around himself with appointments, promotions, and firings. He sits at the heart of this web, smoking a cigar, fawning pathetically before his superiors while treating his subordinates like cattle. His opponents consider him a crude and uncultured parvenu who has transformed the NSDAP into his own corrupt plaything; his supporters preach loyalty so long as they can maintain their positions of power. While despised by many, the Parteiminister has entrenched his position by standing firm against the growing forces of revision and reaction.\n\nAs the Führer's health fails, will the Brown Eminence finally step out of the shadows?§!"

 GER_Hermann_Goring_sec_desc:0 "§YReichsmarschall\nStratocratic Nazism§!\n--------------\n§LIf Adolf Hitler is the undisputed father of the German Reich, Hermann Göring is its beloved uncle. Born in 1893 to Heinrich Ernst Göring, the former governor of Südwestafrika. An early follower of the Führer, Göring has been by Hitler's side since the early days of the Nazi Party in the 1920s. He was a prominent member in the abortive Munich Putsch of 1923 and prominent party leader. His loyalty has not gone unrecognized or unrewarded. Once the Nazi Party took power in 1933 he was made Minister-President of Prussia and President of the Reichstag, both positions he held until the 1950s. After his Luftwaffe aided in the stunning victory over France, Hitler bestowed Göring with the title of Reichsmarschall as a symbol of his authority, at least in theory, over the Wehrmacht - second only to Hitler's.\n\nFollowing the Reich's victory in the Second World War, Reichsmarschall Göring's power seemed more secure than ever, but events quickly transpired to diminish his station. His choice to resign several key positions, including his Reichstag presidency, in protest of the attempted SS coup may have been an act of loyalty to Hitler, but it left him out in the cold when the reformist wing of the NSDAP began to make major pushes in the assembly. In the years since Göring has come to rely more and more on the militarist officers of the Wehrmacht for his base of support, a mutual partnership in which he supplies them political capital in return for the backing of their arms.§!"

 GER_Albert_Speer_eco_desc:0 "§YReichswirtschaftsminister\nReformed National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LAlbert Speer is a silver-tongued politician, knowing what to say on just the right occasion; an expert in getting people over to his side with honeyed words and promises tempered by his background as Minister of Armaments and War Production in the Second World War. Under his reign as the Minister of Economics, however, the economy has seen a steady decline, from the massively inefficient post-war economic system of slavery showing its undeniable flaws, to the general sensation of stagnation in Nazi policies. Yet, even though Speer was arguably one of, if not the most important man responsible for engineering the mass slavery in Germany's colonies, today he speaks against the same creation he partook in and encouraged.\n\nAfter a period of moderate obscurity in the '50s, Speer began an intensive campaign of rallying his support. His supporters are the apathetic men and women who lost their jobs or had their family killed in wars, the technocrats and the reform-minded NSDAP members, the disillusioned National Socialists who were not awarded their promised Aryan utopia, and as a token yet active minority, and the small but slowly growing group of students banking on Speer as their only hope for more radical reform. Each hopes for a different facet of Speer's promises, but nevertheless create a shaky united front of 'reformed' National Socialists.§!"

 GER_Walther_Hewel_for_desc:0 "§YReichsminister des Auswärtigen\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LIn a world of foes both real and imagined, the Reich needs a politician capable of asserting its strength on the world stage. After the downfall of the incompetent Joachim von Ribbentrop, Adolf Hitler appointed his close friend and confidant Walther Hewel as the new Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs. A former coffee salesman, Hewel has scaled the greasy ladder of the Foreign Ministry to become the most important diplomat in the Einheitspakt.\n\nUnlike his boisterous predecessor, the shy and good-natured Hewel has sunk into the bureaucratic background as a tenacious and steadfast Conservative of the NSDAP. While he lacks the dynamic intelligence and independence necessary for being a great Reichsminister, his loyalty to the Führer is unmatched.§!"

 #Generals
 MILITARY_HENNING_VON_TRESCKOW_DESC:0 "§LHenning von Tresckow, called the Last Prussian, is a well-known and well-regarded commander in the Wehrmacht. Born to a family of nobles in Brandenburg, von Tresckow intended to continue his family's proud military history, and fought in the Great War. After the war's loss, von Tresckow supported the Nazi movement, believing it to be the only way Germany would restore its territorial losses after the Treaty of Versailles. This idealism was shattered during the Night of Long Knives however, and von Tresckow began to feel a strong hatred towards the NSDAP, something that only increased during the Reich's later actions.\n\nDespite this, however, von Tresckow served admirably in the Second World War, leading numerous operations on the Eastern Front that some mark as vital to Bukharin's collapse and the victory of the Reich. During the war, Tresckow was reportedly known to meet with several individuals who would later be executed or arrested for conspiracy against the Reich or the Führer. Von Tresckow himself, however, was never implicated in any of these crimes, so these meetings were quietly swept under the rug.\n\nA man of discipline and Prussian gentility, von Tresckow strongly despises the politicization of the armed forces and the extrajudicial hellscape he believes the Reich has become. Surprisingly, Tresckow's highly conservative Prussian mannerisms have led him to become one of the army's leading voices for reform. Albert Speer has welcomed von Tresckow into his circle of ministers, and the old soldier has gladly taken a chance to restore the parts of Germany's golden days that he feels the Nazis have discarded, even if he despises that he must enter politics to do it.§!"
 MILITARY_HANS_SPEIDEL_DESC:0 "§LHans Speidel, like many of the senior generals of the German Reich, is a veteran of the First World War, having served as a company commander in the Battle of the Somme, and having remained in the down-sized German army following the Treaty of Versailles. He continued his excellent record of service in restoring Germany to power in the Second World War. Specifically, Speidel is famous for leading the capture of Leningrad in the Second World War, one of the Reich's most damning blows against Bukharin and his Bolshevik comrades.\n\nSpeidel is undoubtedly one of the most powerful men in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, and he has the talent to show it. A leader for the Reformists within the Reich, Speidel believes that Germany should maintain its status as a global hegemonic power, but pays little heed to the Nazi racial policies, which he views as barbaric and outdated. As such, he has pushed for the Reich to adopt the trappings of modernity and reject some of the more outlandish aspects of National Socialism.\n\nThis, combined with his lack of membership in the NSDAP, has earned Speidel many enemies within the Reich. His promotion to Chief of the OKW caused outrage amongst the more conservative and reactionary elements of the nation, though the reformist faction was pleasantly surprised. Regardless of one's view on his political beliefs, however, Speidel's military record is damn near spotless.§!"

 to_banish_want_desc:0 "The Revolution of the Common Man incinerated the decadence of yore, tearing everything and more down, fueled by promises of a fuller life under the Better World Order of National Socialism.\n\nDecades of economic mismanagement and ruin followed. Lebensraum was hardly realized and proved, alongside projects like Germania, the catalyst of the Reich's self-obliteration. Slavery, both stop-gap measure and means to racial destruction at once, ultimately destroyed an entire generation's productivity and faith in the Party. The inability of the NSDAP to scale down on the overbloated Wehrmacht's budget only adds insult to injury. This is a dead end."

 the_two_principles:0 "The Two Principles"
 the_two_principles_desc:0 "The NSDAP sought to be the party with a true ideology - and the one and only power in Germany. By these principles, the Party fought and won, securing itself a stranglehold over the now most powerful empire on Earth.\n\nBy 1962, with the attempted SS coup, economic breakdown, West Russian War and the repeated failures of the Nazi Party all but incinerating their image as the one and only power, rampant factionalism is burning down what little remains of the 'true ideology'. All of this under the satisfied guidance of Adolf Hitler, and utter shock of the German people."

Not unlike the NSDAP's leadership, the German people are deeply divided, united in only one matter - fear for their future."

For a while, it seemed as though nothing could stop the German god of war.\n\nRot soon infested the Wehrmacht where once glory reigned. If it wasn't for the few bright minds in it left, the Reich would have collapsed in the West Russian War. With mad bombing runs and boundless conscription, it desperately clings to relevance - but there is no way around it. The god of war has gone over to the other side."

 GER_speer_find_reformers_desc:0 "The Führer, in close cooperation with Henning von Tresckow and his assorted allies, will be making reforms within the Wehrmacht that will seek to reduce the factionalism and conflict within the armed forces, upon which any members seen attempting to form their own cliques, factions, or generally trying to divide the Wehrmacht will be met with severe punishment. Tresckow's own faction of reformists will be encouraged with Albert Speer's political expertise."
 GER_speer_new_kindof_war_desc:0 "Unfortunately for many in the Wehrmacht, modern warfare is not amassing gigantic armies and filling the planes and tanks - well, the latter is true to some extent, but warfare has changed. We can learn from our experiences in the West Russian War, on the importance of logistics, coordination, of manuevering every part of our army together to outwit and outflank the enemy, and to always, always have the upper hand in reconnaissance. It is not a question of whether or not the army will accept this new way of war.\n\nIt is a question of when."
 GER_speer_sensible_economy_desc:0 "Under the guidance of State Secretary Ludwig Erhard, whose ideas sharply contrast the ones before, the Reich is making a massive shift away from the previous mode of economic control, which relied on strict autarky, protectionism and state control alongside cooperation with conglomerates. Erhard proposes a much more free market-based economy, alongside reaching out to several countries across the world and letting goods flow to and fro Germany, which should help reverse the '50s economic crash."
 GER_speer_opening_the_market_desc:0 "Ludwig Erhard has repeatedly badgered that no modern economy can suffice on its own, and must instead rely on export and import with other countries. While this hasn't necessarily resulted with us opening up to the superpowers, we are starting to more actively approach smaller countries who could benefit from our massive amount of resources, and the influx of cash that they could give us - something dearly necessary in this time."
 GER_speer_scale_back_milproduction_desc:0 "Given Speer's experience as Reich Economics Minister, he is fully aware of how over bloated the military industry can become very quickly without enough oversight. Though a large and powerful army is extremely helpful, there is a difference between large and powerful, and simply wasteful. Military production will be slowed down under his hand, and the money used to build planes and tanks can be used to build roads and factories and rebuild houses."

 ## Opening
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon:0 "A Man on the Moon"
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon_desc:0 "This is our moment, the culmination of decades of tiresome research and continuous advancement. Headed by the brilliant Prof. Dr. Wernher Freiherr von Braun, the German Aerospace Center is ready to commence its greatest operation to date: landing the first man on the moon. If successful, it will become the Reich's greatest scientific achievement since the weaponization of the Atom. The 'Space Race' is to now come to an end, with the dominant will of National-Socialism soon to triumph over the degenerate Americans and backwards Japanese once again. Heil Hitler!"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy:0 "The Enemy of My Enemy"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy_desc:0 "Despite our rather lucrative partnership during the Second World War, our diplomatic relations with the Japanese Empire have since become significantly more frosty. As we battle for dominance in the East, it is perhaps time to warm our relations with a certain former enemy who despise the Japanese even more than we do: the United States of America. Despite our opposed political philosophies and troubled past, if we can warm our relations together we may be able to contain the Samurai and ensure the fall of the Rising Sun."
 GER_the_speer_proposal:0 "The Speer Proposal"
 GER_the_speer_proposal_desc:0 "As Reich Minister for Economics, Albert Speer is the single highest authority on the issue of the Großgermanisches Reich's economic situation. With the Führer's mark of confidence, Herr Speer has gained considerable influence within the NSDAP, now being able to influence German domestic and foreign policy decisions. Given this influence, Reichsminister Speer has proposed a new easing of trade and diplomatic relations with the United States in order to successfully counter the influence of the Japanese Empire."
 GER_ease_the_embargoes:0 "Ease the Embargoes"
 GER_ease_the_embargoes_desc:0 "Regrettably, the Großgermanisches Reich and Einheitspakt is currently under a trade embargo from the United States and their Organization of Free Nations (OFN). However, with the adoption of Reichsminister Speer's proposal, this may hopefully change soon. In accordance with Speer's proposal, it's time we extend an olive branch to the U.S. Government to arrange talks aimed at the easing of trade restrictions on certain goods between the OFN and Pakt. If we are successful in our attempts, the projected increase in trade will hopefully boost the Reich's desperate economy."
 GER_the_almighty_dollar:0 "The Almighty Dollar"
 GER_the_almighty_dollar_desc:0 "With our own currency, the Reichsmark, being in an astonishingly weak position when compared to that of the U.S. Dollar on the international exchange, Reichsminister Speer has implored the government to enact drastic reform to our draconian foreign currency policies. With our own foreign currency reserves shambolic, enacting reform and easing restrictions will hopefully boost our international economic position and foster improved economic relations with the U.S. in the process."
 GER_the_red_telephone:0 "The Red Telephone"
 GER_the_red_telephone_desc:0 "With the recent 'détente' in German-American relations, it's best we aim to maintain these gains no matter what may occur. Given the history of conflict and aggression between our two nations, it's been suggested that the establishment of a Germania-Washington hotline would be beneficial for both partners, allowing for direct communication between the Führer and President in times of crisis. A direct link between our two nations which may be key in preventing a terrible escalation between our nations, and to ensuring the very survival of mankind itself."
 GER_intelligence_sharing:0 "Intelligence Sharing"
 GER_intelligence_sharing_desc:0 "To further our new cooperative relationship with our transatlantic brethren, it's perhaps time to propose a rather radical concept - intelligence sharing. Although both the German and American intelligence services are mired in obscurity and competition, it's best we punch a hole through said obstacles and work toward improved cooperation against the Japanese Empire. For we will both be able to more effectively fight the growing influence of Japan if we are prepared to share sensitive information on their activities."
 GER_the_trojan_horse:0 "The Trojan Horse"
 GER_the_trojan_horse_desc:0 "With the improvement in German-American relations being watched closely across the world, the citizens of the United States and Reich alike hold their breath in the hope that this 'détente' will eventually result in the achievement of friendship between the traditionally cold Superpowers. As the world watches, we will now launch our most groundbreaking diplomatic move yet. Already endeared to the Americans who view him as their friend within the Reich, we will send Reichsminister Albert Speer to conduct a state visit to the United States on behalf of the Führer. Unthinkable five years ago, the turning of the tide in the Cold War will be clear for all to see, especially the Japanese Empire."
 GER_the_bormann_proposal:0 "The Bormann Proposal"
 GER_the_bormann_proposal_desc:0 "As Parteiminister, Martin Bormann wields an astonishing amount of power within the Reich. With the Führer's support, Herr Bormann has risen to become the undisputed leader of the NSDAP, able to greatly influence German domestic and foreign policy decisions. Given this influence, Parteiminister Bormann has offered the government his proposal advocating for increased cooperation and the achievement of a proper understanding with the United States in order to successfully counter the influence of the Japanese Empire."
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts:0 "Joint Propaganda Efforts"
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "It's evident to Herr Bormann that the seemingly ever continuing propaganda war between the Großgermanisches Reich and the United States is detrimental to any attempt at forging a cooperative-alliance against the Japanese Empire. It has thus been suggested that perhaps if the U.S. and Germany were to partake in a joint propaganda operation against the Japanese Empire it would greatly damage their ability to gain further global influence. For if we are to unite against Japan, we must have a unified voice to the rest of the world about their evil."
 GER_spy_exchanges:0 "Spy Exchanges"
 GER_spy_exchanges_desc:0 "Engaging in a Cold War, the rise in espionage and subversive acts between the Reich and the U.S. was only natural. As we now seek to further our newfound 'détente' with the United States, Herr Bormann has suggested we increase relations between our intelligence communities behind the scenes as well as our more public efforts. With both sides holding dozens of each other's citizens detained for espionage, the time has now come to propose Spy Exchanges to bring both of our people home while relations remain warm enough to allow it."
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims:0 "Recognize Pacific Claims"
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims_desc:0 "It's clear to us that the only way to truly gain the trust and confidence of the U.S. Government is to formally recognize their claims to regions of the Pacific which they lost to Japan during the Second World War. By officially acknowledging said claims, it will (hopefully) pave the way for the swift betterment of ties between our two nations and make our stance regarding Japan clear. For the United States and the Großgermanisches Reich have no choice but to stand side-by-side against the great evil of the Japanese Empire."
 GER_spheres_of_influence:0 "Spheres of Influence"
 GER_spheres_of_influence_desc:0 "A key, yet highly classified, element of Herr Bormann's proposal is now ready to begin. In a secret high level conference with our new transatlantic friends, we shall divide the world into formal spheres of influence. By doing so we can hopefully drastically reduce the potential for future flashpoints between our two nations by staying within our assigned global areas of influence, and put greater focus on containing Japan. Whilst there will surely be times in the future where we will inevitably fail to respect each other's spheres, it remains a significant step towards ensuring peace between our nations."
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land:0 "A Stranger in a Strange Land"
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land_desc:0 "With the improvement in German-American relations being watched closely across the world, the citizens of the United States and Reich alike hold their breath in the hope that this 'détente' will eventually result in the achievement of friendship between the traditionally cold Superpowers. As the world watches, we will now launch our most groundbreaking diplomatic move yet. As the most powerful man in the Reich aside from the Führer himself, by sending Martin Bormann on a state visit to the United States on behalf of the Führer we will show our sincerity toward maintaining warm relations between our two superpowers."
 GER_convene_the_reichstag:0 "Convene the Reichstag"
 GER_convene_the_reichstag_desc:0 "Today we mark another milestone in the history of the Großgermanisches Reich, the opening of the 1962 Reichstag. A grand ceremony, the annual opening of a Reichstag has become one of the most lavish affairs across the entire Einheitspakt with delegations of subjugated peoples' coming from all across our vast empire to gather in Germania to hear the Führer address the NSDAP as we celebrate yet another glorious year. Needless to say, the opening of the 1962 Reichstag will be the grandest yet!"
 GER_approve_the_budget:0 "Approve the Budget"
 GER_approve_the_budget_desc:0 "Although over the past decade the Großgermanisches Reich regrettably experienced certain financial difficulties, our economic problems are now mostly stable and the allocation of finances toward a Reich-whole budget is somewhat of a simple if monotonous affair for the Diet. Yet, it is something that must be done if the Reich is to survive at least another year, let alone the Führer's prophesied 1,000 years."
 GER_guide_the_party:0 "Guide the Party"
 GER_guide_the_party_desc:0 "To truly maintain political stability in the Großgermanisches Reich, we cannot allow for the accidental splintering of the Diet into factionalism. Therefore (like always), we have no choice but to guide our Party Comrades within the Diet on how to vote, and what the acceptable stance is, on upcoming issues which are to be put before the Reichstag. For the pursuit of ideals other than that sanctioned by the will of the Führer and Party is treasonous and destabilizing to the Fatherland."
 GER_a_bridge_too_far:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 GER_a_bridge_too_far_desc:0 "Whilst the Fatherland has been plagued by the protesting youth for months, the protests are now getting out of hand. Now beginning to occupy major bridges across Germany and in the capital, they are causing mass disruption on a new scale and enough is enough. The time has come to decide what must happen to these rogue elements of society who desire nothing but to bring about instability and degeneracy within our borders."
 GER_a_war_of_attrition:0 "A War of Attrition"
 GER_a_war_of_attrition_desc:0 "Given how it would more than likely send a bad message to the world if the streets of the Reich were to run red with the blood of the next generation of 'true believers', it's best we play a proverbial 'war of attrition' with the student protests. By continuing to simply wait them out, like every new generation filled with the rebelliousness of youth, they'll simply bore themselves out and return to their dorm rooms, moving on to their adult lives in the service of the Fatherland and Führer. As has been the case thus far and will be forevermore."
 GER_expand_the_orpo:0 "Expand the Orpo"
 GER_expand_the_orpo_desc:0 "Whilst we have the protests contained, we have still learned lessons from the experience which must be heeded. In order to avoid bloodshed and potential revolution from disloyal and agitated young people, both today and in the future, it's best we invest in expanding the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo), the uniformed police force. By better establishing the police forces of the Reich to efficiently and effectively put down any future hostile actions from the disaffected student class, we can ensure future stability and remove any calls to hand over such responsibilities to the Heer or the SS."
 GER_send_in_heydrich:0 "Send in Heydrich"
 GER_send_in_heydrich_desc:0 "It is clear to our government that the student protestors pose a very real threat to our internal stability and the standing of the Reich on the world stage, and so the time has come to put an end to it once and for all. Occupying major cities, attacking Party offices, assaulting Orpo officers, causing mass disruption the protestors have proved themselves little different to the partisans who fight us across the Reich. If this is how they wish to act, then we must respond in kind. The time has come to declare them what they are and send in our specialists for dispersing partisan activities: Deputy Reichsführer-SS Heydrich and his Schutzstaffel."
 GER_ss_scapegoats:0 "SS Scapegoats"
 GER_ss_scapegoats_desc:0 "Whilst the SS have dispersed the protests with the swiftness, efficiency, and brutality they are famed for, we are now left with the aftermath of streets running red with the blood of Germany's youth. With many domestically and internationally looking for someone to blame, we can ensure that the responsibility falls upon the shoulders of the SS. By invoking well crafted paperwork and coerced testimony, we can direct the blame onto overzealous SS officers who overstepped their orders. Whilst it will alleviate pressure from the government, and allow us to force several SS figures into an early retirement, it is unlikely that Heydrich will react well to the move."
 GER_pakt_wargames:0 "Pakt Wargames"
 GER_pakt_wargames_desc:0 "Although the Cold War is, well, cold, the threat of a 'Hot War' is not lost upon the upper echelons of the Großgermanisches Reich and thus we must be ready for armed conflict at a moment's notice. Therefore, the Pakt Wargames are our answer to keeping Europe prepared for a new, major conflict with our enemies. These military exercises are designed to be vast in its scope, with on average over one million soldiers from across the Pakt partaking in these intensive Wargames, helping strengthen the brotherhood and comradeship between the Großgermanisches Reich and her allies whilst sending a strong message to the wider world."
 GER_reinforce_the_east:0 "Reinforce the East"
 GER_reinforce_the_east_desc:0 "The East, both our greatest accomplishment and our greatest failure. We may have crushed the Soviet bear in Operation Barbarossa, but the bear bit back to force us away from the A-A line a mere decade later. Since the disaster of the West-Russian War, our eastern Reichskommissariats, namely Moskowien, have suffered tremendously at the hands of degenerate raiders who plunge into the borders of the Reich, slaughtering settlers and pillaging their homes for what little loot they can find. It's evident to the Führer that the East at this time is the area of greatest strategic importance to the Reich, and must be strengthened against continued Russian aggression."
 GER_refocus_the_bombings:0 "Refocus the Bombings"
 GER_refocus_the_bombings_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, for all its glory, has through sheer incompetence been left carpet bombing randomly selected Russian targets over the last decade, often of little strategic or tactical significance. Instead of continuing to waste valuable munitions on generally unimportant targets for little gain, we must force the Luftwaffe to adopt a new strategy of strategic bombings, namely against the West Russian Revolutionary Front. By refocusing our airpower to more suitable targets, we may yet move toward permanently entrenching our as of yet uncertain position in the East."
 GER_the_kasche_question:0 "The Kasche Question"
 GER_the_kasche_question_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Moskowien's notoriously 'liberal' and apathetic Reichskommissar, Siegfried Kasche, has long been a thorn in our side. Seemingly having given up on attempting to enforce Germanization quotas and allowing degenerate Slavic natives to enter into Moskowien's government on an unprecedented scale, disturbing the Aryan purity of the regime, any effort to secure the East cannot ignore the Kasche question. Whilst Reichskommissar Kasche does maintain a respectable level of stability in the region, casting him aside in favor of a more enthusiastic National Socialist could allow us to reassert the authority of Germania in the region."
 GER_ss_border_guards:0 "SS Border Guards"
 GER_ss_border_guards_desc:0 "The eastern Moskowien border is, without a doubt, one of the most dangerous postings within the entire Reich. The terrain is vast and rough, terrible snow storms and crippling mud assaulting our divisions alongside constant attacks across the border from raiders and Soviet partisans. To be frank, conditions on the front are horrifying, and the existing border guard has proven barely capable of the task. As such, a new proposal has been put forward by elements of the Heer suggesting that the SS should take a greater role in securing the border. As our specialist anti-partisan forces, there is surely no place in the Reich they are more suited to be deployed than such an unstable region. If, in doing so, SS casualties happen to begin replacing those of our young German soldiers, we shall not shed any tears."
 GER_the_southern_threat:0 "The Southern Threat"
 GER_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "Southern Europe, our greatest diplomatic failure. Although German-Italian military cooperation resulted in our stunning victory over the seemingly unshakable empires of Britain and France, relations between our nation and the Kingdom of Italy have since collapsed. The traitor Mussolini stabbed our beloved Führer in the back, abandoning the Pakt and welcomed thousands of degenerate undesirables into Italy to escape us. Having since formed their Triumvirate alliance with the Iberian Union and Turkey, the situation to the south poses the primary anti-German threat on the continent. With the Soviet threat crushed in the east during the West Russian War, our focus must now begin to prepare against the southern threat."
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark:0 "The Balkan Bulwark"
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark_desc:0 "Though the dastardly Italians may have stolen Croatia from our grasp, the Fatherland thankfully still holds Serbia and Bulgaria under its influence, with both nations being supportive and enthusiastic members of the Pakt. However, our interests in the Balkans must be secured beyond all measure of doubt, combatting Italian and Turkish influence in the region at every turn to ensure that the route through the Balkans remains open in the event of a war with the Triumvirate - this must be our utmost priority in the region."
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager:0 "Expand the Gebirgsjäger"
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager_desc:0 "The Gebirgsjäger, Germany's elite alpine troops, will become crucial in the event of a German-Italian conflict at our southern frontier. The harshest fighting is sure to occur through the Alps, a campaign sure to be grueling and to which our armies will be at a disadvantage throughout. In preparation for such an eventuality, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht has proposed a drastic increase in the size of our prestigious mountain elites, knowing they will prove invaluable in such a conflict."
 GER_find_their_lepidus:0 "Find Their Lepidus"
 GER_find_their_lepidus_desc:0 "Although on the surface the Triumvirate appears a united and undeniably powerful European diplomatic and military bloc, the true reality is its inner mantle is rotten to the core. Through our diplomatic and intelligence channels, it is clear to us that the Triumvirate nations all hold grievances and dissatisfactions against each other. It is only natural then that one of the three powers must feel pushed to the way-side by their larger and more influential partners. We need only pinpoint who it is, and then exploit their unhappiness to our complete advantage."
 GER_the_eternal_enigma:0 "The Eternal Enigma"
 GER_the_eternal_enigma_desc:0 "During the Second World War, Germany's top engineers developed the Enigma machine, our legendary encryption device, along with the unbroken military code which came with it. Due to its success and uncompromised status, the machine is still regularly used to this day operating across all branches of the Wehrmacht. However, the current machinery is now extremely outdated and new computing software has developed to the point to which the Enigma machine is now growing obsolete. It is therefore time to develop a new, even better Enigma to keep our secrets safe in the modern age."

Herr Bormann, a staunch conservative, is by far the least controversial choice and has gained a remarkably significant amount of support from both the Party and citizenry alike, who largely believe that only through the adoption of a far more conservative ethos can the Reich and its National Socialist ideology survive."

 GER_present_the_alternative_desc:0 "Unlike his opponents, Parteiminister Bormann is largely viewed as a pragmatic National Socialist, someone who is both staunchly conservative yet able to see reason, and is able to negotiate with the more reformist elements in our society rather than simply dispersing and breaking up the opposition.\n\nHerr Bormann is first and foremost a National Socialist, through and through, but he is a pragmatic man. He is no fool, and is able to work with men from nearly all aspects of German society; a far cry from the other contenders..."
 GER_secure_the_party:0 "Secure the Party"

 GER_expose_speers_hypocrisy_desc:0 "In recent years the Führer's close friend and Reichsminister of Economics, Albert Speer, has become the main proponent of reform in the NSDAP. Yet Speer himself is quite possibly the most prolific liar and hypocrite within the borders of the Großgermanisches Reich. Having served as Reichsminister of Armaments and War Production during the Second World War, he introduced the very system of the 'Slave Economy' which he claims to despise despite being its proverbial 'Founding Father'. It's about time both the party and public be informed of who was truly behind the German 'Slave Economy'."

As Himmler's 'protégé', Deputy Reichsführer-SS Reinhard Heydrich is the leader of the German branch of the feared Schutzstaffel (SS). During the Second World War, Herr Heydrich more than earned his reputation; that of a psychopathic butcher of men, women and children. We have a moral duty to remind the party and people of Heydrich's insatiable bloodlust and blatant disregard for human life. Under his leadership, the Reich would more resemble a massive 'Death Factory' than a global superpower!"
 GER_challenge_gorings_competence:0 "Challenge Göring's Competence"
 GER_challenge_gorings_competence_desc:0 "Hermann Göring - President of the Reichstag, Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe and the Reichsmarschall of Germany. A typical plutocrat, Göring's concerns lie with his immense wealth and status rather than that of the struggles of the average citizen, despite what the medal-strewn 'man of the people' happens to claim. Behind all his boasting and showmanship, is Herr Göring truly fit to rule a nation? By his own admission he knows nothing of economics, nor has he expressed much interest in his political duties, choosing rather to grow his vast array of treasures. It's time we break the public perception of Göring being a competent politician."
 GER_the_greatest_threat_is_indecisiveness:0 "The Greatest Threat Is Indecisiveness"
 GER_the_greatest_threat_is_indecisiveness_desc:0 "Despite the political polarization of the masses in recent years, many officials both within the NSDAP and the Reichstag have yet to formally pick a side in this multifaceted conflict of policy and economics. Of course Herr Bormann isn't particularly fond of said neutral elements - he believes that indecisiveness among party officials is a sign of weakness which should be stamped out lest it weaken the Fatherland. If you don't pick a side, who knows who you might end up under?"
 GER_blackmail_the_rest:0 "Blackmail the Rest"

As a result, we have the unfortunate yet rightful task of blackmailing these individuals within the party who are moronic enough to not realize that perhaps making an enemy of the Parteiminister - who is aware of all their dealings - isn't a particularly good idea. This will be incredibly useful in getting certain hesitant figures into Bormann's flock."

Among the population 'Uncle Göring', as he is affectionately called, is extremely popular and is generally regarded as quite the 'man of the people'.

A highly controversial choice, Herr Speer has all but alienated himself from the upper echelons of the State through his strong advocation of reformist policies in the Reich designed to steer the troubled nation toward a possible prosperous future.

 GER_appeal_to_the_reichstag:0 "Appeal to the Reichstag"

However - given the Führer's recent proclamation of Speer's successorship, it's been suggested to the Reichsminister that he should perhaps attempt to convince the Diet once more that reform is indeed needed in the Reich. Herr Speer has no choice but to enter Bormann's fiefdom once more and desperately plead his case for reform.

 GER_the_first_reform:0 "The First Reform"
 GER_the_first_reform_desc:0 "With the Reichstag seemingly onboard with the implementation of reform within the Großgermanisches Reich, the first reform is upon the people of the Reich! However, Herr Speer - knowing how important the first reform will be, as it will be what history remembers as the beginning of all to come, is still attempting to decide exactly what the commencement of such momentous legislative action should be. No doubt he'll eventually come up with something worthy of the title as the 'first'."

Through extreme polarization, the truth of the matter has become muddled in misconception in lies. To truly show the Fatherland of Herr Speer's friendly nature and pro-NSDAP attitude, we will send him on a grand tour across the Großgermanisches Reich to dismay any ridiculous fears."

 GER_promise_a_future_desc:0 "Unlike our opponents who seem to fervently cling to the decades old triumphs of the Großgermanisches Reich - Herr Speer urges we look toward the future, rather than continue to seek guidance from our previous exploits. He stands out as the only major political figure active in current Reich politics that has a pragmatic outlook on the future. Whilst our opponents may make extravagant claims of recapturing the magic of the 1930s and 40s, we will simply promise the Reich a future - and hopefully it will be a prosperous one, as the German people have suffered enough."

Given Herr Speer's newfound influence - being the Führer's successor, he will of course target his greatest rival - for it is the survival of the fittest. It has been decided that to best check Göring's influence, you must neuter his pride and joy - the Luftwaffe. As a result we will defund the Luftwaffe, keeping them short of fuel and restricting the missions they can fly, which affect Göring's power. Yet this isn't purely personal, as cutting back the Luftwaffe budget is something that very much appeals to Speer due to his pragmatic economic strategy."
 GER_find_the_reformers:0 "Find the Reformers"
 GER_find_the_reformers_desc:0 "Although the Wehrmacht is primarily split between Parteikanzler Bormann and Reichsmarschall Göring, with the majority of its talented officer pool being drawn to either party - there are still quite a few sympathetic to Herr Speer's ambitious reformist plans. However, these individuals aren't particularly vocal of their secret unquenchable appetite for reform. Therefore we have no choice but to carefully filter the officers of the Wehrmacht, identifying those who are sympathetic to our cause in the event of trouble following the Führer's passing."

 GER_restrict_ss_recruitment_desc:0 "The Schutzstaffel, the most extreme adherents of National Socialist philosophy. Given the organization's largely radical beliefs, it's becoming a breeding ground of virulent anti-Speer sentiment in the Reich. Furthermore, given the actions undertaken by Reichsführer-SS Himmler and Heydrich in recent years - it's been suggested that SS recruitment should be restricted, with or without their consent. The SS's considerable hatred for Herr Speer has provided him with a legitimate casus-belli to enact said restrictions."
 GER_a_new_kind_of_war:0 "A New Kind of War"
 GER_a_new_kind_of_war_desc:0 "Although it's been decades since the end of 'traditional war' as it can be referred to, many generals and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht seem to have failed to comprehend the change in situation. Seeing this rather old fashioned outlook as concerning, Herr Speer must convince the more traditionalist generals who still view the world through the lens of Social Darwinist militarism. We can still fight and win major conflicts without ever firing a shot, we simply need to convey that message to the generals."
 GER_a_sensible_economy:0 "A Sensible Economy"
 GER_a_sensible_economy_desc:0 "In accordance with Speer's doctrine of reform, it's time to at least attempt to commence some level of economic reform in the Reich.

 GER_opening_the_market_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich is currently under embargo by our opponents in the OFN and Co-Prosperity Sphere, though it's not as if we're entirely innocent, as we ourselves are currently embargoing several potentially profitable trade partners. Thus we have unintentionally limited Germany's capacity to engage in international trade - thereby causing us unneeded economic strain. To have a successful economy, we must lift our as of yet iron-clad trade embargoes upon our opponents and encourage free-trade across the Großgermanisches Reich."
 GER_scale_back_military_production:0 "Scale Back Military Production"
 GER_scale_back_military_production_desc:0 "Yet another of Speer's gripes with the economy is the influence held upon German industry by the Wehrmacht. Military needs are playing to far great a role in the economy. Germany's massive military costs a ridiculous amount on its own, and a tremendous amount of the German industrial base is dedicated to keeping it supplied. Therefore, Speer has wisely determined that the Reich's economic situation would improve if we were to scale back our military production - as it's unlikely that the Reich will be engaged in a major conflict anytime soon."
 GER_too_little_too_late:0 "Too Little Too Late"
 GER_too_little_too_late_desc:0 "In recent weeks the situation within the Großgermanisches Reich has worsened, counter to Speer's belief that they would have improved due to the implementation of reformist economic policies. Instead Herr Speer has begun to realize that things are going to get worse before they get better, and at this rate it'll be quite some time before the Reich is able to achieve economic reform. It's more than obvious that we've achieved too little too late..."

An extremely controversial choice, Herr Heydrich has little to non-existent support in Germany, with much of his support coming from Ordensstaat Burgund and the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler.

 reich.5.t:0 "Assassin Strikes the Führer!"
 reich.5.desc:0 "On January 25th, 1962, as the Reich still celebrated their victory in the Space Race, Germania froze in shock as an individual of Japanese origin entered the Führer's office and attempted to assassinate Hitler. Armed with a handgun, the assassin, suspected to be a member of the Japanese Tokumusoukan, would have killed Hitler if one of his bodyguard's had not happened to enter the Führer's office off schedule. Hitler was shot once before the agent was killed and the Führer was briefly hospitalized before being declared stable. While he survived, news briefly leaked that he had been killed in the attempt, and the Reichstag entered crisis without a leader.\n\nMembers of the German RSD briefly locked down the city, armored cars filling the streets and roadblocks ending all traffic for the day. The situation nearly turned to disaster when separate orders were given to both forces of the Wehrmacht and units belonging to the RHSA to occupy the city and ensure peace. When both groups, as well as the RSD, ordered the others to stand down, a 36 hour standoff occurred that nearly turned to open war in the streets had Hitler not recovered and given a personal order for all military units to return to their barracks. Blood was shed regardless, as several officials belonging to various factions were assassinated in the chaos, victims of plans sprung too soon.\n\nHeinrich Himmler has denounced the chaos, claiming that the strike would have been prevented had the Reich not fallen to decadence, and ordering SS units across Burgundy to prepare to ensure peace in Germany, supposedly only if Hitler requests their assistance. The German SS, while supposedly independent from Himmler, has began voicing support for his involvement.\n\nThe incident has showed the dire need the state has for an heir to the Nazi empire, but the Reichstag sits frozen- unable to decide. Not only has this been brought to light however, but relations with Japan are now at an all time low, and although Japan has denied sending the assassin, Wehrmacht leaders have been ordered to prepare readying for the worst."

Almost a week after the Führer was shot in an attempted assassination believed to have been orchestrated by Japan, Hitler today appeared on national television. With the necessity for an appointed successor being exposed by the incident, following days of heated debate Hitler stood before the Reichstag to announce his choice.\n\nFour candidates have been speculated for days. Martin Bormann, expert politician and head of the party, is a staunch conservative and believed the most likely candidate. Also believed highly possible is the militarist Hermann Göring, the beloved uncle of the nation if Hitler is the father. Another name being put forth is Albert Speer, one of the Führer's closest friends, who has advocated for extensive reform within the Reich. Finally, some have even suggested that naming Reinhard Heydrich as his successor would allow for the hostility between Germany and the SS to finally come to an end.\n\nAfter a lengthy, sometimes incoherent speech during which the Führer spoke repeatedly about the strength of Germany, at times seeming to lose his train of thought, the Führer lifted a trembling hand and declared his chosen successor would be..."

Bormann announced in a speech to the Reichstag that he would ensure the ideals the Reich were founded on would be followed, and that he would ensure the Reich remains strong and able going into the future. This has come to mixed reaction, though moderates and conservatives in the Reich remain pleased.\n\nWhile possibly the least controversial choice, Bormann still faces large amounts of resistance from his constituents, namely Speer, Göring and Heydrich, all of which have vowed to continue petitioning for the position. The military remains divided as well, hawks in the Wehrmacht's general staff siding with Göring, and perhaps more worringly, the German SS remaining firmly divided by those loyal to the state and those loyal to Himmler, who's own candidate, Heydrich, still contests the seat.\n\nOne thing is for certain, Bormann represents the continuing status quo of the Reich, an empire characterized by its rapid decline and slow deteoriation. Perhaps his staunchest opposition comes from the very large group who believes the Reich needs radical change to survive into the future."

An ardent supporter of Hitler's from his earliest days, Göring has received not only support from the Nazi oldguard but also much of the Wehrmacht, namely the Heer, whose leaders hope Göring will strengthen the Reich against Japan and also among the airforce, whom with Göring served under during the war. Moderates and liberals, however, have taken offense to the appointment, most wishing to find some peaceful solution to the crisis with Japan, which they fear Göring will fail to deliver. In addition, Göring has some breadth of support in the older population of the Reich, more than at least Speer and Heydrich can say.\n\nEven with this support, however, Göring remains standing on a rocky foundation. Much of the Reich has outright refused to accept the nomination, and Speer, Bormann and Heydrich have all refused to rescind their bids. Many fear war, both inside the Reich, and without. To his credit, Bormann has assured diplomats and party officials that his response will be measured and approrpriate for the situation, for the Reich's enemies abroad and for the traitors inside, but his assurances, and his dogged refusal to outright deny the possibility of another world war, has done little to calm the Reichstag or the many protesters who have seen a marked increase in participation. The Japanese reaction is perhaps most telling of all, as they have mobilized several fleets in response.\n\nThe oddest support, however, comes from Himmler, who, while not outright supporting Göring, and still pushing Heydrich as his own candidate, has called him a "strong man, the sort that the Reich may need in these times.""

While a highly controversial choice, Speer has gained the support of a large swathe of left leaning members of the Reichstag, as well as the peace faction, who wishes to avoid war with Japan at all costs. Speer has announced his hopes to bring the Reich forward into the future, and has assured the German people that he will personally ensure the ailing infastructure and failing economy is brought back from ruin. The various student protesters are hopeful that Speer will prove an adequate inroad to the future.\n\nHowever, this news has been less well received by Speer many enemies, most notably Bormann, Göring and Heydrich, all of whom still contest Speer's claim to the position. The military in particular has taken the news poorly, Wehrmacht command and various hardliners in the Reichstag wanting a strong response to Japanese aggression, which Speer seems hesitant to give. Most worrying of all, perhaps, is Himmler, who has vowed to ensure the Reich remains true to the ideals it was founded on, whether its own Führer agrees or not.\n\nInternational observers are generally hopeful Speer might bring peace to a world desperately praying for it. Despite Burgundian hostilities, support has come from the diplomats of the United States and its allies, as well as several members of the former Soviet Union. Japan, however, has, while congratulating Speer, begun taking the chance to posture anew, already testing the future Führer, and the various minor members of the German Einheitspakt have taken the chance to begin pushing for further independence."

Heydrich, known for his cruelty in the war and adherence to the National Socialist cause, even compared to his constiuents, has received the least support out of any candidates for the position, and the reaction only further shows that. For the first time in the history of Nazi Germany, the Reichstag did not vote unanimously, with a quarter of the seats voting against the appointment, and almost the same number refusing to vote.\n\nHeydrich has been denounced by the other candidates, Speer, Bormann and Göring, who claim the man to be a puppet working on behalf of Himmler, and accusing him of having convinced Hitler through trickery, the three vowing to ensure Heydrich does not receieve the seat. He has, however, received support from the SS, who remains divided in its loyalty to both the state and Himmler, as well as fringe elements of the military. The citizenry, as always, is mostly ambivalent, though the student protests have begun turning into riots at the announcements, to be brutally put down by police units.\n\nHimmler has, predictably, celebrated the news, announcing that the Burgundian SS stands ready to assist their German brethren. While Burgundian-German relations soar, tensions otherwise have only become exasperated, and the international reaction is generally one of horror."

With both Portugal and Spain fascist and weaker than their neighbors, the two countries began to drift closer and closer until German sabre rattling caused both to form a permanent alliance and, eventually, unify.\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini and Hitler split in anger as the German-caused 48 Crash dragged Italy down with it. In a move against the Reich, the Italians began to welcome the many groups that Hitler sought to remove, and parts of Italy remain a bustling cultural hodgepodge filled with refugees from across Europe, a continuing source of strife between Germany and Italy. Now, Italo Balbo rules Italy, and he struggles to maintain Italy both as a European power and as the master of a colonial empire.\n\nJapan has grown considerably, and has begun to rise past the Reich in power and prestige. Japan has the largest population of any nation on Earth, and also the most powerful industry, but no longer maintains ties to Germany, sitting opposed to the Reich. The two now sit locked in cold war, both armed with nuclear weapons and both not powerful enough to want to risk war with the other, though war hawks in both camps openly wish for a beginning of hostilities to finally end the question of which is the strongest.\n\nMeanwhile in America, the collapse of the Democratic Party in WW2 brought forth the revival of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, who now sit opposed to the National Popular Front, a party of progressives and the remnants of the American Socialist Party that over the years has becoming increasingly influenced by National Socialist ideology and rhetoric. The NPF's takeover of old Democratic Party infrastructure has brought it to the national stage, and they now challenge the Republican-Democratic Coalition for the White House. A portion of the NPF is funded by the Reich, who hopes to put the party in power and gain an ally to tip the balance against Japan. For now, however, the Republican-Democrats maintain neutrality and an alliance of the remains of the Commonwealth, and stands opposed to both Germany and Japan, the three locked in cold war."

While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition, and that Köllner, who was photographed giving the characteristic Nazi salute at the flag as the Earth rose in the horizon, was the perfect example of a hero of Germany.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."

Speer, Heydrich, Bormann, Göring. Nobody knows which will win, but all of the people of the nation know that dark days are ahead of them.\n\nWith Germany in collapse and anarchy in the streets, foreign powers have already begun debating what to do. The United States and Japan both have already begun looking into how best to exploit the chaos, and Iberia and Italy have quickly begun militarizing in order to carve out further influence in the chaos. The Reichskommissariats, ostensibly loyal vassals of the Reich, sit in chaos as well, their leaders debating on who to support, or whether or not it is time to begin distancing their realms from the homeland."

Speidel has declared that the military should exist to serve the Reich and her citizens, not battle against fellow Germans for power, and him and his army have announced Germania itself as a ceasefire zone in the conflict.\n\nFor now, the various sides have ignored the city, seeing little use in wasting their resources taking it, but one can only wonder how long Speidel's peace will last, before one side or another attacks."

With nearly a million students constantly marching, protesting and disrupting business, and countless others joining them, the Reich seemed completely unable to cope with the crisis.\n\nWhile many in the government demand harsh action, nobody knows what real harsh action they can take to a movement so large and so disorganized. While threats have been made against the protesters, they remain undeterred as their numbers swell, and with no central authority, there is no head for the government to cut off. With the Orpo so disorganized and with so many paramilitary groups trying to keep peace, it has been a wonder the situation has yet to explode.\n\nAt least, this was the situation, until a small army of protesters began getting rowdy with a group of Orpo officers in Aachen, and a small group of riot officers decided to open up the city's armory and quell the unrest.

"I haven't seen you since that ghastly shooting. It doesn't surprise me that you're walking it off, though!" Hitler's fleshy, sallow face was scrunched in confusion. His bright blue eyes rested on the Reichsmarschall, and he began to hobble forwards. "My Führer, it truly was an honor to be named as your successor. I have great plans for the German Reich. We stand tall and strong, it is true, but we cannot deny its troubles. I believe it is important to cultivate a period of self-reflection and planning for the future. Bormann is a man who would delight in your passing, my Führer, and as for Speer -"\n\n"Speer, that foolish idealist!" Hitler said spitefully, his face contorting in anger. "All his talk of reform... it's all a ploy. Albert and Martin, they want everything! They don't realize I cannot die!" The Führer glared at the Reichsmarschall with feverish eyes. "Hitler is Germany, and Germany is Hitler! If I die, the Jews will descend upon our carcasses like vultures!" An eruption of rasping coughs exploded from his throat, racking his whole body.

"You must be careful, Adolf. I did not come here to see you collapse from an old joke! I came here to give my humble gratitude at being named your successor." His tone turned serious. "I wish to see the German Reich last a thousand years, but I don't think this can be achieved without a serious change in policy. Göring calls me a radical, as if he actually has any convictions.

 hitlerillness.3.desc:0 "The cacophony of clinking glasses and waves of forced laughter was giving Martin Bormann a headache. Among the two thousand guests milling around and sitting at tables were a fair number of diplomats, of both German and foreign extraction. He placed the speech notes on top of the podium with sweaty hands, surveying the room in apprehension. The speech was short and simple, admittedly a little bland. Bormann smiled to himself bitterly. He had never been able to match the striking visual imagery and acerbic wit of Goebbels' writings. At times like these, he almost missed that lecherous little rat.\n\n"Gentlemen," Bormann announced into the microphone, waiting as a blanket of silence gradually fell upon the crowd. "The Führer!" He turned to his right and saluted. The guests followed suit, rising to their feet and saluting to varying degrees of hastiness. Adolf Hitler shuffled towards the podium and grasped it with two trembling hands.\n\n"Recent events may herald a diplomatic shift for the Reich..." Hitler's voice quickly faded away. Bormann's blood ran cold as Hitler looked up and eyed the hall in confusion. "Where... Where is Ernst? He told me he would be here..." Bormann strode over to the podium and placed an arm behind the Führer's back, gently leading him away. The old man's body was violently quivering. "I think... I think I was at your wedding!" Hitler exclaimed loudly, his rasping voice reverberating throughout the hall. Confused murmurs erupted throughout the crowd. "Are you still in the SA?"\n\n"Forgive me, gentlemen!" Walther Hewel exclaimed, swiftly taking the podium as Bormann and Misch led Hitler through the exit. "The Führer was accidentally given my speech. Allow me to continue. The real question is, uh, are any of us still in the SA? You see, the Reich's diplomatic progression can be mirrored in some way with the evolution of the SA...""

There were only a few dozen people in the crowd, but not a single one was unimportant. Reichsminister Werner Naumann and representatives of the RMVP stood with famous artists and reporters of the state press. Hitler's pompous adjutant Julius Schaub was shooting daggers at Martin Bormann, who was watching the Führer like a hawk. They were all nodding respectfully as Hitler began to discuss the late painter Adolf Wissel, pretending to ignore the two trembling hands thrust awkwardly behind his back. Despite Brandt's severe protestations, Schaub had insisted that Hitler travel to the Führermuseum in Linz to officially open the new art exhibition.\n\n"... including a newly commissioned sculpture of my successor. Now, unfortunately for the young men here today, it is the curse of great artists to die before their time. Adolf Ziegler passed away only a few years ago, and Arno Breker's recent death has wrecked the world of sculpturing immensely." The crowd slowly turned to the left podium where Arno Breker was frozen still, his eyes darting fearfully around the room. Brandt wiped his forehead again with a drenched cloth. "Many of you are too young to remember the days of degenerate art..."\n\nThe Führer trailed off. His whole body suddenly tightened up and he staggered into the right-hand podium. Brandt's blood turned to ice. Hitler's arms violently jerked out and his head snapped forwards, slamming into the marble podium with a sickening crack. A gasp of horror exploded from the audience as the Führer crumpled to the floor, blood pouring from his forehead, arms and legs still writhing. A woman screamed. A man yelled a curse. Rochus Misch was yelling at the crowd to stay back. Bormann rushed forwards and slipped on the blood with a yell, staggering into Schaub. Brandt turned Hitler onto his side and inspected the wound on his forehead. It was just a cut. The doctor shot Schaub a glare as the uproar reached a fevered pitch."

I trust the fresh air of the Berghof is treating him well?" Doctor Brandt replied with the usual pleasantries and assured him of the Führer's good health in medical isolation. "Let's cut to the chase, Doctor. Will the Führer survive?"\n\n"As long as my medical orders are not interrupted by the likes of Julius Schaub," the Doctor spoke after a brief pause, "we should see a turnaround."\n\n"Schaub is a pompous oaf," Bormann said through gritted teeth. "Ignore him and continue your good work. I will be sending a man to deliver reports to the Führer at three in the afternoon on a daily basis. Goodnight." Bormann placed the phone down and took a deep puff of his cigar. It was the burden of great men to suffer for their people. Whether Hitler lived or died, at least he would be privy to the Berghof's beautiful views. Bormann snapped his fingers at the man sitting opposite him. Gerhard Klopfer lifted his head from the pile of documents and straightened his back. "Listen up, Gerhard. I need you to organise a meeting of the Reichstag in one week's time. I'll be giving reassurances to the Party that the Führer is medically fit, while also emphasising the importance of remaining mentally and politically prepared for his sudden passing. I'll also use the opportunity to denounce the reformist and the militarist scum, and to attack Speer and Göring for not attending such an important gathering."\n\n"They won't be attending?" Klopfer raised an eyebrow.\n\n"Not if they're given the wrong date," Bormann grinned. Göring had always been an easy target, and Speer had nowhere to hide now that the Führer was incapacitated. There was nothing to restrict his plans."

Any other man would have listened intently to the melodies of nature, from the chirping of the birds to the buzzing of the grasshoppers.\n\nNot Doctor Karl Brandt. He was watching the Führer like a hawk, ready to leap forwards in an instant. Despite his deteriorating condition, Hitler had gently asked Brandt if he could maintain his old ritual of strolling to the teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf Hill. Julius Schaub had soon caught wind of this and, despite Brandt's numerous protestations, forced him to adhere to the Führer's orders. That smug sycophant was striding alongside them, inhaling deeply as he basked in the sunlight. Imagining that idiot tripping over and smashing his face upon a rock gave Brandt some modicum of relief.\n\nHitler suddenly halted in his tracks, panting heavily. Brandt dived forwards just in time to catch the old man by the shoulders as he collapsed backwards like a puppet without strings. His face was pale and covered in sweat, and his breathing was raspier than usual. Brandt gently lowered him to the ground and turned him on his side, tearing off his own jacket to place under the Führer's head in anticipation of a seizure. As he suspected, Hitler's body soon began to jerk uncontrollably.\n\n"Don't just stand there!" Brandt shouted at Schaub, who was staring at the two of them in distress. "Get Kempka! Now!" Schaub nodded and raced back the way they had come. After a few minutes, the seizure stopped. Hitler was breathing raggedly, clutching at the dirt beneath his hands. His eyes were filled with tears.\n\nAt last the car arrived. Erich Kempka leapt out of the driver's seat and thrust open the back door. Brandt slowly helped Hitler to his feet and guided him towards the vehicle."

Hitler had retired to bed at four in the morning to rise again at two in the afternoon, and Bormann had seen fit to adjust his sleep patterns accordingly. Even with the Führer away in Bavaria, Bormann did not think twice about slaving away so late into the night.\n\nIt was early in the morning when Gerhard Klopfer entered the room and gave Bormann the harrowing news. Their contact in the Berghof had been in touch. The Führer had slipped into a coma. Sadness and dread swirled in the pit of Bormann's stomach as he sat silently at his desk, ruminating on the future. His Führer was on the cusp of death, and his enemies were not going to sit idly by once this fact reached them. Though Bormann's support base was strong, Göring's militarists would contest his leadership the moment Hitler died. Perhaps if Bormann informed his loyal allies in the Party and the Wehrmacht of Hitler's condition, they would be prepared for any potential conflict? Perhaps if the Reichstag officially declared him as the Führer, he could maintain a strategic position in Germania in the terrifying event of a civil war? The phone's shrill rings snapped Bormann from his thoughts.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Herr Bormann, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You want me to scapegoat Schaub to protect Doctor Brandt?" Bormann scoffed. "I don't care much for Brandt, but Schaub is a repulsive fucking toad. I'll do it. Tell Göring to do the same. We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub."

The world had ripped a great man from Germany. For decades Bormann had worked tirelessly in the Führer's shadow, learning from the genius with a shameful mixture of adoration and jealousy. Now the dreaded moment to step into the light had come.\n\n"You must not tell anyone!" Bormann suddenly snapped, slapping his palm against the table. "The Berghof staff must be silenced. This information cannot be allowed to spread, under any circumstances. The Reichstag must pronounce me as Führer before Göring or any of the others have a chance to intervene."\n\nThe minutes turned into hours. The hours grew into days. Soon, despite his greatest efforts, the rumors had spread throughout the Reich. The Führer was dead. The Reich was officially leaderless.\n\n"What?!" Bormann roared into his phone, shooting to his feet. "They fucking did what?!" He slammed the phone down with a curse and paced the room, rubbing his temples. The Reichstag had just met without informing Bormann. How had this evaded him? Those vermin on the Emergency Council had refused to legally name Bormann as the new Führer, claiming that now was a time for mourning and not ceremony. Germania was lost.

"I'm afraid I'm too focused on the Führer's health to admire my surroundings, but the medical isolation is helping him immensely."\n\n"I must ask, Doctor, though it pains me so..." Göring sighed dramatically. "Will the Führer live?"\n\n"As long as my medical orders are not interrupted by the likes of Julius Schaub, we should see a turnaround. I'm attending to the Führer night and day, although Schaub keeps accusing me of undermining his authority."\n\n"He's always been a slimy little toad, hasn't he?" Göring laughed. "Your hard work will not go unrewarded; I can assure you. Have a good night!" He placed the phone down and strummed his fingers against the desk. The Führer's absence provided an opportunity for further action. If he hosted a military parade and delivered a grand speech glorifying the Wehrmacht, it would satisfy the likes of Schörner and Remer, while also infuriating Bormann and making him look weak and incompetent. Afterwards, he could propose a meeting in the Reichstag, in which he would paint the Führer's secretary as a closet liberal, no better than Speer and his crypto-Bolshevik agitators. As long as the gap between the conservatives and the militarists was bridged, Göring would face no opposition from the Party.

The moving painting before him, from the fluttering leaves of the majestic trees to the swishing grass basking in the evening sunlight, provided much relief. There was not a sight in the Reich so beautiful, so German. Speer smiled sadly to himself.\n\n"It was wise of you to bring the Führer here," Speer said to the man beside him. Dr Brandt, also staring into the distance, nodded. "There are worse places to take personal residence than the Berghof. Even if that fool Schaub keeps undermining you. Karl, I need an honest answer here. The public are getting suspicious. Will he recover?"\n\n"It isn't likely," Brandt said quietly.\n\n"I need you to do something for me, Karl." Speer placed a reassuring hand on Brandt's shoulder and stared deeply into his eyes. "You told me earlier that Bormann sends one of his lackeys here at 3pm, every single day, to deliver a report to the Führer. Well, I will send my own man earlier in the day to give you a different report. When Bormann's lackey arrives, I want you to inform him that the Führer is asleep, but you will dutifully pass on the documents when he awakes. Instead, you will deliver my report to the Führer, and send Bormann's report to me." Speer could see the apprehension on the doctor's face. "I trust you with this, Karl. You're my friend.

"That is all, Doctor Brandt."\n\nHe placed the phone down and pressed his fingers together. The Führer's incapacity had to be exploited to its fullest extent. He scanned the documents before him. Making Bormann look weak and incompetent was simple; he just needed to ignore any orders directed to him by the Führer's secretary, while strengthening the SS in the process. Göring's faction drew its power from its unity, but a secret brothel recording obtained by the SD would soon change that. The Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Stuckart, one of Göring's closest friends, had been caught on tape explicitly mocking Schörner and Remer, their strongest military allies.\n\nAs for Speer? The SD had also uncovered an illicit affair between one of Speer's reformist technocrats in the Ministry of Economics and a university student with ties to radical liberal movements. Upon the leaking of the scandal, Gestapo agents will waste no time in spreading rumors that this affair is not an isolated incident, and that the relationship between the Party reformists and the liberal students is more than ideological.

Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"Ah, you want me to scapegoat Schaub in order to protect Doctor Brandt?" Göring chuckled. "I'm happy to take any action against that fawning little idiot. Tell Bormann to do the same! We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub." And away from Hitler, Göring thought."

Doctor Brandt's voice crackled a greeting, which Speer's deep monotone returned. Then came the grave announcement. The Führer had fallen into a coma and was not likely to awaken. The tape soon clicked to an end.\n\nHeydrich took a deep breath and stroked the device, his mind adrift on the violent waves of indecision. The Führer was on the cusp of death, and Speer was doubtless preparing for the inevitable. His clique of degenerates were not the largest threat, of course; Bormann's corruption had brought him much support in the Party, while Göring's pathetic weaknesses were perfect for his militarist puppet masters. The Schutzstaffel had to prepare themselves, both militarily and in mind, for the upcoming war that would tear the Reich asunder and usher in a new age of National Socialism. Even if the Reichstag declared Heydrich to be the Führer, he would never be able to hold on to Germania as a strategic position. Military preparations had to be made without hesitation or delay. He was torn from his thoughts by the ringing of the phone.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Reichsführer, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You wish to scapegoat Schaub instead of Brandt?" Heydrich considered for a moment. "Very well. I'll kick that weasel from the Party for good measure. Tell Bormann and Göring to condemn him too. We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub." And away from Hitler, he thought."

 reich.600.t:0 "The Brown Eminence"
 reich.600.desc:0 "If one were to gaze upon the drab visage of this balding little man, it would be hard to view him as anything more than a stuffy bureaucrat, one single cog in the grand mechanism of the state.\n\nSuch a miscalculation could be a potentially fatal mistake. As Chief of the Party Chancellery and Private Secretary of the Führer, Martin Bormann has climbed the greasy rungs of the NSDAP in silent persistence, asking for neither fame nor excess on any step of his rise to authority.\n\nHis friends and foes alike refer to him mockingly as 'the Brown Eminence'. Such a scatological slur means nothing to Bormann, who cares little for humor and less for personal insults directed towards his character. He is not a man of pomp or ceremony, but of duty and dedication to the Reich. Many would claim he is rarely seen stepping out of the Führer's gradually diminishing shadow - except those who whisper of his visits to beautiful young actresses and models throughout the nation.\n\nAs the new decade rolls on, Martin Bormann continues to stalk the shadowy corridors of power in his ill-fitting suit, further enveloping himself in the mechanisms of the Reich's bureaucratic apparatus. The bizarre contradiction of such a despised man holding such enormous influence betrays a mind dedicated solely to the pursuit of power - whatever the cost may be."

 reich.601.t:0 "The Gilded Reichsmarschall"
 reich.601.desc:0 "If the Führer is the paternalistic ruler of the German Reich, then Hermann Göring is its popular uncle. Beloved by the civilians for his jolly demeanor and the Wehrmacht for promoting their interests throughout the decades, the Reichsmarschall has always desired to maintain the reputation of a diligent military man, loyal to his Reich and his Führer.\n\nTo believe such a thing would be to downplay the man's ambitions. Having held many illustrious posts, from founder and chief of the Gestapo to the Reich Plenipotentiary of the Four-Year Plan, the aristocratic Göring has developed a lust for power and wealth few could rival. Residing in his enormous Carinhall mansion with his vast collections of outfits, jewellery and artwork, all of which was plundered from the Reich's conquests, the Reichsmarschall continues to coalesce as much influence around himself as possible. While not as close to Hitler as he once was, he has acquired relevance by becoming the de facto figurehead of the militarist movement.\n\nSome would argue that Göring is little more than a pompous buffoon, allowing himself to be puppeted by radical forces in the hopes of acquiring even more attention and power. Others would find such a suggestion to be foolish, for Göring has long proven himself to be as manipulatively cunning as he is dedicated. His role in the future of Reich politics remains to be seen."

 reich.602.t:0 "The Reichsarchitekt"
 reich.602.desc:0 "A figure often overlooked in the convoluted politics of the Reich, Albert Speer is nonetheless one of its key players. Architect by profession, and personal friend of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, Speer was attracted to the future Führer's persuasive dialectic and his great plans for Germany. The attraction was mutual: as soon as Hitler looked at Speer's work, the young architect found himself launched at the forefront of the party leadership, and tasked with designing dozens of public buildings.\n\nThe war changed everything. Speer was appointed Minister of Armaments and War Production during the most difficult time of the conflict, and it was there that a side of his personality made itself even more evident: opportunism. He took the merit for Germany's production surge, but his main contribution to the war effort had been the invention of what would forever change the Reich: slavery. Hundreds of thousands of inferiors and war prisoners toiled and died in the military-industrial complexes, fuelling the German war machine with their lives.\n\nAfter the war, Speer returned to his passion, and single-handedly designed the culmen of the Reich's grandeur. Germania, the new Caput Mundi, was set to overshadow Rome, Paris and all great cities around the world, but then the economy crashed, taking his dreams with it. In a moment of catharsis, he understood that slavery had been among the main reasons for the collapse, and in the most opportunistic of moves, he started speaking against it, asking for reform: as an unwanted consequence, he soon found himself the focal point of a large reformist movement advocating for change. Swept by currents stronger than him, he decided to follow them, desperately hoping that no one would ever discover his mistakes.\n\nFor good or for ill, Albert Speer has, in his own way, reshaped Germany, forever changing both its architectural fashion and its society. He is, and forever will be, the Reichsarchitekt."

 reich.603.desc:0 "Formerly the Protektor of Bohemia-Moravia, Director of the SD and one of the principal architects of the Endlösung, the very name Reinhard Heydrich is uttered in fear by German citizens and Slavic slaves alike.\n\nA man of infamously intellectual and cultured sensibilities, the Reichsführer of the German SS hides his insatiably animalistic hunger for power behind a cold sheen of quiet reservation. While his meteoric rise in influence and status throughout the 1930s and 1940s surprised nobody, few could have predicted his ascension to the leadership of the Schutzstaffel would come as a result of Heinrich Himmler's failed coup in the 1950s.\n\nDespite its many fractures, the Party is unified behind its hatred of Heydrich and fear of his SS. Many believe it is only Hitler's respect for 'The Man with the Iron Heart' that enables him to maintain such a position of brutal authority, although others would point to a different source. Heinrich Himmler, tyrannical despot of the mysterious Ordensstaat-Burgund, is theorized by many to be the true power behind the throne.\n\nWhile Heydrich and Himmler have their disagreements, both men advocate the return of 'True National Socialism' - by which they mean an end to the corruption of the Party, and the imposition of a totalitarian state dedicated to the values of the SS. The attempts by Hitler's Inner Circle to reduce the influence of the SS has not been entirely unsuccessful, but as long as Reinhard Heydrich remains to be its leader, it will not dissipate so easily."

 reich.604.desc:0 "The Reich is a granitic edifice, firmly under the Führer's control, and utterly dedicated to the glorification of the German people and National Socialism... is not at all what truly is. The country lies in decay and stagnation, and one group of people have taken it upon themselves to champion the most radical change of them all: Albert Speer and his Gang of Four.\n\nKurt Georg Kiesinger is a prominent member of the NSDAP, with deep connection to many organs within the Reich. While charismatic and cautious, his reformist views didn't endear him to the conservative leadership. Ludwig Erhard is an extremely respected - outside of Germany, that is - economist, who had already predicted the economic collapse. Of course, in a modern version of Cassandra's tale, no one listened to him until it was too late, and his vehement criticism earned him many enemies. Helmut Schmidt is an expert diplomat who joined the NSDAP mainly to cover the fact that he hates National Socialism with a vengeance. His ambitions far outstrip his rank, but having managed to live this far, Schmidt plans to bring change to Germany, if his guilt does not overwhelm him. Henning von Tresckow is yet another enigma - a man shown as the shining image of the Prussian ideal, who is himself averse to the strictness of military life, but maintains the prim-and-proper stereotypical Prussian spirit in public while working fiercely to undermine National Socialism.\n\nEach an expert in his own field, they have found themselves tangled in a strange alliance, of which Speer must constantly be wary of. He knows his goals of reforming Hitler's ideology do not align with theirs, but he will use their influence and abilities to his disposal. The Gang sees Speer as a future threat, snapping their jaws at opportunities to limit his influence. Yet both, in a paradoxical relationship, need each other to survive the roiling political climate of the dying Reich."

 reich.606.desc:0 "Among the many agencies dedicated to rooting out any danger to the Reich's integrity and continued supremacy, none holds so much power as the Abwehr. At the top of such a large and convoluted agency, with tendrils digging deep into all offices and bureaus of the equally large German administration, a single man sits uncontested: his power is enough that he can order death without having to ask for permission, and even the SS must tread carefully within his reach.\n\nReinhard Gehlen, better known as Agent Kleiner Fuchs, is a secretive man, a quality that goes very well with his role. Had it not been so, he would have long since been dead... With cunning and skill, Gehlen rose through the ranks of the Abwehr, making important allies and equally important enemies, but no friends: it's difficult being friends with someone who holds enough evidence against you to send you to the concentration camps for the rest of your life...\n\nAmong the countless agents working under him, one stands out, one he has taken the slightest bit of attachment for. Gerhard Wessel - known in the field as Agent Verfilztes Kätzchen - is a capable officer hailing from the Wehrmacht, and has been Gehlen's protegè for almost a decade, ever since he discovered his ability with analyzing large amounts of complex data, and quickly devising plans and countermeasures: while not the best field agent - something which Gehlen tries every day to change - Wessel possesses both competence and loyalty, a rare combination of qualities these days...\n\nIn a world of shadows, the one who rules over them is in charge, and in the Reich, all shadows, be they large or slim, grey or pitch-black, swear their allegiance to Agent Kleiner Fuchs."

Ever ambitious, Schörner desired nothing less than to be head of the entire Wehrmacht itself! Though a brilliant military man, his skill was not enough; his dreams of promotion were dashed against the rocks of reality by his cataclysmic performance during the West Russian War of the 1950s.\n\nConsidered a failure by many and generally despised by both subordinates and superiors alike, Schörner has nonetheless forged a path as an influential leader in the Reich's Militarist faction, and is considered to be Hermann Göring's number one man. To the likes of Hans Speidel, who he despises, his clique is little more than a psychotic band of sabre-rattlers. To Schörner and his followers, however, they are the saviors of a decaying and dying German; a noble band of warriors demanding greater power for the Wehrmacht and an increased sphere of German influence in Europe and beyond."

A former Hitler Youth leader, the Second World War would see him deployed on nearly every front the Reich fought on. Participating in Poland; France; the Balkans; Remer impressed his superiors during Operation Barbarossa, where he led his own regiment in Ukraine with distinction.\n\nIn the following decade, Remer managed to claw his way to commanding his own corps just in time for the West Russian Revolutionary Front's invasion of RK Moskowien. Again, he led with distinction in the fighting against the communists. Remer's corps was also instrumental in sabotaging Himmler's coup; he and his men arrested more than their fair share of SS formations when Speidel sent his orders.\n\nRemer has not been sitting idle since then, however. Ferdinand Schörner made his acquaintance with Remer shortly after the market crash of the 50s, and the two aligned thanks to their staunch opposition to any and all military cuts. As of now, Remer acts as Schörner's right hand man for the most militant of the German command staff. Highly intelligent and ambitious, Remer is certainly a man to watch. An opportunist at heart, the role he is yet to play within the Reich is unknown, for better or worse."

 reich.72.t:0 "The Adler Is Launched!"
 reich.72.d:0 "The port city of Wilhelmshaven houses some of the largest - and oldest - shipbuilding facilities in the entire world. Its awe-inspiring drydocks are capable of building nearly anything; everything from corvettes and minesweepers to gigantic battleships have left these docks, even when the idea of a German nation was still a new concept. Karl Dönitz knows the production capabilities of these facilities; as Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, he has seen dozens upon dozens of ships launch over the years, but this is a moment which will go down in history.\n\nToday, the largest and most powerful aircraft carrier of the Kriegsmarine - christened "Adler" by Hitler himself - is finally ready for its maiden voyage, a spectacle that will be broadcasted all over the Reich! Admiral Dönitz knows what remains unspoken: the Adler is not the latest capital ship, but the last for the foreseeable future, as the Reich can no longer afford to build new ships as per the 1958 budget. Funding had been slashed in nearly all sectors; ship maintenance and payrolls are all that the Kriegsmarine will be bankrolling for now.\n\nThe ceremony was lovely, the Führer himself thanked the admiral profusely for his tireless dedication and work, with vague promises spoken about "more funding for the Kriegsmarine soon", something he has done since 1958. Dönitz ceremonally nodded when he needed to and offered thanks when appropriate, as he had done dozens of times before. Ever the model military man, he greeted the rest of the Führer's entourage. He shook hands with Martin Bormann first; an upstanding gentleman, really. Next, Albert Speer; an opportunistic Nazi, no more, no less. If Speer was opportunistic, then Dönitz wondered what Göring would be considered; the man was looking surprisingly spry as well. Last but not least, Reinhard Heydrich's cold, clammy hand. A Blonde Butcher, and a bastard to boot.\n\nThe Admiral glanced back over at his Führer, who was blabbering to an aide. He was getting old, and old age was not treating him kindly. God help the Reich once Hitler was...\n\nDönitz pushed the thought out of his head. He was a navy man, first and foremost. Let the politics to those four schemers."

 reich.609.desc:0 "The Schutzstaffel are once again stirring up trouble within the Reich. While this isn't exactly uncommon or new, the SS couldn't have chosen a worse time to re-commence their usual antics.\n\nAll across Germany the SS have been putting their noses in where it doesn't belong, causing a great deal of disruption throughout the Reich. Stormtroopers have bullied troops from the regular army out of several armories across Germany, mostly concentrated in the Rhine. Several brawls between them and the Heer have also been reported. The SS are also disrupting flight schedules in order to "screen" pilots and passengers, even from the Luftwaffe! This is a thin veil to harass them, nothing more, and shouldn't be mistaken as anything else.\n\nThey have felt the need to make their presence known to the civilian population as well, carrying out their own investigations of the citizen population. Anything ranging from "foreign spy" to "tax evasion" has been used as an excuse to detain and harass people; they even have the backbone to set up checkpoints with no approval from anyone but themselves, and have been able to freely arrest "suspected Jews and other undesirables," who are more often than not critics of the SS. With these fanatics causing so much chaos, some kind of action must be decided on soon to limit their activities and restore some semblance of sanity."

However, protests have become much more frequent and intense after Hitler announced his successor.\n\nIn major cities all across the Reich, German students have held rallies and marches across university campuses, with some migrating into the streets. Sit-ins have effectively shut down most campuses, and students have taken it upon themselves to block off government and army buildings. Many of the larger gatherings are flat out refusing to disperse, and students at many of the sit-ins refuse to budge. A large crowd of over two hundred people even blocked off an SS barracks! It was a miracle that no one died.\n\nWe need to do something about the student protesters now before the situation spirals out of our hands. One way or another, we need to take action."

Nearly all sectors of the German economy; agriculture, manufacturing, and even construction are glutted, dominated by slave labor. Uneducated Germans are hard pressed to find jobs, forcing them to survive on state welfare. This has made labor involving higher education super competitive, and even our best and biggest struggle to find jobs!\n\nThe situation only worsens year after year, with no solution in sight. There are simply not enough private sector jobs to go around. The German economy needs a major overhaul, with the first being to address the dismissal state of German employment. While we could certainly just conscript more men to drop unemployment or increase benefits and payouts, it may be prudent to start phasing out slave labor and returning these jobs to the civilian sector, even if it is at the expense of the industrialists."

The new Aryan-Feminist movement however, has not.\n\nSpearheaded by a large group of female college students, the new group has been organizing marches, rallies, and meetings in a number of major cities. Reactions are mixed; many conservative NSDAP members are disgusted, arguing that women's purity needs to be preserved and that the German woman's purpose is to be a caretaker. Some of the more traditional women wholeheartedly agree, seeing their place in Germany as an essential pillar of the German family. On the flip side, many younger women chaff at the thought of remaining second class citizens in their own country, and demand more freedoms and acceptance from the population at large. Many reformers, and even more than a few (silent) conservatives are in agreement and see the grievances laid out as valid.\n\nWith popular opinion split and marches and rallies becoming more frenzied, the government needs to step in and offer guidance, one way or another."

The institution is old enough to contain a new generation that only knows the walls and barbed wire of the labor camps. For a while now, the slave population has been slowly but steadily rising, and it is apparent that we now need more living space for the increased number of laborers. The camps are starting to overflow with people, and their living conditions are steadily declining.\n\nAlthough it is inconvenient, something should be done now. Living conditions aren't safe for the slaves, which makes it dangerous for the Germans that guard and employ them.

Their only means of survival have hinged on the state continuing to provide them benefits. While the economy was crashing, many small business owners closed their doors for the last time. Major corporate interests throughout the country silently consolidated their holdings and bought properties, machinery, and expertise for next to nothing. German citizens were replaced with cheaper slave labor, and their jobs simply never returned. A decade later, wages still haven't returned to their pre-crash levels, even with ten years of inflation for the few that still work.\n\nThe German people yearn for some kind of action; we can not be content to sit and watch our citizens suffer.

The group is one of the few public organizations that weathered the economic crash last decade with a semblance of grace. They have always had funding, if not from the state than from fundraising they do themselves. This has allowed them to continue to operate, and has also given them some autonomy from the government.\n\nThe Hitlerjugend has naturally evolved; it is not the same youth group of the 1940s. After a decade of (relative) peace throughout Germany, the program began to de-militarized. They are now more akin to the American or British scouts than the group of old, though they still honor their material traditions.\n\nWe have on our desks a couple of proposals to mold the Hitlerjugend into something more of our liking. Every year, high standing party officials review the scout's training regimates. If we so chose, we can lean on these members to influence the structure, and therefore future of the Hitlerjugend."

After the Second World War, plans were put into motion to see the expansion of the Autobahn to all corners of German dominated Europe, from Moskowien to Gibraltar, and everything in between. Ambitious expansions were planned for the booming and growing cities of the Reich, and were proceeding smoothly.\n\nThe great economic crash of the 50's put a quick stop to everything. Funding was massively cut, making the planned expansions simply impossible. The highway has begun to decay from chronic lack of maintenance.\n\nA stack of proposals have been sent over to our desks. The paperwork details plans for a massive works project to begin much needed repairs all throughout the Reich on the Autobahn. Expansion plans for easily congested areas have also been mapped out.

We proved the world our strength by accomplishing what many considered impossible; we retained tight control over our conquests, then expanded our empire even more by occupying the entire middle section of the dark continent! Since then, we've spent the better part of two decades crushing army after army of partisans, as well as a Russian invasion.\n\nThe economic collapse of the 50s made the burden of maintaining the Heer's budget a titanic struggle. Although many begged for funds to be funneled elsewhere, Hitler stood by the Wehrmacht and would not hear of it. Therefore, for the last two decades, Germany has somehow miraculously maintained its military budget, for better or worse without another major economic crisis.\n\nMilitarists in both the Wehrmacht and administration continue to lobby to maintain current spending to this day. On the other side of the aisle, a coalition of reformers, civilian interests, industrialists, and even limited numbers of conservatives from the NSDAP beg us to cut the Wehrmact's budget for much needed allocation of funds elsewhere. Being in a position of power ourselves combined with Hitler's ailing health allows us to now make a change in policy, if we so choose."

Outdated and massively under-equipped, many of our surface ships sit anchored at port, understaffed and in dire need of refurbishment. A casual observer may mistake active duty warships in dock as a mothballed fleet! It is only under Admiral Dönitz's personal care that the U-boat fleet is even somewhat combat ready.\n\nThere are no disagreements throughout the administration; the surface fleet is severely lacking. Our analysts estimate that even the Italian surface fleet is stronger than ours! Them! A disgrace! To get the navy up to a standard befitting our status as a superpower would require nothing short of a total restructuring of our navy, complete with new ships, technology, and tactics. At this time, there is no feasible way we can achieve this. However, there are some temporary remedies available to us.\n\nBy cutting some of the Admiral's salaries and reducing waste, room in the naval budget for substantial improvements is possible. Be it weapon system overhauls, repairs, new electronics, or even just a new coat of paint, we have an opportunity to finally shape up the Kriegsmarine."

Our loyal troops oversaw the creation of the greatest empire the world has yet seen; it was therefore only fitting to reward them accordingly. Many veterans were given lands to settle, positions of power and influence, prestige and more than their share of wealth. This was easy enough to handle following the days of our great victory.\n\nThis has set a precedent of entitlement. Yet another generation of soldiers are retiring, and there isn't near the amount of wealth to go around; there simply hasn't been any new conquests. Still, they expect, and even DEMAND the same compensation the heroes of the last war were gifted, even the men who haven't seen a lick of battle! The most vocal of the new veterans are the last of our men to see real war; the veterans of the West Russian Conflict. There is no doubt that they suffered greatly to hold back the tide of red rats that threatened Moskowien, and therefore only ask for their fair share.\n\nIt is time we handled retirement benefits once and for all, so we can finally end the debate of what the veterans are due."

 reich.700.t:0 "A Dinner, An Argument, An Idea"
 reich.700.d:0 "Göring was picking at his dinner at Carinhall. He should have been satisfied: the food was terrific, Emma was beautiful as always, and, well, those priceless paintings had not yet lost their glamor - given how many he had collected since the war. He really should have been enjoying himself - if not for his guests.\n\n"What we need is conquest, the thing that made us the Masters of Europe in the first place. Day by day, our grasp on Europe grows ever more tenuous and I shudder to think of what might happen once our great Führer dies." That was at least what Otto Ernst Remer. Oh, how Göring detested the angry little man. Göring knew that he was one of the key architects for the suicidal War Plans.\n\n"Well, I can tell you with great certainty that the last few decades of stewardship under our great Führer have reaped nothing but dividends. I mean, we were the first to get a man on the moon. I think there are still some years left yet in our Third Reich. After all, we are not yet even close to the thousandth year - am I not right Reichsmarschall Göring?" Wilhelm Stuckart was a long-time friend, supporter, and ardent National Socialist. As far as he knew, Europe was theirs and the future of the Reich was no longer about further conquest.\n\n"Well, uh..." Göring looked at Schörner's lackey before returning his gaze towards Wilhelm Stuckart. Before he had a chance to answer, the militarist interrupted him and condemned the weak-willed bureaucrats for the anemic economy. Stuckart of course did not take it sitting down and leapt up in indignation to begin what would be a shouting match between him and the ardent Schörnerite.\n\nGöring excused himself from the meal to no one's notice. It would have been a waste to sign away his great popularity with the likes of Schörner and his band of merry mad men. No, destiny awaited. Surely, the successor would be rather eager to enlist the help of none other than Hermann Göring himself. Yes, there was much work to be done - as soon as he could calm the two idiots down enough to finish dinner."

 reich.701.t:0 "An Invitation to the Reformer"
 reich.701.d:0 "Dear Reichsminister Speer,\n\nAs Reichsmarschall, I must congratulate you on becoming the chosen successor of our Großgermanisches Reich. To celebrate this historic moment, I wish to extend a cordial invitation to a dinner at Carinhall. I have been told that you are a man of expensive taste and on that front I believe that Carinhall is second to none. I have also heard that you are a man of many ideas and reforms, one who wishes to bring the Reich to new heights. Although my past exploits were of the military kind, one thing I have learned in my time as a politician is this: one can never have too many men to keep the peace when less imaginative minds wish to keep things "the way they were". For such fiends, I can only recommend the bayonet. I understand that your Gang of Four would be your main advisors, but perhaps there is room for one more. My popular support and military prowess would no doubt shore up further support for your cause, and there is no other government that I would rather serve under than yours.\n\nSincerely,"
 reich.701.a:0 "gez. Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring"

 reich.702.t:0 "Gang of Four or Room for One More?"
 reich.702.d:0 "Albert Speer thought it amusing how informal and relaxed the letter was after reading and re-reading it. The letter barely seemed the type of correspondence that could have had far-reaching consequences on the Reich Speer was to inherit and manage going forwards. For a moment, it was tempting: Göring was a media darling and also someone who would no doubt move a lot of fence-sitters towards his side, but everything else about him would be more trouble than he was worth. Primarily, his very nature would create an imbalance in the already fragile Gang of Four. His old sabre-rattling reputation would put him at odds with Schmidt, and his terrible economic ideas would no doubt butt heads with Erhard. Göring too was a man who enjoyed the spotlight and would probably try to steal it from old 'Silver Tongue' Kiesinger and, well, Tresckow...\n\n"Herr Speer, Tresckow is waiting in the lobby to see you."\n\nSpeak of the devil. "Oh, send him in, please. Thank you." Speer had made up his mind by now: Tresckow would be the one to handle this. Göring and Tresckow were never amicable in the first place. Perhaps Schörner would enjoy knowing about this also. Of course, the details could all be handled in due time. When Tresckow opened the door, he was surprised that Speer had been standing up and waiting for him - seeming more animated than his usual self. For once perhaps, they may yet agree upon something."
 reich.702.a:0 ""A pity, I would have enjoyed a visit to Carinhall""

 reich.703.t:0 "An Invitation to the Dogmatist"
 reich.703.d:0 "Dear Martin Bormann, Chef der Parteikanzlei,\n\nBefore anything else, I wish to offer my heartfelt congratulations on securing the succession. I have no doubt that you may carry forward the burning torch of National Socialism towards a bright and gleaming future without losing sight of the things which had made us great in the first place. As such, I would like to cordially invite you to Carinhall for dinner. I believe we have much to discuss with regards to the future of the Reich. With your firm commitment to National Socialist principles and my popular support, truly no enemy - internal or external - could hope to stand a chance against our great Reich. As such, I believe I have much to offer as an administrator and officer within your faction. I hope we may meet in Carinhall at your earliest convenience to discuss these matters further.\n\nWarmly,"
 reich.703.a:0 "gez. Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring"

 reich.704.t:0 "Shadow Masters and Flickering Flames"
 reich.704.d:0 "Bormann sat there looking at the letter. He had scanned it over. That bumbling buffoon. Bormann knew someone who was in a weak position when he saw one. No love lost anyhow. After folding the letter along its creases, he slid the sheet of paper back into the envelope. Bormann, with envelope in hand, slowly walked towards the burning fireplace crackling on the far side of the room.\n\nAs the shadows of his fingers flickered in front of the fireplace, it had given him an idea. Göring wanted to get away from his puppeteers. The fool that he was, Bormann was going to bet that those shadow masters would no doubt wish to see this little letter he had. He turned back towards his desk and sat down once more, letter in hand. Picking up the phone, Bormann said to his secretary: "Could you put Feldmarschall Schörner on the line?"\n\n"Of course. What should I tell him as the reason for your call?""
 reich.704.a:0 ""Tell him that I have something that would interest him greatly.""

 reich.705.t:0 ""Göring at Carinhall""
 reich.705.d:0 "Göring strolled out of his office with a sigh. His gambit had failed. He was wedded to the militarists for now. The letter to the successor was leaked and Schörner came calling about his "betrayal". Göring had lied to him: the conservatives had sent the letter without his knowledge and set up the meeting. By a stroke of luck, Schörner believed him - but Göring knew that Naumann wouldn't. It wasn't as if he didn't try, explaining to the Reichsminister how the militarists had done that on his behalf. After all they'd been through, Göring had thought there would have been some quotable last words on either side - but Naumann didn't even manage to finish his sentence before hanging up on Göring in exasperation and disbelief. In one phone call, his conservative support had died.\n\nAs he strolled through Carinhall's art section, one painting caught his eye. It was one of Napoleon; he was sinking into his chair, defeated. There was no commanding gaze, no passionate look, it was a blank stare towards nothingness. Initially, it was there as a matter of pride: nowadays, who, after all, was the Master of Europe? The Führer was not French, let alone one called "Napoleon". However, now Göring looked at the painting with a new sense of empathy. If Schörner and his War Plans were successful, then he would no doubt go down in history as one greater than Napoleon... but Göring knew deep down he was no Napoleon. Even with the greatness of the Reich, the later War Plans would be near impossible to achieve. On that day, when his armies falter and his people groan, he wondered if someone would ever make a painting of him."

 ### Bohemia Events ###
 reich.801.t:0 "Bohemia Sides with Bormann"
 reich.801.desc:0 "It has come to extensive attention that bureaucrats in the Bohemian protectorate unanimously selected to declare support in favor of Martin Bormann in the struggle for the Reich's destiny.\n\nMany who had otherwise opposed the move in favor of relocating the garrisons toward Germany appear to have been quelled, and the common belief within the protectorate remains in the judgement that it is Bormann who will guide Germany on a path to prominence. It can be assumed they consider themselves somewhat worthy of this fate as well.\n\nShort fissures in insight have not prevented the participants of the skirmishes from acknowledging that Bohemian reinforcements may change the course of the emerging war. Only time can tell how the situation will develop, although it can be safely acknowledged that the Bohemian officers have put themselves in an exposed position to many in the Reich, with the odds of resistance now laden against the untested soldiers."
 reich.801.a:0 "Willkommen im Reich, your bravery is saluted."
 reich.801.b:0 "Their days are numbered."

 reich.802.t:0 "Bohemia Sides with Göring"
 reich.802.desc:0 "We have received reports that Heer units inside of Bohemia and Moravia have begun to mobilize themselves and move towards the border of Prussia. The administration of the most recently integrated part of the Reich has apparently thrown in their lot with Göring and acknowledged him as the rightful Führer. This comes as little surprise, as Göring most directly threatens the region out of all of the major contenders.\n\nNo doubt the militarist and his clique are more than pleased with this particular turn of events. Not only will the manpower and resources of Bohemia be welcome, but the region provides an additional buffer against Bormann's base of control in Austria and Bavaria, and perhaps even can act as a launching point to strike at Bormann's base of power in Munich.\n\nWhether or not the decision is a good one remains to be seen, however. If Göring is unable to hold the region, what work has been done to properly integrate it into the Reich may be seriously damaged by the rigors of war, and if any of the contenders aside from Göring succeed, no doubt his collaborators will not live to see much further beyond the end of the war."
 reich.802.a:0 "They have made the correct choice."
 reich.802.b:0 "Their cowardice will not be forgotten."

 reich.803.t:0 "Bohemia Sides with Speer"
 reich.803.desc:0 "Reports have begun to trickle in that Heer units inside of Bohemia and Moravia have begun to mobilize, and are currently establishing a defensive perimeter around the most vital parts of the region, and have begun to dig in. The administration of the most recently integrated part of the Reich has proclaimed Speer as the rightful Führer, and will support his claim militarily against his enemies. This is a shock, with Speer's base of power too far away to be able to immediately support the Bohemians.\n\nMany suggest that this is a gamble in favor of the reformer, that perhaps if he is victorious, he would grant Bohemia and Moravia some boons or liberties they have not been able to enjoy thus far. However, no such demands have been made, and the Bohemian Heer has begun to dig in as they can expect immediate and severe reprisals from both Göring's armies in Prussia, and from Bormann's armies in Austria and Bavaria.\n\nThis is a risky move on the part of Bohemia, and one that could easily end in disaster for the region. Compared to the rest of the nation, Bohemia was only recently integrated, and it would suffer greatly in terms of population and economics if either Göring or Bormann stormed into Prague. Even worse, is the possibility that they split it in two."
 reich.803.a:0 "We will not let them down!"
 reich.803.b:0 "Have they gone mad?"

 reich.804.t:0 "Bohemia Sides with Heydrich"
 reich.804.desc:0 "The Butcher of Prague seems to still have connections to his old base of operations.\n\nReinhard Heydrich was the undisputed autocrat of Bohemia and Moravia during the Second World War, leading efforts to control the region and begin the process of Germanization and integration. He was, undisputedly, the greatest at both of these tasks, as the occupied and recently annexed region remained stable, and Germanization efforts were efficient.\n\nNow, that very same region has declared their support for Heydrich's bid for Führer, in spite of the fact that he controls no territory through which to immediately supply aid. However, it is indeed possible for the two forces to link up, provided that Heydrich's East Prussian forces and the Bohemian Heer could hold out against Göring and Bormann for long enough.\n\nIt seems the Second World War has reared its head again, and the Butcher of Prague benefits yet again from his accomplishments then. Whether or not the Bohemians can contribute effectively remains yet to be seen, but they have taken a risk, out of loyalty it would seem. It shall be seen whether that loyalty can stiffen the backs of the region's Heer forces..."
 reich.804.a:0 "Naturally."
 reich.804.b:0 "The beaten dog yearns for its master still."

 reich.805.t:0 "Hottest Place in Hell"
 reich.805.desc:0 "Intelligence spread throughout the Reich indicates that Wehrkreis XIX, corresponding to the region of Böhmen-Mahren, along with chief administrator Schwerin von Krosigk, has undergone a fortified approach. Thousands of men formerly loyal to the Wehrmacht and the Reich have redirected their allegiance toward a formation of cities across Moravia, with each councilor unanimously probing in favor of sovereignty.\n\nThe aids promised in the form of equipment and helping hands have not arrived, and devout supporters of the rightful successor remain unheard from. Local authorities across the protectorate begun by declaring their allegiance toward a foremost protection of the Reich's citizenries within their constraints, before issuing revived documentation and recoating insignia. Mountaineer units stationed around the Sudetes refuse to permit any soldier fighting the Bürgerkrieg within the protectorate, stopping the action right around the gates.\n\nIt can be assumed that the Bohemians believe that by sheltering themselves from the disorganized militias slogging through the streets of Germany proper, they too can refuse the will of the leader, the creed of our beliefs and the power of our armed forces. For this, they are sorely mistaken. Be it as it may, Wehrkreis XIX remains out of our reach at the moment - for better or for worse."
 reich.805.a:0 "Bohemia remains unprotected."

 reich.806.t:0 "Pierced Pistols"
 reich.806.desc:0 "Bohemia had never fit the description of the jewel of the Reich, as had been promised by numerous protectors across the decades. Debased hordes continually lurked in the shadows, seeking to sabotage any perception of stability confined by the lands adjoining the Morava. History reveals the region's alternatives as often turbulent and unpredictable.\n\nRecounts of fate proved true once more - the fighters selected the duplicitous flag and perished under it. Projected well before its time, this change of allegiance, and later control, serves a lesson in history. But the soldiers under our protection were greatly disadvantaged by the bloodshed that occurred as an outcome of such reckless selections.\n\nAs of six in the morning, several brigades arrived outside the walls of Prag, and the streets of Brno have likewise been occupied by lingering battalions. Although the garrisons under our control are war-torn, with the radio gushing our messages and administrative control restored to the foremost towns, the residents of Bohemia now know their luck is settled. Many now have the choice between following through with the guidance that is obvious or facing the compulsion worthy of convicts and street crooks. Our men will make it clear in the days to come that there's always need for someone to wash the prison floors.\n\nOn another end of the spectrum, edifice efforts have returned to major parts of the capital. Cathedrals, statues and sights of architecture, formerly grazed by artillery shells, and gates overran by tanks, are in the development of solid reassembly. Although a lack of materials poses an issue, logistical specialists in the form of veteran architects can now move around the war-torn land freely and practice their skills to benefit our own nation in the new era, once again united under a Führer."

 reich.807.t:0 "Hell Over Husinec"
 reich.807.desc:0 "Throughout the ranks of the high command in Brno and Prag within the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, it would seem that our efforts to sway the soldiers in the region have been successful. Even still, there remains the issue of the divided garrison, and its heightened efforts to betray or protect Germany along the lower echelons.\n\nOur men closer to home now realize that while overjoyed by the Bohemian garrison's allegiance to our cause, generals may have neglected the destitute situation this national fortress had been dealt with, prior to even its chance to reckon a considerable defense.\n\nIn the days subsequent to the final skirmishes over the Jizera, officers were overflown with radio communications stating an increasing number of troops surrendering - and even deserting - to enemy forces. Surrounded, outnumbered and in dire need of supplies, divisions in the protectorate left our control by the platoon, with each injured man adding to the casualties imposed in the defense of the rightful successor to the Reich's highest office.\n\nThis bloodshed between brothers marks exactly the style of conduct our enemy pushes for, and the sentiment we swore to eradicate from the fatherland.\n\nBut for now, the sad truth must be accepted. Bohemia has fallen to pretenders, and unless we act fast, the Germans over the Sudetes may not see an attentive state and worthwhile peace again."
 reich.807.a:0 "We ought to have acted faster."

 reich.808.t:0 "Prag"
 reich.808.desc:0 "Gothic bells rang overhead the passing soldiers as their march surpassed the enormous black gates of the church, swung open, the riches of the cathedral and the furnished baldachin in open view to passing onlookers.\n\nWalls of the town hall, previously mere shattered pieces upon the ground, now cling together in unison structure. Astonished guards looked over the city, dynamic yet bland and empty, a sense of uneasy trepidation climbing through their backs. Word had arrived from Germania in the early morning that towns along the Moldau had been under no credible threat, and a normal sense of authority would return. That evening would be the first when the Germans of Prag could walk onto their roads in peace since the funeral.\n\nNo sense of victory appeared in the populace. Observers said the sun setting over the murky clouds did little to relieve them of the stress of night. The clacking of grenades and sound of firing bullets failed to graze the town, and each door and window in the Old Town remained solidly shut. Youth had dispersed, the chatting had quieted, and the thought of resistance now long forgotten. The uniformed guard turned his face toward the back of the tower."
 reich.808.a:0 "The streets here have never been this clean."

 reich.809.t:0 "Ehre wen Ehre Gebührt"
 reich.809.desc:0 "The cameras had been focused on the desk in the office, all of its shelves carefully articulated to show off the exact pictures commemorating the victories of the Civil War. Lights illuminated the office to give it a warm feeling, even in spite of the cold aura which could be felt in the eyes of the lone Führer sitting at the table, smiling as bright and lifeless as fluorescent lighting. The effective "producer" gave a thumbs-up, and the Führer cleared his throat.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to give my eternal thanks to those who the Reich owes an immense favor; the garrison of Bohemia-Moravia, who have so fearlessly defended and fought for the true National Socialism." At this moment, the Führer knew that photos of the brave men in marching and fighting were being laid over the footage, and tried to envision his voice layered over their bloody battles.\n\n"It is thanks to these soldiers that the region still stands, and are potentially very well responsible for turning the tides of the Civil War. For that, the Reich is forever grateful, and I hold nothing but optimism for our future relations with such an integral part of the Reich."\n\nWith that, the camera operators let out a sigh of relief, and with the smile of the producer, he announced to the room and nobody in particular:"
 reich.809.a:0 ""We got it!""

 reich.810.t:0 "Mending with Numbers"
 reich.810.desc:0 "Eyes glazed under his pair of spectacles, Berndt squinted at the musty slip of paper sitting in front of him. Yellowed and most likely unearthed from a subterranean bunker in Prag, Berndt counted himself lucky that there were few things so well protected, besides perhaps the Führer and the halls of Sipo HQ. Even so, Berndt could not be more thankful for anything within the realm of comparison, especially not when it came to keeping track of just how to integrate Bohemia and Moravia. For all of the fancy talk of reunification, it seemed as though he was the only man in the Reich who was assigned to deciding just how things would look in terms of logistics.\n\nTo begin, Germany and Bohemia-Moravia were infrastructurally a shitshow on a good day. Namely, one before civil conflict in Germany, as not only had the preliminary highways from the '30s just not existed in the former Czech lands, but the ensuing infrastructure programs simply found no reason to go through the lands past the Sudeten. The region had its own autonomous methods of governing, something which was undoubtedly going to cause troubles for integration.\n\nBerndt let out a sigh and leaned back in his chair. The creak broke the perfect silence of the room, stuck in the middle of the midnight air. It's not that it was impossible. The basis had already been set some 20 years ago. All it would really require would be some slower changes, with time, and the changes already established were staggering. Brendt looked back to his stacks of paper, his effort etched into their pages. He closed his eyes and wondered what his time was dedicated to. His months of research, his pre-existing knowledge of Bohemia and Moravia matched by few others, but what would it be worth come the end of reunification? Would one of the historians still counting the bullets expended in the east dredge it up in some endless history book?\n\nThe midnight air remained still. Brendt let out another breath. He felt his nerves begin to ease."

Thanks to the tireless effort of the soldiers who fought on our side throughout the Civil Conflict, the region has been reintegrated with minimal damage, and they may have very well been the deciding factor in the conflict. Through National Socialist might, grit, and unwavering loyalty to the true Germany, the garrisons of the region have done more than necessary to prove their loyalty.\n\nWhile the region has been within the Einheitspakt for some time now, with all preparations met on the part of our gracious Führer, the official ceremony has been held and aired on national television across the Reich. With this considerable achievement reached, we can now say for certain that the first steps have been taken towards true stability on a national level, and Germany can begin to reclaim what it lost, both in prestige and in Lebensraum. For now, however, it can take the time to celebrate this small victory, something which the people so desperately need, as Germany has finally wrenched itself out of the gutter, and begun to look eastwards to its former colonial possessions."

 ###CAPTURE EVENTS###
 gcwcapture.1.t:0 "Fall of Leipzig"
 gcwcapture.1.desc:0 "Leipzig has fallen!\n\nThe birthplace of Johann Bach has been the center of heavy fighting in recent days. Martin Bormann's forces have been driven out of the culturally rich city, but at a hefty price. Germans from both sides lay strewn throughout what remains of the city. Though damaged, many of Leipzig's culturally significant buildings still stand, although heavy artillery bombardment has devastated the industrial parks, and many civilians wander the streets, digging through the rubble for lost loved ones. In the center of the city, over three hundred men have created a formidable holdout in the Monument to the Battle of Nations, though surrounded and low on supplies, it is expected they will surrender soon.\n\nBormann has suffered a great defeat today. It remains to be seen if his loyalists will be able recapture this strategically important city, or if it will remain occupied indefinitely."

Bormann loyalists were spread throughout the city. Combined with a hostile civilian population, the aggressors had no choice but to sweep the city house by house, apartment by apartment, block by block. The city was, for all intents and purposes, a giant fortress.\n\nHeavy urban fighting has taken its toll on both sides, along with the civilian population. Thousands are dead, and the city has been gutted. The loss of this stronghold is a disaster to Bormann and his men; if the frontlines can't soon be stabilized, much of Southern Germany will lay wide open to attack. Much of Southern Germany may soon suffer the same fate of Nuremberg if the defenders fail to rally."

The fighting that has lasted these last few days has finally come to an end, and a dreary silence has fallen over the once prosperous city.\n\nMany civilians tried to hole up in their homes or flee as German fought German across vast automotive complexes and corporate skyscrapers. Some early reports estimate that over 60% of the city has been destroyed, and the little housing that remains have quickly become quarters for the newly arrived conquerors.\n\nAs most of the civilian population that remains scrounges for the few resources that lay unclaimed, only one question remains unanswered; will Bormann return?"

Bormann's loyalists fought in every street. Civilians were press ganged into labor brigades, homes transformed into makeshift bunkers, and streets blocked off with an assortment of ruble, ruined vehicles, and whatever else could be tossed into the streets. Massive bombardments softened the city before the main attack commenced, and combined with an equally determined infantry assault, the defenders were forced to withdraw from the city.\n\nBorman's position is precarious; with enemies deep into Southern Germany, many speculate that his faction is close to collapse. Whether he and his loyalists can rally and recover or not remains to be seen."

The city, barely standing after the first fight has been thoroughly racked by heavy ordnance and leveled. Many of the old opera theatres and old music studios were filled to the brim with hostiles; there was no saving those buildings.\n\nThe people of Leipzig are suffering greatly; much of the city's infrastructure has been totally destroyed, but Bormann's troops have been doing what they can to assuage the suffering of their newly liberated brethren. News of what the men found at the Monument to the Battle of Nations has spread far and wide; those three-hundred who bravely died are being hailed as heroes and martyrs by their comrades; their charred remains finally being put to rest.\n\nThe fighting has exhausted both attackers and defenders. It is to be seen if Bormann will be able to keep up his momentum and push deeper into Germany proper, or if this is the extent of his resurgence. In any case, Martin Bormann is by no means out of this war just yet."

Bormann's troops, to the fanfare of his people, have returned.\n\nDirty, ragged Swastikas are hung from the ruins as the army marches through the streets. Bloodied citizens cheer as the impromptu triumph makes its way through the ruins like the early days of the Reich. Gunshots ring out as a nearby group of men are led to a standing wall and forced to kneel, their betrayal paid back with a single bullet to the head. Rabid civilians meanwhile hunt down whatever stragglers they can. Usually, the ex-occupiers are simply beaten to death, but more than a few corpses hang from street lights and buildings, the sign Verräter usually nailed or hung to the body.\n\nRecapturing Nuremberg has given the NSDAP loyalists a much needed moral boost. They have regained the momentum for the time being, but it is to be seen if Bormann and his men will be able to keep it."

While military losses are unknown, the civilian population and infrastructure has been decimated. The great automatic plants of the city, Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Bosch and a few others have been completely reduced to rubble. No one will be making any breakthroughs here in electronics, and it seems that not many guns will be coming out of the city in the near future. Still, the city is strategically important, and Bormann once again controls this important junction.

Most counted Bormann as good as dead, with the other factions infiltrating so deep into his main area of operations. However, at least temporarily, his forces have recaptured the vital city of Munich after heavy fighting.\n\nThe city itself now resembles most of the other urban battlegrounds throughout Germany; ruined, lacking running water, low on foodstuffs, and now of negligible industrial importance. Some of Bormann's core lands still lay under occupation as well, but it appears that he has stabilized the frontlines, as well as making limited advances in other areas of Southern Germany. It remains to be seen if Bormann's momentum will continue unabated, or if this was just the spasms of a dying warlord."

The building to building fighting has torn apart the old medieval center of the city. After Speer's loyalists turned the section into a virtual fortress, those on the offensive lost their patience and decided to level most of the culturally rich old quarter.\n\nLingering gunshots ring out as Speer's supporters are hunted down to the man. Goethe University, once the largest school in the city is now little more than a grave for those who made their last stand there, the only occupants being the corpses of the defenders lying next to a bloodstained, ruined wall.

Hanover's now ruined industry and strategic location was vital to Speer's war effort; without this important strategic center, Speer's position in the northwest is precarious indeed.

Steadfast and zealous students clashed with an equally determined enemy. The bombardment of the entire city did little to dampen the spirits of the defenders; Speer loyalists of all ages took up defences in the rubble and patiently awaited the inevitabile assault on the city itself.\n\nThe fight more resembled a death struggle reminiscent to the great battles of the East than a simple clash of a split country as waves of young men attempted to storm important locations; many of them mowed down in the streets. Back and forth battles raged for important buildings that still overlooked tactically vital areas of the now ruined city. Strongpoints too stubborn to fall were repeatedly hit with ballistic and ground-based missiles by the attackers. Supported by tanks and APCs, one by one the city blocks began to fall. Cars loaded with bombs and artillery shells were the response, and more than a few of the surprised attackers met a grisly fate as these makeshift bombs started to hit convoys, troops formations, armor and strong points. Refusing to surrender after the fall of the city, Speer's forces abandoned their military wear and blended into what remains of the civilian population, which is currently being brutalized as the conquerors exact revenge and try to root out the remains of the reformers.\n\nWhile this bloodbath raged on, Albert Speer and his most important advisors quietly left the city, their current location unknown.

Losses were heavy for both sides, and more than a few civilians were shot, confused for combatants. As Speer's men finally pushed the last of the enemies out of the city, more than a few grizzly scenes greeted the now not so enthusiastic men. Blending in with the civilian population, while very effective, extolled a heavy price from the people. Hundreds of innocent Germans line the streets, blood still oozing from their heads or dripping from the walls they were lined up against. Perhaps the worst sight is at the Goethe University. In the middle of the campus, over a thousand college aged men and women lay in a series of ditches they dug themselves, if the abandoned shovels strewn around is anything to go by. The vast majority of them remain unburied, and the stench is unbearable as grieving locals sort through the dead.\n\nThe city is firmly in Speer's hands now, but the cost was great.

Trucks full of fighting men meanwhile sweep the city for any "unwelcome traitors." Most of those captured are shot on the spot, the rest taken by vehicle to somewhere outside the city. Meanwhile, a wave of civilians have come forwards to point out collaborators, fellow citizens who sold themselves to the enemies for trivial amounts of food, water, and medicine. Many of the accused have been taken from the city and have not been heard of again, their status unknown, but their families fear the worst.\n\nAs Speer's men celebrate this major victory, the generals and officers make plans to take the fight to the enemy's strongholds.

Saying the fighting was underhanded would be a vast understatement; Speer's militia used the mostly intact sewers to move around while pickup trucks with heavy machine guns bolted down in the beds sped through the streets. Speer's staff claim that their enemies resorted to using poison gas underground, and resorted to mining many of the streets to attempt to halt their enemy's relentless advance. Using the night as cover, one final mass assault decided the fate of the city; the occupiers were forced to withdraw after being simply overwhelmed by the ferciosity and numbers of the reformers offensive.\n\nThe city is battered; most of its industry is in ruins, the infrastructure is barely functional, and the civilian population is in dire need of relief.

Perhaps as many as three thousand civilians tried to escape the warzone by boat, but the harbor had been mined, most of the shipping was sunk as a result, along with their human cargo. Göring's men meanwhile laced most of the major parts of Kiel with explosives, and used the resulting destruction and chaos to withdraw from the city, at the expense of the civilians.\n\nGöring has been driven out of the strategically important city, and the rest of Jutland lays open, but the human cost has once again been great."

The celebrations were cut short as a shocking artillery and aerial bombardment rocked the entirety of the city.\n\nIt is suspected that the would be conquerors were simply tired of the protracted resistance, and that such a brazen show of strength would break the city's spirit. The bombardment had the opposite intended effect. The civilians, who had up to this point been indifferent supporters of Göring, rose up in anger and defense of their homes.\n\nSaying the line between civilian and soldier was blurred is a vast understatement. After sustaining heavy small-arms fire from plain clothed civilians all across the ruins, many people wearing plain clothes were simply shot on sight in the streets, with few exceptions. In response, the fighting took to the underground. The city's vast drainage and sewer systems were extensively used by Göring and his newfound allies to great effect. So great, in fact, that the underground systems were "allegedly" gassed more than once, and combat engineers were deployed to collapse the tunnels, increasing the damage to the already destroyed city. Rostock University, one of the oldest centers of higher education in the world and headquarters of the defenders was hit multiple times by ballistic missiles, completely leveling it. It wasn't until after the fighting concluded that the attackers learned that it was actually being used as a hospital and refuge for suffering citizens; not a single soldier was killed in the strikes, and there are well over a thousand dead buried in the rubble.\n\nGöring's men, bloodied and battered, have retreated from the broken bones of the city, covered by his airforce. For the time being, it looks like Göring is being put on the defensive in North Germany."

Strong points were meticulously chosen throughout the city, and many first generation settlers volunteered to take up arms against the approaching enemy army, refusing to see their homes fall without a fight.\n\nBoth sides got their fight. The attacker's dreams of a quick victory was dashed as they ran head first into the outer fortresses. Even after sustained heavy artillery fire, missile strikes, armored assaults, and then massed infantry attacks were only some of the fortresses compromised. Trying to assault the city with nearly half of the outer fortresses still operational proved to be disastrous and a constant thorn in the side as the defenders stubbornly fought on inside the city itself. A daring assault by professional army soldiers finally split the defenders in half, ending organized resistance in Posen.\n\nAlthough the city is still a warzone, enough control has been established for the attackers to claim victory. A couple forts still stand defiant, lobbing heavy ordnance at whoever comes a little too close to their perimeters, but Göring's remnants, for all intents and purposes, are trapped and irreverent."

It was no elite Heer sniper, or even a veteran of the Great War. It was a boy, no older than fifteen, wearing a Hitlerjugend uniform.\n\nHeavy fighting started up after the attackers finally entered the city. Artillery crews drank heavily as they launched their ordnance. Most of the snipers had turned out to be boy scouts ranging in age from as old as seventeen to eleven, and every call for sniper suppression was more often than not a death sentence handed out to German children. It would later be discovered that the local youth leaders were mostly hardcore supporters of Göring who had called upon their members to "fight for the true Führer of Germany" and "save our homes from rapists and looters." Currently, the new owners of Kattowitz are too busy keeping their heads down and methodically combing the ruins for snipers to do much of either.

Entrenched machine gun positions were a nightmare to overwhelm, and danger close rocket artillery killed more than their fair share of friendlies. Slowly but surely, The attackers crawled their way through the city. The pressure was simply too much, and the defenders were finally forced from the positions.\n\nRostock, or the rubble that is left of it, is once again in Göring's hands. It doesn't mean much though. All that really remains of Rostock is a dot on the map and a landscape of ruins. The few civilians that remain seem almost feral, and keep their distance from our men. Likewise, the troops keep a respectful distance; more than a few men who went looking for loot or women have disappeared, only for their bodies to be found later, missing hands or their genitals depending on the crime."

Motorized infantry arrived on the battlefield, and the occupiers resigned to fight in the now encircled city.\n\nThe tables turned as Göring's men stepped foot into the ruins. The strongpoints that they once held were now used against them as they tried to push into the city's center. Armored vehicles were basically moving targets with no room to maneuver while ruins laced with explosives went off as the attackers took cover in them.

Their courage was desivise when Göring's troops closed in on the city. Using little more than a few scavenged radios and walkie talkies, the rebel resistance cell radioed important target coordinates to their friends laying siege to the city. With their assistance, precision artillery strikes crippled the defender's efforts to hold their ground. However, one group of these spotters were sighted and shot. The garrison was furious, and in a fit of vengeance began to massacre the city's civilian population, who they believed were all compliant in assisting Göring's men. By the time Göring's army was able to finally secure the city, thousands upon thousands of civilians laid dead, their bodies left strewn in ruined apartments and the streets.

It wasn't a problem until random civilians began to explode.\n\nAs we later learned, the SS went around the city abducting entire families and focing one of the members to wear "salvation vests". The people who "volunteered" were strapped with bombs before mingling in with other civilians fleeing SS brutality, starvation, and massacres. As they were pushed deeper into the city, the SS began to use literal human shields; hundreds of men, women, and children were forced to march towards the enemy lines as SS troops followed close behind with panzers and armored APCs. Only a tragic few caught between the crossfire survived. When the attackers finally reached the center of the city, lines of civilians were handcuffed together in front of machine gun posts and trenches.

As more of Straßburg fell, entire blocks would burst into flames, having been wired to explode. Suicidal SS attacks would almost always hit formations hit by these massive explosions. In either an act of mercy, or afraid that straggling citizens may interfere with their plans, most of the city's population was allowed to leave before the fighting. Leniency on the attacker's behalf may have backfired, as SS soldiers managed to infiltrate with the refugees, and now attack their enemy's backlines.

The SS troops stopped their reckless advance, and cautiously and patiently combed through the city, slowly cutting their way through the rings of defensives. There was no quarter given to either side, and little attention was given to the poor souls who were once again caught in the crossfire.\n\nHeydrich's men did eventually come out on top.

In this time the territory has proven to be by far the most successful example of Germanization in the Eastern Territories, and its well-developed capital of Theodorichshafen is a hub of both military control and local tourism. Yet current developments seem to be placing the Gau at direct threat of annihilation.\n\nGotenland, unlike most of Germany, has avoided the specter of civil war, with its Gauleiter Franz Maierhofer remaining largely neutral. However, the specter of banditry looms ever larger. As partisans see key victories in Ukraine, Gotenland faces an existential threat. The result has been a collapse in the economy and stability of what was once a fairly well-off region.\n\nGauleiter Maierhofer has detailed this crisis to us in a series of increasingly desperate messages to us; due to present conditions we are unable to respond. However, his last missive was of a very different tone. Ignoring proper procedure, he has declared a state of emergency which will allow him to "temporarily assume command of any Wehrmacht units as well as give orders to any NSDAP institutions until the situation across Germany is resolved." This act is technically illegal, but litigating it is hardly worth value in this moment.\n\nThe good news is that for now, Gotenland will be organized enough to protect itself from bandits.

Admirals from across the Reich, from every conceivable fleet and theatre, have apparently sent communiques to Theoderichshafen commending Dönitz's actions. His proclaimations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz.\n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to Maierhofer's, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the German state. Luckily for us, a number of admirals have publicly rebuffed Dönitz's overtures, openly deriding him for acting as if the Kriegsmarine remains under his control while living in luxury in retirement."

Initially, the operation went without note, the base being abandoned as expected with much of the equipment taken by the SS in their retreat. What was unexpected, however, was the discovery of the body of Reinhard Heydrich in his office.\n\nKilled from a single shot to the forehead as he sat behind the desk, the state of the office suggests that Heydrich was in the process of packing up to leave when he was killed, and reportedly other evidence further implies that he did not expect his sudden demise. Officially, it will be announced that Heydrich took his own life, and his body will be cremated before the ashes are scattered in an undisclosed location.

 reich.566.d:0 "Across the country, men from the Heer abandon their posts. Some division's role calls have reported half, or sometimes more of their men going AWOL. In a couple instances, entire infantry and panzer divisions have simply disappeared off the map, only to reappear across the country in Southern Germany. No explanation can be shaken from the officers and generals of these divisions, since they are either nowhere to be found or hidden away in the blackspot of South Germany. To make matters worse, late last night the general staff in Berlin vanished. A convoy of personal cars and military trucks filled with high ranking officials and their attachments were last seen heading south after picking up the troops at our checkpoints. There is little doubt that they are also heading south.\n\nHeer messengers run amok in Germania, and formations all across Germany are suddenly leaderless and further disintegrating. From one partially burnt letter an aide managed to dig up alongside a couple of tapped phone recordings reveal a common, simple phrase from Martin Bormann himself; "It is time.""

Surely, they could see eye-to-eye on this issue, and realize the need for cooperation with former enemies against a new fiend.\n\nSuddenly, the door swung open, shocking the architect as it slammed against the finely sculpted wooden wall. "CHEATERS! CHEATERS, CHEATERS!" Hitler screamed in his pyjamas, his eyes bloodshot and his face red with anger. "My player is the scorn of Germany!!!"\n\nSpeer stood silent, unable to respond. The elderly Führer continued his triade. "Years and years of playing Hearts of Iron, just to learn how to use the state transfer tool! I never used a single console command, yet I conquered Europe all by myself! Shame on all of you!"\n\n"Adolf, please calm down! It's me, Albert!" Hitler stopped ranting at the ceiling and turned to face his old friend.\n\n"Schinsser..." He closed his eyes and his expression turned into one of defeat. "Please, just... Restart the game. Fairly, this time."\n\nSpeer shook his head, hiding his confusion. "Ja, of course." He proceeded to run downstairs, to restart the heating system. Hopefully, his lapse was just from the cold."

 reich.1000.desc:0 "The dinner party was elegant as always. Well dressed men and a few women talked and strolled through the gardens and terrace of the American embassy. Martin Bormann followed their paths absent-mindedly as he watched from a window higher up in one of the many conference rooms.\n\n"It is very simple Herr Botschafter, Speer doesn't have the support necessary. His few supporters may be loud, but they are few and fickle to boot. It would only be a matter of time until they turned against you as well if given the chance."\n\nHe turned his gaze away from the window again to face Walter C. Dowling. His attempts to sway the American ambassador had been frustrating so far to say the least. Bormann had tried everything in his political and diplomatic toolbox; from reason, to charm, to veiled threats and even various historical and scientific anecdotes. All to convince this man that he was the better choice for the Americans to befriend than that spineless Speer. It hadn't worked.\n\n"That's all very well and good Mr. Bormann, but as of right now the government of the United States sees no reason to comment on the internal affairs of a sovereign country such as yours."\n\nTwo hours later, annoyed, exhausted and barely containing his anger Bormann would leave. It was pointless - the Americans wouldn't support him."

It wasn't supposed to be like this. All those years of work building his web of influence and support. The Reichskommissariats should have been his staunchest allies, and indeed some of them were - but they all had their own problems.\n\n"So that leaves us with Veesenmayer, the Danish, the Africans, and Serbia."\n\n"No Sir, the Serbian and British garrisons are necessary to keep the areas under our control, they can't spare any troops. And with respect Herr Bormann, the African RKs would take weeks to send over significant amounts of troops and material. That is if rogue elements in the Kriegsmarine don't intercept them."\n\nHis aide looked almost as tired as he felt.\n\n"So the Danish garrison then? Well, it's better than nothing I suppose."\n\nBormann left the room to make a call to Copenhagen.\n\n"When I am done with the traitors at home, I swear I will make sure the Reich is never disunited again," he muttered to himself."

The majority of the Party saw Bormann as a symbol of stability. The German people viewed him as the new, albeit less charismatic, Adolf Hitler. Attempts to shore up loyalty throughout the Wehrmacht had proven most rewarding, and his latest scheme to buy the loyalty of corrupt Waffen-SS officers had succeeded.\n\nYet his foes across the board were not weak. There was Heydrich, the black Knight, surrounded by fanatics. Speer, the Pawn, bowing to the whims of the so-called 'Gang of Four'. Then there was his strongest rival, Hermann Göring, the King. Bormann chuckled to himself. Considering the man's taste in clothing and jewelry, perhaps 'Queen' would be more apt.\n\nBormann's private secretary, Gerhard Klopfer, barged into the room with urgency.\n\n"They've betrayed us, Parteikanzler Bormann. The Waffen-SS troops we bribed. Göring doubled what we paid them, and they've pledged loyalty to him. All in secrecy, of course, but our spies uncovered the truth."\n\nBormann ground his teeth in silence. Another day, another move."

This fear has led to a pact between the three against Heydrich, with Speer, Bormann and Göring all signing a temporary ceasefire solely to ensure Heydrich remains out of the Reichstag. While this coalition has little hope for remaining united, it is generally agreed that any option should be put before Heydrich."

 reich_shared.23.desc:0 "With the end of the Bürgerkrieg, volunteers from all sides return to their homes after risking their lives in the defence of their ideals. Some, however, will be remembered more than others.\n\nToday, the entire Wehrmacht honors the final retirement of Erwin Rommel, the "Desert Fox" who led the Italo-German invasion of British Africa. The old general, who had been living as a civilian for almost a decade, had rejoined the army in the civil war, bringing with him his legendary ability with Panzer tactics: while no longer a tank commander due to his old age, his keen insight in armor warfare, combined with the legendary reputation that followed him ever since the days of the Afrika-Korps, inspired many to fight well beyond their own capabilities.\n\nNow, however, the tired Fox has announced his second - and final - retirement from the Wehrmacht, citing his failing health and the sadness from fighting fellow Germans as the main reasons. While some would have wanted to keep him to help rebuild the armed forces, no one dared suggest it, so respected he was. After a final parade where he saluted the crowd atop an old Panther tank, he was escorted to his home covered in even more medals than he already has, to enjoy his final years."

 reich_shared.22.desc:0 "Wojciech Omyła lay beneath the rubble, dreaming of oblivion. He drifted across a reality where it all ended. Where his brethren would never fear to speak Polish, where Warszawa would reside beneath a peaceful horizon never starless and the shrouded horrors of the past long forgotten. A world wrought from his own sacrifice. For him to join a doomed uprising that would ensure Nazism to be lost in echoes and for his children to be disintegrated into the ashes of destiny and time.\n\nHe awakened from the call of his son, scarcely a decade old, holding his morbidly wounded arm. The child begged for him to find the strength to lift himself up from the debris, to join his wife who survived the mortar strike. The father struggled to turn his head to see the devastation. He saw his comrades from the underground, all around him, their bodies grey and still. From his numbness he knew he would soon join them to the end. He extended his arm and pulled his son close, and told with his dying breath to walk towards the sunrise until they reach the mythical new homeland, a place where they would never be lost again. The child's grip did not falter, the pain of loss too providential in his hands. The boy prayed for God to deliver them from evil, for a world where they never had to suffer.\n\nAs his son begged for the Lord's mercy, he remembered the vision he saw, and he decided that nothing could have ever made him give up his only son. Weakly, he murmured his last words. "If I were God, Jakob... I'd make the world just so and no different... so I have you. I've you." His voice drifted away from the world with his soul. The child held his cold, motionless hand until the smoke cleared and the tolling of Saint Florian's bells rang across the ruin. Jakob Omyła reached into his father's uniform, unpinned the emblem of the Kotwica from the leather jacket, and placed it in his pocket before he turned around, away from the sunset, and began to make his way along the long road home."

Out of the ashes of Iberia, however, rises something polarizing in Europe, dreaded in America and Japan, and reluctantly accepted on the peninsula itself- the División Azul, now the Frente Azul, have won a decisive victory and now lay claim to all of the Union's former territories.\n\nThe Frente Azul, being the radical wing of the fascist Falangists, have close ties to the Reich- having fought alongside the Wehrmacht in the 40's, their loyalties to National Socialism have never truly faded away. Instead, they bode their time, waited to strike, and have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. This, too, has presented us with an unprecedented opportunity- the opportunity to accept the Frente Azul into the Einheitspakt, expanding our reach to the shores of the Mediterranean.\n\nOn paper, this seems to be a no brainer, but reports of massive brutality, governmental instability, and a deep air of resentment among the Iberian populace seems to warn of a quagmire on the level of South Africa and Indonesia- and we know from recent experience that wars in Iberia can drag on for years. Such tremors have been enough to scare some of our high-ranking officials away from the offer, but others claim that the benefits of access to the Mediterranean are simply too good to ignore.

Grandiose Baroque halls, constructed by homesick architects, dominate the dying light of the skyline. The park itself? A mishmash of weeds, sickly yellow grass and palm trees dotted around the area in a seemingly random fashion. There's a pond, but neither bird nor fish dares to disturb its dark, placid waters.\n\n"Make it quick. Think I'm on lunch break." another man sits down next to our protagonist.
