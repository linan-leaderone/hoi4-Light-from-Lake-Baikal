 ## Leader Descs ##

 POLITICS_ION_MIHAILACHE_DESC: "Ion Mihalache, father of peasantism in Romania and a founder of the PNT, is one of those rare politicians that has threaded a political needle: though more left-wing than most of his party, he commands the respect both of that party—the PNT—and the entire Romanian nation. Politicians disregard him at their peril.\n\nFifty years ago Mihalache's career began in education. Beloved among his fellow teachers and the local clergy in his rural home region, he parlayed that popularity into a political association that emerged from Northern Muntenia to gain national appeal.\n\nA perennial advocate for reform to benefit peasants and farmers, he survived the vicissitudes of dictatorship and war to become the most successful politician in Romania after Antonescu's hold at last failed. Presiding over the PNT's obtaining the largest majority in parliament in 32 years at the 1960 elections and uniting the left-wing of the PNT back into the party, he now leads a majority government with PSD backing.\n\nBut the hour is late, and Mihalache has begun to feel the age that everyone else has long seen. His hope these days is that whoever takes over from him can capitalise on what he has left behind for Romania and its people."

 ## Ministers ##

 ROM_Nicolae_Penescu_hog_desc: "§YVice President of the Council of Ministers\nAgrarianism§!\n--------------\n§LNicolae Penescu is a veteran agrarianist, in the spotlight ever since Mihai Antonescu legalized party politics in 1952. First becoming secretary general of the PNT, he would become a cabinet favorite of the Maniu, Pop, and Coposu premierships as Minister of Internal Affairs, eventually ascending to deputy of the council of ministers in 1958.\n\nNowadays, Penescu is a name whispered with reverence by PNT men. He serves the crucial role of Mihalache's second-in-command within the party, the prime representative of the centrist faction's needs and wants within the government. It is here where Penescu upholds the balance of the PNT/PSD Coalition with his utmost vigour."
 ROM_Viorel_V_Tilea_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nAgrarianism§!\n--------------\n§LViorel V. Tilea is a grandmaster of diplomacy. After having impressed his superiors following his conduct representing his nation at the Paris Peace Conference, he was made an attache of the Romanian legation in London. Disgusted by the National Legionary State's formation, he resigned and requested political asylum in Britain.\n\nTilea soon became one of the leaders of a makeshift group of PNT exiles until he handed his place over to Ion Ratiu. After Operation Sealion, he evacuated to Canada, staying in exile until he could return to Romania after Antonescu's regime fell in 1956. Since then, he has been considered an almost permanent foreign minister, serving consistently since the Maniu cabinet."
 ROM_Gheorghe_Zane_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nLeft-Wing Agrarianism§!\n--------------\n§LTo those in the know within the PNT, Gheorghe Zane was a clear pick for such an important cabinet position. The economist and historian rose from poverty in turn-of-the-century Galati to a flagship academic for Romania's political economy and financial literature. It was with these credentials that his appeal to the PNT's concerns over economic rationalism proved to be a winning forumla.\n\nThis impressive background made his rise through the PNT very swift following his entry into politics, a rise only assisted by Corneliu Coposu's fondness for him. Now, Zane stands as one of the main flagbearers of the PNT's left wing, a figure of powerful influence when it comes to policy-making but also one with a willingness to compromise, making him a popular bipartisan figure."
 ROM_Corneliu_Coposu_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Internal Affairs\nChristian Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LA law student, a journalist, a boxer and an apt pupil of PNT party founder Iuliu Maniu, Corneliu Coposu is truly a man who could do anything. All he desired for was to act as a mechanic for PNT's political machine, first as a coordinator, now as second-in-line to the party presidency.\n\nDuring the party conference which ultimately decided on Mihailache's candidacy, Coposu presided as interim President of the Council of Ministers throughout the entire sequence of events. A calculating man, his politics may be compromising but his morals have certaily not yet been as tainted. For someone who has spend the past decade in the political limelight, it is ultimately ironic that now he seeks only to retreat back into the shadows once more. Should the office of President of the Council of Ministers once again beg his name, Coposu shall not answer its call this time around."

 ### Ideas ###

 ROM_Scars_Of_Vienna: "Scars of Vienna"
 ROM_Scars_Of_Vienna_desc: "All patriotic Romanians regard Northern Transylvania as a phantom limb torn apart from Romania's body after the arbitrary Vienna Diktat. It is a claim given pride of place in the Romanian constitution. It is a land where nationalists lie in wait to strike the final blow to the Hungarian beast that occupies their land. Mihai Antonescu failed to retake it during his calamitous and short reign, the duty now rests with his successors to heal their nation's scar."

 ROM_Ghosts_Of_The_Past: "Ghosts of the Past"
 ROM_Ghosts_Of_The_Past_desc: "The democracy of today strives to new heights Romanians have never seen before, but it does so despite, and not because of Ion Antonescu's dictatorship. His regime has burdened governments with a consistent record of domestic failures. These range from the unfinished Danube-Black Sea canal currently blemishing the landscape to a collapsing agrarian situation coupled with a vast increase in power to the country's elite. Today's agenda continues to linger in second place to yesterday's mistakes."

 ROM_Antonescus_Territorial_Remnant: "Antonescu's Territorial Remnant"
 ROM_Antonescus_Territorial_Remnant_desc: "Antonescu's grand conquest, the Holy Grail received as a reward from Romania's World War Two adventures is, in reality, a poisoned chalice. The Transnistrian territory is bound to the Tighina Accords, an agreement that currently sees Romania pour money and military into it for paltry benefits and little ability to change the status quo. This has led to ire towards the Bucharest government from the settler population of Dniester Hills for their inaction and inability to deal with any of these issues."
 ROM_Transnistria_Burden_tt: "§R"The Romanian people will never consent to the continuation of the struggle beyond our national borders".§! - §YDinu Brătianu§! and §YIuliu Maniu§!"

 ROM_Michael_The_Brave: "Michael the Brave"
 ROM_Michael_The_Brave_desc: "In Romanian society, no one is as universally beloved as King Michael. Ever since his critical role in the sabotage of Brătianu's premiership and the restoration of the 1923 constitution and free elections, he is looked towards as the mantle bearer of democracy and regarded as an integral part of the nation. This has led the king to bear not only his crown, but also the critical responsibility of keeping Romania's freedom alive and safe from the tyranny at its doorstep."

 ROM_King_And_Pawn: "King and Pawn"
 ROM_King_And_Pawn_desc: "Romania secured its place on the winning side of World War Two and has reaped the benefits, it now endures the long winter of its detriments. Extensive German ties have alienated any potential trading partners outside of the Pakt's sphere. This has led to an almost total economic domination of Romania by Germany. Romania has become nothing but a pawn for its king, a king that consistently contradicts the democratic ideology it champions."

 ## World Events ##

 ROM_WORLD.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Transnistria War"
 ROM_WORLD.1.desc: "The chaotic collapse of Reichskommisariat Ukraine into civil war has had ripples across Europe, but none have been felt as much as the turmoil currently taking place in Romania. A new wave of guerillas from Ukraine have spilled into the Transnistria region, restarting the previously inactive insurgency and causing a dramatic rise in violence within the territory.\n\nReports suggest that the insurgents have flooded into the Odesa catacombs, using them to launch surprise attacks on the city itself. This has resulted in a constant stream of bombings targeting multiple buildings and officials, leading to an outpour of chaos in both Odesa and the countryside at large. Newly appointed President of the Council of Ministers Nicolae Penescu has promised a resolution to the increasing levels of disorder but has not offered further details as to how."
 ROM_WORLD.1.a: "The folly of the Antonescus shall be their legacy."

 ROM_WORLD.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Odesa Hostage Crisis"
 ROM_WORLD.2.desc: "Shocking news today from Odesa as guerillas from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army have seized control of a local VoMi office, taking the occupants inside as hostages. The office is the headquarters of Area Command XXV of the Sonderkommando R, the group responsible for managing the interests of the Black Sea Germans residing within the Transnistria Governorate, which has also previously attracted anger from the neglected local Ukrainian population.\n\nIn the wake of this situation, President of the Council of Ministers Penescu has announced a rescue operation with support from Germany to neutralize the terrorists and safely resolve the crisis. Furthermore, the mayor of Odesa, Gherman Pântea, has announced a state of emergency in the city, taking effect immediately. Germania could not be reached for comment."
 ROM_WORLD.2.a: "Troubled news from a broken land..."

 ROM_WORLD.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Penescu Bombed, Coposu Appointed PCM"
 ROM_WORLD.3.desc: "The hostage crisis in Odesa that has dominated Romanian politics in the last few weeks has succeeded after the neutralization of the Ukrainian insurgents and the rescue of the hostages. Sadly, this victory was shortlived following the bombing of the Council of Ministers, an attack that has taken the life of President of the Council of Ministers Penescu. The Prydnistrov'ye section of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army has claimed responsibility for the bombing, leading many to suspect it was done in retaliation for the rescue operation.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombing, an emergency sitting of the Council has led to Corneliu Coposu being appointed by King Michael as interim president of the Council of Ministers until new elections can be held. For Transnistria, the territory has been placed under military rule by General Grigori Bastan for the foreseeable future."
 ROM_WORLD.3.a: "First triumph, then tragedy."

 ROM_WORLD.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Penescu Resigns, Peasantists in Disgrace"
 ROM_WORLD.4.desc: "The hostage crisis in Odesa that has dominated Romanian politics in the last few weeks has ended in disaster following the slaughter of both the hostages and the Ukrainian insurgents. To make matters worse, a scandal labeled by local press as the "Tiraspol Affair" has broken out involving President of the Council of Ministers Penescu after he was found to have employed agitator Nichita Smochina to doctor justifications for Romania staying in Transnistria, scuttling any chance he had left of continuing his premiership.\n\nPenescu has already tendered his resignation to King Michael. In the meantime, Corneliu Coposu has been appointed in the interim as president of the Council of Ministers until elections can be held, elections that the PNL is widely predicted to win. For Transnistria, the territory has been placed under military rule by General Grigori Bastan for the foreseeable future.\n"
 ROM_WORLD.4.a: "Romania's political scene has been turned upside down overnight."

 ROM_WORLD.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Referendum in Transnistria"
 ROM_WORLD.5.desc: "Following the calming of the deadly Transnistrian conflict, the Bucharest government has announced a series of referendums in parts of the troubled territory on whether or not parts of the area will be annexed into Romania. These votes will be held in the five counties of the Dniester Valley, which contains the Moldovan majority areas of Ananiev, Rîbnita, Ovidiopol, Tiraspol, and Dubăsari.\n\nMost international observers believe that the referenda will easily pass with a majority, calming the tensions of the settler population within the regions. For the rest of the former governorate, the Romanian government has announced plans to transition it to native rule as soon as possible under the banner of the Pridnestrovian Republic."
 ROM_WORLD.5.a: "A part of Ukraine will still survive somewhere."

 ROM_WORLD.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Romania Abandons Transnistria"
 ROM_WORLD.6.desc: "Official communiques from Bucharest have confirmed what most have suspected for a while as the Romanian government has announced its evacuation of the Transnistrian territory. International observers have diagnosed the cause of this as the result of a brutal and unending insurgency within the region and the ascension of Radu Câmpeanu as Prime Minister, a result widely believed to have been the cause of student protests triggered by the conflict.\n\nThe future of the former governorate is that of further Reich control as Romania transfers its responsibilities to the German administration, ruled under the apathetic control of military man Siegfried Haß."
 ROM_WORLD.6.a: "Antonescu's remnant, abandoned."

 ROM_WORLD.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Emergency in North Transylvania"
 ROM_WORLD.7.desc: "Hungarian diplomats have internationally condemned Romania after issuing blistering accusations that hold them responsible for restarting a new wave of guerilla attacks in northern Transylvania. These reports have been verified by most credible experts, who have given evidence showing Romanian arms being smuggled to nationalist insurgents within Hungary's borders.\n\nBucharest has denied these accusations but has expressed sympathy toward the "Romanians trapped within the clutches of a foreign land" inflaming the tense situation further. Germania has issued statements asking for peace and European unity, but many international observers believe that confrontation is only inevitable in the future."
 ROM_WORLD.7.a: "The Pakt is bleeding..."

 ROM_WORLD.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Referendum in Transnistria"
 ROM_WORLD.8.desc: "Following the calming of the deadly Transnistrian conflict, the Bucharest government has announced a series of referendums in parts of the troubled territory on whether or not parts of the area will be annexed into Romania. These votes will be held in the five counties of the Dniester Valley, which contains the Moldovan majority areas of Ananiev, Rîbnita, Ovidiopol, Tiraspol, and Dubăsari alongside the city of Odesa.\n\nMost international observers believe that the referenda will easily pass with a majority, except in Odesa, where critics believe that only extensive electoral fraud can allow Bucharest its desired result. For the rest of the former governorate, the Romanian government has announced plans to transition it to a native ruled administration as soon as possible." #Rîbnița's ț not yet supported by font
