Sound, tested models of administration and investment would unlock the economic potential of Africa! The Indian and South Atlantic Oceans would be secured for the Free World!\n\nLike many foreign conquerors before them, they soon found their ambitions dashed. Their leadership found itself overwhelmed trying to make sense of the disparate tribes, factions and groupings and struggled just to maintain the status quo. Investments dried up as delays, red tape and petty corruption made a mockery of investment models and profit projections. Generals and politicians alike watched with horror as patrol after patrol failed to make it back to their bases.\n\nThe cumulative weight of all these setbacks have proven too much to bear for the Mandates and their masters, and they are now cutting their losses and leaving the territories."

 #New Nixon Events
 USA.ct.1.t: "Cracking Fortress Europe"
 USA.ct.1.desc: "President Nixon stared at the world map projected onto a screen in the White House briefing room. At the center was America, encircled, facing the Japanese and their colonial minions to the West and the Germans and their slave empire to the East.\n\nBut where the Japanese and the Americans had only recently escaped Armageddon's embrace in the Aleutians, the Nazi empire was fraying at its seams. Hitler grew older and more infirm by the day; no amount of clever camera work and pre-recorded speeches could hide his creaking gait, his once-mesmerising oratory shrunken into senile rambling. Germany's moon landing was not a triumph - it was an epitaph.\n\nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird looked up from the latest CIA intelligence brief on the German Reich. "It's a house of cards, [GetPresidentHonorific] President. Britain chafes under a foreign occupier, the French government can't keep the country together, and the Norwegians continue to resist decades of occupation. And their African colonies will wither on the vine without support."\n\n"All held together by a man who can't finish a sentence without forgetting how it started," Nixon noted.\n\n"When Hitler goes, his successors will fall over themselves to split the spoils, like Alexander's generals did in antiquity." Laird handed over a sheaf of documents from the CIA folder. "It's the opportunity of a lifetime. We'll never get another shot at crippling the Nazis like this.""
 USA.ct.1.a: "It's time to go back to the Old World."
 USA.ct.2.t: "The South African Tango"
 USA.ct.2.desc: "Secretary of State William Rogers was well familiar with the steps of the 'South African Tango'. The South African ambassador would ask in vague generalities about admission into the OFN, but without any real plans for common defense or tariff liberalization. The Secretary would, in turn, respond with vague updates on South Africa's application, now nearly a decade old.\n\nIt suited both parties; the South Africans wanted the threat of OFN membership to cow the Germans, and the OFN needed to preserve the last democracy in Africa. Neither, however, wanted a German intervention, which OFN membership could provoke. Thus, the South African Tango continued on, without end.\n\n"How can I help you today, Ambassador?" Roger struck a neutral tone to hide his boredom; he was near-certain that the response would be entirely predictable. "We're doing very well, and about that OFN application" would be the usual response --\n\n"The Germans are making their move." Ambassador Willem Christiaan Naude declared. "Hertzog's Boer nationalists are talking to the Germans. South Africa is in danger, and we need America's help."\n\nThat got Roger's attention, as his stomach dropped at this most unexpected turn in the decade-long discourse. "What kind of help are we talking about?"\n\n"Financial, intelligence, but above all, military." Naude said firmly. "If the Boers and Germans want a fight, we won't make it easy for them.""
 USA.ct.2.a: "No more dancing, no more games."
 USA.ct.3.t: "Memorandum - Situation in South Africa"
 USA.ct.3.desc: "CLASSIFICATION: SECRET\n\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY | DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nSubject: South African Political Assessment\n\nThe question of the vacant monarchy in South Africa symbolizes the political tensions pulling the nation between the German Reich and the remainder of the Free World. The upcoming referendum has inflamed these divisions, with the pro-German and Boer-led National Party, led by Albert Hertzog, arguing to abolish the monarchy against the status-quo United Party of PM De Viliers Graaff.\n\nWith reports of German weaponry flooding Bloemfontein and with political violence escalating (see Memorandum - Assassination of B.J. Vorster), CIA assets report widespread concern in Cape Town that the referendum is cover for a declaration of Boer independence. This would rob South Africa of much of its strategic depth and provide a pretext for German intervention to support its new client state.\n\nSimultaneously, protests by the African National Congress (ANC) against widespread discrimination continue to roil the nation. The movement continues to gather strength despite the incarceration of much of the ANC's executive leadership, and moderates are increasingly being sidelined by militant radicals.\n\nThe center, it seems, cannot hold much longer."

 RD_D_compromise_b_103: "We won't fall on our swords for Nixon's sake!"
 RD_D_compromise_desc_103: "Some days, Vice-President John F. Kennedy hated his job. It wasn't just because President Nixon was a mercurial, ornery bastard. No, it was because sometimes Nixon would saddle Kennedy with the dirty work - to risk his reputation to save the President's. Now, not a year after talking the Japanese down, the President wanted to bankroll the Nazis ('but only the nice ones'), and Kennedy would talk the coalition into supporting it.\n\nAs expected, Wallace F. Bennett and Al Gore Sr. both stared at Kennedy like he'd grown a second head.\n\n"Jesus, Jack!" Gore finally exclaimed. "How can you be okay with this?"\n\n"The President sure has it out for you after Hawaii," Bennett remarked. "But we're still being dragged down over losing the war. If this goes public, we'll be wiped out politically."\n\nThe comments stung deeply, but Kennedy made his pitch regardless. "Germany's rotting from the inside. We put Speer in power, and Germany will be in chaos as the various cliques fight him tooth and nail. We're doing this to end Germany, not help it!"\n\nAfter a long silence, Bennett spoke. "Even if you convince us, what about the rest of the coalition? We could be looking at another set of defections to the NPP. Can we afford that?""

 RD_R_compromise_desc_103: "An uncomfortable silence settled in the Oval Office as soon as Nixon outlined his plan to covertly support Albert Speer in the impending succession crisis in Germany. William Scranton and Nelson Rockefeller looked at each other worriedly.\n\n"Let me get this straight," Rockefeller said incredulously. "You want to use taxpayer money to covertly support a leading figure in the Nazi Party? Not the British resistance, or the Russian warlords, but the Nazis?"\n\n"When Nelson puts it that way, it sounds like you're losing your marbles, Richard." Scranton drawled.\n\n"Just listen, damnit!" Nixon growled. "Speer's the only candidate to succeed Hitler who's even remotely inclined to talk to us. We get him into office, we can string Germany along with promises of lifting the embargo, so we can focus on Japan. His student radicals will keep Speer too busy to cause trouble. This isn't a threat; it's an opportunity."\n\nAnother worried silence. "If you really want this to happen, we can get the caucus to fall in line." Scranton finally said. "But it'll be a helluva fight getting everyone to agree to this. Hell, you might have people jump ship like Margaret Chase Smith did.""

 # Impeachment Nixon
 USA_MAD_impeach.1.t: "Tabloid Press"
 USA_MAD_impeach.1.desc: "Joe's office was a relatively small one, especially for someone who worked in the state department, though he liked it all the same. What he did not like was people barging into his office, both for sake of professionalism and because when they did the door nearly scraped the front end of his desk. Unfortunately, today would not be as calm a day as Joe would have liked, the door slamming against the wall as his superior, Andy, tramped into his office, slamming a tabloid onto his desk, "JAPANESE AGENTS TEACH ANTI-OFN REBELS WITH AMERICAN EQUIPMENT!" it read, with a photo printed into the top right of a training camp and crates clearly labeled with a hand and torch. Joe just looked up at Andy's fuming face and grimaced.\n\n"Afternoon, Andy, why is this my problem?" Joe asked, placing his pen against the paper he'd been signing.\n\n"Your job is to keep this secret. What the fuck happened?!" Andy pushed the cheap paper and ink across the table, right in front of Joe. After picking up the paper and reading for a moment, Joe held the paper so Andy could see it.\n\n"First of all; this is page five. Not front page news. Second-" Joe flashed the cover to Andy, "-this is not The New Yorker, this is not The Washington Post. This is the Albuquerque Daily. How'd you even find this? Third of all-" Joe turned back to the photo in question, "-this could be anything. The Japanese took a captured Malayan supply drop and sent it to their friends. They leaked a doctored photo to some no-name paper so they spread propaganda. We can spin this basically any way we want to, because they have nothing against us." Joe finished, only calming Andy slightly.\n\n"Joe, this happens again, we might not be so lucky. We've gotta decrease support to Madagascar." Andy said, halfheartedly. Joe sighed.\n\n"A nice idea, Andy, but that's not my call. I hide what gets out, but the more we send, the harder that'll be.""
 USA_MAD_impeach.1.a: "Let's try to keep this quiet."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.2.t: "Father and Daughter"
 USA_MAD_impeach.2.desc: "He was having a bad day, that much was clear. Despite the president's attempt at a jovial wave and the presence of his fourteen-year-old daughter gripping his hand, Nixon walked to the end of the White House Drive like a beast approaching prey. He looked at the reporters there. "How are you fellows doing? I was just taking, uh, Tricia here for a little stroll."\n\n"Mr. President, Theodore White, Time Magazine. Do you have any comment at all on story recently reported in the Albuquerque Daily on US weapons arming Japanese soldiers in Madagascar?"\n\nTricia attempted to hide behind her father, only to be pulled back in front with a small but perceptible yank. "Oh, well, you know. I can't really comment on matters of national security, especially with the little ones around." He gave a forced laugh.\n\n"The photos, though—?"\n\n"Photos. Photos. You know, there's a great deal of photos taken all the time. Some of them doctored. Nasty stuff." There was the flash of a camera. The president shifted to holding his daughter by the shoulders, appearing for a moment like a gargoyle perched over her. "I just want to encourage members of Congress and, uh, the media to avoid the kind of shrill, irresponsible rhetoric that might damage our national security. We'll get to the bottom of this, but through existing processes."\n\nAnother voice rose from the crowd. "What processes?"\n\nNixon gave a taut smile. "Well, just before I came out I ordered a meeting of the National Security Council and told my Secretary of State to call a special meeting of the OFN. You better believe I'm working to get to the bottom of this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think Tricia and I should return to our walk.""
 USA_MAD_impeach.2.a: "The reporters continued shouting as the president dragged his daughter across the lawn."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.3.t: "Crude"
 USA_MAD_impeach.3.desc: "The jungles of Madagascar buzzed with life around the German compound, isolated as it was; with nothing more than a wood cabin and three posts with a man attached to each in the yard outside, the outpost was spartan, but not useless to the Germans. Of all three men, Steven the contact was whining the loudest, and the most.\n\n"Fuck, man! We're not even supposed to be here, and we get caught! What are we supposed to fucking do-?"\n\nThe trio were each tied to a lashing post, though there were only two guards present- the third had driven off to fetch reinforcements to deal with such special "guests". Carol, the eldest of the three, an operative for the CIA since long before Steven was even born, sat gagged and bound in the heavy jungle heat. He could handle the heat, the bugs, even the gunshot wound burning away at his shoulder. What hurt him most was that he could not tell Steven to shut the fuck up. John, the local expert whinged at Steven's complaining.\n\n"Christ, man, you think your crying's gonna fix this? Because it won't. I'll bet they'll trade us back to the States in no time, that's what always happens to guys like us. Right, Carol?" John asked. He knew the answer was a no, yet he nonetheless hoped any offered solution might give his ears a rest."
 USA_MAD_impeach.3.a: "Relief for them, not the State Department."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.4.t: "Swarmed"
 USA_MAD_impeach.4.desc: "He'd done the best he could, thought White House Press Secretary Herb Klein glumly. For weeks he'd managed to keep the whole Madagascar business out of the national press through a combination of promises, threats, and stalling tactics. He'd told the San Francisco Chronicle that they'd be barred from the White House Press Corps and begged the New York Times for two weeks to preserve national security. Finally, though, the Washington Post had broken. There were pictures of American soldiers in handcuffs on the front page. The president had reamed into him for it and demanded a press conference to control the narrative.\n\n"Alright, alright," said the pale-faced Klein before swarming reporters. Let's all just settle down and—."\n\nThere was a buzzing of voices from the crowd. A mass of limbs held out microphones and recording equipment. Lights flashed within their bulbs, appearing like the eyes of some terrible insect.\n\n"I have a statement! I have a statement from the president if you'll all just settle down and be decent! Please!"\n\nThere was more buzzing but, slowly, the voices began to dissipate.\n\n"Thank you," he said when the room had regained composure. "President Nixon wishes to emphasize that his first priority, as always, is to ensure that all Americans are safe. While he cannot comment on matters of national security, his current focus is on getting back these boys safely. In the meanwhile, we urge the media not to use these men's status as political ammunition. The president is deeply concerned by irresponsible and reckless reporting and the great amount of speculation that he has seen in place of traditional journalism," There was a rumble of outrage. Klein began talking faster. "Once these men are home and safe, we can begin the long and hard process of figuring out how they got there. Until then, the president has no further statements.""
 USA_MAD_impeach.4.a: "Klein then fled from the crowd like a man fleeing a swarm of angry bees."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.5.t: "The Most Mundane Hunt"
 USA_MAD_impeach.5.desc: ""The one time the fat bastard goes for a walk." Joe muttered to himself. Nearly running down the hallways of the State Department HQ, Joe was reminded of the feeling he would often endure when searching for his brothers at the bar to bring them home for the night in a childhood long past. Even now, he mused, Joe was forced to search through small groups of gathered hunched reprobates or depressed shambling boozers to find someone to save from the groups- only this time, he did so because he cared for the man, and not because he had to.\n\nThe crowds of men and some women were all huddled around lists of names kept in ad-hoc lists around the office. That afternoon, dozens of State Department employees were marched out of their offices or cubicles, and given 10 minutes to pack up what amounted to occasionally decades worth of careers. Needless to say, when word had gotten out, lists of the -effectively- deceased were drawn up by the secretaries who had made note of those who were led out. Joe had been yelling out to find Andy somewhere in the throngs of people on their lunch breaks, trying to uncover which of their coworkers were now gone with the wind. "Over here, Joe!" Someone yelled in the biggest crowd. Pushing forward to the center, Joe began to hear the man who had called on him over the other conversations,\n\n"...not scheduled, these firings don't just happen! Kennedy, that piece of shit... tragic, goddamned- Joe!" the voice called out, "Mr. Abignale! Get over here!" Joe began to cut through the crowd to the voice. Upon inching closer, Joe realized it was one of his subordinates, naturally a luckier one, who was calling to him.\n\n"Mr. Abignale, I just wanna say I'm sorry, I know you and Andy were close, this just cuts too deep," he said with a look of genuine sadness. Immediately Joe realized what had happened."
 USA_MAD_impeach.5.a: "Another casualty of cleaning one's hands."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.6.t: "Definitely Not Tabloid News"
 USA_MAD_impeach.6.desc: ""...As such, the fundamental processes of governance were disregarded, and the rule of law was subverted..." the paper read. Joe's work life had become immensely hectic, almost to the point of absurdity, and his private life had begun to reflect that. Sitting at home, enjoying a solitary moment of calm away from work and with his family, Joe had taken the time to read his copy of The Washington Post. Even away from work, Joe could not escape it. With a defeated sigh, Joe walked to his landline and dialed Andy's personal number. "This is Andy," the voice on the line muttered, "if this is another journalist, I'm hanging up." Joe felt a pang of guilt. Andy had spoken a whole sentence without cussing- the man must have been truly defeated.\n\n"Andy, it's Joe. I'm calling to say I'm sorry."\n\nThe line stayed silent awhile. Joe hadn't thought of anything to say, and Andy wasn't sure how to respond.\n\n"Thanks," Andy said, "but this still cost me my fucking job. Do you still have that Washington Post subscription, Joe?" Joe grunted to the affirmative. "And what did you tell me this wouldn't be, Joe?" Andy half-asked.\n\nJoe sighed. "It wouldn't be on the front page of the Washington Post. And it is."\n\nAndy let out a light chuckle. "I know it wasn't really your fault- nobody could cover up all that, even with the team we had. Still, thanks for humoring me."\n\n"Anytime, Andy- this is a shitshow, isn't it? Americans giving cash to the Japanese-? I know that there was a lot more than that, but..."\n\n"Since when would The Post give us a break?" Andy finished. The two men chuckled at the joke, one-part serious, another part sad that it was over for at least half of them."

 USA_MAD_impeach.7.t: "The Nightly News"
 USA_MAD_impeach.7.desc: "The situation had deteriorated, thought White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In the course of a few weeks, the story on Madagascar had gone from the back pages of third-rate newspapers to the International section in major papers to the nightly news. Haldeman stared at the back of his boss's head as Cronkite intoned on allegations of illegal shipments.\n\n"This isn't good, Bob," said the president. "The press will fuck me for this. They'll bend me over a table and fuck me like an old whore."\n\nHaldeman waited in silence. Nixon changed the channel to ABC and grunted approvingly at a story on protests in Quebec.\n\n"At least Cochran's still giving us a good shake."\n\nThe broadcast continued. Nixon changed the channel again. A blonde woman presented dish soap to the camera.\n\n"Sir, do you want me to tell Klein to make another statement?"\n\nThe president waved a hand dismissively. "No, no, the bastard would find some way to put his foot in his mouth. I don't need to clean up any more messes." The screen flashed to the smiling face of a young girl. "Get...Safire. Tell him I want to make a speech in the morning. We'll say the allegations are troubling, that we support a full nonpartisan FBI probe to get the people answers. Maybe mention my work on the whole Hiss thing and how that will be a picnic in comparison. Some stupid bullshit like that."\n\n"Of course, Mr. President.

 USA_MAD_impeach.8.desc: "When he'd first arrived in the United States House of Representatives almost two years ago, Nationalist Party Representative John B. Anderson had talked a lot about integrity. While so many men in Illinois were willing to sacrifice their principles to the Democratic machines that controlled the state, Anderson had vowed to remain true, to remain decent, to remain honest. He would speak truth to the powerful.\n\nWhich is why he now found himself huddled in the backroom of a restaurant on the outskirts of DC, surrounded by a ragtag group of young congressmen from all across the political spectrum.\n\n"So," he said lamely, "Nixon."\n\n"Nixon indeed," said Democratic Congressman Mo Udall. Even sitting, he towered over the other representatives. "I know we all have our disagreements, but I think we can all agree that what's emerged from Madagascar is a disgrace. American dollars are financing the same men who attacked us at Pearl Harbor."\n\nThere was a murmuring of angry voices.\n\n"Mo's right," said Anderson. "What we need now is action. Real action. No empty speeches. No censures. Real action." He looked conspiratorially around the room, aware of the magnitude of what he was about to say. "We may even need to start drafting Articles of Impeachment."\n\nMore murmuring. Udall cast his unlikely allies a look. "Most of us here are freshmen representatives, men with junior positions on our committees, but even that is enough to start moving things forward. If we can build a movement in Congress, if we can make the outcry loud enough, we can force an investigation and get rid of the most crooked president in our nation's history.""

In addition to his personal testimony, the committee compelled him to provide documents, logs, records, memoranda, correspondence, news summaries... The list went on. They even wanted his personal meeting diary.\n\nRogers blanched. His eyes fell onto the final lines.\n\n"Hereof fail not, as you will answer your default under the pains and penalties in such cases made and provided."\n\nHe got up and moved toward the dark window. It had taken weeks, but Congress's patience with the Administration had finally run out. The Committee on Foreign Relations was going to have the Sergeant-at-Arms detain him if he did not appear. It would go through all his files and refer the Justice Department to pursue criminal charges. Nixon would demand noncompliance, would demand that he stall, but what good would that do? Was he really willing to risk his legacy for a man like Richard Nixon?\n\nRogers stared out into the black.

Rogers resigned as Secretary of State today following testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in which he confessed to "unintentionally misleading" the body about the illicit selling of arms to finance Japanese and Malagasy forces.\n\nThe development, capping weeks of denial by the State Department, represents a stunning downfall for a man once talked about as a potential presidential candidate. The confession shocked his closest associates and has precipitated one of the largest crises in Washington since the end of the War.\n\n"I have informed the president of my intention to resign my office, effective immediately," Mr. Rogers declared in his opening remarks. "I wish to comply fully with the Congress in their efforts to investigate allegations of misconduct in Madagascar."\n\nOver the next two hours, senators from both coalitions pushed the former secretary about his conduct and the extent to which President Nixon was aware of either the arms deals or cover-up. While professing his own innocence in the affair, Rogers alluded to members of the White House staff involved in devising the "blueprints and plans concerning the scandal."\n\nHis remarks are likely to increase pressure on the White House to testify and further embolden those members of Congress who have advocated for the impeachment of the president.\n\nWhile no statement from the White House was available at time of publication, a source from within the White House indicated that the president had hired New York attorney John N.

 USA_MAD_impeach.11.desc: "Democratic Representative Mo Udall made a signal to House Judiciary Chairman Chauncey Reed, aware, as he did so, of the eyes of the entire room upon him. He adjusted his tie to look respectable before he detonated the explosive resolution.\n\nThe old man sighed. "The gentleman will state his motion."\n\n"Mr. Chairman, I move to introduce House Resolution 843."\n\nThe Chair paused, as if he could stop the future by simply refusing to speak. Then, reality returned. In a miserable voice, he spoke, "The clerk will report the resolution."\n\n"House Resolution 843, impeaching Richard Nixon, President of the United States for high crimes and misdemeanors in the House of Representatives, [getDateText]. Mr. Udall submitted the following resolution, which was referred..."\n\nThe clerk droned on. Over the next few days, Establishment leaders would raise objections and force protest votes. Udall was sure there would be speeches to delay the proceedings or to beg members to abandon this course of action. There would be attempts to cajole Representative Udall's activist cabal with more hearings, with backroom promises for senior appointments in the RDC. There would be fiery threats from the White House, threatening to end his career and have him blacklisted.\n\nBut he didn't care. The wheels of history were turning and Udall had done his math. He knew there were enough members on the Judiciary Committee willing to move the resolution forward. Plus, he had one piece of information that no one else had yet, that would make impeachment seem like an inevitability, a necessity:"
 USA_MAD_impeach.11.a: "His brother, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, had resigned in protest one hour ago."
 
 USA_MAD_impeach.12.t: "Floor Vote"
 USA_MAD_impeach.12.desc: "Speaker of the House John McCormack looked and felt like death as he stared down from the rostrum at the assembled body. For days, there had been debate in the Judiciary Committee over Articles of Impeachment for Richard Nixon. When the committee had finally voted to move the measure forward to the full chamber, it had fallen on him to find some way of dealing with the vote in a fair and even-handed way. His decision to privately tell RDC representatives to "vote their conscience" had led to angry, late-night calls from the president. His decision to allow a full floor debate before that vote had led Udall and the rest of his freshman cabal to accuse McCormack of delaying, of defending a failing status quo.\n\nStill, he was determined to be fair. He was determined to handle the second impeachment vote in American history with grace and dignity. He was determined not to let himself be flattened by the terrible weight of history. As Udall finished his fiery final statement, the Speaker nodded to the clerk.\n\n"All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 843, the previous question is ordered on the resolution as amended. The question is on adoption. The question of adoption of the resolution as amended shall be divided between the six articles: His approval and acquiescence in shipping arms without congressional approval; his approval and acquiescence in covert actions conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency..."\n\nIt went on. McCormack banged his gavel to signal the start of a fifteen-minute voting period and watched as members moved across the room. For once, there were no signs of party divisions among the NPP, who were all solidly united in favor of impeachment. Among his own members, though, he made a miserable note of deep factions emerging. Richard Nixon had left the once-stable RDC more divided than ever."

It's crazy! I can't trust anyone.\n\nJM: Now, Jack, let's hold on before you go on resigning.\n\nJK: No, no. The whole thing is falling apart here. Dick's barricaded himself in the Residence. This new Mitchell bastard is looking for leakers with an axe. Bobby's kept the press at bay so far, but I know if I stay here much longer they're going to start talking about me as "damaged goods" going into '64.\n\nJM: Listen, Jack, I hear you. I know you're frustrated, but we have to think about the here and now. The president is... not himself. I think he called me drunk last night after the impeachment vote. He's a cornered animal and, if he sees no way out, he might start making messes. We could wind up with tanks in DC if you leave and it looks like the Senate will convict.\n\nJK: Jesus Christ, that crazy bastard.\n\nJM: If you don't stay on, the cabinet will fall apart.

"You did nothing wrong. You have no reason to lie, especially not to protect a bastard like Nixon. Please..."\n\nThe vice president stared into the pattern in Bobby's carpet.\n\n"You think he'll lash out? Fine. Let him lash out. You think the Republicans will acquit him just so he can burn down the country? That's fine too. We can build something better out of the ashes." He bent at the waist, trying to catch his brother's gaze. "Don't do this. Don't let him take your integrity from you."\n\nBut Jack shook his head. "I can't, Bobby. I just can't. I wish I could but..." He trailed off. "I can't risk it. There's too much at stake."\n\nBobby cursed under his breath and kicked a trash can, which clattered across the room, spilling papers across the carpet. When he spoke again, his voice was full of bitterness and hurt. "You were supposed to be better than this."\n\nJack said nothing as Bobby stormed toward the door and slammed it behind him.

He did not look at the press packed into the gallery nor back into the eyes of his brother, Bobby, seated stone-faced behind him. Instead, he looked up at House impeachment manager Mo Udall.\n\n"Mr. Vice President, I think it's fair to say you've often been excluded from the decision-making processes in the Executive Office. Is that accurate?" Said Udall.\n\n"I would say that Dick and I have had our disagreements." Kennedy shrugged with a forced casualness. "But I find ways to keep myself in the loop."\n\nUdall raised an eyebrow. His glass eye gleamed in his skull. "Oh? And did you manage to keep yourself in the loop on the affairs in Madagascar?"\n\nVice President Kennedy did not give Udall the benefit of a pause or a break in eye contact."Yes, I did." His eyes bore into those of the impeachment manager. "Dick and I spoke on it at length. The president and his chief of staff can attest to my involvement in key decision-making."\n\n"And in your, uh, involvement in key decision-making, Jack," Udall dropped his name as if it were a curse. Beneath his lawyerly presentation, there was fury and disgust. "Did you witness President Nixon or any of his aides order the sale of arms or other resources to aid the Japanese military?"\n\n"No, Mo, I did not. The president expressed a great sympathy for the Malagasy people's fight for independence, but I did not witness anything that could be construed as an order to provide aid in violation of US law. If any decision was made, it occurred without the knowledge or consent of the president and myself.""

"Lyndon has kept quiet on the whole matter, but I do not believe he plans to let this impeachment affair come up for a full vote when the Senate comes back into session."\n\n"Thank you, Senator, we'll stay in touch," Nixon put down the phone, rubbing his temples. He turned to his chief of staff. "Haldeman, do you think we've put this damned thing behind us?"\n\n"I think so, Mr. President," came the reply. "We'll let the big networks run with the Vice President's testimony, take the pressure off the Senate to act. It's hard to say right now, but in a couple of weeks, this probably won't be anything more than a minor story."\n\n"All thanks to Kennedy," Nixon said bitterly. "That Harvard bastard, I know he's planning something. I want daily reports on what he's up to until we're sure he's not scheming with his brother to start a goddamn coup or something."\n\n"Yes, Mr. President.""

Haldeman listened to the roll call vote blasting through the Oval Office television. "Bible's a good sign. He'd been wavering."\n\n"No doubt afraid about the Kennedy brat being caught in the crossfire." The president slurred, gripping his glass of whiskey tight. "Disloyal bastard. He'll pay soon enough."\n\nThe broadcast went on. "Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating, not guilty. Mr. Kennedy?" There was a pause. "Mr. Kennedy?"\n\n"Choke on it." Nixon spat. He leaned toward the television, spilling his drunk onto the floor. Haldeman eyed the president warily. "Choke on it and die you fucking cocksucker."\n\n"Mr. Kennedy... not guilty. Mr. La Follette? Mr. La Follette, guilty. Mr. McGovern? Mr. McGovern, guilty..."\n\nThe president made a rude remark, but Haldeman was barely listening. Based on the votes so far, the president would avoid the two-thirds needed for removal. Even better, there was a good chance they'd saved the president from receiving a majority on any charge. The RDC had stayed together—if only barely.\n\n"Bastards, the lot of them," muttered Nixon.\n\nHaldeman pursed his lips. Impeachment would lose the president support, yes, but they could still pull '64 off. They could paint the opposition as pet radicals of Eastern liberalism, the darlings of the New York Times persecuting the president of the Silent Majority. All they needed was to avoid further scandal. All they needed was for the president to pull himself together..."

If they go through a town and one of their soldiers gets hit by a sniper, they line up the whole goddamned town and say, 'until you talk, you're all getting shot.' Obviously, we're not going to go that far. We're tolerant people, but something's got to be done about this window smashing and atmosphere of hatred. We've got to clean out the whole damn movement, really root out the troublemakers. It's the only way to stop the mobs and bring law and order back to America.

At least the country will get this nastiness out of its system. Then maybe it will settle down for five goddamn minutes.\n\nLook, we're not animals. Once we dump the poor, humiliated bastard from the ticket in '64, we'll propose our own civil rights bill. We'll find some compromise to tie the Coalition back together, some token reform that gets King and the Dixiecrats on the same side. That'll be a real goddamn achievement, not the half-measure Kennedy cooked up."

Along its length rose a string of watchtowers, seawalls, and concertina wire, their seams held together by trillions of Reichsmarks and the Führer's Aryan will. This stranglehold over the Old World goes by deceptive names like the Einheitspakt and Fortress Europa. The Free World calls it for what it is: a Steel Curtain.\n\nThe Volkshalle would have one believe that the Steel Curtain is impregnable, insurmountable, everlasting. In truth, the Curtain is pregnant with rot, surmounted by power struggles, and frail on its deathbed -- much like its architect Hitler. Subtle blows can make gaps out of its rustiest sections; there liberty's torchlight can filter back into the continent afresh."

They also assumed the German government had held true to its promises thereafter. Moreover, they assumed the German army had no business prevailing against the combined forces of two world empires, and that they will fold in a second war as they had in the first.\n\nGermany proved them wrong on all three accounts by raising the swastika over Paris and London. On that ignoble climax has America since been forced to leave its Allies' governments to Hitler's mercy.\n\nOperative word, says the CIA: governments. With an appropriately sized black budget, the Allies' restive peoples will be forgotten no longer."

Luckily, a force which can effect such exists in Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. President Nixon pledges to uphold the Special Relationship both before and when America's other plays its hand."

Similarly, America has no shortage of guns -- pistols, machine guns, factory-fresh M14s, leftover Stens from the Second World War, perhaps an armored car or three in a warehouse -- and their corresponding ammunition.

Unfortunately, unless we thaw our currently chilly relations, we are in no position to leverage this.\n\nAccordingly, let us approach the Free French foreign minister, M. René Cassin, in order to establish a foothold for America and the OFN in West Africa. As Cassin's superior de Gaulle is known to be reticent about the OFN, there is only so much we are able to do; nonetheless, whatever ties we are able to establish will be of great use should something major take place in the region."

As arms shipments adopt tight schedules without authorities' notice and agents slip into and out of Fortress Europa with a revolving door's ease, the two countries' resistances ask Washington's leave to form closer ties with The Company.\n\nFor his part, President Nixon recalls the OSS's legendary exploits in its short-lived record.

Though the inevitable power struggle's severity had caught Capitol Hill off guard, America must still issue a formal response to Europe's latest crisis. Deadlock has unsurprisingly arisen over what said response should be.\n\nTo both parties' outrage, President Nixon suggests offering diplomatic recognition to Albert Speer. The noted reformist may ultimately be a Nazi, he defends, but no better opportunity to steer Germany from its excesses exists than in his accession as the Reich's new Führer. If nothing else, Speer seems more receptive of peace and cooperation than Göring, Bormann, and Heydrich.\n\nAmerica's eyes are on Capitol Hill as its statesmen-elect decide whether to fan the embers of German liberalism... or watch idly by as it turns to ash."

 USA_Boxing_In_the_Sphere_desc: "When he wrested a giant's prized cattle for his Tenth Labor, Hercules journeyed farther westwards than the borders his maps detail. Before returning to Mycenae he erected two mountain-sized pillars where the narrowing coast met Poseidon's boundless blue dominion. Inscribed upon these pillars demarcating the world's seeming edge were the words "Ne Plus Ultra": no further beyond.\n\nThe erudite can draw parallels between the Japanese Empire's conquests and the Greek hero's Tenth Labor. Like Hercules, its armies and fleets ventured towards the continent's westernmost edge to wrest wealth and glory from Europe's giants. Like Hercules, they halted at a body of water, in this case the River Ganges, and ventured no further.\n\nBut unlike Hercules, they feasted merrily on their spoils for years hence. Now even grasping its empire's edges has become a Herculean labor for Tokyo's corpulent digits. In effect, India and Southeast Asia have turned into cracks running along an otherwise perfect Sphere's surface... and with a little help from Washington, these cracks can widen into gorges tearing Japan's pet project apart."

Discontent is a pox concomitant to what Japanese planners disdainfully call the Southern Resource Area, where haphazardly scattered freedom fighters violently return Tokyo's denigrations onto its beleaguered puppet regimes.\n\nThe Rising Sun expected pliant mines and oil wells out of Southeast Asia; instead, it acquired only a trayful of kindling right underneath its bootheels.

With every passing day that those Japanese bastards continue to hold their dominance over the lands and seas of Malaya, more innocents are sent to be slaughtered like animals in another new contraption or scheme devised by the IJA or the Kenpeitai to maximise the locals' suffering and choke their wishes and hopes for liberty and freedom. The United States has always stood as a bastion of liberty and humanity and we must not leave our Malayan brothers wailing from the barbaric rage that the Japanese induce upon them; guns, tanks, planes and just about whatever the UMAJF freedom fighters need to continue their honourable fight against imperialism and tyranny will be sent to them effective immediately.

None more so than in Malaya, where years of pent-up tension between the peninsula's ethnicities and their Japanese occupiers have exploded into a full-scale insurgency.\n\nUncle Sam, of course, is more than happy to lend a helping hand. Whether one subscribes to the theories of dominoes, rollback, or toolbox, all can agree that aiding a stand against Japanese Imperialism is in America's best interest.

Consisting of those fighting for the Stars and Stripes, and those fighting for a Philippines free of Japanese tyranny, the Free Philippines Republic has recently sprung up, and we may not have long before they wither and fade.\n\nIt is clear to all that the ironically named "Second Philippine Republic" will soon undergo its greatest challenge, and if we can do anything to make that challenge all the more difficult, we should. If we ever want to return to the Philippines, we will need to do everything in our power to support our fighting Filipinos. Sending arms, ammunition, and intelligence support will only worsen the conditions for our enemies, and improve the odds of an allied Philippines once more.

The words themselves struck chills into every turncoat's kyphotic backs, dreading in their silent moments the doom they were owed.\n\nLangley's contacts reported rumblings of activity from the mountains and jungles just this morning.

He eyes the full moon in between empty Zippos; tonight a field of stars accompanies its wan light.

Tokyo has since seemed content with letting their cat's-paws in Calcutta bet against their adversaries in New Delhi for the subcontinent's destiny.\n\nThe United States can and will do its part in tilting the odds towards a fellow democracy's favor.

 USA_recognize_the_roi_desc: "Whether out of fear for renewing tensions with Japan or simple indifference, the United States government had neither received nor courted either of India's governments since 1946. In hindsight, America acquiesced perhaps too readily to the Sphere's vaporous threats when it could have earlier laid the groundwork for countering its ambitions in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe Nixon administration will reverse this trend by acknowledging opportunity out of a geopolitical hotspot. In the following weeks, the President himself shall visit New Delhi to formally recognize Mr. Nehru as President of the subcontinent's rightful government."

 USA_Give_Them_Our_Arms_desc: "As it stands, the West Indian arms industry remains a white paper held by some nondescript official from the Republic's Ministry of Defense. In lieu of well-established arms companies operating under their jurisdiction, West India has relied on imports from a coterie of foreign contractors to fulfill their armed forces' needs. Admittedly such an arrangement suits a country facing neither insurgency nor invasion -- a state of affairs which can reverse overnight at Calcutta's immediate behest.\n\nIn contrast, American gunsmiths sell guns and ammunition by the millions even within its own market. These companies are incidentally all too happy to service another in a more formal basis. The White House is, of course, also all too eager to oblige both parties' needs."

Rampant tax evasion, nurtured by an antiquated, byzantine codex of regulations, hampers New Delhi's industrialization programs with an ever-present shortfall of money. These factors lock their economy under a perpetual, stagnating cycle between a lack of cash for building factories and a lack of factories for making cash.\n\nFortunately, both American investments and American factories are willing to cross two oceans for India's relief. All they need is President Nixon's fountain pen -- and, of course, some incentives from the country's ample reserves."

Their presence brought plenty to rajas and tide-swept defeat upon their foes; their absence brought famine and destitution indiscriminate. Likewise, the Indian Ocean's strongest cyclone to date carries with it the howling winds of war -- no longer a distant hypothetical, but now an oncoming certainty heralding its approach with thunder and rain.\n\nUpon Washington's request, the Army Corps of Engineers has begun constructing a stretch of border fortifications from the Bay of Bengal to the Himalayas, dubbed the "Bamboo Curtain". Every block and sandbag laid onto its foundations represents a risky, no less genuine investment towards a free India's future... and at the same time, President Nixon hopes, one where America has a place by its side as a trusted friend."

 USA_mccormack_against_the_npp: "The McCormack Presidency"
 USA_mccormack_against_the_npp_desc: "A President in disgrace, another President shot dead, a country in chaos and an election barely a year away. To say that the situation of the Republican-Democrats is dire would be the understatement of the century. Enter former Speaker of the House John McCormack, a man who never expected to hold the reins of power who has regardless found them thrust into his hands. At such a dark moment in America's history, McCormack will certainly have his work cut out for him.\n\nWith the election approaching, McCormack's tenure as President will be short. He has no intentions of running in the election, instead simply resolving to hold the Oval Office for the coming months until a new Commander-in-Chief can be nominated. However, with the stability of the RDC in shambles and the National Progressive Pact's Caucuses making unprecedented gains, he intends to use his brief tenure to try and right the ship and save the Republican-Democrats from ruin.\n\nThe tarnished legacy of Nixon will need to be addressed, a matter President Kennedy was unable to attend to in his tragically brief rule. The fallout of the South African War that Nixon thrust the country into will need to be carefully managed as well. If McCormack can successfully put out the flames that his Coalition is currently engulfed in and restore some semblance of dignity to the government, the Republican-Democratic Coalition may just manage to pull through - or at the very least, survive absolute electoral decimation."

 USA_mccormack_remain_calm_desc: "The shock and uncertainty sparked by the wave of scandals and tragedies the coalition has experienced has not only shattered the public's confidence in us; it has frayed the tenuous bonds that hold the dynamism of the two parties together. With many of the Democrats and even a few Republican senators openly wondering if the continued existence of the united coalition is beneficial to anyone, drastic action must be taken to pull the party together if we are ever to have a hope of salvaging the election.\n\nPresident McCormack will need to wrangle the squabbling factions into presenting a united front against the chaos America finds itself in. Restoring unity for both parties will be critical to allay the nation's panic and prevent a mass defection of voters from the Republicans and the Democrats."

With confidence in the coalition still gravely damaged, President McCormack must move quickly to prove that we are still the best choice for a better American future. Through dedicated and clear-headed leadership, he will show the people that both the Republicans and the Democrats are capable of guiding the nation through the crises we find ourselves in.\n\nMcCormack will also need to deal with the ascendant NPP, who have taken full advantage of the crises facing us to rocket up the opinion polls. If their rise is to be halted, we will need to outmaneuver them in both words and policy, proving that we are truly the only real option to carry America forwards."

The key to redeeming oneself from scandal is not to wring your hands and agonize over it, but to move forwards and prove that you are better. McCormack will embody this idea by focusing instead on the future, by working to salvage the coalition's image and prove that the unfortunate occurrences of the past year are naught but a hiccup compared to the historied political pedigree of the Republican-Democrats.\n\nWe will abandon the legacy of Nixon and cut a new path to the future. Tackling the current issues head on will demonstrate to the American people that we are still capable of ruling as effectively as we always have. We must do much to earn back the people's trust, but should we succeed, our tarnished reputation will be restored to greatness."

 USA_mccormack_speaker_of_the_white_house_desc: "As the former Speaker of the House, McCormack occupied a unique position in politics. Tasked with leading the House of Representatives, presiding over the administration of the House and the debates held within, the position of Speaker is at least theoretically as non-partisan as someone in American politics can get. The delicate art of mediating between two rival parties requires a certain level of detachment from the inner goings on of both.\n\nAs President, McCormack could use the prestige of his old position to his advantage. By presenting himself as a non-partisan element, uninvolved in the unfortunate scandals of the past, McCormack can distance himself from the taint of the Nixon presidency. Styling himself as a clean, uncorrupted voice within the White House, he could more effectively argue the RDC case and significantly increase our chances of surviving the coming election."

 USA_mccormack_curb_radicalism_desc: "In desperate times, people will turn to anybody who can offer them a solution, no matter how radical or insane the solution is. Indeed, it is in this way that modern Germany came into its nightmarish self. This exact scenario is now being played out across America, as a nation full of scared and uncertain people jump ship to the NPP. The NPP insist that they and only they can be trusted to "fix" America, promising hardline solutions to America's problems as one might take a sledgehammer to a loose nail.\n\nIf the Republican-Democratic Coalition is to endure, we must make the people of America see that the way of the NPP leads to ruin. President McCormack intends to go on the offensive, calling upon all red-blooded Americans to stand firm against radicalism. Their siren song, the likes of which has led to so much poverty and death in so many regimes in history, cannot be allowed to take hold in the United States as well. Such a call to action might help win back both wavering liberals and moderate conservatives who were considering switching sides."

 USA_mccormack_saving_nixon_desc: "Scandalous or no, President Nixon left us with a lot of baggage. Intervening in the war in South Africa, while an arguably honorable decision in the name of helping our allies, has quickly become one of the most controversial moves in recent times. If we are to recover our reputation, we must find a way to salvage Nixon's decisions and turn his failures into a great success.\n\nWar propaganda must be ramped up to further spin this war as our moral duty. Efforts must be taken to mitigate the bad press we accrue from the goings on in the African bush, for every life lost or man crippled is another stain on our reputation. Ultimately, efforts must be taken to eke out some sort of victory in Africa, even a moral one. South Africa is an affair brought about by the actions of the Republican-Democrats, and only by proving that it was the right decision can we prove that our loyalty to President Nixon was not completely foolish."
 USA_mccormack_african_gamble: "The African Gamble"
 USA_mccormack_african_gamble_desc: "No matter how one looks at it, the situation in South Africa is a mess. Through President Nixon's misguided opportunism, our troops have been sent half a world away to fight and die in a conflict we barely even understand, and the people are understandably growing more and more angry. To back down now, however, would be an act of cowardice from which we would never recover.\n\nInstead, we will win back the people, by winning the war. We must not only win the war, but win it quickly. If we can minimize the amount of time America spends bogged down in this quagmire, we can score a great victory for the United States that we can ride all the way to the polls. President McCormack is already prepared to order American troops fighting in South Africa to steel themselves for an aggressive assault, aiming to cripple the Boers and the Nazis as fast as possible.\n\nA bold plan, which will require equally bold results - and if we fail to provide those results, the voters will never forgive us..."

The faster we move, the faster our enemies fall, and the faster they fall, the sooner we can have a great victory parade.\n\nThe anti-war protests grow louder, but we must harden our resolve and strengthen our commitment. President McCormack is preparing to authorize a massive influx of supplies and equipment to the troops to help them keep marching, keep fighting, keep winning. No price is too great for victory to be within reach.\n\nOur boys will be home by Christmas. They must be. Let us not stop to think about what will happen to the coalition if they are not..."

A not insignificant portion of both Republican and Democratic bureaucrats have suggested that Nixon's actions should be formally pardoned and allowed to retire gracefully. Nixon's former allies argue that this would allow us to truly wash our hands of him and help stabilize the Coalition in this critical moment.\n\nThis would not be popular. Nixon's voting base would approve, but pardoning his actions would certainly be condemned by many other people. Still, bringing Nixon's allies back into the fold would help bring the coalition together, and the stability of the Republican-Democratic Coalition is paramount to our potential success."

Not only did he commit acts of unacceptable corruption, he refused to accept responsibility and denied any involvement until the truth was practically forced out of him by the courts. This is not a man the Republican-Democrats should ever associate their image with, and in the interests of showing that justice still reigns in this land, he must face the consequences.\n\nNixon will be given no pardon, condemning him to face indictment and punishment. He will be treated as any other corrupt official would be treated, and made an example of to America at large. His more die-hard supporters may not appreciate this, but unlike Nixon, President McCormack is not afraid to speak the truth: "He is a crook"."

As election night draws nigh, all we can do is sit back and hope that it was enough.\n\nWhatever happens, the White House must be ready to house its fourth President in two years. Preparations must be made for the transfer of power to the next Commander-in-Chief, and for the first time in over a hundred years that man may not bear an R or a D next to his name. Whoever wins the election, we must make sure that the handover is as clean and orderly as possible, to ensure that the principles and traditions of democracy our nation was founded upon are upheld.\n\nThe wait is nearly over.

RD_mccormack.1.desc: "John McCormack never wanted this.\n\nHis career had been most successful, for sure. He had always wanted to serve the country and what he saw as the stable choice with the coalition, and in his tenure as Speaker of the House he had performed admirably, if he did say so himself. Then Nixon lied and Kennedy died, and suddenly this Boston-born son of a hod carrier found himself thrust into the highest office in the land.\n\nThe days seemed to blur together as he struggled to gather himself. The Oval Office was a whirlwind of activity, endless lines of politicians and secretaries rushing to give him the lay of the land. "More rioting in the South" cried one. "Latest casualty reports from South Africa, Mr President" said another. The podium at the press conferences was another beast. He had lost count of the amount of times he had uttered the phrases "national tragedy" and "difficult times for us all" in front of flashing cameras over the last few days. Finally, whenever he found himself a brief moment to relax, he would pick up the newspaper and read all about the grim poll forecasts and the endless rumor mill and the countless reports of protests and continuing civil rights clashes and lines of coffins returning from overseas.\n\nOne night, sleep truly eluded him, and he found himself in the Oval Office, sitting in darkness save only for the lights flooding in from the White House lawn. His presidency would not be a successful one. He accepted that. He made no plans to run in the election to try and legitimize or extend his rule. But perhaps he could steady the nation well enough that he who came after him could be in with a shot of triumph.\n\nSteeling himself, the Caretaker President prepared for the ordeal ahead."

We want nothing more than to bring our boys back home to be with their families again. That is why we are making efforts to bring this escapade to as swift a conclusion as we possibly can."\n\nThe conference was long and grueling. Wild claims were made regarding the war. McCormack promised swift offensives, influxes of support equipment, various dates by which Bouhlerstadt and Luanda would surely be in American hands, and many other bold suggestions. The reporters asked tough questions - how would this effect the economy? Could the soldiers hope to cross such vast distances in such a short time? How would such an offensive affect the wellbeing of the men? The claims flowed freely, and the questions came back even firmer, for what seemed like hours.\n\nAfterwards, McCormack found himself only able to hope that his words would sway the public back. A quick end to the war would not only free the coalition from the indignity of having declared it, but also allow them to bask in the great victory over fascism that would arise from it. This, of course, rested on whether or not he and the armed forces could pull off such a victory.\n\nIt had to work."

RD_mccormack.3.desc: "McCormack had never seen so many numbers in his life.\n\nRight now, as the rest of the country headed out to the polls to cast their vote in what had become the most divisive election in living memory, all he could do was sit and examine the endless sheets of paper stacked out on the desk. Newspapers, stat sheets, comuniques from all across the country; the contents of the papers were varied, but on each of them he had circled the particular stats he was looking for - the polls.\n\nThe New York Times said the RDC stood a good chance in Iowa, while the Boston Globe predicted a bloodbath in the NPP's favor. Pollsters in Indiana seemed confident that the Democrat senator there would keep his seat, but the news from Arizona was not so encouraging. Endlessly, McCormack gorged himself on poll numbers, feeling his heart sink at every poor showing and subsequently soar at every promising result.\n\nYet he felt himself growing increasingly frustrated as the pollsters seemed incapable of agreeing with one another, and the final result remained as unclear as ever. The uncertainty made him feel sick to his stomach. He knew he hadn't always made the right choices, and the NPP were stronger now than they had ever been before. Nixon and Kennedy were the reason he was in this mess, yet history would remember him as the man who made or broke the Republican-Democrats.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the official vote counts began, McCormack felt his eyelids begin to droop. Resting his head upon a copy of the Washington Post, he felt his thoughts and fears ebb away. As sleep finally took him, he resigned himself to the knowledge that he would wake up to a brand new President. Whoever that might be."

 USA_mil_64_m60_enhancement_project: "M60 Enhancement Project"
 USA_mil_64_m60_enhancement_project_desc: "The M60 Patton main battle tank, while a decent vehicle, is beginning to lag behind its foreign counterparts, such as the German Leopard. Its armor composition is out of date, its turret has poor stabilization, the road wheels are susceptible to damage and deformation, and so on. All in all, the M60 has several design flaws and outdated features that greatly lessen its combat effectiveness. By starting a program to rectify these problems, the M60 may once again be on par with the tanks of foreign powers."
 USA_mil_64_m113_enhancement_project: "M113 Enhancement Project"
 USA_mil_64_m113_enhancement_project_desc: "The M113 armored personnel carrier, or APC, has faced several issues since its early adoption under the Nixon Administration. The vehicle has an aluminum body that, while light, creates issues in survivability, both for the vehicle and the soldiers inside it. In order to improve the M113's capabilities, the Department of Defense has recommended outfitting it with steel armor slats, and even experimental, "reactive" armor plating that will improve its strength. In order to counteract the added weight of this extra armor, this upgraded M113 will feature a larger, turbocharged diesel engine. After implementing these potential upgrades, the U.S. Army's standard APC should see a notable increase in effectiveness."
 USA_mil_64_expand_west_point: "Expand West Point"
 USA_mil_64_expand_west_point_desc: "The United States Military Academy at West Point has yet to truly adapt to the modern concept of large, standing armies that the armed forces have used since the Second World War. Every year, hundreds to thousands of promising, qualified officer cadets are simply rejected due to there not being enough space for them at the Academy. The Academy is simply too small to handle all the recruits needed for our massive military, and, as such, many are forced to go to poorer schools, or even give up the officer corps as a whole. By expanding West Point, the United States Army will have the large, well-trained officer corps that it requires."
 USA_mil_64_department_of_the_navy: "Department of the Navy"
 USA_mil_64_department_of_the_navy_desc: "The current United States Navy places a heavy emphasis on using aircraft carriers, as a tool for both power projection and easy aircraft transport. This was important during the Pacific War, and it still is, but it cannot be the sum total of our focus. New research and funding needs to be put into submarine programs, to counter our enemies beneath the waves. We should also focus on expanding our nuclear triad in a variety of ways, so that we will not be reliant on silos and bombers to dominate the newest form of warfare. In total, it's vital that the US Navy become a truly modern, relevant force."
 USA_mil_64_two_seas_concept: "Two Seas Concept"
 USA_mil_64_two_seas_concept_desc: "The US Navy faces two vastly different opponents on either side. On one, they face the formidable Imperial Japanese Navy, with a heavy focus on carriers and air power; on the other, they face the Kriegsmarine, with vast fleets of battleships, cruisers, and submarines. By nature, these two enemies are difficult to counter with a single, overriding doctrine. Consequently, it becomes necessary to split the USN into two different groups: the Pacific Fleet to counter the Empire, and the Atlantic Fleet to counter the Reich."
 USA_mil_64_an_sqs-23_sonar: "AN/SQS-23 Sonar"
 USA_mil_64_an_sqs-23_sonar_desc: "The conclusions gathered by the United States Department of the Navy in Operation Silent Serpent have been very helpful in determining the shortcomings of the American navy and naval doctrine. In short, the report came to the conclusion that American sonar capabilities were insufficient in detecting new, silent-running German submersibles. The new submarines are able to run much quieter than their earlier counterparts, easily fooling American sonar technology. In response, the Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the development and adoption of SQS-23 Sonar, which can operate at a much greater range of frequencies, and detect previously-undetectable silent craft."
 USA_mil_64_an_sps-40_radar: "AN/SPS-40 Radar"
 USA_mil_64_an_sps-40_radar_desc: "To counter the heavy focus on airpower that the Japanese place in their navy, it becomes imminently necessary to increase our ships' capability to detect newer, faster aircraft from farther distances. To this end, SPS-40 Air Search Radar provides far greater target detection and tracking for long-range surveillance and self-defense. Able to detect the fastest aircraft in the harshest of weather, it will vastly improve the Navy's defense capability."
 USA_mil_64_ssbn_program: "SSBN Program"
 USA_mil_64_ssbn_program_desc: "Submarines have faced an issue since their inception: they must always return to port for fuel. However, with new advances in energy technology, this may no longer be the case. We can introduce the concept of the SSBN (Ship, Submersible, Ballistic, Nuclear) to the world: a nuclear-powered submarine that does not require quickly-exhaustible diesel or gasoline to fuel it. With a nuclear reactor placed on our ballistic subs, they could remain at sea, almost indefinitely, putting pressure on America's enemies around the world for weeks or months at a time."
 USA_mil_64_department_of_the_air_force: "Department of the Air Force"
 USA_mil_64_department_of_the_air_force_desc: "The air wars of decades past were fought with simple fighters and bombers. While the basic principle of "use planes to make the enemy blow up" hasn't changed all that much, the planes certainly have. Nowadays, helicopters and long-range bombers are the most important new components of a serious air force. These two points of development need to be focused on, along with associated training regimes and air doctrine, so that Germany and Japan will never rule the skies while the US Air Force is in play."
 USA_mil_64_heliborne_division_proposal: "Heliborne Division Proposal"
 USA_mil_64_heliborne_division_proposal_desc: "Helicopters are possibly one of the most versatile technologies to emerge in the past 20 years; they are fast, cheap, and able to carry troops over normally untraversable terrain. Despite this versatility, however, they are being used in relatively small roles, such as reconnaissance. In order to exploit their full potential, a proposal has been made to the Department of Defense: divisions of helicopter-based mobile infantry. This "air cavalry" or "heliborne" idea proposes that entire divisions of infantry be outfitted with helicopters, which they use to traverse large distances in short periods of time and deploy from quickly."
 USA_mil_64_laser_guided_munitions_development: "Laser-Guided Munitions"
 USA_mil_64_laser_guided_munitions_development_desc: "The days of unguided "dumbfire" rockets are now clearly passing. As aircraft become ever faster and more agile, unguided rockets become less and less effective. Targets are simply too fleeting to hit with anything unguided. As such, the Department of Defense has recommended the widespread adoption of laser-guided missiles. If America is to stay ahead of the curve in munitions technology, it may be prudent to invest research and development time into laser-guided munitions, which can track individual ground targets as the aircraft that fire them fly away to safety."
 USA_mil_64_short_range_missile_project: "Short-Range Missile Project"
 USA_mil_64_short_range_missile_project_desc: "With greater development of guided rockets, it now becomes possible to equip aircraft with effective and consistent air-to-air missiles (AAMs). Previously, most propeller-driven aircraft relied upon machine guns or automatic cannons to engage with other aircraft; now, as jets become in the air forces of the world, this gun-based approach is simply no longer viable. Luckily, with the advent of guided air-to-air missiles (AAMs), the Department of the Air Force has possibly found a new approach. Should we invest in these munitions, our aircraft can expect a massive boost in combat effectiveness, as they will be able to hit the fastest of hostile jets without a second thought."
 USA_mil_64_expand_the_sentinel_program: "Expand the Sentinel Program"
 USA_mil_64_expand_the_sentinel_program_desc: "The great fear of nuclear war is no longer represented by a single, lone bomber flying over a major city; rather, it is represented by the pointed head of a ballistic missile, rocketing through the sky towards some unknown, far-off target. This fear is no longer countered by conventional means. With enemy bombers, it was a simple enough task to send interceptors to shoot them down. Now, however, ballistic missiles fly far higher and faster than even the fastest jets, and as a result, can no longer be countered conventionally.\n\nAs a solution, the Department of Defense has envisioned the Sentinel Program. In it, a series of low-range, anti-ballistic missile sites will be placed around the continental United States. If enemy missiles come nearby, these sites will fire guided missiles in response to intercept and destroy them. While these won't be able to do much against large ICBMs like those expected from the Reich or Japan, they should be able to shoot down the short-range missiles that our enemies place in their puppets close to us."
 USA_mil_64_third_generation_warfare: "Third-Generation Warfare"
 USA_mil_64_third_generation_warfare_desc: "War has changed. The American Military has yet to fully adopt the ideas learned from the Second World War, that maneuver and speed are the way of the future. As of right now, that changes. America will no longer be on the backfoot in tactics and strategy; rather, it will rush ahead with new, innovative combat concepts that will put it at the forefront of military doctrine. Among these innovations are helicopter-focused infantry, highly mobile ground units to outflank and surround enemy positions, and advanced naval detection technology and protocols. America has seen the future of warfare, and the future is American."

 USA_BFW_68_Carelessness_of_Bennett_desc: "The now former President Bennett was a believer in free market economics, international cooperation and opening trade around the world. While all well and good, the previous administration was a bit too eager to undermine the status of the American worker, smashing safety regulations that protect them, and encouraging big companies to move the jobs to lower cost countries. Now we need to clean up the mess Bennett left behind."

While this allowed huge profits to be gathered by the owners and stockholders in the short term, the effects in the long term will lead to consequences that we cannot even begin to predict. A suite of executive orders will lasso these companies back to a more equal and fair playing field. The horse may have escaped the stable, but we can bring it back."

Well, we've had time to experiment with this idea as a nation, and the results are in: it was a failure. While economic progress was seen at the start, soon it was clear that the rich were only getting richer, the middle class saw a tiny bump, and the poor saw next to no progress, and even a regression as government budgets were stretched. Now is the time to end this dead theory, and start something better."

Wallace Bennett seemed to fail to remember this fact incredibly early in his political career, instead focusing on the rich, powerful and influential that walked the halls of Capitol Hill or the offices of Wall Street. Today we vow that the Average American will be the focus of our new administration."

 USA_BFW_68_Reel_in_Military_desc: "Wallace Bennett is many things; however, reckless and inefficient was not what one might have expected to call him. Yet those unfortunate words accurately describe his approach to military spending - or, more accurately, military misspending.\n\nOur estimates indicate that Wallace Bennett spent well above what needed to be spent on the military for it to function. Cutting back on the military spending and deploying the funds elsewhere is a prudent decision that will also allow us to show the US and the world that we are distinct from Wallace Bennett and his administration."
 USA_BFW_68_Tone_Back_Trade: "Tone Back Trade"
 USA_BFW_68_Tone_Back_Trade_desc: "President Wallace Bennett sought to increase prosperity by increasing trade. However, Bennett's idea of trade was to move high paying manufacturing jobs from America's great cities to areas of the world that had weak unions, little protections and no need to pay their workers much above subsistence levels, and then selling what was made back to America. While this made the big companies that still owned the factories and the distribution methods rich and also helped those countries bolster their economies, it put thousands out of work here at home with its after effects rippling throughout the American economy. We should rectify this balance, and encourage the companies to return home and employ our citizens, even if it does make our friends and allies angry."

 USA_BFW_68_Let_it_Run_its_Course_desc: "We had campaigned on a rollback of Bennett's trade deals, and had won on such a platform. However, as we look into the clauses and appendices, we now realize that dismantling the deals will be incredibly difficult: not just from a diplomatic standpoint, but with some of the most wealthy and influential power brokers in New York and Washington, not to mention the impact on the budget from the big companies headquartered in the US. It may be a better idea to make incremental changes and minor alterations for now, and see if we can get a better deal later."

 USA_BFW_68_Slam_the_Deals_desc: "The trade deals that were negotiated were, to it frankly, bad. America gave up too much: income, jobs, reduced environmental and employer regulations, and our sense of well being. Our "partners" on the other hand, got all the benefits. America elevated itself to become the number one economy in the world by our own hard work and prudence, without any foreign help. Our allies should do the same, whether they like it or not."

Of course, our supporters and average citizens are not so attuned to the machinations inside the Beltway, so they are angry and disappointed at another politician lying to them. Of course, we can't tell them that we are only working with them for now so we can destroy them later, and get a bit of money in the meantime."

 USA_BFW_68_Slap_on_the_Tariffs_desc: "The biggest problem with free trade, besides the lost jobs and obscene profits made by the rich, is the huge hole it punched into our federal budget. By eliminating those tariffs, we had basically cut off our legs to help the American people and the schools, roads and infrastructure that truly helps. Therefore, we are going to put some of the customs duties back on. Our trade partners might through a conniption, but it's a small price to pay to make our country better."

The new President, however, has directed the State Department to start drawing up plans to alter the deals to benefit the citizens of the US more. This will help the American worker get back to work, the taxpayer pay less taxes, and perhaps get us some more voters as well.\n\nThey better pray that we don't alter it any further."

Agriculture is one area that we can leverage: the United States is the breadbasket of the world, and many of our OFN allies don't have the access to the good farmland that we do, and the bountiful harvests that we produce annually. If we can negotiate to give our farmers a leg up, to make foreign markets more open to sell their grain and cattle, then we can show that we are taking the threat of the deals seriously, and maybe get a few more votes in the Midwest for the next election."

 USA_BFW_68_Crank_Up_Exports_desc: "While there are a lot of issues with the now retired President Bennett's trade deals, one thing that we are in favor of is the fact that other nations reduced their tariffs to American goods. This will, of course, make superior goods, especially those Made in the USA, that much more profitable and enticing to foreign markets. So even though we had to deal with a flood of cheap knockoffs, we can at the very least sell our own, much higher quality products overseas. The consumer goods must flow!"

There are more important things to life than the pursuit of gold and riches. While our Allies may not like it, and the big companies are angry and in panic, it is time that what we make in America should be sold and consumed by Americans first to increase our standard of living, and not be forced to buy inferior goods made from overseas that we were forced to bring in from the deals.

There are, after all, countless rebel groups in the Philippines, more than one of which has already claimed responsibility through graffiti, leaflets, and pirate radio.\n\nAccompanying the update on the bombing was a new request for security and economic aid to the Aquino government.

 USA_politics_details_category_desc_gui: "Even in the best of times, American politics has never been particularly transparent. Now, with the US facing its most pressing hour, the chaotic shifting of parties, sympathies, and allegiances is inevitable. We have prepared a situation report below to the best of our abilities:\n\nThe £GFX_rd_texticon §RRepublican§!-§BDemocratic§!

[ROOT.GetNPPUnity]American society [ROOT.GetUSAUnity]\n\n[ROOT.GetRDUnited][ROOT.GetRightYockeyUnited][ROOT.GetLeftCenterUnited][ROOT.GetRCenterUnited][ROOT.GetRRightUnited][ROOT.GetDCenterUnited][ROOT.GetDRightUnited]\nThere are currently [?RD_senators|Y0] £GFX_rd_texticon §RRepublican§!-§BDemocratic§! Senators, of which:\n\n[?RD_R_senators|Y0] are £GFX_rd_r_texticon §RRepublicans§!.\n[?RD_D_senators|Y0] are £GFX_rd_d_texticon §BDemocrats§!.\n\nThere are currently [?NPP_senators|Y0] £GFX_npp_texticon §ONational Progressive§!

Each state elects two Senators every six years. While there are only two major parties, the £GFX_rd_texticon §RR§!-§BD§!'s and the £GFX_npp_texticon §ONPP§!, each has its own factions with their own popularities. While the popularity of each candidacy is essential for victory, it's meaningless if §Ycoalition unity§! is insufficient to stop different blocs from voting for an opposing candidate whose policies closer match their own. The coalition's choice of candidates depends on the strength of each party, and §Ycoalition popularity§! can be §Gimproved§! through regional campaigning. However, there's always a chance that a campaign effort can go §Rawry.§!\n\nThe President of the United States is not directly elected by the American people. Instead, Americans elect a slate of State electors, based on population size, to vote for a candidate on their behalf. While §Ycoalition popularity§! is important in Presidential elections as well, members of a party are far more likely to vote for a candidate who shares their views."

USA_running_on_fumes_desc: "To say that the recent Oil Crisis has thrown a wrench into our economy is a vast understatement. Much like a well functioning machine, the US economy is heavily reliant on a steady supply of petroleum to work efficiently. While oil reserves exist in states like California and Texas, it is simply not enough to provide for the ever-growing needs of our population. The recent economic malaise of the past few decades is still fresh in the minds of America, and as such, preventing another, potentially worse crisis is paramount to our survival. A Presidential Task Force will be formed to secure new sources of oil, calm down internal strife, and apply a handful of administrative measures to resolve this issue. We can survive anything the world throws at us!"
USA_set_the_prices_desc: "Opportunistic businessmen have already implemented outrageous prices on the cost of gasoline and oil related products. This cannot stand! Effective immediately, the Federal Government will implement wide-reaching price controls and permit an efficient system of enforcement to ensure that no ludicrous pricing slips through the cracks. While the... less ethical viewpoint of this crisis would be to sustain profit, we must ensure affordability for the common consumer. Price controls will also help us slow down our soon-to-increase inflation rate, and provide some more stability in local markets. Those who are looking to personally profit off such a disastrous crisis must be restricted and taught the error of their ways, for the good of the nation."
USA_the_Federal_Energy_Office_desc: "Our current and past Administrations have not had any dedicated resources to meet the energy requirements of the country. With the current crisis in full swing, this can no longer stand. Through an Executive Order and hopefully action from the Legislative Branch, we can create an Agency which is responsible for managing as well as allocating our supply of electricity, collect information on the power needs of America, coordinate foreign policy measures to keep our trade of natural resources which can produce energy, and can regulate prices. While the Office will of course increase efficiency and scope with time, and perhaps even become a fully fledged cabinet-level department one day, their efforts now will help manage this crisis to a point where it does not strain an unprepared bureaucracy."
USA_Bigger_in_Texas_desc: "Texas is one of the largest producers of crude oil in the world. Despite this fact, it is not enough to keep up with the needs of domestic oil use. Although there are already plenty of corporations drilling for oil in the area, it is not enough. We need to encourage existing drillers to expand, new drillers to set up rigs, and subsidise their businesses so they don't immediately go under from the weight of their expenses. Hopefully with all of this initiative going forward, Texan oil will heat homes during winters in New Jersey, power trucks on interstate highways in Utah, and keep industries running in Florida long enough for us to sort all of this out."
USA_Odd_Even_Rationing_desc: "Despite creating efficiency bottlenecks, enforcing strict price controls, and increasing our immediate as well as future supply of oil, it is simply not enough. This is a full-blown national emergency, and as such we will have to enforce rationing on our markets. Our system can't work as well as it is able to if our supply of oil isn't evenly spread. Businesses, private citizens, or agencies hoarding supplies of gasoline or crude oil supplies is simply unacceptable. We have a responsibility to ensure an even supply spread; perhaps even implementing ration cards and expanding the powers of the Federal Energy Office to punish those who do not comply. A thinly-spread supply of oil is better than no oil for some, as it goes."
USA_Synthetic_Alternatives_desc: "Recent advances in technology and scientific research has offered potential breakthroughs in alternative supplies of fuel. Although existing technology has already existed and was implemented by the Germans during the Second World War, it is now at a point where it is efficient and advanced enough to contribute to civilian supplies of fuel. Experts and cabinet advisors are skeptical about the short-term application of subsidizing such an experimental process, given that the scale it will be implemented on is mild at best. However, with time and enough funds thrown their way, we're sure that a stable supply of synthetics will at the very least reduce the negative impacts of future energy crises. Let's send a stimulus package to these scientists and industrialists as well as officially support their efforts, so that perhaps we have alternatives to rely upon a few years from now."
USA_Disaster_Averted_desc: "Through all of our efforts, we are starting to see miniscule signs of recovery. Despite there still being long lines at gas stations, a lack of supply in some areas, and a general slowdown of the entire economy, things are beginning to return to normal. Many policy experts and key figures in our administration are confident that the worst is over. Despite the Crisis still being in full swing, it is at least starting to slow down on the home front, with our economy showing signs of life again. We can now return to approaching our domestic agenda without fear of the entire country imploding in on itself from a lack of fuel. As we remember the impacts of this crisis and the consequences of past losses on the American consciousness, we can now steadily move forward to a safe and secure future, one where the public is protected from emergencies and the American Dream can still survive against overwhelming odds."
USA_reach_out_to_Riyadh_desc: "Saudi Arabia holds more cheap oil than any other nation on Earth. Miles of oil wells have stuck out of its dunes for decades, pumping millions of barrels of liquid gold a day. Italian colonialism expanded these lucrative fields to new plays underneath both the desert sands and the Persian Gulf. In a twist of irony, the Arabian Desert is now an oasis for a planet famished for oil.\n\nThe President's advisors unanimously believe King Faisal is America's ticket out of the Oil Crisis. However, its ideal method of approach is still subject to debate. Some believe Arabia needs firm reassurances from the Free World, up to and especially a tour de force. Conversely, others warn of the risks involved in repeating the South African and Indonesian debacles, instead advocating for diplomacy and more... clandestine, means to support the monarch."
USA_Securing_Our_Interests_desc: "America runs a race against an oil market on the brink of freefall; if it fails, then so too will its economy. In these precarious circumstances, mistakes made of haste are more easily forgiven if they ultimately preserve the country's fortunes.\n\nWashington is sure to make plenty of mistakes by intervening overtly in the Arabian peninsula, to say nothing of the political capital it needs to convince Congress and the people in favor of another foreign adventure. Rest easy knowing that the sacrifices we make now will pay off for millions of Americans' lives decades into the future. Prosperity, after all, makes forgiveness an easy choice."
USA_Gifts_For_The_King_desc: "King Faisal holds sway over a nation-state's embryo. He may have government, culture, recognition and rule of law - but without the guns to back its monopoly on violence, his dynasty may as well be one more tribe among the Arabian peninsula's lawless bedouins. More specifically, Bedouins vulnerable to the nationalistic overtures of a united Arab identity.\n\nHere America can leverage its economic largesse to buttress the young nation's precarious position. A shipment of guns both outdated and state-of-the-art will assure the King of his state's lastingness in the face of a subcontinent's worth of foes."
USA_King_Faisal_Im_CIA_desc: "The fruits of human intelligence compound with every year they operate within a country's borders. In turn, a well-established intelligence apparatus both forewarns and precludes enemy action, sometimes without their knowledge.\n\nWhich is why the CIA is so eager to expand their operations in the Middle East as of late. Our stiletto in the dark needs ample preparation time to conduct their covert deeds - we can satisfy their demands by sending them into the region before our armed forces. The Company will wreak their infamous havoc where we need it most soon enough."
USA_Operation_Sandstorm_desc: "As of late, the Joint Chiefs of Staff busied themselves with preparing America's most comprehensive expeditionary force since Indonesia. Drawing from the lessons learned in the past decade's two largest wars, the country's finest generals and admirals drew minute, extensive plans for a lightning war involving all four branches of the US Armed Forces. They described the immense firepower America's tanks, guns, ships and planes combined will demonstrate as a "shock and awe campaign" spanning the Middle East, routinely inspected for any flaws that may lead to another quagmire.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon assured America that Sandstorm will promise just that: a storm. Woe betide the fools who bar its path."
USA_Step_Up_Our_Shipments_desc: "Our army lives and dies by supply routes thousands of miles astride the East Coast and the Persian Gulf. As their principal supplier, said supply routes likewise dictate the Royal Saudi Land Forces' shape, tempo and effectiveness. Heavier combat necessitates several thousands more tons of shipment sent per day; should our logistics fail to meet the armies' demands, we will likely see both their ammunition and morale plummet deep enough to hit a reservoir of oil.\n\nThe simple solution is to increase the pace of convoys running extant routes. We can always rely on our capable merchant marine to implement this directive to their abilities' best."
USA_Black_Gold_Rush_desc: "One immeasurable benefit of direct cooperation with Saudi Arabia is direct access to their pipelines bursting full with oil. Their generosity has thus far ably stemmed the bleeding on America's economy since the Oil Crisis began. With war on their doorstep, and the US Army their most stalwart shield against it, the Saudis believe dedicating some of their valuable pumps solely for our army's consumption - after their extracts leave the refineries, of course - will service both themselves and us in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nReally, who are we to disagree?"
USA_Pick_Your_Targets_desc: "The CIA's contacts have proven their worth by providing every last iota of intelligence they can gather about our adversaries' leaders. Blueprints, photographs, sensitive documents, and even hearsay all blended into coherent narratives and routines involving the Middle East's most famous and infamous. The lax environments their abodes exhibit would scream danger to our agents - were they tasked with protecting them. Instead, the CIA saw only chances gaping wide open.\n\nWith the leaders' lives laid bare before the Company's omnipresent eyes, certain personages believe now is the most opportune time to plunge our stiletto in the dark behind their backs."
USA_Finding_Their_Leaders_desc: "Pan-Arabism is a mass movement, with its corresponding strengths, weaknesses, and weaknesses disguised as strengths. In particular, the ideology has mobilized millions throughout the Middle East around several charismatic ideologues like Arafat and al Sadat. If the presence of such men inflamed the people's passions, then would not their sudden, abrupt absence snuff these passions out?\n\nThe United States government has always been a staunch advocate of evidence based policy. As its foremost experts in unconventional policymaking, Langley has been tasked to make conclusive results out of Pan-Arabism's greatest progeny."
USA_In_For_The_Kill_desc: "What America needs the least in the middle of its greatest economic crisis since the Depression is a protracted conflict sucking its money and attention. South Africa and Indonesia had played merry hell on both - and that was with a healthy economy. From White House to janitor, America's government has wholeheartedly resolved to prevent Saudi Arabia from spiraling into a worse repeat of the last two wars that had wasted its energies and fortunes.\n\nTo this end, the President has requested that the Pentagon draw a time table for military operations in the Middle East, immediately followed by withdrawal plans upon the war's conclusion. If Washington has its way, then American soldiers will not spend any more time in the sandbox than they absolutely must."
USA_An_Unsavory_Bargain_desc: "The Saudis have so far been reliant on American support to secure their own interests, and get out of their own predicaments no matter how trivial or significant, this can't be allowed to stand. America stands for freedom, not the interests of the regime in Riyadh, and they can't expect to stay leached onto us whenever they hit a bump in the road. As such, we'll begin de-escalating our involvement in Saudi affairs and let them figure out their messes on their own."
USA_Operation_Eagle_Eye_desc: "The Royal Saudi Air Force is, to say the least, not in great shape. Lacking any sort of professional training, the pilots of the RSAF often find themselves circling over their bases in the sky rather than engaging their adversaries in any form of active combat. Therefore, we have drawn up plans to send attachés and advisors to the Saudi Government to train their rabble until they're able to defend and shield their own airspace from enemy attacks."
USA_Our_Support_is_Conditional_desc: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has since its founding been a highly traditionalist state based on the doctrines of Wahhabism with absolute power centralised in the pawns of the ruling House of Saud. To many, it may seem inconsiderable that the United States, a bastion of liberty built on the ideals of egalitarianism, might support such an autocratic and theocratic state, but our support is not without its conditions. The Saudi State must know that unless they ease off their absolutist traditionalism and heed the calling winds of liberalisation, the American eagle's support will not be theirs for the taking."
USA_Expand_the_No_Fly_Zone_desc: "Patrolling the vast landscape of Saudi Arabia, with its sparsely populated and enormous deserts, has proven to be a challenging task for the meagre in size and under-trained Saudi air fleet. Thus, we're left with no choice but to deploy the American air force on a mission to patrol the skies of Arabia, leaving no chance for any enemy aerial attacks as well as granting the Saudis an advantaged position in their own aerial offensives against Pan-Arab strongholds."
USA_Victims_of_war_desc: "All across the Middle East, the engines of war roar to life as smoke from burning oil wells covers the skies and those who once considered each other brethren clash. The once pristine, golden sands of Arabia now lie blackened with char and stained red with spilt blood, but from these very war-torn lands come those who have lost their homes and families to the fires of revolt, wishing for nothing more than to live till the next day of their life and desperate for any relief from their struggle. While some may call it inhumane, the Saudis should utilize these victims of war to their own net benefit and organize them to aid in the defence of their nation, whether through their recruitment as soldiers or assignment to factories. After all, is a better life safe from the anxieties of poverty not worth the smallest risk of death?"
USA_Call_Up_The_Palace_desc: "The Saudi police force as it stands is a slap in the face of their facade of liberalism. Not only is it a PR nightmare, but they also rally the citizens toward the Pan-Arabs. If we want to bring order to the Middle East, and stop the Pan-Arabs and the economic crisis, we're going to need them to cooperate.\n\nWe're going to give a call to the Saudi government. We will state our request, clear up any misconceptions, and, if necessary, use less... diplomatic tactics to get them to tone down the brutality. They may not like us for it, but we do what we must."
USA_Enlist_Our_Allies_desc: "This isn't just the Saudis' and ours' problem. This is a problem for the entire OFN, and it's high time they get the message. We're going to flex our diplomatic muscles and work to get OFN boots on the ground. Of course, our allies are not just going to send their men to die out of good will alone. We'll dangle a carrot for them, offer them some favorable business deals, whatever it takes to get them to help our cause. Hopefully, the Free World will stand against the Pan-Arabs just as they do the fascists."
USA_Send_In_the_Spooks_desc: "The Royal Saudi Air Force has been out of conflict for years and hasn't bothered to upgrade their outdated fleets, and as the tranquillity that once faced Arabian sky passes, the RSAF find themselves reliant on these ancient Iron Birds for their aerial offensives. This won't cut it, and as the embers of conflict continue to burn in the deserts of Arabia with no end in sight; the Central Intelligence Agency has demanded an increase in US air support to the Hermit Kingdom. The solution proposed to the Kingdom's ails? Send them a hoist of AC-47 gunships. Modern yet massive, the sheer firepower of these "Spooks" will prove a deciding factor in the ongoing struggle for the Middle East, giving Riyadh the ability to decimate the miserable forces of their Pan-Arab foes from the skies above without even taking a single scratch."
USA_Prepare_The_Blockade_desc: "There is no easier way to strangle a war effort than to trample its supply lines, and the war in the Middle East is no exception, especially as the pan-Arabists have proven themselves to be almost entirely reliant on aid from external benefactors to supply their little revolutions with little to no ability to produce their own arms and equipment. With this in mind, our high command has concocted a plan to send a fleet to the Horn of Africa, blocking pan-Arab supply efforts and choking their own war effort. Despite not being at war with the pan-Arabs ourselves, this will prove invaluable to our effort to support our allies in Riyadh in their own conflict against the insurgent pan-Arabists."

USA_OilCrisis_Setting_Prices_desc: "Desperate times demand desperate measures, and so in order to bring an end to rampant speculation in the market and to avert runaway inflation we have decided to impose price controls on the entire oil market, from crude oil itself to all related products, including gasoline and plastics.\n\nThis is at best a plaster over a gaping wound, one which has already proven extremely unpopular and which will only cause more problems the longer it is in effect, but it has given us the moment of stability we need to consider more long-term solutions by stabilising the market and signalling our intention to get a firm grip on the energy crisis."
USA_OilCrisis_Federal_Energy_Management: "The Federal Energy Office"
USA_OilCrisis_Federal_Energy_Management_desc: "To combat the current energy crisis the President of the United States has, by Executive Order, decreed the creation of the Federal Energy Office, responsible for managing and allocating the national energy supply.\n\nTo this end the Office is empowered to collect information on America's energy needs, coordinate foreign policy initiatives aimed at securing the supply of energy resources from overseas, and to intervene directly in the market by setting prices so as to regulate the supply of energy."
USA_OilCrisis_Federal_Energy_Management_2: "Imposed Rationing"
USA_OilCrisis_Federal_Energy_Management_2_desc: "Whilst the creation of the Federal Energy Office has helped to alleviate the worse impacts of the energy crisis it is clear that the FEO's mandate will need to be expanded if we are to fully get a grip on our energy supply problems.\n\nAs such, in addition to its existing mandate for stabilising the energy market the FEO will immediately begin to impose rationing on our limited oil supplies so as to ensure that they are distributed in a fair and rational manner, with the goal of ensuring that shortages do not develop unevenly across the country."


USA.oilcrisis.1.t: "The Earth Bleeds"
USA.oilcrisis.1.desc: "The horrible fighting has begun again.\n\nBeneath the shifting sands of the Middle East oil pumps like blood through the veins of some slumbering primordial deity. Proboscoid derricks pierce the sediment in their hundreds, gluttonously sucking up the earth's bounty to feed the world's limitless thirst for petroleum. It is strange, absurd even, to think that the most valuable commodity in the world, and, indeed, the grease that spins society's cogs is little more than the corpses of prehistoric flora. And yet, every day, America burns through uncountable tons of this ancient biomass, without which our nation would grind to a screeching halt.\n\nPerhaps the only thing in the Middle East older than the land itself is the people. They wandered the sands for a thousand generations before the first city, and will surely do so again after the fall of the last. Entrenched in their ancient ways, they fought and married each other for millennia in the neverending dance of civilization, and every so often, as the years ground by, the cradle of humanity exploded into sudden and ferocious violence.\n\nOnce more, blood is spilled on the sand. Under the Italian boot for decades, the Arabs have risen up to form the nascent United Arab Republic, intent on expelling the foreigners from their homeland and taking claim of their own destiny. As the Italians desperately try to stop the spread of rebellion, the Saudi King watches from Riyadh, perhaps seeing his opportunity to grip the region in an iron fist.\n\nOur diplomatic staff, terrified of the distant explosions and gunfire they can hear from their offices, have been sending in frantic reports on the escalating crisis. Reading between the lines, the central message is clear: our oil supply is threatened. The situation appears bleak. America may soon find itself deprived of oil unless we act, soon and decisively. As the Middle East embroils itself in bloodshed, the policy-makers in Washington debate about what action to take, and our men in the Middle East are airlifted to safety, one thing is certain: it is happening again."

USA.oilcrisis.2.t: "Capital Is Commodities"
USA.oilcrisis.2.desc: "Wall Street is the heart of the American economy, and today it's beating harder than ever. Turmoil erupted on the trading floor after our plan to set prices on oil became public, and what can only be described as mass hysteria ensued as traders followed the trail of current events to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, realizing the way the wind was blowing.\n\nThankfully it proved to be a minor hiccup, and the chaos on the trading floor quickly died down. Despite the initial hullabaloo, setting prices on oil has allowed us to maintain control of Wall Street and keep the markets relatively stable, averting the economic disaster many of our advisors were certain was imminent.\n\nOf course, we've made a lot of people angry. Commodities traders in particular are unsurprisingly furious, but the anger of a gang of hair-gelled smooth-talking champagne-drinkers is a small price to pay to avoid economic meltdown."

USA.oilcrisis.3.t: "A Momentary Embolism"
USA.oilcrisis.3.desc: "Looming disaster has been avoided, for now, and oil flows again freely through America's veins thanks to our oil rationing and price-setting and the expansion of our domestic petroleum industry. Now our citizens can once again drive to their dead-end jobs and heat up their TV dinners without fear of impediment!\n\nAnd thank goodness for that, because without oil America would come apart like a house of cards in a tropical typhoon. Nevertheless, we can't let ourselves become complacent. The turmoil in the Middle East doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, and although the brunt of the crisis has been averted for the time being, if the violence escalates we can expect a similarly chaotic impact on America's markets. Our oil supplies are already stretched pretty far, and the worse it gets the more draconian our response will have to be just to keep the wheels spinning.\n\nFrankly, the reports coming in from our men in the Middle East are getting bleaker by the day. Oil distribution is still far from secure, and it appears as if none of the players have the power to end this conflict quickly. Most worryingly, we've just received a report from the CIA about several UAR nations joining into a single political entity, but who's to say if it's accurate? All kinds of rumours are pouring in, and it's getting more and more difficult to separate the truth from the baseless gossip.\n\nRight now there's no way to tell which way the wind is blowing, and that kind of uncertainty isn't good for anyone. We'll have to wait and see, but at least it seems the worst has been avoided.\n\nFor now."

USA.oilcrisis.4.t: "Our Man in Riyadh"
USA.oilcrisis.4.desc: "As the airplane's doors opened, the heat hit Bruce in the face like a nuclear blast. To a Minnesota boy used to freezing winters and mild summers, it was like stepping into a kiln. Christ, he knew it was going to be hot but this was something else. Lucifer himself would sweat in this.\n\nBruce gathered his resolve and started down the airstair to the scorching tarmac of the runway. He could already feel his shirt moistening and, after only a few seconds in Riyadh, he understood instantly why the Arabs wore those billowing robes.\n\nParked ostentatiously in the middle of the airstrip was a Rolls Royce, dark green as far as he could tell through the light reflecting blindingly off the chassis. The chauffeur opened the rear door. Bruce gave him a nod and ducked inside.\n\nGod is merciful: it was air-conditioned. Hell's bells, thought Bruce, an air-conditioned car is a luxury even back in the States and here's one in the middle of the damn desert. Sitting opposite him, and flanked by two extremely large bodyguards, was Crown Prince Khalid, swathed in enough white cloth to sew a sail for a Spanish treasure galleon. He shook Khalid's hand as the Crown Prince scrutinised him through his aviator sunglasses and responded to his pleasantries in impeccable English. "A pleasure, Mr. Laingen," he said, although his face betrayed little.\n\nAs they were driven to the Palace, Bruce and the Crown Prince stiltedly discussed the region's ongoing conflict, Bruce assuring the Prince of America's unwavering commitment to Saudi Arabia in the face of the crisis. Nevertheless, as the two discussed the merits of this or that policy, Bruce couldn't get the Rolls Royce out of his head. This man is driven in a Rolls, he thought, when his grandfather rode a camel. Would his grandson also drive a Rolls, or would the House of Saud once again ride camels over Arabia's shifting sands?"
USA.oilcrisis.4.a: "How long can they conjure money from the desert?"

USA.oilcrisis.5.t: "Smoke on the Wind"
USA.oilcrisis.5.desc: "Bruce Laingen sat resting his head on his palm, reading and re-reading the communique from Washington. He'd been ensconced in the American embassy for days, drafting policy plans in the searing heat, ceiling fans going full bore. They often revolved so fast he was half-afraid they'd spin off their axes and decapitate him. Frankly, now he'd received his orders, he was almost starting to hope for it.\n\nWith a sigh, he called in Agent Hunt, one of the latest concrete cowboys Langley had sent him. Like most Agency men in the field, Hunt was a red-blooded American with a taste for beer, football and shooting foreigners. Bruce had an almost instantaneous dislike for the man, but if they were going to be forced to work together, they may as well try and be civil. After all, personality conflicts aside, they were striving for the same goal. Bruce lit a cigarette, and offered one to Hunt. He tossed the communique over to Hunt's side of the desk.\n\n"The President's decided to put boots on the ground," he said laconically, in a carefully neutral tone of voice. He had become paranoid lately that his office might be bugged, by either the Saudis or the Agency, and did not want to give them any indication that he was doubting the efficacy of the slowly escalating policy of interventionism in the Middle East.\n\nHunt glanced over the document, then flicked his eyes to Bruce's. "We'd better get ready then, is what you're saying," he said, a barely perceptible grin on his face.\n\nBruce nodded. "Get everyone organized, the first of them are gonna be here pretty damn soon and we're nowhere near ready to receive them. And for god's sake, get Frank to keep the Saudis off my damn back!"\n\nHunt stood, and flashed Bruce a pearly white smile as he made for the door. "Hot damn, it's gonna be just like another South Africa!""
USA.oilcrisis.5.a: "The overture begins."

USA.oilcrisis.6.t: "Langley and the Saud"
USA.oilcrisis.6.desc: "Bruce examined King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the allegedly great reformer, through narrowed eyes, shimmering hazily in the cigarette smoke that filled the great banquet hall. He found it darkly amusing to see the normally so uptight Saudis sitting around smoking, drinking and groping dancing girls, all the vices they spent so much hypocritical breath decrying.\n\nThe King himself had apparently been handsome in his youth, but Bruce couldn't see any evidence of it now. Surrounded by giggling wives and concubines a third of his age, the King was bloated, droopy and covered in liver spots. He reminded Bruce of a scoop of rum and raisin ice cream that had been left sitting in the sun.\n\nAnd yet, despite all outward appearances, King Faisal was one of the shrewdest political operators he'd ever met. The man was wily as a fox.\n\nBruce noticed suddenly that the King was looking in his direction. He beckoned for Bruce to come to him at the other end of the table, and Bruce went without hesitation. When the King beckons, you come.\n\nThe King liked to project an urbane aura when speaking to Westerners, but Bruce could detect the hint of menace lurking beneath the King's friendly facade. "My dear Mr. Laingen! I did not know you were here. A pleasure to see you once again in the Palace! I trust things are progressing at the Embassy?"\n\nSneaky bastard, thought Bruce. He knows full well I was on the guest list. His reply, however, was far more deferential. "Yes, your majesty. Our defence and intelligence network has been thoroughly established. Our agents are at your disposal to root out the traitors to your rule."\n\nThe King smiled, but his eyes were as cold and immovable as a glacier. "My dear Bruce, I must commend you! You do your nation credit. We are proud to have the United States as our ally."\n\nBruce kept his face carefully neutral. Are you?, he wondered."

USA.oilcrisis.7.t: "The Silent Majority Speaks"
USA.oilcrisis.7.desc: "We could hardly have expected our deployment of ground combat troops to Saudi Arabia to remain covert for long, and since it's gone public we've become inundated with opposition to our escalation of the American presence in the Middle East. Students and South Africa veterans have staged anti-war demonstrations in several universities and parks across America, and they've made public their plans to march on Washington to call for a halt in deployment.\n\nSenators from both parties of the divided coalition are being buried in angry letters from constituents, many of them who had family who died in Africa, and consequently are urgently calling in Congress for a freeze in troop deployments or, for the more radical Senators, a total withdrawal.\n\nWe'd lose serious face in the international community if we just pulled out, and we can't abandon the Saudis, slimy bastards though they may be, without jeopardising our oil supply. All we can do is hope tensions don't keep escalating and we get stuck in a war we can't win. Goddamn it all, why does such an oil-rich region have to be so unstable?"

Rag-tag guerrillas are no match for American airpower.\n\nUnfortunately, their friends might be. German diplomats have made their nation's displeasure clear, calling us hypocrites for running operations in the no-fly zone. Germany's opposition, of course, does not come from a love of peace but from a desire to protect their sometime-allies in the pan-Arabist movement, presumably afraid that an unfriendly faction taking control of the region could throttle their oil supply.\n\nUltimately, what do we care what they think? Germany is unlikely to put boots on the ground in the Middle East in order to avoid a confrontation, and, after all, we're in desperate need of the oil too. Better we pump it into America rather than allow it to grease the gears of the cruellest superpower in history."

USA.oilcrisis.9.t: "Taming the Beast"
USA.oilcrisis.9.desc: "You'd have to be a damn fool to trust the Saudis, but they're the only native group in the region even slightly friendly to the US. Nobody could say that they were reliable, but having the Saudis on our side gives us a valuable beachhead into the Middle East to protect exports of precious, precious oil.\n\nNevertheless, the values of Saudi Arabia are distasteful even to the most hardline reactionaries back home, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify our alignment with a nation so diametrically opposed to the virtues of freedom and liberty that Americans hold dear. It's hard to see the Saudis as the lesser of two evils when they deny women even the most basic rights and behead political and religious prisoners like some kind of medieval warlord. Some commentators back home are even comparing the pan-Arabists to the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, which, presumably, would cast us in the role of King George.\n\nIf we're going to back the Saudis, it's our responsibility to try and nudge them away from hardline conservative Salafism. The idea of a republican or, Allah forgive me for uttering this word, secular Arabia is a pipe dream, but if we carefully influence Saudi thought leaders we can perhaps engender positive social change in Arabia.\n\nThe CIA's current plan is a covert operation to influence the hearts and minds of Saudi Arabians who might be sympathetic to our ideals, mainly non-Salafist intellectuals and the petit bourgeois. The Saudi upper crust would balk at sudden change, but perhaps over the next few decades of our association with them we can nudge the oil kingdom in a brighter direction."

USA.oilcrisis.10.desc: "They are streaming across the border in their tens of thousands, many of them with little more than the babies in their arms and the clothes on their backs. Every war creates refugees, but the sudden brutality of the conflict in the Middle East is annihilating ancient ways of life and sending people fleeing from the land their ancestors have occupied for centuries in a way never seen before, and they're all flocking to what appears to be the last remaining beacon of stability in the region: the Saudi Kingdom.\n\nMost of them aren't exactly friendly to Saudi or Western interests, but more than that, they fear and hate the men who expelled them from their homes. As the pan-Arabists spread their tentacles over more and more of the Middle East, that hate could be a powerful weapon against an increasingly dangerous enemy.\n\nOur man in Riyadh, veteran diplomat Bruce Laingen, has presented us with a plan drawn up by two CIA operatives under his command, Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt. It suggests training and arming the refugees and sending them back into the fray as a totally deniable army to fight the pan-Arabists without smearing red, white and blue across the Middle East. If it seems like we're uninvolved, the local response will likely be far more amenable to a native army whose interests just happen to coincide with our own. This could be a way for us to exert our influence in the region without having to send our boys to die in the desert."

USA.oilcrisis.11.desc: "A servant led Bruce into the garden, filled with lush green leaves dripping water from the afternoon's storm. The towering date palms let very little light into the courtyard, and in the twilight it was filled with a dim purple glow. By a shimmering pool sat King Faisal, sipping coffee from a silver goblet.\n\nThe King motioned for Bruce to sit. At some unspoken signal the garden was suddenly empty. The King set his coffee down and gazed into the pool. At last he began to speak, not looking up.\n\n"America is a young country, is it not? Forged in the fires of revolution some two centuries past. Indeed, the very ideals that drive your nation are scarcely older than America itself."\n\nHe glanced up to meet Bruce's eyes, and Bruce shuddered in the coldness of his gaze. "We are an old culture. The legacy of the Arab people goes back far further than your own, our way of life is founded on values and ideals millennia older than yours. Our faith in God is the driving force behind our society, tradition its cornerstone. You must come to understand this or someday the desert will consume you as it has so many others."\n\nThe garden darkened as the sun slipped below the horizon. "I love to sit here after the rain," confided the King, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his belly. "The coolness after a storm is a rare pleasure in Riyadh. Imagine the hubris to construct a garden such as this! This palace and its garden will be here long after America has crumbled into the sands of time, and the ways of our people will exist as unchanged in the years to come as they have for so many centuries." He glanced over at Bruce. "I hope you understand."\n\nBruce heard the message loud and clear: the King wanted an end to the CIA's program of liberalization. Heart in his throat, he felt a sudden burst of fury at the veiled threats of this decrepit old wreck. "Your people once built great gardens in Córdoba, your majesty, before the forces of Christendom burned them to the ground. You should consider the fate of the Moors before you make threats."\n\nWith that he rose, and left the King to sit alone in the twilit darkness of his garden."

Apparently, the CIA has been meeting with university professors, business owners and the like to discuss liberal policy change in the Kingdom. They've even held several secret meetings with the ones most sympathetic to their degenerate views.\n\nFaith and tradition are the cornerstones of our society, without them we are nothing. We're perfectly happy to accept American money and American guns, but they can keep their corrupt values. It's time we identify those they've influenced and make sure they're silenced. The Americans can hardly just pull their aid, not when they're as oil-starved as they are, and that might be all we need to put an end to the toxic ideas spewing forth from the American embassy.\n\nOur ways have survived the long ages and a parade of conquerors, whose bones lie forgotten under the sands while we carry on.

In fact, it seems more likely that the greatest warriors in this war will be clerks in lightless Washington basements, tapping away at typewriters, furiously trying to find ways to divert funds to our friends in the Middle East.\n\nUsing some creative accounting, the CIA has managed to requisition a squadron of state-of-the-art fighters and have been able to throw some of America's finest pilot aces into the package. Our new planes are set to soon arrive at Port Dammam, and our boys in Riyadh have already drawn up plans for ambitious missions against the pan-Arabist menace.\n\nWe don't plan to let the Middle East and its oil escape our grasp just 'cause the limp-wrists back home balk at the idea of dropping a few million tons of bombs on people who are fighting, as we once did, for their freedom, liberty and right to self-determination. Now we can finally take the fight to those damn guerrillas, who'll surely have a tougher time achieving their dream of a unified Arab state when everything they build gets blown to dust the next day.

Our supply of oil is not ensured, while our enemies in the region are starved of their main source of funding.\n\nNow that we've got a good, tight stranglehold over outgoing trade, we can throttle the enemy until they're crying uncle.

The icy cold drink and the frantically rotating ceiling fans did little to cool him down.\n\nAfter Hunt left in a huff, swearing that something had to be done about "those damn slimy Arabs", Bruce sat back, wondering what was to be done. He got up and walked to the window, flicking open the Venetian blinds. Past the low, white buildings of Riyadh he could see the endless desert expanse, stretching all the way out into the scorching nothingness of the Empty Quarter. The view reminded him often of what Minnesota might look like if it was covered in sand. Like Arabia, the only round things in Minnesota were the fruit on the trees and some of the people.\n\nAnd yet, despite the similarity of the land they inhabited, the people of Minnesota and Arabia couldn't have been more different. He often found himself unable to understand why the locals did anything they did, why they held onto these bizarre, archaic beliefs. It was like living in a kingdom from the Dark Ages that had been dumped into the twentieth century.\n\nBruce closed the blinds and went to sit back behind his desk, slumping into the chair, still moist with his sweat. The authoritarian Saudi police would have to be dealt with if Americans were to operate unrestricted through the country. The Saudis would hate it, of course, and he had little doubt that the King and the Crown Prince would try every possible tactic to keep the status quo, but if they didn't stop harassing American operatives they'd feel the wrath of Uncle Sam.\n\nHe took a page and began to draft up some ideas to handle the situation, narrowing it down to two main contenders: play nice with the Saudis, maybe throw them a bone or two, or serve them a veiled threat by reminding them that America could pull out and cut off their lifeline if they didn't get back over the line."

Bruce was forced to repeat himself with each one of them: reform their authoritarian and overzealous police force, or suffer a reduction in American funding.\n\nTheir reaction was invariably the same. It consisted of a brief explanation of the importance in the kingdom of Sharia law, tradition, faith, yadda yadda. All stuff he'd heard before, and like before he found it impossible to believe after seeing what the Saudi upper crust were like behind closed doors. When he had requested to meet with the King, or the Crown Prince, he was told blankly that they were not receiving visitors. Frankly, he wasn't surprised he was on the King's shit-list after their little confrontation in the garden, but now he couldn't even talk to him?\n\nSo the Saudis wanted to play hardball did they? Well, two could play at that game. Back in his stifling office, Bruce wondered how to deal with them. God knew he wanted to turn the screws on the bastards, but the angel on his shoulder was being very insistent in telling him to take the high road and back off. Even so, he couldn't shake off his anger at their condescension, brushing him off like he wasn't threatening to throttle their aid. He narrowed his eyes. Surely they had to be bluffing...?"

USA.oilcrisis.17.desc: ""Goddamn Saudis!" yelled Bruce Laingen, impotently flinging his mug against the wall. It shattered in a cascade of ceramic debris. He swung to his terrified secretary, a cringing suburbanite from Long Island. "Get the hell out!" he spat. She vanished from the room faster than Bruce's hopes for a quiet day without trouble from the Saudis.\n\nBruce slumped into his chair, the leather instantly sticking his shirt to his back. It was the Chinese, he recalled, who cursed people by wishing them to live in interesting times. The Saudis were making his life extremely interesting indeed. His attempt to intimidate the Saudis by threatening to pull out had been a complete and utter failure. He could almost feel Faisal and Khalid and the rest of the aviator-wearing bastards laughing at him in the Palace.\n\nBruce laid his head in his hands. The Saudis knew America needed them, and they knew America was desperate for oil. He was supposed to be working them, and yet somehow they'd maneuvered him into a corner. Faisal was calling the shots now, and he had sent a letter filled with extremely thinly veiled threats, in essence a demand for the CIA's social liberalization program to be discontinued and for American interference in Saudi internal politics to be immediately halted. There was the suggestion that further interference could result in a butterfly effect leading to a halt in oil shipments to the United States. It didn't take a genius to read between the lines there.\n\nWell, Bruce thought, they've sure got us over a barrel here. He sighed. After all, what did he care about democracy in the Middle East? As long as the oil kingdom kept up the shipments, Washington would be happy."
USA.oilcrisis.17.a: "God forbid Americans not have power for their hair dryers and microwaves."

USA.oilcrisis.18.t: "Diplomacy, the Stepford Method"
USA.oilcrisis.18.desc: "Sitting down in the plush upholstered chair, Bruce thanked every god that might be listening for air conditioning. On the other side of the ludicrously oversized mahogany table sat King Faisal, the Crown Prince, and a number of ministers. The usual suspects, in other words.\n\nBruce plastered a smile on his face, hoping he didn't look too ingenuous. After their tiff in the garden, he was surprised but glad the King had agreed to meet with him. He may have grown to hate the slippery, corpulent warlord, but god knows America needed a stable oil-exporting ally in the region, and the Saudis were just about the only option.\n\nAfter the stilted pleasantries, the real discussion began, both sides trying to get as much as possible from their opponent while giving up as little as possible, the endless dance of diplomacy, negotiating and bargaining. Bruce was in his element. Determined to control himself, he gave the Saudis several minor concessions they wanted. It seemed to make them happy, but with the Saudis it was difficult to tell.\n\nFinally, after over an hour of dancing around it, the central point came up at last. Bruce's attempts to play nice with the Saudis had at least gotten his foot in the door, and now it was time to wedge the door open or forever give it up. As much as they pretended at supreme military dominance, Bruce knew the Saudi military was far from the juggernaut the King wished he had at his disposal. He could, of course, just play it cool, restore friendly relations and avoid further embarrassment... or, he considered, he could offer them the weapons agreement he knew they wanted. If a bunch of new toys couldn't mollify Faisal and get him to cooperate, Bruce reflected grimly, it was probable nothing would."
USA.oilcrisis.18.a: "Get the presents ready and don't bother with the gift wrap."

USA.oilcrisis.19.t: "A Bargain At Half the Price"
USA.oilcrisis.19.desc: "Bruce stood sipping coffee at the window in his office as he watched the dust cloud build over the horizon. After a few minutes, the first in the line of brand-new American troop transports emblazoned with Saudi emblems came powering over the rise into the suburbs of Riyadh. Next would be the tanks, and the helicopters, and the cargo loads of guns, explosives, yadda yadda.\n\nHe drew the blinds and sat down. The King was signing the laws to put a leash on his overzealous police force and to allow a few token liberalizations in a closed ceremony in the Palace. It hadn't even made the news, which Bruce was sure wasn't an accident. Along with the seemingly endless materiel, the Saudis were getting millions more in aid and development funds siphoned by the Agency's oh-so-clever accountants in Washington.\n\nAs he listened to the trucks rumble past, Bruce blackly sipped his coffee. When he thought about it, the Saudis had gotten a hell of a lot more out of his agreement than he'd managed to get for America. He felt like a customer in a bazaar who thought he'd gotten a great bargain out of a haggle but had actually gotten swindled. He'd been warned Faisal was an infamous political operator, and yet somehow along the way Bruce had let him get the better of him. He supposed he'd had a chance to get the upper hand at some point, but he must have missed it. He almost had to admire them for it. Almost.\n\nFaisal and Khalid and the rest of them must be having a good laugh up at the Palace at having got one over on that degenerate heathen American. And yet, what could he possibly have done? America needed the Saudis on their side, for better or for worse. Anything as long as it kept the oil flowing.\n\nFinishing his coffee, Bruce sighed, and hoped it wouldn't be long until he could go home to the snowy plains of Minnesota, and never have to step foot in the desert again."
USA.oilcrisis.19.a: "Don't blow it all up in one place."

USA.oilcrisis.20.t: "Diplomatic Impudence"
USA.oilcrisis.20.desc: "Bruce sat, stunned, as the door swung shut. He looked up and down the now-empty room. After a minute, he realized they weren't coming back.\n\nAs he was driven back to the embassy, Bruce sat in the back seat in the depths of a fell mood, his every muscle tensed. When he had offered a new weapons agreement to the King in exchange for token liberalizations and further cooperation from his government, the King had sneered, calling the United States weak and decadent. His ministers and the Crown Prince rising with him, King Faisal had declared that he would never compromise the deeply held beliefs and values of the Arabian people to appease America, especially not for what he deemed a "bribe". The King left sneering, cursing Americans as servants of Mammon.\n\nBruce was fuming. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was somehow personal, the King's retaliation for the harsh words they had exchanged in the garden. Could the man really be so vain that he would sacrifice such a one-sided deal for something so petty? Perhaps he had underestimated Faisal and his coterie.\n\nOf course, this didn't mark the end of America's association with the Saudis. They had become entangled into a frankly dangerous symbiotic relationship, the Saudis relying on America's military power and influence, and the Americans on Saudi oil. And here he was, Bruce Laingen of Butterfield, Minnesota, somehow caught up in the middle of it.\n\nGoddamn it all, he thought. All he could do now was try to satisfy Washington without rocking the boat too much. It was clear now that there would never be democracy in the Middle East if they were unwilling to give up their medieval practices. As long as the oil kept flowing Stateside, it would be enough.\n\nBruce leaned back into the richly upholstered leather, and dreamed of returning to the snowy fields of Minnesota."

USA.oilcrisis.100.t: "The Machine Falters"
USA.oilcrisis.100.desc: "Like any engine worth the name, the American economy functions on a continuous flow of oil. Its bitumen pave the country's many thousand miles of highway; its petrols, kerosenes and diesels fuel the trucks, planes, ships and cars transferring money and goods from city to city; its naptha and gas compose many chemicals and heat many homes. Whether from rigs off the Louisiana coast or the bountiful wells in the Arabian Peninsula, cheap oil is the linchpin keeping the world's strongest economy strong from the bottom up.\n\nThen one sunny day in the turn of the decade, oil prices quadruple to $12 a barrel. And like an engine with neither lubricant nor fuel, the world's strongest economy sputters into a sudden stop. Pandemonium strikes Wall Street's floors as indexes dovetail past their troughs with no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Main Street fares little better: look only at the miles-long lines of cars outside gas stations across the country, both awaiting shipments of fuel that will never come. As conflagrations spark abroad, the crisis they have brought to America's shores have skyrocketed the prices of goods while simultaneously keeping people from earning money for them - in other words, a cataclysm poised to stunt, even reverse, a decade of growth.\n\nAmerica turns desperately to Capitol Hill for an answer to the world's first ever oil shock. Congress turns desperately to the White House for solutions to a quandary that evades modern economic thought. The buck has now landed on the Resolute Desk; when and how shall its occupant respond?"

Their inability to contain, or at least moderate, the Arab people's unrest has caused wave after wave of disruptions to the world's largest supplier of cheap sweet crude oil. A sizable faction within the government grumble if America's resources are better served hastening the ailing empire's decline; seeing as Italy is now an OFN member-state, Washington has decided that supporting its newfound ally's weakening grip over Arabia is the surest way of stabilizing global oil supply.\n\nStill, even proponents of pro-Italian intervention are divided over its extents - whether overt military action or covert black operations best complement Rome's own efforts. President [Root.GetName] has resolved this dilemma by vacillating between sides until the Pentagon can provide a clearer assessment of the Middle East's situation as is."

Who shall be America's beneficary? While vigorous debate has sprung over who America should suppor, recent intelligence suggests that the Reich is sending support to the Baathists in an attempt to utilize the faction for their own nefarious schemes.

His agents have noticed a steady increase in anti-war rhetoric: newspapers, radio broadcasts and several opposition politicians are criticizing the choice to send "our boys" to "die in the jungles and quagmires of a god-forsaken hell" and, while the tones are still kept civil, small non-violent protests and marches are breaking up in counties where the draft has been felt more extensively.\n\nWhile the effects of such propaganda are still limited, the report considers "very likely" that a prosecution of the hostilities with the Afrika-Schild will only worsen the current state of affairs, and urges "immediate gains" to quell the discontent, or we'll risk facing a severely worse situation in the next months."

USA.saf.effects.4.t: "What Happened in Hamlet 773"
USA.saf.effects.4.desc: "The village had no name. On the US maps of the area, it was called Hamlet 773. Like so many others, It was a squalid collection of huts whose inhabitants made their meagre living by grazing cattle. It would forever have avoided the pages of history, if it wasn't for one ill-fated patrol.\n\nAnd so, in the baking heat of the afternoon, they came. A group of American soldiers strode into Hamlet 773, guns out. It had been months since any Americans had come their way, and they all came out to see them. Their leader was a boy with pimples on his face. He indicated the oldest man present, the village elder, and began to shout at him, his voice cracking, his pale face growing red.\n\nThe elder, unable to speak English, tried to figure out what he wanted, but the boy soon lost patience. He shouted at his troops, and they moved into the huts, ransacking them. As the elder approached the American to ask him to stop, the boy struck him to the ground. Lights swam behind the elder's eyes as he wiped the blood from his face. He could hear shouting, in Tswana and English. Looking through clouded eyes, he saw a group of women approach the boy, pointing at him and yelling. The elder tried to entreat them to calm, but the words died in his throat.\n\nEverything after that happened so suddenly. A girl ran from the group. She didn't get five paces before a shot rang through the air and she dropped like a ragdoll. The elder tried to rise, fell. Shots tore through the air above him. Silence. Then the wailing began.\n\nIt hadn't taken more than ten seconds. Gathering what little remained of his strength, the elder rose to his knees. Twisted bodies lay everywhere. Women, children. The American boy was shouting, his voice cracking. The elder looked back to his people, the few still upright keening, wide-eyed with horror. He began to crawl, but felt his spirit fading, like a cloud passing into the distance. Fainter, fainter..."

USA.saf.effects.5.desc: "It was a dusty morning in the bushveld the day doom came from the sky.\n\nDistant horns sounded forth from the clouds, and it was the din of the Seventh Seal being broken, and the Boers looked skyward and exalted, for they were simple folk, dirt-farmers one and all, and knew the signs of Judgment Day. They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the Kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal craft came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and flames rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from them. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any conqueror of antiquity. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. The helicopters left back through the smoke, leaving the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten."

Backed by the bleak vastness of the sky, the weary Americans passed through the kraal.\n\nIt was barely a village, a collection of shacks made of rubbish and dry wood, a handful of emaciated goats and sheep who gazed forlornly on the men as they made their way into the center of the feeble settlement. Their leader, a boy with patchy fuzz on his upper lip, looked around him into the houses, and saw in the gaps between planks the sullen red faces sneering at him with the hateful eyes of the conquered.\n\nEvacuate, he called, once, twice. They only glared and snarled in their pig-speech, and the boy felt his anger stoked at their contempt. Forward, he motioned, and the masked men approached with their strange machines, and the villagers watched them in confusion.\n\nWithout further warning, fire poured forth and the shacks went up in flames. Screaming, they began to flee, clutching babies and valuables, crashing to the ground as shots ripped through the air, tearing into their sunburned skin in fountains of blood.\n\nWithin minutes, the all-consuming fire had cleansed the village from the face of the Earth. All that remained was the ash, and the bodies, and the boy-commander gazing upon the destruction he had wrought with faraway eyes. Sifting through the remains, the Americans found no evidence of the hidden Boer cache they had come so far to find. As dry thunder boomed over the highveld, they turned and returned the way they had come, between the jagged rocks, back down the sandy road."

Instantly he felt in his gut that something wasn't right. They had been sent to reinforce the men already there, but this was meant to be a simple reconnaissance mission. The mud was littered with corpses - children, women, old men. There didn't seem to be any of draft-age, or any with weapons.\n\nThompson ordered the helicopter to land in the center of the village, where he could see a few Americans milling about. He disembarked and, as he approached the nearest private, he was startled by an African woman stumbling from a nearby hut, naked, groaning, blood running down her legs. A shot rang out. Her head blew apart in a fountain of brain matter and skull fragments. The woman's body slammed to the dirt in a pool of gore.\n\nA man came out from the hut, stepping over the corpse, one hand holding his pistol and the other doing up his zipper. "Who's in charge here?" demanded Thompson.\n\n"That'd be me," said the soldier, unaffected. "Name's Calley. You our relief?" Thompson stared at him in horror as an enfilade of shots rang out behind him, at the other end of the village. He got into Calley's unshaken face. "Just what in the hell is going on here, Lieutenant?"\n\n"Just following orders," replied Calley, "giving these savages a taste of American firepower."\n\n"But- these are unarmed civilians, human beings, sir!" More shots. Thompson winced. Calley lit a cigarette. "Look buddy, this is my show. I'm in charge here. If you ain't interested in doing your damn job why don't you fuck off back to your chopper and mind your own business?"\n\nThompson carefully glanced around. Calley's men were staring at him, slowly moving towards him from the sides, surrounding him. "You ain't heard the last of this!", he snarled impotently as he stepped back into the helicopter. Raising over the village, he saw a group of soldiers push a handful of girls and old men into a ditch and open fire.\n\nThompson desperately tried to raise the colonel on the radio, receiving only static. Meanwhile he could do nothing but watch the orgy of killing unfold below him, helpless to stop it."

Blonde hair, blue eyes, the German pedigree. The rags of his uniform identified him as an officer of the SS. A shot to the spine had left him paralyzed below the waist, and he had laid there since the battle in a pool of his own filth, drinking tainted rainwater from the mud and praying for a clean death. He would not get it.\n\nThe German fumbled for his gun as he saw the Americans approach, but they got to him first. It was all the excuse they needed. The men of Tiger Force tied cables around his legs and attached them to the back of the APC, then took him on a spin through the grime of the battlefield, dragging him over the ruined bodies of his comrades, through the congealed gore. First he shouted, then he screamed, then he begged and cried and called for his Mutti, and finally he was silent.\n\nAt a sharp turn, his head was dashed against a rock, shattering his skull, his brain matter splattering across the mud.

One of the men punched him full force in the stomach and the chest, over and over again as the other watched, asking questions he didn't know the answers to. After a time, the torturer went to wash his hands clean while the Boer spat blood onto the concrete floor. It glistened in the harsh yellow glare of the sodium lights.\n\nNext came the pliers. He was determined not to scream, but his resolve broke immediately as the frowning torturer ripped out his thumbnail. The questioner continued in his monotonous drone, speaking the Afrikaans of one who had not been born to it. Where were they, how many were there, where were the supplies coming from. All the Boer could say was that he did not know, but they were not satisfied. After his remaining fingernails were lying on the floor in pools of blood, the torturer went to work on his teeth.\n\nAfter a time, the Boer awoke. He wondered how much time had passed in the dank, stinking cellar. The torturer wheeled a car battery forward and attached jumper cables to it, then clipped the clamps to his nipples. The Boer felt electricity light his brain up like a Christmas tree. For a moment the shock was so strong he didn't even feel the pain, but it came. Oh, it came. When he proved once again unable to answer their questions, the torturer swapped the clamps to his testicles.\n\nEventually, morning came. In an alley in Cape Town, down by the docks, a nondescript door opened. A young man with slicked-back red hair walked outside into the dim sunlight, rolling his shoulders and stretching his neck. Behind him, he awkwardly dragged a garbage bag, the contents sloshing around with every step. He heaved it into an already overflowing dumpster, and, shielding his eyes from morning's bright light, made his way back inside.\n\nSoon, they would be bringing in the next prisoner."

Tanks, helicopters and all kinds of weapons and explosives were littered across the continent in abandoned camps. Among this bounty, claimed by the Americans, was the Germans' invisible killer: poison gas.\n\nAs the men of Tiger Force advanced across the savannah, they ransacked many such camps, eventually coming into possession of a sizable stock of gas grenades, which they carried around with them, itching to find some krauts to use them on.\n\nIt was a regular patrol, to yet another of the half-empty hamlets that dotted the savannah. Their radio was on the fritz again, so as they milled around waiting for new orders, they decided to play a game: see how far away they could chuck a gas grenade into the village's well.\n\nA ruddy-faced corporal eventually managed it at ten paces. As the grenade clattered down into the well, they heard the pin get ripped out and the hiss of the gas filling the well as the grenade sunk into the water.\n\nAn old African approached them, yelling, repeating "Poison, poison!" over and over again. With a sneer the corporal shoved him to the dirt, his buddies laughing. Their laughter was cut short as more villagers came out of their huts, first curious to see what all the fuss was about, then furious. The elder stood, his nose bloodied, and began to shout at them. The other villagers were shouting too, closing in.\n\nWhen they stood before the panel at their disciplinary hearing, every man of Tiger Force said they didn't know who had fired the first shot, or who had thrown the poison grenade into the village's only source of water. Nevertheless, when the smoke had cleared, the ground was littered with shattered corpses. The few survivors were evacuated from their ancestral lands and, as the days went by, the plants and animals withered and died as the poison spread through the soil.

It is easy to deal death from a distance, never having to look into the enemy's eyes, hear them cry and scream and beg for mercy.\n\nThe bombs screamed downward, whistling through the air, but the pilot didn't hear them. Before their impact, there was a moment of peace that seemed to stretch for an eternity, where everything was locked where it was. Then the explosions blasted across the savannah, blowing apart the trucks in an eruption of twisted metal.\n\nSatisfied with a job well done, the pilot turned back to base. He would never see the villagers running to the shattered remains of the convoy, horrified to see their shipment of vital supplies obliterated, not a scrap remaining, and the road torn apart, their only lifeline to the outside world.\n\nHe would never see the children starving, the people dying of curable disease, the death and agony of their eventual migration away from their ancestral lands, desperate to survive. That flash of metal in the sky, sighted above the village for a split second, had forever decided their destinies, destroying lives, wiping a whole community from the map, but the man who had pushed the button would know none of this. After dozens of subsequent missions, he would scarcely even remember it."

President [USA.GetLeader] spoke to the nation from the Oval Office to announce the victory, and that America's brave boys will be returning home "...as soon as humanly possible."\n\nEven as the first chartered PanAm flights touched down at airports across the Eastern Seaboard, crowds of thousands filled terminals and parking lots, waving flags, singing the national anthem, and cheered heartwarming scenes of tired soldiers hugging and kissing their young wives and children, snapped by photographers to be shared in newspapers and preserved for eternity. The Secretary of Defense has announced plans to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C. to honor the returned veterans that "saved a continent from barbarity and slavery."\n\nWith the defeat of the Nazis in Africa, now comes the long and tough work to rebuild half a continent for a bright and democratic future. War crimes trials will be held to try the captured SS and Wehrmacht soldiers, as well as the Boer irregulars, that caused so much death and destruction. New nations will be set up, to allow the people of Africa to make their own destiny, and fully supported and rebuilt by American money and technical expertise. And of course, millions of people: former slaves, war amputees, orphans, the hungry and sick, will have to be cared for in Africa, as will our own troops who have seen bloody battles and gruesome deeds that few believe humans are capable of.\n\nBut that is tomorrow's job.

The forces of the three Nazi Reichskommissariats and their Boer lackeys has proven to be too much for the United States and the Organization of Free Nations, and our toehold for democracy and free markets in Afrika has fallen.\n\nWhile we were able to withdraw many of the troops before the final collapse, by sea or air, many of our brave boys have been captured and forced to surrender, marched off to prisoner of war camps. What happens to them next, we have no idea. Considering the SS fanatics that ran the Afrika-Schild, it most likely won't be good. And of course, the supporters of freedom and liberty in South Africa will soon be rounded up, sent to concentration camps, or outright murdered.\n\nAs the Nazi's parade through Johannesberg and Pretoria, the American people are in an uproar. How did this happen? Why did we spend so much on a failed war? How can we justify the death and injury of our soldiers? Congress is already opening investigations into the Army and President [USA.GetLeader]'s handling of the war, while resignations and firings are rocking the administration. Francis Parker Yockey and Gus Hall, while normally bitter ideological opponents, have joined together to denounce the President and the incompotent political leaders of both the RDC and the NPP.\n\nWith this second defeat to the Nazi's in 25 years, American morale is at its lowest ebb as the flags are lowered to half mast."

While it wasn't a full on defeat, it's hard to claim a victory, as much as President [USA.GetLeader] and his supporters try to spin it. Sure, South Africa still exists and can hold free and fair-elections, but the three Reichskommissariats have strengthened their position in Africa, and have established an allied-Afrikaner Volkstaat, reducing our ally to a rump state.\n\nThe result has seen the American people bitterly divided: all the sacrifice that had been made to keep South Africa free and defeat the Nazi's was apparently wasted, as South Africa is now smaller and weaker, and the RK's are stronger than ever. If just another division had been sent earlier, or more bombing runs had been launched, or just a bit more effort had been made, then the war would have gone differently, and we wouldn't be left with this unsatisfying, and unstable victory. Others say we should have cut and run sooner, so the casualties and news reports of dead soldiers and brunt villages didn't cause the public morale collapse, or resulted in the deaths of many young men. The what-ifs and could-have-beens, however, will have to be left to the historians and the President's political opponents to fight over in the future.\n\nWhile the fighting is over for now, it's clear that South Africa will need our assistance and help to survive, and to maintain a toehold in Africa."

At the same time, the OFN was unable to erase the stain of Fascism from Africa, so the status quo remains.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] maintains that the goal of the intervention in Africa was just this: protecting our allies and "containing" Nazism to its current borders and preventing it from spreading like a disease around the world. However, many politicians and generals stated their desire to drive the fascists back, and liberate all of sub-saharan Africa from our ideological opponents. While these words were more hopeful than concrete policy goals, a decent chunk of the general public that had heard time and time again that America was fighting for democracy and freedom are not content with what some are calling a "half-finished war." While no one is exactly saying that they want to go right back to war and utterly destroy the RK's as the troops are arriving home, except maybe a few warhawks on the fringes of Congress, there is a listlessness and dissatisfaction that pervades the population over the stalemate.\n\nNevertheless, with South Africa intact and free, and the dominos stopped before they fall, we can be satisfied, if not enthusiastic, about the outcome."

However, President [USA.GetLeader], in comments made at the White House Press Briefing, stated that "...the US and OFN have accomplished all their goals in the fight in South Africa. The Reichskommissariats have had their capabilities dismantled, our ally is secure, and we've liberated many of the subject peoples of Nazi tyranny."

USA.saf.war.missions.1.desc: "Today, the Afrika-Schild suffers a serious blow. Despite constant aerial bombings from increasingly desperate defenders, the South African army, supported by elements of the OFN coalition, has taken Windhoek, administrative center of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika, after almost a day of furious fighting. The central compound of the colonial government was the last sector of the city to fall, as almost two hundred soldiers, supported by a battalion of the native SS, had bunkered in the heavily-fortified building, forcing the American troops to clear the underground corridors and booby-trapped halls with flamethrowers and military engineers.\n\nThe last weeks had seen the combined Allied troops inflicting defeat after defeat against the Reichskommissariat, steadily gaining ground against a weakened and demoralized opponent, but this might be the turning point for the war: with the fall of Windhoek, the Schild has lost its largest air fields, and large supplies fuel and airplane parts have been seized by the attackers before the Germans could retreat.\n\nReichskommissar Schenck has managed to flee the city on his personal fighter, and in his first statement he has sworn "to bring back the German flag to Windhoek", but with the western front in disarray and Schild troops still retreating, many doubt whether he'll be able to keep faith to his word."

On the contrary, the defeat spurred the Reichskommissariate to reorganize and react: after several days spent planning and concentrating troops and supplies, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte launched a general offensive on the occupied city. Troops from the entire coalition attacked with fierceness bordering desperation, and despite heavy losses managed to push the frontline until the South Africans and their American allies had to fall back to the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt was immediately evident how ill-prepared had been the defenders, as they never thought the Germans would actually be able to react to the last defeat. Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads. Rather than suffering heavy losses, the commander preferred to retreat from the city, and convoys filled with soldiers and supplies quickly left the cities the night before the attack.\n\nThe following day, the German troops entered the liberated Windhoek in triumph, though the locals seemed less than happy to welcome their saviors. Reichskommissar Schenck returned to the city hailed by his soldiers, and resumed his post in the administrative compound, now under heavy repairs. The victory has been broadcasted all the way to Germania, and reinvigorated the morale of the Afrika-Schild.

Situated very close to the initial frontlines of the war, Bloemfontein, capital of the newly-established Afrikaner Volkstaat, had little time to prepare: despite the efforts of the garrison commander, lack of manpower and materials due to the poor industrial development of the region meant that only makeshift defences, mainly a few prefabricated bunkers, trenches and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the outskirts, could be erected in time for the South African offensive.\n\nDespite a fierce resistance, the city garrison couldn't repel the attackers and was soon forced to retreat inwards: emergency barricades were built by auxiliaries, and several buildings were booby-trapped or set on fire to slow down the foe, but in the end it wasn't enough. After a brief last stand in the town hall, the officer in command of the city agreed to the surrender terms offered by the Federation: the civilian irregulars were disarmed and allowed to return to their families, while all others were taken prisoners.\n\nEven though the government evacuated the city long before the offensive began, due to safety reasons, the fall of Bloemfontein is still a hard blow to take for the Boer cause. Morale is falling all throughout the insurgent forces, and many have begun to question their German allies: if this is how the war is turning out to be, then it may not be long before peace returns."

In a strange mockery of time and human fortunes, the South African commander surrendered at the very table where his Boer predecessor had done the same thing.\n\nWith the liberation of Bloemfontein, the frontline has returned as it was at the start of the war, and many within South Africa are worried that the offensive might spill inside the country, forcing them to assume defensive positions to avoid further ground losses.

As the war entered its acute phase, with German and American troops fighting each other directly, the Boers found themselves as the proverbial clay pot between the iron ones: the newly established Afrikaner Volkstaat was immediately invaded, and despite the trickle of supplies from the Schild, the Federation was able to break through the border defences and directly push for Johanasburg in their effort to force the insurgent state to capitulate.\n\nAs the second most populous city in all of South Africa, Johanasburg was heavily garrisoned and protected, but it proved to be too little to stop the advancing attackers: the fortifications were torn down by heavy bombings, which were immediately followed by a general offensive. Despite the valiant efforts of the Boer soldiers, they couldn't resist the impetus, and were forced back to the city center. There, they found many defensive positions sabotaged by ANC partisans, which eventually forced the commander to surrender.\n\nWith the fall of Johanasburg, the Boers have lost not only their largest settlement, but also their only developed industrial sector, effectively crippling their war production: this will make much more difficult for them to keep fighting effectively, and many agree that this might be the beginning of the end for this ill-fated uprising."

In the days before the offensive, American aerial reconnaissance had already shown a large concentration of Boer and German forces near the front, but few would have expected such a fierce counterattack: due in large part to supplies and advisors from the Afrika-Schild, the insurgents proved to be much more organized and effective than before, and achieved several key victories, forcing the front back to the city, where the occupation garrison had already bunkered in, supported by several volunteers from the African National Congress.\n\nDespite their fortifications and air support, the defenders couldn't resist the attack, supported by several battalions of superiorly-trained German troops, and gradually conceded more and more ground, before finally opting to fully withdraw from the city. While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency. As the front moves once more towards the core lands of the South African Federation, many believe that the war is slowly turning in favour of the German coalition."

The order of the addends doesn't change the result: in what comes as a surprise for most, and as a horrible nightmare for the Afrika-Schild, Libreville, the largest port of the westernmost Reichskommissariat, and the main source for their supplies from the mainland Reich and has fallen to American and South African marines.\n\nWith the cover of darkness, and supported by several naval units "borrowed" from the US Navy to their ally, the joint OFN task force launched a large naval invasion against this vital infrastructure. As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline. Should the Schild fail to retake Libreville, not only would the flow of supplies from the motherland abruptly end, but it would be the start of a devastating pincer move which could theoretically cause a general collapse of the German colonial alliance."

It seems the concrete risk of total defeat awakened the German Reichskommissariate from their torpor: frantic call for arms were emitted, emergency reserves called into service, and the efficient German production plants, fuelled by the death throes of so many unfortunate souls, churned out an endless supply of weapons at the price of thousands more lives in a clean, mathematical proportion. Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands. As the Afrika-Schild draws a collective breath of relief from the averted catastrophe, and the American government faces heavy criticism at home for the hundreds of soldiers dead or captured in what newspapers have called "the Bay of Fools", all contenders return their undivided attention to the main front.

This news comes as a welcomed development for the South Africans and their allies, as it now means that a second front has been successfully established deep inside Deutsch-Afrika, crippling the German war effort and dramatically sinking their morale.\n\nThe city, now bordering the Congo Lake, was poorly fortified, but had strong natural defenses in the form of quagmires and the ever-present jungle, which slowed down the attackers, and severely limited the use of artillery and air support. In the end, however, they weren't necessary: the hastily-erected defences fell after only a short battle as the mercenary garrison preferred to surrender in the face of the dramatic numerical superiority of the enemy. Now, they await to know their fate as it is unclear whether they are actual soldiers or "armed civilians".\n\nWith the fall of Léopoldville, Zentralafrika is on the brink of collapse, and the entire Schild hangs precariously in the balance: unless bold actions are taken, and victory follows, the war will be lost.

In a last, desperate move to cauterize the wound on the western front, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte mobilized all remaining forces for a desperate push: Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller himself returned from the southern front to lead the assault on his administrative center. Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound.

What the garrison couldn't expect, however, was an enemy from the inside: though it's unknown whether they took contact with the besieging army, or if they acted on their own, partisan movements all throughout the city's many concentration camps and slave quarters launched a full-scale uprising, slaughtering their jailers and breaking free, spreading chaos and panic in the German quarters of the city. This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nBouhlerstadt was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last. Reichskommissar Hüttig managed to flee the city, and has sworn to avenge the defeat "with the lives of all Amerikaner in the city", but some doubt the factibility of such a claim."

After all, he was known for his vengeful temper long before taking his office in the Dark Continent. What few predicted, however, was the extent of such single-minded will: the Reichskommissar immediately launched a furious counteroffensive, until the front fell back to the occupied Bouhlerstadt. What followed was one of the greatest tragedies to befall this bloodied land.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had showed only minimal troop movements near the city, and the garrison believed they could hold out in the hastily-repaired German defences: this belief soon turned hollow, as the attackers made use of an unmarked web of tunnels, known only to the highest officers, to secretly enter the city at night. Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises. The worst, however, came after the victory, as all non-Germans within the city were declared "traitors to the Aryan race": the soldiers simply entered camps, tents, houses and began killing. With bullets. With bayonets. With flamethrowers. The few who managed to escape told of SS covered from head to toe in human gore, rummaging through the bullet-ridden bodies of men, women and children to find the few still breathing and finish them with knives.

The city was an important industrial center in the area, and home to the command staff for that sector, therefore its capture is an important success against the Afrika-Schild.\n\nThe city had been well-prepared for the siege, with strong defenses and large ammunition supplies, but in the end, the enemy was too strong. One by one, the bunkers were busted by surgical artillery and aerial strikes and tanks moved in to seize the entrenched defenders still fighting. Slowly, the garrison fell inwards to pre-prepared positions, but they found many of them sabotaged or occupied by partisan who had been waiting for the right moment to strike: many German soldiers were felled by surprise bursts of their own HMG, and the rest were crushed between the anvil and the hammer as the South African infantry launched the final offensive.\n\nReichskommissar Hans Hüttig is reportedly "disappointed" by the failure to defend the city, and has issued a conscription order to mobilize additional forces and retake the city as soon as possible. He also threatened the occupying forces to abandon the city immediately, "or suffer the consequences of their hubris".

When Salisbury first fell in the hands of the joint American-South African force, he swore that they would pay for their insolence: now, it seems he has come to collect his debt as the last offensive managed to push deep enough to retake the city.\n\nSalisbury had been prepared for the assault, with new fortifications built in place of the demolished German ones, but it proved no match for the intense incendiary and bunker-busting bombings which targeted the defenses for days. When the Schild launched a full-scale offensive, few were still capable of fighting, and even retreating to more defensible positions in the center proved useless, but when the garrison commander finally surrendered, he was shocked to hear the terms. With the only other alternative being mass execution, they were requested to enact decimation: one every ten soldiers would be selected by chance under German surveillance, and killed by his own comrades. The entire process, intended to break enemy morale, was described in detail by a few prisoners liberated on purpose and allowed to return to their units.\n\nThe American high command was shocked by the news, but even more shocking was the tale of what the native population was subjected to: hundreds of suspected partisans, along with even more slaves who had "dared" to leave their camps and go live in houses left empty by evacuated German families, were summarily executed by firing squads, their corpses thrown into mass graves. It seems that the war will last more than expected, and it will reach an even higher degree of brutality"

USA.saf.war.missions.15.t: "The Fall of East London"
USA.saf.war.missions.15.desc: "Despite the increasing involvement of the United States, it seems the scales are tipping in German favor. Today, the Afrika-Schild managed to fully occupy the city of East London: after a string of defeats suffered by the OFN coalition in the East, the Boer insurgent army, supported by several elements of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, had pushed the frontline far enough to threaten the core of the South African Federation. Despite losing its status of an economic center due to the years of apartheid, which saw most of its white population leaving for greener pastures, the city was still an important logistical junction, allowing supplies from Cape Town and the increasingly frequent American shipments to directly reach the eastern front.\n\nThe city had been heavily fortified for the coming assault, with several artillery and anti-aircraft emplacements scattered in the many squares and parks dotting the city, while the outskirts had been torn down and replaced with interlocking bunkers, trenches and minefields. Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets. The garrison fought back valiantly, with important support from those civilians who preferred to fight and die rather than live in slavery, but in the end they were forced to concede more and more ground, until a last defensive line was hurriedly formed around the harbour: all possible supplies were loaded on any availabe ship to not let it fall in German hand, but many were left behind and had to surrender and face the war prisoners' camps.\n\nThe American commander in South Africa has vowed to "free the people from the national socialist yoke", and already rumors are starting to circulate about heavier investments in the war, but this defeat is drawing heavy criticism for how the American expedition was ill-prepared for this conflict, and many doubt that the tides of war will change. Is this the end for freedom in Africa?"
USA.saf.war.missions.15.a: "And yet the war goes on."

USA.saf.war.missions.16.t: "The Recapture of East London"
USA.saf.war.missions.16.desc: "Perhaps the fall of East London finally let the South Africans and their American allies understand the seriousness of the situation. They say that, in desperate times, people do extraordinary things, and this proved true once more, as a full-scale counterattack, ordered by the joint General Staff of the coalition, managed to liberate the city after a hard-fought battle: the arrival of new reinforcements from the United States proved instrumental in retaking the city, showing once more how invested they are in the war, something which drew diplomatic protests from the mainland Reich.\n\nThe Germans had bunkered in the city, erecting makeshift fortifications and turning the outskirts into a death zone with booby-traps and minefields: uncaring for the civilian population, they had torn down several blocks to have clear firing lines and dig trenches. In the end, however, this wasn't enough, and the heavy bombardments destroyed most outer defenses, forcing the garrison to fall back to the opposite end of the city, where they had already prepared for the retreat. Under the cover of darkness, most of the Germans and high-ranking Boer officers abandoned the city, leaving behind only a token force to delude their enemies into thinking they were still fighting. The ruse was discovered only the next day, when the Americans attacked and found almost no resistance.\n\nEven though the victory was less of a triumph than hoped for, this still comes as a success for the OFN coalition after a long time without any meaningful success. While it is clear in Washington that the war will still drag on, at least total defeat is no longer a likely outcome, which is already a result."
USA.saf.war.missions.16.a: "And yet the war goes on."

USA.saf.war.missions.17.t: "The Fall of Cape Town"
USA.saf.war.missions.17.desc: "Today, a devastating blow has been struck against South Africa as Cape Town, the nation's capital and largest city, fell to a joint task force of Boer and Südwestafrikaner soldiers. The last weeks had seen the American-led coalition suffer defeat after defeat, losing several key settlements to the Afrika-Schild, until the front reached the very heart of the country. Now, that heart has stopped beating.\n\nThe hills surrounding the "City Bowl" were turned into fortresses linked by trench lines, fully enclosing the Cape in a ring of heavy fortifications. The city itself had extensively prepared for the coming attack, with barricades and key locations garrisoned by volunteer units, and American artillery and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the roads and squares. However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid. The South African government, evacuated from the city before the attack, has promised to retake the city, but is this still possible?"
USA.saf.war.missions.17.a: "And yet the war goes on."

USA.saf.war.missions.18.t: "The Second Battle of Cape Town"
USA.saf.war.missions.18.desc: "Perhaps the war isn't over yet, and there's still some fighting spirit among the South Africans. In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies. At this point, no one knows whether this will be the proverbial swansong before ultimate defeat, or the beginning of the comeback for the Federation."

South Africa's fires rage heedless of the man in the White House, burning Nazis, civilians and, more pressingly, American soldiers alike. The American people have elected President [Root.GetLeader] in large part to bring them home posthaste.\n\nCongress has split into two sides over when to pull our boys out of the Veld. The "Interventionists", led by Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, argue that bringing more of them for large-scale offensives will finally break the Schild's back and end the war soon. Chairman of House Foreign Relations Donald Rumsfeld and his "Technocrats" advocate leaving only our best behind with better leadership, doctrines, weapons systems and intelligence instead of risking a gruesome war of attrition.\n\nWhoseever advise the President listens to shall become America's strategy going forward. Thousands of families, both of servicemen and of potential draftees, pray he decides rightly."

USA_WFB_SA_CORDS: "The CORDS Program"
USA_WFB_SA_CORDS_desc: "To maintain the war effort, and the safety of our soldiers on the ground, we need to win the support of the civilian populace of South Africa. People have to feel safe in their homes and communities, or else all trust in this coalition will collapse. Thus, the Pentagon has proposed the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support Program, aka CORDS. By assigning training personnel and funding to local communities, we can build up local security forces. This will give us additional cachet on the ground, and additional manpower to help combat a variety of insurgents. Civilians that feel secure and in control of their local environments will be better allies, and CORDS can help to make that happen."

These are vicious guerrillas who strike when least expected, and sow chaos both behind and at the front lines. Werewolf activity is devastating for morale, and we need to get a handle on it immediately. The brass is proposing the Phoenix Program as a solution. This program would involve forming joint counterinsurgency units to go into potentially hostile areas and eliminate Werewolf activity, by any means necessary. Order has to be restored, and the Werewolves need to be knocked out once and for all."

Or worse, brother Tommy hosing down POWs in a fit of rage.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] has thus directed the Signal Corps to tone down the news filtering back into the States a little - say, that morale is high, casualties are low, and the war's ending soon.

When further inquired of the steps needed to save South Africa, his proposal was anything but.\n\nFounts of tabulated data, calculated extrapolations, and above all cold, hard numbers flowed freely from Ford's brightest Whiz Kid. The erudition he demonstrated had rooted logic into the war's vagueries and made them answerable with actionable solutions - "...the most effective among them," he concluded, "being an escalation of our presence by several orders of magnitude than current.

Said politicians return the favor by inflating our budget every fiscal year or so, letting Boeing, McDonnell and North American gorge themselves fat on the excess - like spiders having their fill of succulent flies.\n\nNevertheless, these spiders bear sharp fangs and potent poison. Their weapons of trade can be put to better use paralyzing the Nazis' industries and supply lines instead of bogging ours to near-uselessness.

Our industrial and military capacity far outstrips what the Reichskommissars can usually bring to bear.

After all, America brought them into the South African War, and many have suffered dreadful losses. Withdrawal now would be politically difficult for our allies, to say nothing of the genuine waste in blood and treasure. Our ambassadors in Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, and beyond should make it clear that we don't intend to create such a waste. The only option in South Africa is a satisfactory victory, and that will be the case regardless of the coalition involved."

We should begin immediately drafting new contracts for everything from small arms to helicopters, and get the American military-industrial complex raring to go.

We need to get out of this war quickly and with our prestige intact, and the only way we can do this is by letting the Africans take charge. Unfortunately for us, the African army is neither well-trained nor well-supplied. If we can train these guys hard enough, they may be able to cover our retreat and we can hand the war over to them. Our pact is currently divided over the issue; members of the Nationalists believe this is too much of a cut-and-run, but this is the only way for us to end our participation. No matter the disapproval, we have to get out of this war."

We sent the advisors, we sent our troops, we fought the Boers directly. However, the time has come for us to pull our troops from the continent and let the South Africans lead instead. The problem is, the South African military is in dire need of improvement, and in its current state, it will be wiped out by the advancing Germans.

 USA_npp_saf_party_way_desc: "General Curtis LeMay is one of the most beloved military thinkers on the Nationalist Caucus of the NPP, and with good reason. His attitude is that victory in South Africa can only be achieved by giving the military the authority to "bomb the Nazis back to the Stone Age".

This air power can't just blindly bomb a patch of forest and hope to return safely, though. Our radar capabilities in Africa should be expanded and improved. Deploying new tactical wings and building new long range radar installations in-country will help to coordinate missions, locate potential enemies, and hopefully save lives and materiel."

 USA_npp_saf_larger_docks: "New Ports"
 USA_npp_saf_larger_docks_desc: "One of the most difficult hurdles to victory in South Africa has always been logistics. The Nazis have had more of a home field advantage, due to their close location, while all of our troops and supplies have to be sailed or flown in. One of our new initiatives in the South African War should be to expand existing port infrastructure in-country, and to create new facilities. This way, we can get supplies to the battlefield faster, and with less difficulty."

 USA_npp_saf_more_men: "More Men on the Ground"
 USA_npp_saf_more_men_desc: "The most difficult truth of the South African War is that we need more boots on the ground. Air power is devastating, but the war will only be truly won when we can take and hold territory, and you can't do that with B-52s. We need to authorize a troop surge and flood South Africa with new forces. It won't be popular, and nobody truly wants to do this, but it's necessary. Our forces will arrive ready to win this war once and for all."

 USA_npp_saf_africa_will_burn: "Africa Will Burn"
 USA_npp_saf_africa_will_burn_desc: "The South African War has been one of messy combat in incredibly difficult terrain. Most of the rural hinterlands of Africa are dominated by jungles, swamps, and vast plains, and have become nightmares for our commanders on the ground. With our new airpower, though, we can use defoliants and napalm to eliminate all of these potential guerrilla hiding places. It will also have the convenient effect of forcing rural peasants into strategic hamlets and urban areas, denying the enemy a civilian population to hide within. Africa will rise stronger from this war, but first, the Nazis must become ash under our feet.."

Tens of thousands of Americans risked their lives every day in a war that seemed unwinnable on the ground, and pointless at home."\n\nHe knew that every eye was on him, and that every paper would carry his words. So as he continued, he spoke carefully, trying to avoid sounding like a prophet.\n\n"The South African War must end. Morality demands it. The American people demand it. But it cannot end with Nazi jackboots in the streets of Cape Town. It must end with a triumph of liberty. I vow to you now that America will win this war, with our honor as a nation intact.

It is a struggle which must end, not in ignominy, but in a victory for liberty and freedom for all."\n\n"At the same time, it is a struggle that we must recommit to. This is not an easy decision for me, and it is not an easy task for the country. But as a nation, we have always fought for freedom.

And they won't. Stop. Chanting.\n\nDeep down, the President can't blame them. When he announced the troop surge, and the new aid package for Africa, he knew that people would see it as a betrayal.

President [GetPresidentLastName] surveyed the room, knowing the enormity of the moment was giving everybody pause.\n\n"It's been twenty years since the end of the war, gentlemen," President [GetPresidentLastName] said. "A decade or so since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords and admitted Hawaii to the Union. Now it's our turn to finish what he started."\n\nThe proposal - to stand up to Japan at last and to demand negotiations over the Treaty Ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles - would be the most ambitious and consequential diplomatic initiative by the United States in their lifetimes. The eyes of the world, and of the American electorate, would be scrutinizing them under a microscope. There would be no room for failure.\n\nThe Japanese wouldn't simply fold - but it was clear that holding ports halfway across the world, a diplomatic nightmare and impossible to secure, was increasingly unattractive.\n\nHow much could America push, without being pushed aside by Japan in return? It would take the political power of the American government to ensure the successful return of the ports, without giving away the house to the Japanese in the process - but a few concessions here and there might be useful in making demands further down the line..."

The Foreign Minister sighed. "The Americans probably aren't seriously considering going to war for the Ports, but..."\n\nPrime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] nodded somberly. Twenty years after the victory in the Pacific, the ports were rapidly becoming more trouble than they were worth as Japan faced new challenges from every corner. If Japan could walk away from the negotiations with tangible guarantees - open trade, oil provisions, or an enforceable promise to formally recognize Japan's suzerainty over the Sphere - then what were two ports, really?\n\nIt would take every ounce of political and diplomatic capital to keep any deal as favorable to Japan as possible, even if they gave way on certain items to gain a temporary advantage to be used later.

One big problem between our nation and the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the fact that we do not trade enough. Because of this, the Japanese have demanded substantial amounts of oil to make up for their recent shortages. Simply put, the Sphere lacks many of the oil reserves that we have here in the United States. Luckily, the Japanese diplomats seem pretty desperate to sign a contract with us. If we grant them subsidized oil purchases, the economy of the Sphere will continue functioning and we may regain our lost ports. If we help out the Japanese and the Sphere helps us out, we could see a brighter relationship between our two great nations. We also have a chance of bringing American workers back to work for us.\n\nNow, the question of the moment is: how much oil will we give to the Empire of Japan? We could be generous and offer them the substantial amounts of oil they say they need. We could go down the middle and offer them a moderate amount of oil. Finally, we could give them small amounts of oil, but they may not accept the offer. We also need to consider what the Japanese plan to use the oil for.

However, the amount of oil the Americans promise us seems too good to be true. The American diplomats have been quite the shady bunch surrounding this whole deal; we could try to request more oil to make sure they are telling the truth, but this plan could backfire quickly.\n\nPrime Minister, we have two options to take that could alter the course of the deal, and we must hurry before the Americans propose a counter offer."

These last few days were supposed to mark the end of Japanese oppression on the West Coast. The handing-off of the treaty ports was meant to symbolize the American eagle's rebirth onto the world stage as a bringer of democracy, a beacon of hope against the evils of Fascism. These negotiations were not just for the goodness of the peoples of San Francisco and Los Angeles, no, the Americans were going to gain much-needed prestige from the deal with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese, on the other hand, were handling a massive oil shortage across the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Diplomats hated stooping so low as to ask the United States for economic assistance; the Empire had triumphed over the States two decades ago, and now they needed their help? Wasn't this the problem that caused World War II in the first place? But they were desperate. Desperate for a resource that would fix the economic problems of an entire region. The negotiations showed that apparently, Japan was not desperate enough.

This would ensure us the most important prize, market access, and allow us to quickly move on to other parts of the treaty.\n\nMany in our cabinets, however, believe that a mutual lift favors the Americans too much, and are pushing to attach trade conditions to the deal. These conditions would provide for mutual reduction of several tariffs in areas beneficial to Japan, ensuring us more favorable trade terms, but might not go down well with the Americans.\n\nThirdly, there are some who think we are offering a deal too cheaply, inviting further bullying attempts by the Americans in the future.

The specifics of the transfer has been left to the end of the negotiations, and this will be the last clause up for discussion. We have a few options for how we position ourselves to approach these final negotiations.\n\nOur advisors fear that a straightforward transfer will be perceived in Japan as a loss of face, and that the politics of that perception might jeopardize the negotiations. To avoid this, they say, we should offer to demilitarize the ports upon transfer. By doing so we will ensure the Japanese have something they can point to as "getting in return" - enabling them to transfer the ports without appearing weak.\n\nOthers in our administration counsel a tougher approach. The goal of the whole summit, they say, is to turn a page on our relations with Japan, and that can only be accomplished if they agree not only to the port transfer, but to demilitarize Hawaii. With the Aleutians Crisis in all too recent memory, they claim the asymmetry of mutual threat will soon cause a rise in tensions back to previous levels as long as the Japanese garrison the island chain. Our most hawkish counsel suggests we can demand the demilitarization of Hawaii without offering to demilitarize the ports in turn.

Most of our advisors consider this a favorable deal. It accomplishes our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA, while scoring us a victory in the form of demilitarization.\n\nSome, however, are saying that American willingness to accept such conditions betray the weakness of their position, and suggest we push to attach a second condition to the transfer - making the ports a special customs territory shared between our two nations. This will secure our traders and merchant fleets valuable bases of operations for their future American endeavors.

If the purpose of the port transfer is to reobtain control over the ports, then accepting the "joint customs zone" defeats that purpose, allowing the Japanese to continue to have a say in the comings and goings of goods through the ports. We'd also open ourselves up to potential smuggling operations out of the zones. Accepting such a blatant power-grab would also encourage Japan to continue this "bad-faith" approach in future talks between our countries, according to these advisors.\n\nOn the other hand, this could be the final hurdle of the negotiations. Paying this price, however unreasonable we find it, will secure the port transfer. That might just be worth swallowing our pride. What should we do?"

Once they finished expressing their outrage, they informed us that a demilitarization is still on offer, a worthy price, according to them, we could obtain by agreeing to the transfer.\n\nMost of our delegates counsel accepting this deal as favorable and closing this clause. Predictably, there are a few voices that speak in opposition, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining national pride and a projection of strength, and demanding we secure compensation for the ports that "match the value of the blood spent" in securing them.\n\nHowever we respond, there's no further room for negotiation, so we should choose our reply carefully."

There is still a slim hope we will get the ports back, but that hinges on Japan judging our progress on the other two clauses to be important enough to reconsider their stance.

The American delegation has opened the negotiations by sending a proposal for the port transfer to be accompanied by mutual demilitarization. They pledge to keep the returned ports exclusively civilian, but ask that we demilitarize Hawaii in return. With the Aleutians Crisis in recent memory, they claim our forces on the island chain imply a threat to their country, which must be removed for normal relations to resume.\n\nAgreeing to this proposal will accomplish our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA. According to our advisors, however, it is far from balanced. The docks in Hawaii are vital for our operational capacity in the East Pacific. Losing them will force us to choose between reduced operational space, which will surely anger our admirals, or constructing new docks on different islands, which will be expensive. The Americans have already more than replaced the docking capacity they lost when we occupied the ports, and are in no great need of them for their navies.\n\nSome in our delegation point out that while this particular clause may be unbalanced, we risk losing our gains in the earlier clauses should we push the Americans too hard on this issue. Are we willing to do that over a naval base?"

 honolulu_accords.40.desc:0"Our request for demilitarization of Hawaii has apparently not been well-received in the Japanese camp. Flatly refusing to consider the merits of our proposal, they say that port transfer is the only issue up for discussion. Demilitarization is only a part of these talks as the condition for port transfer, they say, and they insist equally firmly on this condition and the complete impossibility of reciprocation. The Aleutians Crisis, they "remind" us, was caused by "American duplicity and recklessness" and our "domestic politics driving foreign policy decisions", and the onus is "entirely on the USA" to prevent a repeat of the event.\n\nMany in our administration point out that this arrogance is typical of the Japanese in their dealings with us. Discussions are completed on the clauses that matter to the Japanese, so they've reverted to their attitude of "victorious conquerors", dictating demands to a vanquished foe. If we accept their diktats, they say, we'll set up for them to continue their arrogant disregard for our interests in our future dealings as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the success of the summit hinges on us finding some way to accommodate both nations here, and we might need to give them this to prevent the negotiations from unraveling entirely. However we reply, there will be no room for further negotiations on the issue. What should we say?"

A "rebalancing of strategic threat", they say, is a prerequisite for a productive future relationship between our nations, and they seem willing to stake the outcome of the whole summit on getting it.\n\nOur delegation is united in condemning the arrogance of this demand. We are already willing to transfer the treaty ports and it's outrageous of them to demand more, they say. Hawaii is also a significant strategic asset, and demilitarization would lose both our navy and air force an important base.\n\nOn the other hand, we risk losing the economic benefits we've worked so hard to secure ourselves in the first two clauses. However we proceed, the lines are now firmly drawn, and there will be no further negotiations on this clause. What will we do?"

They justify this brazen demand by stating that the purpose of the clause is to secure peace and future relations, and that this objective demands a "neutral East Pacific", "as the Aleutians Crisis has shown".\n\nWe are well within our bounds to refuse this. We never agreed to discuss the status of Hawaii and are under no obligation to. Some of our delegation are calling for us to punish the Americans for their brash behavior by attaching conditions, including demilitarization, to the ports instead. Others see the demand as a bluff, the Americans trying to shore up their position for the negotiation, and suggest we offer up a bargain - we will demilitarize Hawaii, as they ask, if they will agree to limit the returned ports to civilian purposes as well.\n\nA few advisors are cautioning against seeing the proposal as a negotiation tactic. This is the clause that is the most important to the Americans, and they might very well be willing to stake the entire accords on getting a favorable outcome here. What will we do?"

The ports, and Hawaii for that matter, are American soil and we can't allow a foreign power to keep making demands and setting conditions for how we act on our own territory. If the Japanese want better relations, they can damn well accept that we won't allow them to keep waving Hawaii-based navies in our face. A demilitarized Hawaii means peace in the East Pacific, and peace in the East Pacific is the only outcome we will accept. We will resubmit our original proposal.

For any deal to be signed, they say, it must mean the end of Japan dictating matters on US soil, and a demilitarization in California would stand in the way of that aim.\n\nTheir demands are outrageous, far exceeding the scope of what was agreed upon in the lead-up to the summit, and very few would fault us for declining. They want both the treaty ports and a demilitarized Hawaii and they're staking everything else at this summit to get both. Are we willing to do the same?"

Together, this provides us with an opportunity too good to pass up. With most of the treaty safely agreed upon, it's time to open discussion on one last question: The return of Hawaii.\n\nIn order to get them to even consider the transfer, we must be prepared to give important concessions in return. Our advisors believe they might ask for a joint or neutral administration of the Panama Canal, extensive arms limitation concessions, or both. Regardless, it might be a price we should be willing to pay. Securing Hawaii would be a fantastic achievement for our government and for the USA, but beyond that, it would cement this treaty as the end of the era of hostility between us and the Japanese.\n\nThe last core US territory still occupied by Japan, its return will mark a true end to the war in the minds of the public and help usher a time of peace in the East Pacific."

For the first short leg of its journey back to friendlier waters, each and every Japanese ship has been sneered farewell by jeers, threats and obscene gestures from a hostile city.\n\nToday, as the last Japanese cruiser finally left the port of San Francisco, this ritual was broken. The jubilant crowds, freshly arrived from "port parties" all over the city, waved and cheered our sailors a final goodbye. The Captain of Chikuma called for all hands on deck to witness the event, and soon our sailors were cheering and waving back. Pictures of the exchange are making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific, a sure sign to our people that an era of heightened hostility is coming to a close.\n\nNot everyone is equally enthused, of course. Many in our own country are grumbling about how much ground we are giving to the Americans.

All across the country, everyday life has given way to "port parties", pulling whole neighbourhoods out into the streets in celebration. The biggest crowds of all have been seen in the treaty port cities themselves. In San Francisco, cheers from the gathered throngs drowned out the voices of the Japanese ambassador and his translator as the last Japanese flag was taken down and the stars and stripes hoisted in its place.\n\nSurprise was evident among the Japanese as well, as the sailors aboard Chikuma found themselves cheered goodbye by the jubilant crowds, the scowls and jeers they had come to expect from Americans replaced by cheerful smiles and waves.

The visit's official intent was a tour around the American capital - a show of goodwill capitalizing on the momentum of the now-named Handover's success.\n\nUnofficially... well, the old man had his suspicions. He thought them confirmed when he entered the Oval Office and saw the President, back turned, inspecting a large canvas map of Hawai'i. The Minister drew in a sharp breath as he took a seat, steeling himself for the last conversation he ever wished to confront in his career.\n\n"I trust the accommodations here are to your liking?" President [GetPresidentLastName] asked without glancing back. The Foreign Minister grunted in assent. Not exactly proper decorum, but he figured the silence meant the President didn't care.\n\n"Good." Leather shoes clacked with polished linoleum as the President shuffled back to the Resolute Desk, pulling several folders out of its cabinet. [USA.GetSheHeCap] spread the stack across the surface like a dealer with a stack of cards. Each folder bore "PROPOSAL" in red capital letters across their tab. "Wouldn't want to keep you from seeing the sights, so I'll keep this brief: we've some ideas for your government's consideration. We'll discuss these more later during your stay."\n\nAs quickly as he had arrived, the Minister left the Office escorted by his assigned guide.

In exchange, they have agreed to enforce the same in the Panama Canal Zone. President [USA.GetLeader] expects a speedy response in official channels, and has voiced his willingness to attend another conference to negotiate the agreement's finer details at a time and place of our choosing.\n\nI understand your concerns, sir. Convincing the public, no less the Navy, to return our farthest-flung awards from the Liberation War was already a momentous endeavor by itself. Another concession to our adversary may signal weakness our enemies in Tokyo will doubtless capitalize. Nevertheless, the American President has offered us an opportunity whose waste we can scarce afford: a guarantee of peace between our two nations at least within our lifetimes.

Both parties also consented to regular inspections by a bipartisan committee, ensuring the agreement's letter and spirit are enforced.\n\nWhere an otherwise ideal negotiation process met the realities of jockeying with a geopolitical adversary was when the frequency of such inspections was broached.

On one hand, clearly defined punishments for violations within the proposed DMZs disincentivize Japan from using them as de facto outposts for their Pacific-wide cordon sanitaire - provided, of course, that the same penalties apply to them. Those disinclined to trust the Empire's intentions argued that the punishments will be selectively, and aggressively, applied at our disfavor.

When asked to clarify by the cautious Americans, they proposed actions ranging from remilitarizing the affected territories to establishing a full embargo. Even talk of declaring the Handover null and void gained traction among its more zealous members - that is, until their arguments were cut short by the meaty thwack of a face meeting fist.\n\nOrder returned to the conference room before the negotiations broke down under an inter-Pacific exchange of blunt force trauma.

As the two superpowers met again to discuss exactly that, many thought they would see the "Pacific Question" settled within their lifetimes.\n\nSuch fantasies were dispelled by Japanese diplomats, leaving the conference disgruntled and without the promised settlement. Perhaps none could fault Tokyo for protecting its hard-won conquests from America's encroachments, or simply for barring them from taking two thousand miles more when they had already won their inch. Yet had not the Rising Sun scorched the forests under whose shade the Eagle once rested? To see its lost glades returned, the Americans replied, is no unreasonable ambition. That Tokyo argued otherwise said more about the Empire's bad faith, and the conference which masked it with the pretense of compromise, than their own.\n\nBut did right and wrong matter to the millions who longed for peace that stayed, rather than a conflict kept frozen until it can't?"

USA_the_iranian_civil_war_desc: "War grips Iran, one of the few countries in the Muslim world with a strong tradition for democracy. If we are serious about our commitment to ensuring fascism is contained everywhere in the world, we must be as forceful and determined in our response to this civil war as we are in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. The US has always been and will always remain a steadfast ally of antifascists everywhere, and America has always been a true friend of Iran. We must look to organizing a response, we cannot let the fascists control the oil reserves there to fuel their evil empires."
USA_iranian_aid_bill_desc: "The House Foreign Affairs Committee has swiftly drawn up a bill authorizing dispatch of advisors, equipment and financial aid to Iran, as well as authorizing the government to advertise, organize and dispatch volunteer divisions from both veteran and active duty Army personnel. Once this goes through Congress, help will be on its way to the brave Iranians."
USA_american_aid_inbound_desc: "The Iranian Aid Act has been quickly rushed through Congress to ensure a timely response to the crisis there. An immediate loan of $100 million has been granted to the Iranian liberal faction so they can fund their armed forces until American equipment and volunteers can arrive en masse. Initial military advisors are to be dispatched as soon as secure flights can be established, followed by the equipment and then the volunteers. With some luck the Iranian liberal movement will soon be strong and economically stable, a force that can sweep aside the armies of tyranny opposing them."
USA_american_equipment_desc: "Coordinating with the Iranian liberals and our advisors, we have set up a pipeline for regular shipments of military equipment between California and Iran, using Australia as a go-between. Sadly, for the moments this limits our ability to send significant quantities for the gear, but the ability for the Iranians to use the remaining money from their loan to buy American weaponry and gear will certainly be a relief for both them and our domestic arms industry."
USA_american_military_advisors_desc: "The eagle soars once again to distant shores! Our advisor teams report the bulk of their teams have landed safely in Iran, and request we coordinate with the legitimate, freedom-loving Iranian government to ensure they have translators, staff and vehicles available."
USA_american_loans_desc: "The Iranians have run out of money from our initial loan to them! This simply won't do, they are fighting tooth and nail against the enemies of democracy and freedom. Let us pull some strings at the congressional budget office to authorize further Liberty Loans to the Iranian liberals. No amount of money is worth a loss to fascist tyranny."
USA_send_in_cia_advisors_desc: "While not mentioned in the official Iranian Aid Act, in the black budget we have set aside money for advisors from REDACTED to instruct and share REDACTED with the Iranian REDACTED services. It is our REDACTED's hope that this will lead to REDACTED, increased trust, REDACTED, REDACTED, higher recruitment of Persian-speaking operatives, REDACTED, and new perspectives on the regional intelligence situation, especially in regards to REDACTED."
USA_grand_strategy_of_the_iran_war_desc: "With the Iranian Civil War still dragging on, our administration finds itself on a crossroads. Should we commit fully, South Africa-style, with boots on the ground and a strong hand, or should we press on with the current strategy of primarily arming the Iranian liberals and letting them fight the war for us? We will need to carefully weigh whether the risk of upsetting the public with another foreign conflict is worth the risk of losing Iran to the forces of tyranny. The economic and geopolitical consequences of the fascists controlling the oil of Iran could be devastating, but a direct intervention can seriously undermine our popularity, not to mention our military budget plans. What should we do?"
USA_promise_more_american_soldiers_desc: "We have to go all in on this one, public opinion be damned. We are readying several divisions of intervention troops to help the liberal Iranians win this thing, and have already sent them our assurances more are on their way. Democracy will never die where the torch of liberty shines bright through its soldiers! Forwards to freedom!"
USA_promise_more_american_equipment_desc: "We cannot risk another bloodbath like we faced in the jungles this decade. To limit the potential loss of American life without letting the Iranians down, we will instead announce an expansion of our current strategy, with efforts undertaken to greatly increase the quantity of weapons shipments to the Iranian liberals. This will be difficult, but we will be enjoying the cooperation and support of our military-industrial complex, which stands to benefit from the Liberty Loans being spent on their product line."
USA_to_free_the_oppressed_desc: "To help build popular support for our intervention in Iran, we have crafted a carefully staged media campaign showing our soldiers and the Iranian liberals working in tandem to bring freedom to the oppressed classes of Iran. Zoroastrians, Christians and women will all feature heavily in the messaging, with starry eyes thanking their American liberators. The coverage will even be mostly true for once, as we really fight on the side of the most tolerant and Western-aligned faction present."
USA_darwin_supply_hub_desc: "The biggest hurdle in supplying the Iranians has been that we've relied on Australian shipping for the last stretch of the journey. If we instead repurpose and expand our naval base at Darwin, intended for use in supplying allies and intervention forces in Indonesia, as well as defending Australasia proper, we can move the supplies the whole way on American keel, in larger and faster freighters. This should enable us to greatly expand the transported volume, albeit at a significant monetary cost."
USA_new_contracts_for_military_industral_complex_desc: "The promise of fresh contracts delivered the expected support from the large armaments firms. A group of them have promised that they will invest in any efforts we make to expand the supply pipeline to Iran, on the condition that it is structured in such a way as to give them a voice in the running of the products. In normal times this sort of collusion with private arms manufacturers might be seen as unethical, but the last twenty years have been anything but normal, and we have to be ready to work with all our allies to defeat fascism, whether they be countries or corporations. Let us begin the restructuring."
USA_the_beacon_of_hope_desc: "We have done everything we can for the Iranian liberals. As we ship off the last of our promised supplies and men, we can only hope that the sacrifices America has made to help the Iranian people rise the torch of liberty against the extremist tyrants surrounding the liberals on all sides. One day, Iran will be a true democracy and close ally of our great republic, but if the liberals can win here and now, we will have progressed tremendously in pushing back the darkness of our age. Let the flame of freedom we have lit in the Iranian people forever serve as a beacon of hope to the oppressed all around the Middle East and the World!"

 USA.1.t: "The Land of the Free"
 USA.1.desc: "While America joined the Second World War, support came too late to save her allies. The United States performed admirably, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies.\n\nNow, twenty years later, America stands divided. While the great American Depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democratic Coalition and the National Progressive Pact, a failing union of America's progressives, socialists, and authoritarians. With the Civil Rights movement greatly shifting the political sphere, many predict that the 60's will herald the greatest threats America has ever faced."
 USA.1.a: "Liberty shall not perish from this Earth!"
 USA.2.t: "The Nationalists"
 USA.2.desc: "In 1954, right before Brown vs. Board, a note that circulated between the liberal judges on the supreme court is leaked to the press. The note refered to a fifth possible judge that could potentially vote in favor of ruling that segregation in education is unconstitutional. This fired up the public and the Southern Democrats signed the so-called Southern Manifesto that declare they would not stand for the coalition line that lead to this possible outcome and will go into Patton's NPP to continue working for continued segregation, whatever the outcome of the Brown vs. Board would be.\n\nThey rallied their voters to join the NPP and they managed to nominate their Harry F. Byrd to the 1956 Presidency, the campaign was a failure, and only carried a few states. The 1960 elections didn't go much better with Richard Russell Jr. as their candidate. After the second fiasco in a row, many of the senators lost their seats to Democrats and others crossed the aisle a second time in only 5 years.\n\nThey figured they couldn't run only on a segregationst platform, with appeals only to white southern voters. Their whole tone of their politics was thought to be too "nice", voters didnt understand what the difference between the NPP and the Democrats were, so they voted democrat, to not waste their vote. Some stayed behind as NPP senators, and noticed the new young Governor in Alabama, George Wallace. He is the perfect candidate for the NPP: segregationist, harsh critic of the mainstream foreign policy and has that angry aura, which they lacked. Wallace has since become the face of the Nationalist Caucus and stands to be their 1964 candidate."

 USA.3.t:0 "An Overdue Ratification"
 USA.3.desc:0 "It had been a busy few days at the capital.\n\nHarper had seen a number of major legislative events in his tenure as a Senate staffer, but he had to admit that he would have expected the ratification of a new amendment to have garnered some more... celebrity? Attention? Maybe even a few media segments?\n\nAh well, it wasn't especially exciting as amendments with. In fact, that was likely why it hadn't gotten much attention or focus in the press and legislature alike. The Twenty-Third Amendment concerning the line of presidential succession in the event of an untimely death or removal had been originally spurred by Kefauver's health issues. It had also, ironically, died out when Kefauver had left office.\n\nThe ratification today was more the end of a long, long process, than a concerted effort to clarify that rather important detail. Most people assumed that the line of succession was clear, from President to vice President, to the Secretary of State, and so on. In reality, none of it was actually enshrined in the constitution or law.\n\nWithout the threat of a potential constitutional crisis, Harper wasn't really surprised it had taken this long to get done, and it was almost certainly going to be a few years before enough states officially ratified it. Nixon and Kennedy weren't exactly in danger of unexpectedly leaving office, untimely or otherwise.\n\nPersonally, Harper hoped that it would be ratified sooner than later, if for no other reason than to cross another item off the list. At the same time, he couldn't really muster up much urgency outside a mild preference. When it happened, it would happen. No point in worrying about a distant, worst-case scenario. There were plenty of other problems to deal with right now."
 USA.3.a:0 "After all, what's the worst that could happen?"

 USA.4.t:0 "Commander-in-Chaos"
 USA.4.desc:0 "McCormack had never seen the Capitol in such chaos.\n\nHe didn't know if it was worse because he was seeing the ugliness and confusion behind the scenes for the first time, or if it was really just that bad. It was made all the worse by the fact that no one was actually sure if he was supposed to be filling the role of President at all.\n\nHe was the Speaker of the House, or rather, he had been. Now he was President, or Acting President, something no one was sure about, and this was only worsening the situation. Kennedy's cabinet was unsure if they should be coming to him for approvals, or continue on their own initiatives. He was sure the intelligence community, particularly the CIA and FBI, were not giving him full briefings for security reasons, and the military was taking a similar, if more neutral, approach.\n\nThe chain of command was shot to hell, and it was grinding everything to a halt or actively sabotaging what little was working. There were already debates on how legitimate any legislation he signed into law was—generously assuming he'd get that opportunity—and if the Supreme Court would have to intervene. There was no precedent for this scenario; the one thing no one had expected to happen, happened.\n\nThe sole saving grace in this entire fucked situation was that the legislature had ratified the Twenty-Second Amendement - and now all of the states were scrambling to hold votes to ratify it and end the constitutional crisis. Even still, it would be months before this was done; months where the government would be stuck in this strange, uncertain limbo.\n\nMcCormack knew that some kind of status quo would emerge eventually—but it was going to be painful, difficult, and throughout it all he had to keep it from getting worse."
 USA.4.a:0 "They'd get through this. They had to."

 USA.5.t:0 "A Christmas Miracle"
 USA.5.desc:0 "The Christmas season was normally a busy time under normal circumstances on Capitol Hill. There were always last-minute scrambles for budgets, bills, and other legislative matters before the break. It was made even worse this year with the South African War, and while the normalcy had settled somewhat, McCormack never had a spare moment.\n\nA throat cleared behind him. "Mr. President?"\n\nDespite the initial confusion over chain of command, now several months in, everyone had decided to call him that. Arrangements had been made, as legally sound as possible, that would effectively let him hold the authority of President, even if it wasn't technically constitutional. McCormack frankly didn't care if everything he did got undone later—all that mattered was getting through this first.\n\n"What is it?" He asked the staffer, who'd uncharacteristically entered without knocking, and even more uncharacteristically, was smiling widely.\n\n"Idaho completed the ratification," he said. "We crossed the threshold. The Twenty-Third Amendment is now in effect."\n\nMcCormack immediately sat down, a wave of relief washing over him at the news. The amendment was such a small thing, just outlining a line of succession—but these past months had shown just how critical it was. He found it difficult to express his relief, knowing that no one else would need to go through what he had.\n\nAll he'd wanted for Christmas was for this crisis to end, and by an act of providence, it appeared that it had. He took a breath, stood, and spoke to the staffer who was waiting patiently for what to do next."

CIA assets in Germania have reported that shortly after celebrations over the moon landing began to settle, German military units and several platoons worth of the German dictator's various bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. From what we are hearing, an assassin, which the Germans claim had belonged to the Japanese Tokumusoukan, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards, and killed on the spot.\n\nAlready, reports of several assassinations have surfaced, as various politicians in the Reichstag initially believed Hitler to have been killed and began long-planned plots to eliminate their rivals in the chaos. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as various units ordered one other to stand down and the chain of command broke down.\n\nWhile the situation has begun to recover, martial law is still in effect in Germania, and suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker.

Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed along with a team predominantly made up of former Luftwaffe pilots. Köllner, on live television broadcast globally, snapped a smart salute to the flag of the Reich with the earth visible in the backdrop, a photo which has spread across the globe, thanks in no small part to German propaganda. Jubilant celebrations began almost immediately across Germany.\n\nAlready, President Nixon has publicly vowed that the race shall continue and that NASA is already making preparations for a permanent human presence upon the moon, in the form of a lunar colony. The President's announcement was quickly followed by one from Japan, who stated that they will land on Mars.\n\nDespite the President's insistence that the race is not over, the American public has taken the news poorly. Although America managed to get the first astronaut into space, public confidence in the space program is at an all-time low, as fewer Americans than ever look to the night sky with a sense of explorative awe."

On the other hand, should we really send all these weapons to one of the weakest camps in the war, just to see them in the hands of men like Bormann or Göring?\n\nMore importantly, the Senate would never approve our sending equipment to fascists, so we'll be extremely limited in our covert support."

Comic books have continued on still, growing in popularity, and the 1960's have brought forth a need breed of superhero. Conflicted, with personal lives to handle and Human problems, readers across the country have been eating up these new relatable heroes, sparked by the release of the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe comic book craze has begun anew, and already, hundreds of new adventures and heroes have been made for and sold to the American people."

One of the big losses was Captain America, who faced a massive downturn in popularity after the war, and was mostly forgotten about. With the sudden resurgence of comic books however, writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby have revived Captain America in a new issue of the Fantastic Four. The comic describes Captain America having been frozen in ice while on a secret mission to stop a Nazi invasion through Antarctica, but returned to be a champion of justice anew.\n\nWith the Cold War in full swing, and a young generation growing up in need of new heroes, Captain America has seen a massive resurgence in popularity.\n\nHis adventures, normally involving bashing fascist's attempting to strike at America and other national enemies, appeals greatly to the new generation of Americans. Some have criticized the caricature depictions of the Japanese, though these criticisms have been mostly ignored, and despite them, Captain America has become the best selling comic book in the nation's history."

With the sudden resurgence of comic books however, writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby have revived Captain America in a new issue of the Fantastic Four. The comic describes Captain America having been frozen in ice while on a secret mission to stop a Nazi invasion through Antarctica, but returned to be a champion of justice anew.\n\nWith the Cold War in full swing, and a young generation growing up in need of new heroes, Captain America has seen a massive resurgence in popularity.\n\nHis adventures, normally involving bashing fascist's attempting to strike at America and other national enemies, appeals greatly to the new generation of Americans. Some have criticized the caricature depictions of the Japanese, though these criticisms have been mostly ignored."

Following the adventures of Luke Skywalker, aged monk Obiwan Kenobi, Princess Leia Amidala, and the roguish Han Solo and his alien companion, Chewbacca, Star Wars has provided millions with an awe inducing journey from Luke's homeworld in the backwater Yavin IV to the frightening depths of space and the horrifying Death Star space station, which many have claimed is a reference to the late Führer Göring's ill-fated 'Sun Gun'.\n\nEven George Lucas, the director of the film, had anticipated an utter flop, especially after the Tunisian debacle, but has been made rich overnight by the massive blowout sales.\n\nStar Wars provides a glimmer into a faraway land, of ancient religions and dark empires, where the line between good and evil seems clear, and where those who fight for good may win against unassailable odds.\n\nIn a world so rife with tension and fear, slowly dragging itself away from the abyss and towards what many pray to be a beautiful, new century for man, this might be just what the people needed.\n\nA new hope."

The blow of the defections in the Senate, Nixon's impeachment and Kennedy's assassination means that the National Progressive Pact has a serious chance at the Presidency, especially as the Republican-Democrats continue to founder, directionless. There still remains, however, a small window of opportunity to run a campaign of unity and restraint, blitzing the nation with what little political clout the Republican-Democrats still have.

 USA.34.t: "World Chess Champion Forfeits Title!"
 USA.34.desc: "Ever since he became a grandmaster at the age of 15, Bobby Fischer has solidified his position as perhaps the strongest chess player alive. After his unanimous victory in the 1969 Chess Championship against Bent Larsen of Denmark, he has been considered by many observers as the greatest American grandmaster of all time, and has achieved the highest ELO rating in recorded history. But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Pact. He has openly described himself as a Sovereigntist, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit... I would rather be branded a traitor by you FIDE degenerates than to go against another intellectually superior Aryan of my own blood." It appears as if he will continue to stir discontent if we let him say what he wants to say. What should we do?"

Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Germany, claiming to have been contested by a local club in Bavaria. However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism. What we have sacrificed may have been just a pawn, but every piece matters as the game unfolds..."

The United States government has restricted Fischer's behavior since, monitoring his games and preventing him from attending conferences for the German-American Bund. Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Bavaria, claiming to have been contested by a local club. However, upon arrival he instead entered a foreign ministry where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich, offering to play for our cause in the future.\n\nUpon being notified of the grandmaster's internment, the Führer has personally announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and appointing him a private instructor for him to learn Deutsch. All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess." With Darga agreeing to play with him against the United States in 1975, we are now certain of our dominance over the game's global scene. The rest of the chess world now perpetually belongs in our check."

 USA.37.t: "Infernal Squeaking"
 USA.37.desc: "Ever since the unit had chased the Huns into the bushveld, there had been that squeaking. That infernal squeaking- it was driving Logan mad. He didn't know what it was, nor where it came from, but he knew it was annoying.\n\nIt wasn't that the sound was unpleasant, per se- in fact, he would have described it as "cute" to an outside observer. It wasn't even that it was loud- it was pretty quiet- quiet enough that talking or screwing around would drown it out- two things that Logan's unit did often.\n\nNo, it was the fact that it was ever present- more than that, it was the fact that Logan had no idea what it was that was causing it. At first he thought he was going insane- but his squadmates heard it too. His second thought was that it was some newfangled German technology- but that didn't make much sense either- the sound might have been annoying, but it wasn't really doing anything. Not really, anyway.\n\nIt was something like the third day they had been in the bushveld (and a month since Logan had been deployed to South Africa) when he finally decided to find out. At exactly 2:30 AM, South African Standard Time, Logan got out of his cot and grabbed a flashlight. Without a second thought, he left the tent- his squadmates were all fast asleep and didn't notice a thing- not that they would have cared.\n\nIt took about an hour before he found the source. He had realized about thirty minutes in that the sound was coming from below, not above- so he modified his search routine. He didn't need to scan the trees with the flashlight anymore, and just started focusing on the ground. He overturned rocks and looked in holes- he had to find something.\n\nFinally, he found them- he flipped over a rock, and there they were: countless tiny potatoes. Logan thought they were potatoes- but a closer look revealed this to be untrue. They were moving- and squeaking. They were frogs- tiny little round frogs, burrowing into the wet dirt."

 USA.38.t: "Why Expand the OFN?"
 USA.38.desc: "With both the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Organization of Free Nations courting the newly democratic nation of Italy, there has been an increased push from within the United States to attempt to convince the government to put in more effort into convincing the newly appointed Italian government.\n\nPolitical analyst Jeane Kirkpatrick, writing for Commentary magazine, also weighs in on the issue; in her new article "Why Expand the OFN?"\n\nIn the article, Kirkpatrick refers to the Empire of Italy as a "western nation with western institutions," claiming that the admission of Italy to the alliance would provide a crucial counterweight to increasing German influence in both Europe and the world. Access to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the oil that it brings are all crucial to the United States and her allies, Kirkpatrick argues.\n\nWhile the middle east may be relatively stable now- under a variety of Italian aligned regimes and dictatorships- the probability of it remaining this stable is unlikely, Kirkpatrick argues. This new threat may come from Islamists or the Nazis themselves, but Italy would provide a crucial ally in the region.\n\nKirkpatrick calls on the President and the government in general to increase diplomatic overtures in an attempt to woo the Italians into the alliance- by any means necessary. Be it military or economic promises, Kirkpatrick argues that no cost is too high for a new, strong ally in Europe."

 USA.49.t: "Immaculate Impressions"
 USA.49.d: "Another look into the mirror. One sweaty hand went to the tie around his neck, seeing it just a millimeter or two off center, which was immediately corrected. An obsessive attention to immaculance to some, but to him impressions were the difference between success and failure. Anything less than perfection damaged first impressions - and you only got one first impression.\n\nWhen people thought of battlefields, they thought of bombed-out fields, armies of soldiers, and parades of weapons and tanks. When they thought of soldiers, they pictured camouflage, body armor, guns, and helmets. These days, a new battlefield was taking shape. One not in trenches and bloodied streets, but in boardrooms, hotels, and balconies in dim lighting. A battlefield where the weapons were pens and words, and its soldiers wore pressed suits and ties. Different tools, yet curiously similar outcomes.\n\nThese battlefields had consequences just as real as any single conflict. Success or failure meant the difference between peace or war, it determined which nations would prosper or regress, and which people would live or die - and that was before his own career implications. Failure for him? Showing weakness? At best a demotion. At worst being removed and blacklisted.\n\nThe diplomat swallowed again, once more going over his appearance in the mirror. As he made sure his cheeks were perfectly smooth, he wondered if his brother felt such stress when he was on the front lines. If he felt the weight of knowing that the decisions he made would have ramifications not just over life and death, but the fate of nations as well.\n\nThe art of diplomacy was delicate, yet essential. Seeing the time, he stepped away from the mirror, steeled himself, and let his hands fall to his side. The tie was straight, his cheeks were smooth, his hair styled, and his suit pressed. It was time to go to work, and change the world."

The threat of nuclear annihilation now hangs over the head of humanity, and the age of grand invasions and overwhelming force is no more. Yet war itself has not ended, it has merely adapted. War was once loud, now it has gone quiet.\n\nThe battleground has shifted from the homelands of superpowers to the nations large and small beyond their reach. Influence has become the dominant currency, one which we acquire and spend as do our rivals. This war of influence is fought across the world, from the most prosperous nations to the smallest islands.\n\nThere remains much of the world that remains undecided as to their path and we must utilize our power to exploit this. Be it through volunteers, money, weapons, or political support, we must use every tool and piece of leverage at our disposal to move them in the proper direction. If one of these dominoes falls in our direction, then many more will soon follow. However - the same is true of our enemies.\n\nIn this new theater of war, allies great and small must be acquired if we are to succeed. For if our interests are to be permanently secured, we must ensure that we are dominant throughout the world.\n\nAnd should we fail, our irrelevancy and destruction is assured."

 USA.51.desc: "When we took the brave decision to join in South Africa's defensive war against German aggressors, there were many who claimed that we had entered a pointless war, one where true victory was impossible due to the circumstances of the situation. Yet, when the final Reichskommissariat surrendered and their leaders were taken into custody, none could deny the fact that we had achieved overwhelming victory against the forces of tyranny.\n\nDuring the war, we discovered the deplorable conditions the native peoples of Africa were kept in by their German oppressors. Disease and famine were common, and the regimes cared little for their people beyond how much wealth could be extracted before they ran dry. This has to change.\n\nOur South African allies have taken administrative control over Namibia, Rhodesia, and southern Mozambique. That leaves the vast swathes of land in central Africa under our control. Keeping the land would be a ridiculous and idiotic idea. However we must choose whether to establish multiple democratic states in the area, or whether to attempt to create a single, unified central African state."

It seems that many of these former native SS members have either joined the ANC, local SS resistance movements or perhaps worst of all, become bandits roving the countryside looting and pillaging as they please.\n\nThe ANC, now exceptionally strengthened and radicalized by the influx of ex-SS members, continues its violent guerrilla campaigns against our allies in the region. Worst of all the ANC now enjoys a wide base of support, both from the native African population and whatever is left of the old reichskommissarat forces.\n\nSouth Africa's garrisons have proven ineffective at containing the ANC rebels within their zone of administration. As they are often misled into traps by local African villagers, and despite the harsh reprisals such actions engender they show no signs of stopping. The local regions around South African garrisons are slowly transformed into wastelands patroled by brutal military patrols, for some, it is as the Rechiskommisarats never left.\n\nAs it stands South Africa is slowly taking the place of the old German colonies, both domestically and abroad. Anti-war protests continue, and now focus exclusively on the multitudes of war crimes committed by our supposed allies"

It will become all one thing or all the other."\n- Abraham Lincoln\n\nThough the institution of slavery was torn down at the end of the Civil War by the 13th Amendment, a failed Reconstruction and decades of Jim Crow ensured that the issue of race would not or could not be solved. As the divides within the Republican-Democratic Coalition grow, debates turning to fights and friends turning to enemies, the truth only becomes clearer and clearer: the coalition as it stands cannot be saved. Yet there is still time to act. America must once again reckon with its issues of race, be it through words or war. We can only pray for less blood to be shed this time around, for the fate of the world rests upon this near-divided house."

#Nixon's Wild Ride events
#  USA.70.t: "The End of the Missile Crisis"
#  USA.70.desc: "For the past several weeks, the United States has been embroiled in a crisis with Japan. Our former jewel in the Pacific, Hawaii, has been turned into a staging point for Japanese medium-range ballistic missiles, which were discovered by a CIA U-2C spy plane not long ago.\n\nAfter a tense standoff between the USN 1st Fleet and the IJN, Vice-President Kennedy approached the Empire with an offer - the United States would remove its own MRBMs from Australia in return for the Japanese doing the same in Hawaii. After several rounds of tense negotiations, this offer was accepted, despite the urging of the Joint Chiefs, who argued that it was the perfect time to reclaim America's lost territory.\n\nThe doves prevailed, and today both sides are removing our missiles. This has been a major diplomatic coup for Kennedy, who is being hailed across the nation as a hero for his actions in the crisis. President Nixon, on the other hand, mostly stayed out of the negotiations, and has been widely criticized for such."

 USA.71.t: "Protest in Birmingham"
 USA.71.desc: "The Civil Rights movement is reaching its crescendo. All across America there are protests, rallies, and riots hosted by Civil Rights activists, and they get worse by the month. Just this week, a massive march was held in Birmingham, Alabama, the heart of the segregationist south, with tens of thousands of activists, white and black alike, calling for equal rights.\n\nAlthough it started civil, local police chief Eugene 'Bull' Connor quickly deployed riot police and set dogs loose on the protesters. The peaceful march quickly turned into a running battle in the streets between police and activists.\n\nThis event has been widely televised across the nation, with average Americans shocked by the police brutality on display in Birmingham. Many of the more liberal news sources across the United States have likened the events in Alabama to those in Germany decades ago, citing police brutality and the suppression of activists to draw parallels with the Nazi regime."
 USA.71.a: "Worrying."

 USA.72.t: "Counter-Protest in Birmingham"
 USA.72.desc: "One week ago, civil rights activists held a protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that quickly devolved into a riot. Now, tens of thousands of people opposed to the civil rights movement have staged a counter-march, waving the flags of the Confederacy, their home state, and even a few swastikas.\n\nIn comparison to the previous week, the police chief didn't even bother deploying more than a few lightly equipped beat cops, several of which joined in the protest. Furthermore, there are reports that pro-civil rights activists, attempting to flock to Birmingham to continue the movement, have been driven out of the city by police and locals alike, with several would-be protesters returning home battered and bruised.\n\nWith the rising violence in Birmingham and elsewhere, Vice-President Kennedy has reportedly convinced President Nixon to consider federalising the Alabama National Guard and deploying it to restore order in the state."
 USA.72.a: "Even more worrying!"

 USA.73.t: "German Spy Arrested!"
 USA.73.desc: "According to his landlord, Joseph Greenberg was a rather unassuming fellow: he paid his rent on time, never had any noise complaints, and always helped old Mrs. Conners carry her groceries up the stairs. In reality, this was all a cover, something the landlord learned when she opened Greenberg's empty apartment to the sight of piles of surveillance equipment and folders with swastikas stamped upon them. Thinking quickly, she called the police, who in turn informed the FBI and arrested Greenberg this morning as he left for work.\n\nJoseph Greenberg was revealed to actually be Josef Hansen, an agent for the German Abwehr. Ironically disguised as a Jewish American, his mission was to secure a job at Bell Telephone, study their communications infrastructure, and identify flaws for the installation of wiretaps and other espionage methods. Even more concerning was that his phone book had the telephone number of several local NPP politicians inside, and it seemed he was trying to contact the Pact's fringe elements, including the fascist agitator Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nCharges for violation of the Espionage Act are already being brought against him, though he will likely end up simply being deported back to Germany, rather than facing a long prison term in the United States."
 USA.73.a: "That's one less Nazi to worry about."

 USA.74.t: "Conversations from the Street"
 USA.74.desc: "The two young men walked down the streets of LA, basking in the midday sun, but the topic of their conversation was distinctly gloomier. "So did you hear about the Nazi spy they caught out in New York? They're saying he was trying to get in touch with Yockey, of all people!"\n\n"It's crazy, isn't it?" the other replied. "I know how much they hate the Japanese-hell, who doesn't around here-but I never thought they'd get in bed with the Krauts!"\n\n"The spy was just reaching out to them, didn't say nothing about them agreeing to anything." the first man continued.\n\nThe two men, like plenty of others out in California, had their own sympathies toward the NPP. After all, everyone in LA or the Bay Area had to live only a few miles away from a humiliating reminder of 1945, and the NPP were the only ones who seemed to have any interest in getting the treaty ports back.\n\nHe turned to his friend and asked. "So what do you think, was Yockey in on it or nah?""
 USA.74.a: ""He's definitely wearing lederhosen underneath.""
 USA.74.b: ""Sounds like a commie load of bull.""

 USA.75.t: "Media Slams Nixon"
 USA.75.desc: "Although President Nixon's sweeping electoral victory two years ago may prove that he once enchanted the American people, it seems that the magic that swept them to the polls in 1960 is wearing off for many of them. And many of those people also happen to be journalists at nationally syndicated newspapers.\n\nHeadlines riddled with pun-laden insults seem to be everywhere, and titles like "Nixon Needs Fixin'," "Tricky Dick in a Pickle," and "Law(lessness) and (Dis)order" fill the newsstands. Their main source of ire is the rising tension of the civil rights movement in the South, and specifically the President's inability to properly contain it. The man who once staved off nuclear armageddon, or so we would claim, now seems powerless to stop a bunch of student protesters and racist hoodlums from squaring off, and his image is deteriorating as a result. And Nixon -who seems impish and anemic when compared to Vice President Kennedy's charm and charisma- needs all the positive press he can get. All he can do for now is hope that they will eventually change their tune, though he cynically insists that the press has a grudge against him that they simply will not let go."

 USA.76.desc: "-SECRET-\n\nThe Situation and Prospects in South Africa\n\n(TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\nCONCLUSIONS:\nA) The South African Federation faces a similar issue to our own of Civil Rights. Despite never having implemented the so-called "Apartheid" system proposed by the National Party, the continuing legal, social, and economic inequality between black and white South Africans are prime breeding grounds for social unrest-something the already weakened government cannot afford.\nB) Boer agitation in the North-West of South Africa has grown stronger in the past two years, especially as the government moves to pass legislation addressing racial inequality. The Boers live relatively isolated from wider South African society, and hold proud traditions of political independence and armed defense. An organized uprising is likely in the near future.\nC) A direct invasion by South Africa's northern neighbors, the African Reichskommissariats (Reich Commissariats), would be very unlikely in the current situation. As they almost entirely rely on their mother nation to provide material and political support to prop up their governments, all their military forces are tied up in internal peacekeeping operations. However, should this support ever be withdrawn, their actions may turn erratic to the point of losing any sense of predictability.\nD) The wider American public would not be vehemently opposed to direct intervention in South Africa should the situation change to require it.\n(TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\n\n-SECRET-"

 USA.77.t: "Blackmail in the White House"
 USA.77.desc: "The rigid manila envelope on the White House staffer's desk had nothing that struck him as unusual, save the absence of a return address. He tore the end open and peeked inside, finding nothing more than a small bundle of papers and photographs. But when he saw what they were, his blood ran cold. Internal memos from the 1960 Progressive National Convention, transcripts of private conversations between NPP senators, schematics on wiretaps, photos taken inside NPP campaign headquarters, and most chillingly, a letter from Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman authorizing the espionage. At the bottom of the envelope was notecard with a message typed on it: "Unless you want this on the front page of the Post next week, contact me and we'll talk," with the address for a P.O. box printed on the other side.\n\nThe staffer had enough wits about him to immediately reseal the envelope, call the F.B.I., and pass it on to them. In under an hour, it was on J. Edgar Hoover's desk. A brief call to Nixon informed him that the staffer agreed to stay quiet, the bureau's top men were already set on tracking the blackmailer down, and it would all be over in a matter of days."
 USA.77.a: "Time to call some plumbers."

 USA.78.t: "The FBI Pounces"
 USA.78.desc: "The task of apprehending the unknown White House blackmailer was hardly difficult. The P.O. box had been registered under a false name and paid for in cash, so the F.B.I. decided to play along and write a letter "agreeing" to the blackmailer's demands and asked to meet in person. Surprisingly, the blackmailer showed up suspecting nothing, and was immediately nabbed by federal agents.\n\nThe blackmailer turned out to be a 24 year old NPP activist, one Charles B. Juno, but they have had little success getting more than that out of him. He has refused to say anything besides requests for a lawyer, but fingerprint evidence has left no doubt to him being the one who sent the envelope. The Bureau's best guess is that he's a misguided progressive who wanted to force through change with some underhanded methods, but that's all they've got to go on. Charges of espionage and mail fraud are already working their way through the pipeline, and he'll hopefully go to trial by November. With any luck (and a bit of nudging from the White House), it could get moved up to October or late September, meaning that he'll be safely behind bars when the midterm elections roll around."
 USA.78.a: "Three cheers to Hoover and his boys!"

 USA.79.t: "An Internal Investigation"
 USA.79.desc: "Despite the jubilation about catching the blackmailer, the mood in the White House and the Department of Justice building quickly turned sour when an unpleasant piece of information came forward: Charles Juno wasn't acting alone.\n\nThere was no way that the envelope could have been screened and intercepted with the other incoming mail unless a co-conspirator on the inside had helped it get through. The Secret Service immediately began investigating potential leads in the mail room, but to little success so far. The White House staff are all whispering about something that's going on, and most of them suspect that it's an information breach that involves the NPP in some way.\n\nEven worse are the rumors going about that another Grey Scare is on the horizon, but directed at any and all NPP members. Although this is currently limited to the White House-and there are certainly very few professed NPP members in the Nixon administration-it would lead to widespread panic if the news leaked to the rest of the executive branch's bureaucracy, let alone the press."
 USA.79.a: "This is getting complicated."

 USA.80.t: "Extra, Extra!"
 USA.80.desc: "Richard Nixon had never thought he would say it, but he was feeling thankful for the press.\n\nClippings from nearly a dozen newspapers sat on his desk, ranging from respected national publications to supermarket tabloids printed on paper you could almost see through. All of them had headlines, with various levels of luridity, claiming NPP members had ties with the Nazis. From hot mics unknowingly picking up comments sympathetic to Albert Speer, to a former German-American Bund member shaking hands with his Congressman, to tapes where pact officials discussed giving Francis Parker Yockey's radical wing funds if their members ran for office.\n\nFor once, the shoe was on the other foot. The NPP were desperately scrambling to summon a press conference and denounce the accusations, and the press would likely not put them in a sympathetic light. Meanwhile, Nixon ordered for a press conference of his own to be called soon, where he could address the "deeply troubling implications" of these stories head-on. Even though it was a scant bit of breathing room after being hounded for his civil rights stance, now could be the perfect time to go on the offensive and really rail on the NPP."
 USA.80.a: "Kick 'em while they're down!"
 USA.80.b: "Take the high road and keep things dignified."

 USA.81.t: "Hoover's Offer"
 USA.81.desc: ""Good afternoon, Dick," J. Edgar Hoover said as he stepped into the Oval Office, quietly shutting the door behind him.\n\nNixon furrowed his brow and replied, "I told you not to call me that."\n\n"You tell me lots of things, Mister President."\n\n"Well, I've had to postpone the one press conference where the media wasn't going to be after my head, so this had better be good."\n\nWhat Hoover had to say wasn't good, but it certainly was important. The FBI's investigation into the origin of the blackmailers had seen little success, but there still remained the question of what to do with the blackmail itself. Hoover, ever cautious and considerate, asked the President whether it would be best to seal it away in some classified vault or destroy it as much as possible. Either way, it would hopefully stay buried forever. Although, it could see some value in the future. The existence of blackmail could, after all, provide a rather large boon to the President in the upcoming midterm elections."
 USA.81.a: "Burn it all."
 USA.81.b: "Keep them secret. Keep them safe."

 USA.82.t: "U-2 Almost Shot Down Over England"
 USA.82.desc: "Yesterday, German fighters based out of northern England nearly shot down a CIA U-2C piloted by Lieutenant Francis Gary Powers. Powers had just entered English airspace when four Horten Ho 229 flying wings were detected on radar. However, three were forced to turn back due to fuel range, one of which crashed in the North Sea when it got overzealous and ran out of fuel for the return trip.\n\nThe final aircraft managed to get within missile range and fired at Powers with what appears to be an experimental missile designed specifically to shoot down the U-2, before peeling off to return to base. Powers evaded the missile, then proceeded on course, completing his mission and returning to Eisenhower AFB in Iceland.\n\nDue to the classified nature of the mission, we cannot let it be known publicly that our aircraft was engaged by German fighters. No diplomatic protest will be issued, and no German scare will take the front page of the morning news. Not this time."
 USA.82.a: "Good job Gary!"

 USA.83.t: "God Bless John F. Kennedy"
 USA.83.desc: "Richard Nixon glowered as he stared at the television, watching Walter Cronkite inform the public about the recently-signed Civil Rights Act. While it was certainly a public relations boon in the North, there was just one thing that consistently irked Nixon. And that was the wall-eyed, grinning idiot plastered all over the news footage: John F. Kennedy. "Vice President Kennedy's Civil Rights Act..." "...and other civil rights leaders congratulated the Vice President..." "...to the Vice President from the NAACP."\n\nNixon stood up and shut the television off. Sure, the bill may have been first endorsed by Kennedy, but he'd had nothing to do with writing it, or even wrangling Senate votes for it! Nixon was becoming hated in the South-well, more hated than before-while Kennedy was lapping up all the glory everywhere else. His mind briefly flashed with horrifying images of Kennedy standing at the podium at the '64 national convention, graciously accepting their nomination for President, with the American people blithely forgetting what happened the last time they elected a democrat. It was in moments like this where Nixon seriously regretted not tapping Henry Cabot Lodge as his running mate."
 USA.83.a: "Yes, hooray for Kennedy."

 USA.84.t: "Presidential Veto Called into Question"
 USA.84.desc: "The protestors marched in circles around the White House, holding high placards and signs disparaging the President's recent decision to veto the Civil Rights Act. A couple even made a point of wearing Klan hoods festooned with Nixon campaign buttons. Invariably, they were all student beatniks and jobless bums with nothing better to do in their life, hollering and making noise in a desperate bid for attention.\n\nRichard Nixon watched them as they popped in and out of view between the trees and hedges of the south lawn. Couldn't those dumb kids see they were the reason he did it? He'd refused to cave to a bunch of doped-up so-called "progressives" demanding he do too much too quickly, and for that they said he was Hitler. Literally, as it turned out; he caught a glimpse of a placard where his face had been cut out from a campaign poster and pasted on an image of a saluting Führer.\n\nHe rolled his eyes and closed the curtains. He hoped they'd learn their lesson and simmer down, but that would probably be asking a bit too much of them. Instead, they spent what little brainpower they had deifying Jack Kennedy of all people and calling for him to join the NPP as their candidate in '64."
 USA.84.a: "Not everyone is blessed with intelligence."

 USA.85.t: "Nixon Attacked for Lack of Action"
 USA.85.desc: "As President Nixon continues to sit idly through the civil rights crisis, seemingly every wing of society continues to lambast the President for taking no action on the civil rights issue. The presse, the Senate, former allies and foes of Nixon alike. They all seem to stand together in agreement on one issue: the President is not doing enough. Progressives complain of the enduring injustices endured by black America, and Segregationists complain that not enough is being done to protect their states from the activists who seek to impose an end to segregation upon them.\n\nAs rumours stir of a wave of Senatorial defections towards the NPP in protest of Presidential inaction, everyone begins to wonder: when will the President act? Many tabloids have even begun to publish talk of Vice President Kennedy himself jumping to the NPP, and many Americans have begun to believe it. Whilst such claims might not be entirely reputable, the unity of the Republican-Democratic Coalition has never seemed weaker."
 USA.85.a: "Will President Nixon not simply do something?"

 USA.86.t: "The Two Coalition System"
 USA.86.desc: "The National Progressive Pact is growing in influence and popularity across the nation, and is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to the decades long Republican-Democrat dominance of American politics. Though the NPP is on the rise, they could certainly be made to rise a little higher, if, for example, some government resources were sent their way without anyone being any the wiser. Alternatively, we could shore up support of the RDC instead, and hope that the NPP's rise is nothing more than a passing fad. Nevertheless, whomever we choose will have a bigger chance of winning the race to the Oval Office in '64."
 USA.86.a: "The status quo exists for a reason."
 USA.86.b: "It's time for some change."

 USA.87.t: "CIA Report: Adolf Hitler"
 USA.87.desc: "-TOP SECRET-\n\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT: Adolf Hitler's Health\n\n1. On January 20th, a Tokumusoukan agent attacked Adolf Hitler in an attempt to assassinate him but was stopped short by German security forces, who swiftly shot him dead. Despite the undeniable Tokumusoukan connections held by the agent, leaked Abwehr documents and sources close to SUNSHINE show no evidence of Japanese involvement despite material and method matching perfectly. This is corroborated by both SAKURA and LILY, but sources close to the IJN and IJA could not further verify the information, and friendly agents in Germania were unable to retrieve the body and weapon for closer analysis.\n2. Hitler's health has been in a state of constant decline ever since the signing of the 1945 Armistice. There is now strong reason to believe he is no longer competent to lead Germany, as many of his duties have been delegated out to various ministers and aides. Any attempt at high level diplomatic contact should be considered impossible while Germany lacks a competent Führer.\n3. Despite an official nomination of a successor, the Führer's succession line is far from assured. With the four candidates jostling for favor from the army, students, and other power bases, the situation is quickly turning volatile. The immediate withdrawal of SUNSHINE and EAGLE is recommended for consideration.\n4. Adolf Hitler is estimated to have a maximum of six (6) months left to live.\n5. Should Adolf Hitler die, a wide-scale armed conflict is almost inevitable in Germany.\n6. Should an extended conflict break out in Germany, the Einheitspakt is likely to collapse, though armed conflict between the German Reichskommissariats (Reich Commissariats) seems unlikely, with internal unrest posing a much greater issue for many of them.\n\n-TOP SECRET-"
 USA.87.a: "Understood."

 USA.88.t: "A Burglary in Washington"
 USA.88.desc: "It wasn't uncovered until the next morning, when a janitor noticed flecks of paint on the ground. He inspected the room and realized that it had come from the window frame, which had been pried open during the night with a crowbar. The police were swiftly called, and the Republican-Democratic headquarters turned into a crime scene.\n\nNeedless to say, the atmosphere in the White House was one of anxiety. There were no eyewitnesses, no fingerprints, and no signs of the getaway vehicle. Everyone felt that it had to be the NPP in search of reelection campaign strategies, but the President and those in the know had far greater fears. If the NPP, or someone sympathetic to their cause, was indeed behind the robbery, what might they have found out about Nixon's...less-than-reputable campaign strategies from 1960?"
 USA.88.a: "The past has a way of haunting people."

 USA.89.t: "The Investigation Concludes"
 USA.89.desc: "For what feels like the first day in a long time, people are finally starting to breathe a little easier in the White House. The police's investigation of the Republican-Democrat headquarters break-in has concluded, and while the identity of the burglars has yet to be known, the concern was less who they were and more what they may have taken.\n\nWhile a number of file cabinets were ransacked during the break-in, a cross-reference of the indexes revealed that hardly any files were missing. The only ones that were gone related to some re-election campaign strategies for 1964, and those thankfully contained no mention of certain stunts pulled during the last election. The President's paranoia that the NPP were just as ruthless as he feared is beginning to dissipate, allowing him and his staff to once again focus on the state of the nation and other, more important matters. This chapter of the Nixon administration has been closed, for now at least."
 USA.89.a: "And may it stay that way."

 USA.90.t: "The News Leaks"
 USA.90.desc: "This morning, the press offices of the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Globe, and half a dozen other newspapers of repute received the same anonymous package. Inside were a group of photocopies, detailing how the Nixon campaign and the FBI conspired to wiretap political opponents during the 1960 election. Needless to say, the outrage from the National Progressive Pact was immediate and fierce. George Wallace took to national television in the afternoon in an interview upon the front steps of the Alabama Capitol, in which he looked to the cameras and called President Nixon a "corrupt crook," and concluded with demands that he resign at once.\n\nThe White House and the Republican-Democrat National Convention have clammed up for the time being, refusing to issue a statement to the press about the documents' origins or veracity. While keeping their heads low and letting it blow over may have worked in the past with minor scandals, something as broad as this is simply too massive to ignore. The press, the public, and especially the National Progressive Pact will not tolerate Nixon's silence for much longer."
 USA.90.a: "Deny everything!"

 USA.91.t: "Damage Control"
 USA.91.desc: "For the first time since information on the wiretaps leaked to the press, President Nixon has called a press conference in the ballroom of Washington's Mayflower Hotel. The press, obviously eager to hear his comments on the scandal, arrived in droves.\n\nThe questions, many of which focused on the wiretaps, were biting and intrusive, but Nixon handled them with the skill of a master debater. He danced around the questions with such grace that plenty of people seemed to overlook that he never gave a direct answer at all. He changed topics, he spun yarns, he equivocated, but even all his skills couldn't stop the question of the wiretaps from coming up again and again.\n\nFinally, he decided to confront one reporter's question of "To what extent would you cooperate with a federal investigation into the possibility of a cover-up?" head-on.\n\nAfter a lengthy non-answer on the values of liberty and egalitarianism, he concluded with "I will cooperate, and in fact welcome, this sort of investigation. I have never attempted to cover up a crime or obstruct justice, because I have committed no crimes to cover up. This investigation will tell the American people what they need to know: whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.""

 USA.94.desc: "It wasn't clear how the bomber managed to acquire a uniform, nor how he managed to smuggle his bag through the security checkpoint without getting searched. But no matter how it happened, the result was still the same: a man disguised as a dockworker managed to sneak a duffel bag with a firebomb inside onto the deck of the IJN battleship Shinano, where it exploded late last night. In what could only be described as miraculous, no sailors or dock workers were killed, but three Japanese sailors and an American fireman suffered serious burns during the explosion and subsequent attempts to put it out.\n\nThe Japanese government is apoplectic with rage, with their ambassador describing the bombing as "all but an act of war," and presenting a long list of demands, which they had likely drafted some time ago and were waiting for the opportunity, as reparation. Most notable are a massive increase in security around the ports (all on America's dime, of course) and a televised apology from President Nixon himself.\n\nNixon, needless to say, refuses to let things go over that poorly. He has reached out through every diplomatic backchannel to get the Japanese to avoid making a public release, insisting that he can make a deal that satisfies everyone while saving face."

Never could he have imagined that such a longshot deal could be so successful, let alone from an incident that seemed increasingly minor as time went on.\n\nThe bombing of the battleship Shinano had not been all that long ago. Yet, after the incident, the Japanese diplomatic corps had been swarmed with demands for reparations from Tokyo. In all seriousness though, the ship had received little damage from the American dock worker's stunt.\n\nHowever, that did not stop his office from getting into contact with President Nixon. After all, he was a man proud of his foreign policy and would surely be eager to get a step up on his vice president, the diplomat reasoned. Still, he could not imagine getting not only the reparations asked for, but additional security as well.\n\nHe chuckled to himself. The bomber might have been a greater asset to Japan than he could have ever hoped for. Now was not the time for gloating though, at least not publicly. Any publicity could cause a scandal for the president and thus a revoking of their deal. He would keep his lips shut, the diplomat thought. After all, appearance was a small cost to pay for the sheer success in results."

 USA.96.desc: "Some political theorists believe that ideas are a top-down phenomenon: they start in the minds of politicians and think-tanks, who use the media to spread them, and they percolate into the minds of the people. Others think that it is bottom-up: they gain momentum among the common folk, and as they gain more publicity, the message bubbles upward and reaches those with actual political power and the ability to shape policy.\n\nBut whether it's top-down, bottom-up, or merely a case of great minds thinking alike (though the Republican-Democrats would consider it "fools seldom differ"), both National Progressive Pact politicians and their constituents are calling for the beginning of impeachment procedures against President Nixon. If they begin, he would be the first President to be impeached since Andrew Johnson, nearly a century prior. But that is not what concerns Nixon. He is well aware that his rivals have little love for them, and the projected effects on his 1964 re-election bid are currently minimal.\n\nWhat he fears is not what the NPP is saying, but the fact that some of the RDC are starting to listen."

 USA.97.t: "The Shinano Files"
 USA.97.desc: "This morning's issue of the San Francisco Chronicle featured a fairly prominent political cartoon, printed far larger than most others are. Specifically, one of President Nixon on his hands and knees, blubbering as he kisses the boots of a goblin-faced, buck-toothed Hirohito and dries them using a dirtied American flag. The caption below simply reads "The Tricky Dick Kowtow."\n\nWord of Nixon's under-the-table negotiations with the Japanese after the IJN Shinano bombing has reached the public, and the hawks in the media are having a field day with it. While the negotiations were indisputably legal, it nonetheless undermines Nixon's image as a devoted patriot who fights the evils of fascism across both oceans. The National Progressive Pact has already started drafting advertisements mocking the deal in anticipation of the 1964 election, and the already hawkish public in California is eating them up. Despite California being his home state, Nixon's odds of electoral victory in November look to be more of an uphill battle than anticipated..."

 USA.98.t: "Department of Justice Begins Investigation"
 USA.98.desc: "Today, the Department of Justice have announced that they are officially launching into a federal investigation of the wiretapping accusations, seeking to determine whether or not the claims are legitimate and whether President Nixon was involved. The support was nearly unanimous from the National Progressive Pact's politicians and constituents, as well as some of the President's more vocal critics within the Republican-Democratic Coalition. Even the President has publicly praised the investigation, swearing up and down that it will exonerate him of the malicious and ill-founded rumors that have been haunting him for months.\n\nPrivately, however, it is another story. The moment he got to his private office in Room 180, he slammed the door behind him and vented to his staffers about how the investigation was a shame, a farce, a conspiracy to destroy everything he accomplished! No group was safe from his invective; the National Progressive Pact, "dirty traitors" in the Republican-Democrats, the wiretappers for leaving so much evidence, J. Edgar Hoover for being sloppy in burying the evidence, alleged conspirators in the FBI and the White House, and everyone else who ever wronged him in his Presidential career. Epithets like "Jew bastards" were invoked multiple times, and at the end, he made everyone in the office swear not to breathe a word of it to a living soul."
 USA.98.a: "They're all out to get him!"

The White House Press Secretary was unavailable for-"\n\nNixon switched off the TV. Just as he had feared. It felt like everyone was trying to find a bone to pick with him, and they wouldn't rest until they had torn down everything he accomplished during his Presidency. As he stood up and walked back to his desk, he couldn't help but wonder how much of this was simply paying the price for old sins.\n\nAnd how the hell did the Post even get those tapes in the first place?!"

And there is nobody in our government, nor should there be anybody, who considers himself immune to the very laws he swore to defend and uphold. This is not a matter of partisanship, this is a matter of democracy and dictatorship, of Americanism and anti-Americanism."\n\n"Vice President Kennedy, are you insinuating that the investigation into the President for criminal activity is justified?"\n\n"I am saying that any question of alleged wrongdoing on the President's part can only be answered in the court of law."\n\n"If President Nixon is impeached and removed from office, how would you react?"\n\n"I would respect the decision of the Senate."\n\nNixon grabbed the clicker and switched off the television with a grunt of frustration. He thought that Kennedy could smooth things over at the press conference; instead, he all but admitted he was leaving his own President out to dry! Every day, it felt as if another prominent member of the administration was issuing some kind of veiled condemnation, hoping to save their own hides if he went down. Just like rats on a sinking ship."

 USA.101.t: "Nixon Staffers Arrested"
 USA.101.desc: "The men were led out of the State, War, and Navy Building in handcuffs by FBI agents, trying their best to not look remorseful in front of the press's dozens of popping flashbulbs. Their charges had yet to be announced publicly, but few had any doubts about what they were. Those who hadn't violated federal wiretapping laws were invariably involved in the cover-up that followed. The press was less interested in what crimes they committed, however, and more in who ordered them. They were all racing to answer one question: how high up does it go?\n\nRichard Nixon watched the parade from room 180, silently fuming as the condemned were marched past the press and into a waiting police van. He KNEW Hoover could've dragged his feet and delayed the warrants if he wanted to, but he clearly had no interest in sticking by his President.\n\n"Should've fired that bastard on day one..." Nixon muttered to himself as the van sped off and the reporters dispersed.\n\nPardoning them could've worked, but that would require them to be tried and convicted first, not to mention burning away more goodwill than it's worth. Like all the other messes bearing down upon him, Nixon would need allies and time to get out of this, and both were in dangerously short supply."

 USA.102.desc: "Senators Johnson, Bennett, and Speaker of the House McCormack sat across from President Nixon in the Oval Office, the tension between the three Congressmen so thick you could cut it with a knife. All the formalities had been dealt with, so all that remained was their assessment of how the upcoming impeachment trial would go.\n\nMcCormack was the first to break the ice. "The situation on Capitol Hill is, to put it bluntly, sir, gloomy."\n\nNixon's brow furrowed. "Damn gloomy?"\n\n"Yes, sir," McCormack replied, not missing a beat. "When the articles of impeachment are read before the House, there's no question as to which way the vote will go. As for the Senate..."\n\nJohnson took over where McCormack left off. "In the Senate, you'll need, what, thirty-four votes to acquit? You'll probably get twelve, maybe fifteen if you're lucky. Even if I put the fear o' God into every Senator on the floor, you'd never hit thirty-four."\n\n"And which way would you gentlemen vote?" Nixon asked the Senators. They stared down at the floor, their silence betraying their intentions. For a brief moment, a maelstrom of rage seemed to brew behind Nixon's eyes, but it vanished as quickly as it appeared.\n\nThe rest of the meeting was rather unremarkable, and the Senators departed the White House into a swarm of journalists trying to glean a hint of what went on in there. Nixon, however, would not reveal his thoughts on the meeting until he sat down for dinner with his wife and daughters that night."

 USA.103.t: "End of the Line"
 USA.103.desc: "Richard Nixon stared at the faces surrounding him in the East Room. Staffers, Secret Service, cooks, custodians, all of them having served his administration as loyally as they could for the past four years. He had decided to pontificate to them for a few minutes. At the very least, they could learn not to do what he did.\n\n"And remember," he concluded, "though your enemies may try to drag you down, never step down to their level. Never sink into pettiness and spite. Never submerge yourself in hate, because once you do, they will triumph and you will destroy yourself. It's been an honor. Thank you." He stepped out of the East Room to muted applause.\n\nWith all the paperwork signed and noon just seconds away, Nixon opened the doors to the south lawn of the White House, holding it for Pat, Tricia, and Julie, followed by John and Jackie Kennedy. The press, of course, turned out to revel in his dethronement, a final twist of the knife. But Nixon took it in stride-he wouldn't be there for them to kick around much longer.\n\nAt the stairway to Marine One, Nixon shook Kennedy's hand, simply stating, "Keep her steady, Jack." He climbed the stairway and turned around for one last look at the White House, the staff, the guards, the reporters, the cameras, and he couldn't stop himself from smiling. He gave a wave and threw up two "V for victory" signs, chuckling at the fervent applause he got from the crowd. He then turned around and stepped onto Marine One and into history."

 USA.JFKassassination.1.desc: "The night had finally drawn its curtain over Birmingham, and yet the celebrations had not yet ceased. From the moment that the veto was announced over the radio, pro-segregation celebrations broke out across the city, and most definitely beyond. Bobby Cherry wasn't thinking about the rest of the South, however, all he could think of at the moment was hailing the barkeep for his friends, and what to do about Kennedy. The lot of his friends were jawing over their drinks, as was the rest of the bar, but there was the same thing resting in the back of the minds of all the patrons cheering the name of Wallace and flying the flag of the South.\n\n"What will Kennedy do next?" The trio of friends looked towards Cherry, who had absentmindedly let loose his thoughts. Robert, Hermann, and Thomas, lifelong friends, glanced over from their conversation, which just so happened to be exactly along the same lines. "Well, I'd imagined it was pretty obvious, Bobby, he's going to do whatever the fuck he wants with us, and he's got the fuckin' northerners going along with it." Thomas chuckled, and finished his drink as Robert and Hermann laughed along, Robert's laughter more subdued, as he glanced around the bar to see if anyone was eavesdropping.\n\n"Frankly, the man should be hung for what he tried to pull. Thank God for Nixon's spine, otherwise we wouldn't be seeing as many streamers tonight, believe me, you." Taking a sip of his beer with his face glowing with a smile, a small trickle of alcohol poured onto Hermann's shirt. Cherry cleared his throat.\n\n"Let me clarify, that's what everyone's already talking about, but what can we do about it?" The group went quiet for a moment, the tension filling the corner of the bar. One thing filled the mind of everyone present. Cherry broke the silence. "I am not letting the South get kicked around, and I need the world to know we're not letting it happen." The trio looked at one another. "Robert, you got a rifle I can borrow?""

The room was practically pitch black, save for the dust illuminated by the light peeking through shutters covering the windows. Sitting alone in his worn leather armchair, with a radio and dry shot glass sitting on his chairside table, Cherry overheard a collection of words break through the static.\n\n"... which has caused mass protests across the city..."\n\n"...it's a fucking miracle he got those rats to agree with him! If Nixon grew a goddamned spine, we..."\n\n"...Kennedy's fault! All..."\n\nCherry had been listening to the South all night. All of its anger, all of the excesses of those that had so thoroughly violated America. What's more, he knew he wasn't alone. He could just picture the families gathered around their radio sets, crying as they listened to the fate of America be decided without their word, without their input, without their say in what would happen to their livelihoods, what would happen to their culture that they fought so hard to preserve. What's more, why Kennedy thought he could pull this kind of thing and get away with it was beyond Cherry.\n\nSomeday, Kennedy was going to pay for what he'd done, though what scared Cherry the most was that the President was far from done. Cherry turned the dial on the radio, and its waves of static withered away into nothing. Then, Cherry was alone in his home, with not even the static to calm his nerves, and nothing but his thoughts to keep him company. It took him less than a minute to organize his evening musings into a plan, one that would forever put the final nail in the coffin of northern tyranny."

FBI agents, sailors, and a massive regional manhunt and round up. Nixon couldn't tolerate it. Kennedy wouldn't have. McCormack would have to.\n\nThere was too much to be done, far too little time. South Africa, the transition, Congress and more. He just didn't have time to bring Hoover and the South to heel. As the 38th President of the United States was ushered to his next meeting, he glanced at Lincoln's portrait hanging on the wall, eyes following him, judgingly. McCormack ignored it.

Nixon stood accused of wiretapping his rivals in the National Progressive Pact during the 1960 election, as well as obstruction of justice for trying to cover up the deed. With impeachment inevitable, he left of his own accord rather than be convicted and removed.\n\nThe office falls to Vice President John F. Kennedy, scion of the prominent Kennedy family.

With Speaker of the House John McCormack rushed to the White House to be inaugurated as President, few can claim to know what will come next, with the political scene as divided as ever, the NPP mobilizing to capitalize on the situation, and the American psyche left traumatized and directionless."

It was a symbol of American commitment to Brazil, of the unshatterable resolve between two giants of the hemisphere. It would make a great image for the campaign in '64.\n\n"Mr. President," said Lott in a slow, stilted voice of a military man attempting to navigate an American press conference. "I greatly appreciate your hospitality in inviting me here for the opportunity to discuss the relationship between our two states. We have much to discuss about... your bases in Brazil. The payments."\n\nThere were camera snaps. Nixon's smile did not fade but it no longer reached his eyes. His hand fell away. "Ah, we'll of course discuss many, many things about—."\n\n"I am glad to be in a friendly country with a friendly leader. I look forward to speaking to your American Congress, but I must say that the current payments you provide for your bases are simply not—."\n\nAlmost imperceptibly, Nixon's warm smile calcified. Then, in a flash, H.R. Haldeman was between the Presidents and the press, pushing the assembled crowd out the door so that the two men could talk in private about issues of security. It was an effective diversion, a believable lie. Even though Lott did not bring up the bases again, Nixon spent the remainder of their meeting stewing.

"Of course, the cause of freedom at home and abroad, uh, demands the highest quality armaments." He was trying to sell the press conference now, milk the opportunity with some surprise deal that the reporters at the Times would write about. "The arsenal of democracy is more than ready to assist our friends wherever... and whenever they need material."\n\n"You have my attention," said Lott with forced enthusiasm. For the next hour, with the cameras rolling, Nixon relished the meeting with Lott. There were discussions of solidifying military partnerships and bolstering economic ties. Nixon rambled briefly about the possibility that he, himself, might one day visit Brazil to the delight of Lott and the crowd.

Representative Symington reached out and vigorously shook the man's hand. Senator Mike Mansfield pushed his way past two junior representatives to make himself seen by the stiff, foreign President. Applause echoed through the chamber until Lott reached the rostrum. He gazed out across the body with an expression of forced appreciation and then he began his speech.\n\n"Twenty years ago, the world was in chaos. Empires built on autocracy and hate marched forth to conquer and ravage any that would not bend to their wills. There, the United States and Brazil first fought alongside each other in the name of liberty," said Lott in a tight voice. "We could not prevent the tragedies that claimed millions of lives, but we could stop them from happening again."\n\nOn it went. The Americans nodded dutifully. They pretended not to notice as Lott raced through his lines in an accented monotone, more a recitation than a speech. They were silent at the correct times and applauded at the soaring rhetoric.\n\nIn truth, the carefully constructed sentences and prose mattered little to the assembled body. What mattered more was that Lott himself was there. For those senators and representatives on foreign relations committees, for those overseeing weapons sales, the President's trip to the Capitol was a sign that Brazil was on America's side against fascism. The congressmen would do what they could to reward that support."

This time, however, the filibusters and angry outbursts are delivered to a room with a very different atmosphere. With popular support for the bill only growing, once staunch opponents are beginning to waver, and some NPP senators have even approached us in secret to give their support for the bill.\n\nMany experts are now predicting that the bill now has a very real chance of passing the senate, especially with Vice President Kennedy's authorship."

Despite the invocation of cloture, several Southern Democrats continued on increasingly incomprehensible tirades, and had to be forcibly removed from the chambers.\n\nTheir return today also brought a nasty surprise, as Strom Thurmond, Robert Byrd, and several other senators announced their defection from the Republican-Democrats. Estranged from the increasingly progressive stance of the Democrats in the Coalition, this move comes as an expected, but nonetheless nasty shock to the already troubled coalition.\n\nDespite agreeing to take the defectors, many NPP senators have publicly and privately expressed their concerns regarding the right-wing views of the defectors.

In the 15 minutes that it took Capitol Police to entirely control the situation, senators destroyed five chairs, two desks, and a chandelier, also damaging the Senate Gavel beyond repair. In total, 27 senators had to be forcibly detained and removed, and 34 treated for their wounds, albeit mostly no worse than a broken nose or blackened eye.\n\nThis shocking incident has galvanized many already-unhappy Republican-Democrats to renounce their coalitioned party membership and align with the opposing National Progressive Pact. Surprisingly, both pro and anti-Civil Rights coalition members were among the defectors, resulting in another smaller incident where senators Lyndon B. Johnson and Strom Thurmond had to be forcibly separated when they approached Minority Leader Paul Douglas at the same time, looking for an altercation."

Dissatisfaction with the coalition's inaction has driven a stake deeper than anyone could have imagined. With several senators a day renouncing their coalitioned party membership, news outlets and record keepers have had a hard time tracking the rapidly fluctuating political situation. Estimates still vary widely, but many predict that the Republican-Democratic Coalition will not survive losing two of its largest wings: the Progressives, and the Segregationists. All that remains to be seen is just how many senators leave.\n\nIn slightly better news, friction between the rapidly growing Progressive and Nationalist caucuses of the NPP has already become apparent, with vocal internal debates not uncommon on the Senate floor. Where once the Progressive Bloc of the NPP held a comfortable majority of the party's seats, this is no longer the case, its once total dominance challenged by die-hard segregationists who have flocked to the NPP over the years. A once united voting block now stalls in a growing deadlock, the avenging eagle of the NPP united only in name.\n\nYet, despite the disunity of the NPP, their ranks continue to swell, and soon it is predicted that the President will be fighting congress before the 1964 election."

 USA.113.desc: "The Civil Rights issue seems to have no end in sight, families, friends, and even Congress divided on the best solution. Our great President Nixon, however, has come up with a plan to put down the dissent once and for all. Those goddamn liberals will learn to fall in line. And they will, after Nixon crushes whatever crazy, un-American legislation they've come up with by his own hand. Estimates show that by turning his silence into lukewarm, verbal-only support, there'll be just enough support to clear a supportive bill in the Senate.\n\nAnd Vice President Kennedy has just the bill."

 USA.114.t: "Progressive Backlash"
 USA.114.desc: "The response to Nixon's surprise veto has not been subdued to say the least. What fell upon the Senate after the veto was not chaos, not calamity, but a thick silence. One moment, and then two. And then nothing.\n\nAt least for a few days.\n\nLed by senators Humphrey and Johnson, the entire Progressive Bloc of the Republican-Democratic Coalition has renounced their allegiance to the coalition, and indeed, marched out of the Senate chambers in a display of protest. Vice President Kennedy, who authored and spearheaded the bill, has refused to comment.\n\nWith the NPP gaining a torrent of support, the hegemony of the Republican-Democrats now comes under fire, and an upheaval in Congress and even the Presidency looks more and more likely."

 USA.115.desc: "Though the civil rights movement has always been present, especially after our defeat in the Second World War, recent reports have indicated an increase in violence, polarization, and popularity--both for and against the movement. Even Congress isn't free from the issue, with the progressives in the Republican-Democratic Coalition constantly in conflict with the segregationists and conservatives. And amongst it all, the NPP revels in the chaos.\n\nIt seems that the populace is no longer satisfied with our platitudes, finally recognizing our feet-dragging for what it is. We can only continue to stay the course for so long.\n\nThe nation of America is taking sides, and it's only so long before they arm themselves."

 USA.116.desc: "The issue of civil rights continues to grow out of control, as both its supporters and its detractors gain momentum and militancy. Protests and counter-protests frequently devolve into bloody clashes, city police forces are stretched thin, and at least one state has its National Guard mobilized at any given time.\n\nEven the Senate has not kept itself above this enmity. Republican-Democrat and National Progressive Senators fight over every issue, using day-long filibusters to break issues, and neither coalition being able to get a supermajority to invoke cloture and actually vote.\n\nUltimately, there is only one solution to break this cultural and political deadlock, and the only man who can do it seemingly has no interest. President Nixon sits paralyzed and tight-lipped, almost if convinced that if he refuses to act, the problem will somehow solve itself and go away. While that may very well happen, it is unclear just how long it may be before the situation starts to improve. And things have the potential to get much, much worse."

 USA.117.t: "A Torrent of Blood"
 USA.117.desc: "The city of Birmingham, Alabama was founded in 1871 by the Elyton Land Company. It quickly grew into the "Pittsburgh of the South" with the arrival of U.S. Steel. Racial tensions have always been high, doubly so with black migration into the city, and triply so with the KKK's ready access to dynamite, other explosives, and firearms.\n\nAnd now everything has come to a head in Birmingham. As yet another anti-segregationist protest made its way through the city center, explosions raked the already contentious demonstration, engulfing protester and counter-protester alike in a blaze of shock and debris. Initial reports place the casualties at 89 killed, and several hundred more wounded, but this number is likely to grow as the survivors of both sides begin to turn on each other, blaming the bomb upon their opposition. Further details are hazy, as unidentified gunfire forced first responders and journalists to retreat. Images and footage of the violence are being broadcast nationwide, with seemingly every station forgoing usual programming to report on the situation at all hours.\n\nGovernor Wallace has refused to send in the Alabama National Guard, publicly citing safety concerns and deployment fatigue. State police forces are scrambling, but seem content to safely contain the fighting instead of intervening.\n\nThe situation on the ground has only continued to deteriorate, and both sides of the Civil Rights issue have quickly rallied around "Bloody Wednesday", each side blaming the other. Fortunately, there is one message both sides are uniting around. Unfortunately, it is one calling for the President to step down."

 USA.1738.t: "Nixon's Dilemma"
 USA.1738.desc: "President Nixon had been sitting in silence at the Resolute desk for almost a full minute. Speaker John W. McCormack, who had come in expecting to make a grand presentation, was now sitting across from him and growing more uncomfortable by the minute. He had expected Nixon to read through the bill he'd handed him and then quickly offer a signature. Instead, Nixon just stared at the heading at the top of the first page:\n\n"The Kennedy Civil Rights Act."\n\nJack had some fucking nerve, thought Nixon. It was him, Johnson and the other Republicans who'd managed to bring this bill through the Senate. To be sure, Kennedy had introduced the bill and wrangled some holdout Democrats to get behind it, but he sure as shit didn't deserve the credit for this act. What was he playing at? Was this some goddamned silly attempt to make America shine in his eyes? Did Jack just hate the thought of Nixon being praised once in a blue moon?\n\nAn idea crossed Nixon's mind. If he vetoed this act, Kennedy would be ruined. The pro-Kennedy wing of the RDC didn't have a supermajority in the Senate to overturn his veto. His vice-President would have no choice but to stand by his decision. It would be the embarrassment of a lifetime. And yet...Nixon would go down with him. He wasn't a racist, he'd campaigned for Civil Rights in 1960. It would be insane to veto this act. Vetoing a landmark bill like this, especially on the heels of Bloody Wednesday, would be cutting off his nose to spite his face. Yet Kennedy would finally get what he deserved.\n\nNixon came to his senses and realized how anxious McCormack was getting. He needed to give him an answer now. He opened his mouth and said,"
 USA.1738.a: ""I will gladly sign this bill, Mr. Speaker.""
 USA.1738.b: ""Due to critical technical issues, I have no choice but to veto this bill.""

 USA.118.t: "The Long Road Ahead"
 USA.118.desc: "President Nixon has paid the price for his apathy. Many outspoken members of the Republican-Democrats, whether progressives or segregations, have announced that they refuse to share a coalition with such a spineless coward, and those few activist Congressmen who remain with the RDC have condemned his "destructive inaction" for leading to "senseless-and wholly preventable-deaths."\n\nBut despite the defections, the denunciations, and the Congressional fistfight, the Republican-Democrats still hold a majority in the Senate-if only barely. Nixon is still in power, but the odds of him and his coalition retaining it beyond 1964 are minimal. His approval ratings are at an all-time low, and Republican-Democrats' polling numbers are in freefall. They are matched by an equally meteoric rise in support for the National Progressive Pact, both among Northern liberals and Southern conservatives.\n\nNixon is still the captain and the ship still sails, but its rudder is broken, its crew is deserting, and it may begin to rapidly take on water. He may guide it to port, but the odds of that are growing slimmer by the day."
 USA.118.a: "The coalition will endure. It must endure."

On announcement, a certain few of our troops took unauthorized absences, trying to flee from deployment. While this is unfortunate, it is quite small scale, and can be explained as cowards in the military looking for a free lunch.

Whatever his failings, Haldemann ran a tight ship, tossing the Eisenhower types who couldn't keep up, replaced with Nixon loyalists and Kennedy men who the President could stand. It was the team that secured Nixon's nomination, ensured Kennedy's support, and helped deliver a landslide victory against the turncoat Jackson and the NPP. Now it was tasked with ensuring that the RDC supermajority achieved in 1960 would not fall in 1962.\n\n"Well, can't be that hard, can it?"

Four seats in the South, New Hampshire, and a couple out west?"\n\nOne of the staffers nodded, "At least that's what we think. We should have Bush's seat sewn up, but Pennsylvania is looking dicey, and Yates is giving Dirksen a run for his money in Illinois."\n\nHaldemann nodded, "The President's approvals aren't looking great. The media doesn't like him, the liberals are wary, and conservatives think he's too moderate after his deals with Rockefeller and Kennedy."\n\n"Well, Harry," Morton said, exasperated. "What's our plan this mid-term."\n\nHaldeman leaned in, "Our party got its ass handed to us in '46 due to the post-war recession as much as signing away Hawaii.

Every pulse it carried from Canberra caused a scowl to etch itself deeper onto the face of Richard Milhous Nixon, 36th President of the United States of America.\n\nThis bastard, López Mateos, was reading straight from Tokyo's playbook, starting some goddamn investigation into treaty violations around the Aleutian Islands. Nixon had called the Mexican president to mediate this pilot business and get the Navy and IJN out of the North Pacific, not to start a parade of headlines and color photos of star-spangled ships supposedly entering the DMZ. Jack and his friends at the Times would love that, wouldn't they?\n\nHe—. He needed to turn up the heat and end this nonsense. "Adolfo, that's, uh, not gonna work.

Thousands of miles, five days, and multiple volleys of warning shots separated it from Ordaz's proposal. But these were terms the Japanese could accept, had accepted: the freeing of their pilot without an apology from Tokyo, the staged withdrawal of both fleets from around the Aleutians, and no investigation into either side's claims of treaty violations. And... the secret clause written underneath in his own pen, the names of the agents the Japanese demanded. Twelve of theirs released for four of ours.\n\nThe lopsided arrangement had been the best the ambassador could wrangle, so committed had been the Japanese to their investigation.

I welcome a fight between our philosophy and the corruption and heavy handedness of Washington, telling us what to do, what to think, which now threatens to engulf every man, woman, and child in the United States.

Perhaps it was the sidelining of his brother as scandal engulfed the White House, or perhaps to simply make a clean break from the corruption of the current Administration and of his own past to serve his nation. The true answer may be that Robert was infuriated with the President's vetoing of the Civil Rights Act, stalling, if not ending the dream of equality for all races. This issue, which RFK has championed since he first got into politics, managed to obliterate his closest competitor, the segregationist Governor Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, Robert Kennedy made his support for Civil Rights adamant. "We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government.

 USA.136.desc: ""Our great country stands today as a union that is not truly united. This great discord from within serves as the greatest threat to the spirit of America, not any army or statesman or ideology from without. If we are to stand as the greatest country this world has ever seen, we must come together as one people, for as President Lincoln once said: A house divided against itself cannot stand."\n\nThe inauguration of Wallace F. Bennett marks the return of a Republican in the White House, after Richard Nixon's tenure as President was cut short by his resignation. He has expressed his intent to be a force of moderation and compromise and wishes to pursue the implementation of a Civil Rights Act, albeit with input from segregationists. He also plans to increase America's global reach through a slew of new diplomatic programs as opposed to the subterfuge employed by his predecessors.\n\nHis policy of compromise has raised eyebrows; segregationists decry his policies as going too far while civil rights activists argue they do not go far enough. His softer foreign policy has also been denounced by the NPP as a sign of weakness. Nonetheless, while some dislike his policies, few can honestly say they hate the man himself, and it is this quality that the Republican-Democrats hope will make Bennett into the great compromiser America truly needs."

 USA.137.desc: "Lyndon Johnson, the trustworthy new face of the Democratic Party, took the oath this morning at the Capitol and was formally inaugurated as President of the United States to thunderous applause from the thousands gathered on the Mall. Stepping to the podium, President Johnson faced the television cameras and spoke to the nation.\n\n"My fellow countrymen, the oath I have taken before God is not mine alone but ours together. We are one nation and one people. Our future as a people rests not on individuals, but on all citizens working together to a greater cause. Our nation's journey towards the Great Society shall continue on, always trying and always gaining in the cause to build a greater America for those who will come after us, so they will not have to suffer the same injustices that plague so many Americans today. In a land of bountiful wealth, people go hungry. In a land of peerless scholars, children are unable to read and write. In a land of healing miracles, our neighbours suffer and die. This should not be so. Before this generation of Americans is finished, our enemies of poverty, of injustice, of inequality will not just retreat, but be conquered. When any citizen denies his fellow, saying "His colour is not mine", in that moment he betrays America. The Great Society insists upon the liberty of all Americans to pursue happiness, no matter their colour. Each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the Great Society, and it is in this that our course is abundantly clear."\n\nThe President stepped down from the podium, smiling and waving to the cheering masses as he made his way to the Statuary Hall to enjoy the traditional Congressional luncheon. There would be time enough for widespread national change after he'd eaten."

The states will be free to make their own decisions, free from Federal tyranny, just as our founding fathers intended. I promise you safety and freedom. America, I promise you segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!"\n\nStrong words today in D.C, as President Wallace was inaugurated on this cold winter day. President Wallace's supporters claim him to be a champion of states' rights, while his detractors compare him to a modern Jefferson Davis. The new President is characterised by a strong, populist rhetoric, emphasizing the struggle of the American people against the political elite.\n\nThis is a major shakeup for US politics, and shows that the American people are ready for change that the current Republican-Democrat platform simply cannot provide.\n\nAnd now, a special report on the Russian anarchy, presented by a man who spent years traveling the wastelands-"

 USA.142.t: "The Hope Massacre"
 USA.142.desc: "On August 31st, 1946, John Hersey published the article O'ahu in The New Yorker. In 160 pages of detailed, emotionally-charged narrative, he accounts the lives and aftermath of six Hawaiian-American civilians who survived the atomic blast. The Japanese cruisers landed on their shores scarcely a week later, and forced them to stay on the islands, calmly telling them that if they want the charred corpses of their families to rest in peace, they will have to bury them themselves. "The six of them all share one pain: they envy the dead," Hersey wrote.\n\nOver one million Americans, still reeling after the horror of the atom was revealed to them only two years prior, opened up their Saturday morning magazines, expecting comforting satire and laughter. But as they read its prose, all they felt was their hearts suffocating with sorrow and dread towards the nuclear holocaust Germany and Japan now ceaselessly march towards.\n\nIt is twenty years later, and America opens up another special edition of The New Yorker to find the same horror once again, now directed towards the crimes of our own nation. Sprawled across the first page is an aerial photograph of hundreds of mutilated corpses strewn out across a river flowing with blood, all positioned in the shape of a massive swastika. The perpetrators have been confirmed to be a U.S. Army company, who, deployed to search a village in the deep rainforest, were allegedly ambushed by a group of unidentified combatants while crossing the Orange River. Fueled by rage, the officers ordered for the bodies of the fallen to be rearranged into the symbol of hate.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland's own attaché conservatively estimates that the composition was made out of 347 stormtroopers that attempted to capture and torture the infantry division. Rejecting this, anti-war activist Tom Hayden's private correspondents assert that the photo was composed of 504 unarmed Boer settlers who happened to walk in the direction of the death squad's nightly patrol. We have yet to receive an official statement from any German authorities that isn't composed entirely of vague, slur-riddled insults.\n\nThe article begins with the suicide letter of Private First Class Varnado Simpson, who hanged himself from guilt on March 16th, hours after the massacre. The investigation eventually lead to the discovery of the war crime. "We formed the swastika's center with dead infants and exhumed animals," he wrote. "Lord, have mercy on their souls, not mine.""
 USA.142.a: "Pardon all the perpetrators, and release an official statement denying all responsibility, supporting Westmoreland's statement."
 USA.142.b: "Make sure that a select few officials are tried for publicity, but let go with the rest."

After the dust had settled, over a hundred people lay dead in what we now know is the most powerful earthquake in North American history. In addition to the tremors themselves, the state has been wracked by landslides, fissures and tsunamis, as well as the widespread destruction of roads and railways.\n\nThe rescue effort is ongoing, with survivors and bodies being pulled from collapsed buildings in Anchorage, but emergency services were woefully unprepared for a disaster of this magnitude and do not have the resources to adequately deal with it. If we send disaster relief immediately we'll boost our political capital not only in Alaska but across the nation as we prove that we are capable of protecting our citizens."

 USA.144.t: "Alabama's Champion"
 USA.144.desc: "A smouldering cigar lay on the edge of a littered desk. Behind it, Alabama's Governor George Corley Wallace, 43, seemed charged with electric intensity. His eyes, burning like coals, were dark, deep, and eyebrowed with black bands. His voice grace-noted with a Southern drawl.\n\n"I deplore violence," said Wallace. "But who started all this violence? There's a lot of agitators and communists mixed up with those who want good. A bunch of sissy britches pooh-poohing from their ivory towers." He reached for the cigar. "I don't believe just because somebody somewhere has a grievance that you should ignore the fabric of the Constitution." Wallace stood up. "If they do," he said, "they will risk a lot more than they realize."\n\nWallace is no ordinary Alabama redneck. A smart, capable lawyer who has in many ways been a first-rate Governor. Since he took office four years ago, he has raised teachers' salaries, overseen a swathe of school construction, and lobbied for a massive infusion of federal funds to finish the spur of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Once pathetically barren, the northern tier of Alabama now flourishes with cheap public power and the mushrooming of federally financed space-age industries.\n\nBut on the question of civil rights, Wallace is a different man. When running for Governor on the Progressive Pact's ballot-line, Wallace was no diehard defender of segregation. His near defeat at the hands of Democrat John Patterson taught him the risk of being "out-segged." Walking a fine line, Wallace has marched separately from the law of the land. He is at once a staunch defender of the South, a new Southern moderate, and even a nominal ally of organized labor.\n\nAs rumours swirl around possible candidates in 1964, Wallace is a name no one is discounting. Term-limited, the Governor has already announced his intention for his wife to succeed him, a race with a forgone conclusion, and has waived off a Senate draft. When asked about future ambitions, the Governor smiled. "We'll see where I'll be.""

His people are gathered below the stage.\n\nThere are students, from the august heights of Columbia to America's vast networks of community colleges and state schools. There are activists and organizers, fighting for dignity, for justice, for a fair shake, in the fields of the Central Valley and the streets of Harlem. There are union men and women, proudly paying their dues and giving management the middle finger. They are gathered in front of the Capitol, stretching past the Supreme Court, past the Folger Library, sprawling across the city laid out for democracy.\n\nAround the world, people watch with hesitancy. In Germania and Tokyo, tyrants whisper about the best ways to subvert him. In capitals across South America, people wonder if the stick-waving Yankees really are finding a new way. Across America, millions watch the spectacle. Some love him. Some hate him. Some aren't quite sure yet. But all are waiting to see what he does.

Johnson on the other hand dug into the NPP's platform, decrying the "empty words and bland platitudes" that his opponents talked about. "So focused on keeping your pact happy and together that you can't agree on anything about how to run a country!" Johnson thundered toward the end. "How can you campaign with such empty promises?"\n\nThe partisans of either coalition were quick to claim their candidate won the debate, but it's really up to the independents, the swing voters to decide who actually emerged victorious in the polls to come, and eventually the election itself."

 USA.174.t: "Escape from Alcatraz"
 USA.174.desc: "News arrived from Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary today that three prisoners have escaped! They appear to have escaped during the night, as the three prisoners went into their cells the night before, and were absent from roll call the next morning. A brief survey of their cells found tunnels dug through the walls, and paper-mâché dolls in the prisoner's beds. A frantic search found no trace of the three prisoners on the island, and it was only when mainland police found a shoddy raft along with prison clothes that the it was realized that Alcatraz had been successfully escaped from. More worrying than the fact that multiple people escaped from an 'impenetrable' facility however, is the fact that two of the escapees are members of the German-American Bund, including Vice President and KKK member: Arthur Hornbui Bell.\n\nThis has, predictably, caused an incredible amount of outrage amongst the populace. Not only did a prison that was 'inescapable' broken out of, but a major member of the German-American Bund is now at large in the USA. All across the country, as bizarre and stupid as it may seem, people lock their doors at night and peek out their windows to see if Bell himself will come to their doors.\n\nThe Republicans have demanded that the police make the hunt for the fugitives the top priority, while Democrats say that such a move would only make the escaped rats hide even deeper, and that the police should not give this case any more priority than an average case. What should the course of action be?"
 USA.174.a: "This is a first priority case!" #Republican
 USA.174.b: "Treat it as a normal case" #Democrat


 USA.175.t: "Fugitives are Captured"
 USA.175.desc: "After a few days of searching, it appears that the 'Alcatraz Three', as the media has taken to calling them, have finally been caught. A helicopter flying overhead spotted a group of three men rushing to hide from its spotlight, and after the group was cornered aerially, a ground squad was able to arrest the three men and positively identify them as the escapees from Alcatraz.\n\nThe worried populace of California and the US as a whole are very relieved, as wild tales of the Alcatraz Three breaking into houses swept the nation, despite the fact that this. The President himself reportedly expressed joy upon the capture of the Three, and is expected to award those who devoted themselves to the search.\n\nAfter they were captured, the Alcatraz Three were interrogated on a variety of matters, including details of their escape, and in the case of Arthur Hornbui Bell, more questions about his membership in the German-American Bund. Bell has predictably remained quiet on those issues, but surprisingly ranted at length about the 'inhumane' conditions he was kept in at Alcatraz. The interrogators, who were FBI agents, were shocked to say the least at how bad the conditions were, at least according to Bell. Also mentioned deep into his rants about his conditions, were Bell's KKK ties and his plans to use them to help stay underground. Whether the KKK would've actually risked helping Bell and his comrades, some of the country's most wanted fugitives, is doubtful, but the fact remains that he thought that they would, which has caused renewed suspicion on the KKK.\n\nIn any case, at least for today, the American people can rest easy, for major fugitives have been caught, and the streets of the country, from sea to shining sea, are that much more safer."
 USA.175.a: "Thank God they were caught!"

 USA.176.t: "The Alcatraz Prisoners are still out there"
 USA.176.desc: "Despite the searches and the manhunts, the 'Alcatraz Three', as the media call them, have not yet been found. In fact, the three have basically vanished off of the face of the earth, and the police can barely trace where they went before the three vanished completely.\n\nThe populace is, to say the least, not very happy with our total lack of progress in finding the Alcatraz Three. Furthermore, after Alcatraz was successfully broken out of, an investigation ensued to see how the 'impenetrable' prison was penetrated from the inside. The report has revealed shockingly bad conditions, especially for people in the Bund such as Bell. Many across the country have called the prison 'inhumane' and 'almost Nazi-like in nature.' If the Alcatraz Three were recaptured, the report could've been stealthily released during the celebrations, which would've allowed us to avoid the large amount of outrage we currently face.\n\nPoliticians through accusations left and right about who is to blame for this, and it is clear that this escape will have political ramifications, especially in California where Alcatraz is located."
 USA.176.a: "We must keep on looking!"

 USA.177.t: "Investing in the Police"
 USA.177.desc: "Despite some opposition from Democrats, the Republican plan to invest more time and effort into the hunt for the Alcatraz Three seem to have paid off, as they are now back behind bars where they belong. This Republican plan has earned them support from the Californian populace, as they have seen the fruits of their tax dollars. This has also sparked interest in more funding for the police, as more money during crises could help them solve more cases and function better, which has earned the Republicans support from the police departments. While a prison escape may be bad for many reasons, it has certainly been beneficial to the Republicans."
 USA.177.a: "The right move."

 USA.178.t: "The Democrats Spike in the Polls"
 USA.178.desc: "When the Alcatraz Three were loose, Democratic Governor of California Pat Brown said that the police would treat the case as any other escape, and that "people should not worry about the fugitives." People were, understandably, shocked. These three fugitives broke out of one of the most legendary prisons in the United States! How could people not worry?\n\nNow that the Alcatraz Three have been caught however, the populace of California see that Pat Brown was correct, and that the strategy of not worrying about the fugitives paid off. Due to this, people have gained more confidence in Pat Brown, and Democratic popularity in California has gone up greatly."
 USA.178.a: "A Blue Tide!"

 USA.179.t: "NPP Explosion in California Polls"
 USA.179.desc: "The large scale investments into finding the Alcatraz Three have proven to be an utter failure, as the fugitives seem to have vanished into thin air. This failure of the Republicans to deliver results have let to many criticizing them as money wasters. Furthermore, this has led to the NPP gaining a frankly incredible amount of popularity in California, and it seems that the state may finally flip into becoming an NPP state. Such an event would be shocking, and some might call it the prelude to an NPP politician entering the White House..."
 USA.179.a: "An Orange California?"

 USA.180.t: "Still Not Found"
 USA.180.desc: "The day after the Alcatraz Three escaped, Governor Pat Brown said in a speech that "people should not worry about the fugitives, for they'll be caught soon." Pat Brown's predictions have been proven to be very, very wrong. The laissez-faire approach of the Democrats has failed utterly, and many believe that if only more manpower and money was placed into the manhunt, then the Alcatraz Three would have been found and not have vanished totally. This massive blunder has caused many to grow disillusioned with Pat Brown and the Democrats, and it seems that the RDC name is becoming more and more connected with short sightedness in the state of California."
 USA.180.a: "Could This have been ANY Worse??"

 USA.181.t: "A Harsher Line Against the Klan"
 USA.181.desc: "Arthur Hornbui Bull's connections to the KKK have been revealed to the people of Congress after he escaped from Alcatraz. This connection between the two have caused a great flurry of activity, as the Progressive Caucus's James D. Martin has proposed a plan to launch a large scale investigation against the Klan, and possibly eventually arrest major leaders. This is a controversial move, as while the Klan is not what one would call a model organization, it is still legally allowed to operate. After inconclusive debating, the President's opinion on the matter was eventually asked. What should be done about the KKK?"
 USA.181.a: "The KKK will stay!"
 USA.181.b: "Investigate them!"

 USA.182.t: "A Theory of Justice"
 USA.182.desc: "From Harvard Univeristy, philosophy Professor John Rawls, released his latest book last week. A massive tome, called 'A Theory of Justice', drawing both on Kantian and Humean traditions, describes Rawls' theory of how the social contract makes political life possible. He asks us to imagine an 'original position' from where we should design how we want society to be, without knowing where in society we would be placed. From this he believes there are two principles of justice that could be formulated:\n\n1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.\n\n2. Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\n\nRawls is happy to finally have it published so he can go campaign for the upcoming senate election, where he hopes to gain the seat for the Progressive faction of NPP.\n\nSome pact leaders have already praised it for its commitment to social justice, especially its insistence on a global perspective, and some members have been bold and predicted the book to become a leading piece of theory for the growing pact, as social justice is connected with systems of justice and injustice across the globe. People in Colorado are in a sense not free until people in Tokyo or Germania are free, free from systematic injustice. It is thus each state's duty to fight for the freedom of justice of all people wherever they are!"

"Imagine the irony of it: silver's so valuable an industrial metal, and the silver dollar is so popular in the Free World, that America has nothing left over for itself."\n\n"It's a terrible case of silver anemia." the Treasury Secretary agreed resignedly. "Every turn of the fiscal taps saps confidence in the dollar because we don't have enough silver -"\n\n"And if we lean on the Fed to raise interest rates to bring silver home, we're going to cause an OFN-wide depression so severe Hoover would think he had it easy." [Root.GetLeader] finished, leading the room to fall silent. The solution, they both knew, was simple - if America wasn't going to bring silver home and if it couldn't build its stocks naturally, then the dollar's value in silver would have to devalued, until a more abundant source of monetary backing could be introduced.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] exhaled exasperatedly.

 USA.162.t: "Godspeed, John Glenn"
 USA.162.d: "John Glenn figured his heart had never beaten so fast or so hard in his life, as the heavy staccato rhythm threatened to pop out of his chest. In 46 years of life, he had been blessed with many momentous occasions: flying his first combat mission over the Marshall Islands, careening towards the stars on Friendship 7, even quitting NASA after Nixon cut its funding. However, all of those life-changing events seemed trivial as a host of his countrymen stared in admiration as he slipped his hands off of that pristine little bible upon which he swore the oath of office. Now, millions keenly watched him standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial to hear his first words as President; words that would define the fate of his country and possibly all of mankind.\n\n"Today, we as a nation are brought together not to celebrate the victory of a man, but of a movement and an idea. We celebrate the idea that our homeland is indeed a great society; one unsullied by war, or autocracy, or depression. We celebrate and reaffirm our dedication to freedom, democracy, and the self-determination of all peoples. To make our celebrated ideals into appreciable ones, we must begin anew as a people, just as the world begins anew with the changing of the age and the passing of the generational torch..."\n"...This new page of human history has brought with it many innovations and yet more uncertainties. From these innovations have spawned both terrors and wonders, some of which with the potential to save mankind, and yet others with the capability to destroy it. To truly be a great and freedom-loving society, we must not appreciate those creations of man that implants a balance of terror upon the whole of the species; rather, we should celebrate and develop those creations which may yet bring us to the depths of the oceans, or the distant light of the stars."\n\nPresident Glenn stood slightly taller as tens of thousands of once-dreary, blank faces erupted into smiles and cheers and applause. Through one-hundred-and-forty-nine combat missions, three trips to space, two governorships of Ohio, and a presidential election, he had followed the tides and turns of his life and his country. Now, it seemed his solemn, God-given duty to let his country follow him. Ex nihilo..."

President Richard Nixon sits at his desk, anxiously signing a few inconsequential documents. Shooting a few expectant glances at the telephone to his right, he realizes his pile of unsigned papers has been exhausted. Just as he kicks back in his chair to relax after a long day, the phone rings.\n\nHe already knows the caller, and for what reason he calls. The National Assembly of Guyana would soon finish voting on their National Security Act, and William Rogers would be the first to know the results.\n\n"Give it to me straight, Rogers."\n\n"It was a landslide, Dick. Barely more than a quarter voted down."\n\n"They're afraid of Burnham." Nixon muses.\n\n"They should be, now more than ever. He'll crack down on anyone who threatens the peace. Political rivals, anti-segregationists; anybody and everybody." Rogers declares.\n\n"Why'd we put that bastard in power, anyways?

The Guyanese President, Forbes Burnham, has stated that the raids 'strengthened the Guyanan Republic, and its democratic system'. Exiled former President Cheddi Jagan issued a statement..."\n\nA couple dozen people crowd the room. Aides, secretaries, and even a few senators, all sitting in pure silence as the low hum of the television and its tinny speakers recite the unfortunate news. Rogers sighs, deciding he has heard enough. Standing up, he shuffles over to the TV and turns it off. He turns around and looks at the two dozen-or-so people crowded into the sitting room, their expectant eyes locked upon him, their ears awaiting his word. He pauses for a moment, "No one speaks to the press, not yet. Not the Press Secretary, not me, not any of you. Not a word until we figure out our next step, understand?"\n\nA series of nods acknowledge his message. "Now, somebody get me a phone line to the President. We need to arrange a cabinet meeting.

All along the magnificent mahogany table, the presidential cabinet is seated, from the Secretery of Veterans Affairs, far at the end, to Jack Kennedy and H.R. Haldeman, settled next to the President. So far, no one has said a word, aside from a few curt greetings. H.R. Haldeman breaks the palpable silence, "I think we all know why we're here. Our friend in Guyana has gone too far, we need to do something about it."\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, follows Haldeman's lead and speaks next, Nixon still bearing an angry yet contemplative look. "The press doesn't know our involvement in his election. We need to threaten constricting economic ties. Sanctions, condemnations, and diplomatic isola-"\n\n"-frankly, Bob, he'll get trade from somewhere else. Hell, when Germany gets back on its feet we'll all be in trouble because that's where he'll get it from. The Krauts would jump at the chance for an ally right on our doorstep," Kennedy cuts in, his sharp Massachusetts accent grabbing the attention of the room.\n\n"What do you suggest?" McNamara asks.\n\n"Use our clout in the country. Threats, bribes, and blackmail."\n\nMcNamara shakes his head, "No, just apply pressure for him to repeal the act! If we threaten him, he'll double down on his opposition. Any MP of theirs he suspects might turn against him will face retribution. We can't top that, if only for moral reasons."\n\nSlowly the room evolves into conflicting arguments, various cabinet members arguing for an exile army, others for isolation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the clamor. "That's enough!"\n\nThe head of the table has spoken. Richard Nixon stands, and then speaks, "I don't care about it either way, I just want the press and Burnham, both, to calm the hell down! Force him, pressure him, it doesn't matter. Get the act repealed."\n\nHe turns to Haldeman, nodding, "I'll do it either way, but I want your word, Haldeman.""

Burnham's a loose cannon."\n\nNixon is looking thoughtfully through one of the windows of the White House meeting room, ignoring the exchange behind him. Unlike yesterday, the Presidential Cabinet is not assembled in its near-entirety. Only McNamara, Haldeman, Nixon, and Kennedy are in the boardroom.\n\n"Well," McNamara says, "I guess we've got to do it the hard way. Ball's in your court, Jack."\n\n"I'll make the call."\n\nKennedy makes the move to get up, but Nixon raises a hand. Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the President.""

A street adorned with flags from around the world and buildings to match, Embassy Row was the beating heart of America's chancery and diplomatic body. The buildings were always pretty (or at least interesting), and it was right next to a fantastic burger joint.\n\nThe first thing he always noticed was the noise. It was hard not to- it was deafening. On a quiet day, it would be more of a dull roar, but still ever present. Countless protestors standing outside the Reich and Japan's embassy- chanting their sayings and waving their signs. The signs could have anything on them- pro-OFN or "Boycott the Reich" were the most common, of course, but sometimes you'd see an "LBJ All the Way", "States Rights- Vote Wallace" or even a "Nixon Now!" poster or sign.\n\nHere was a place where a Wallace supporter could stand next to a supporter of 'Scoop' Jackson and agree with everything- united against the tyranny of the Rising Sun and the soaring eagle- at least in theory.\n\nJackson had spent a lot of time in front of the Reich's embassy. He had protested there, a lot; he was doing what he thought was best for his country as he stared down the Sovereigntist counter-protestor bastards- and he hadn't blinked, he hadn't backed down.\n\nThat wasn't why he was here today, however. He had seen the Reich's embassy. He had seen Japan's. He had seen the old (but recently refurbished) [ENG.GetAdjective] embassy, and he had even gone inside the small Vichy French embassy. There was one embassy that he constantly looked for; one that constantly evaded him."
 USA.1760.a: "Where's the Russian Embassy?"


 USA.1109.t: "The United States Intervenes in Guyana"
 USA.1109.desc: "(AP) After several days of sporadic fighting between Guyanese militia forces and the forces of the American expeditionary forces landing on the coast, the Pentagon announced that Guyanese President Forbes Burnham was taken into custody this evening. American troops now patrol the streets of Paramaribo and Georgetown in an interim capacity until the legitimate government of the Guyanese people assumes control of the nation.\n\nWith widespread disorganization reported within the Guyanese military following former President Burnham's coup, defense analysts had expected that the American policing action would face little opposition. The State Department issued a press release welcoming intervention's success and the 'return of genuine democracy' in Guyana, while expressing high hopes for future cooperation with the government-in-waiting on 'matters of mutual agreement.'"
 USA.1109.a: "Be our friend or else!"

 USA.1731.t: "The Second Inauguration of Wallace F. Bennett"
 USA.1731.d: "After a hard-fought election campaign against the NPP, President Wallace F. Bennett was sworn in for his second term as President of the United States today, before cheering crowds on the National Mall. President Bennett noted in his address to the nation that "I see no distinction between party or politics before me; I see only Americans, and a solemn vow to leave the republic stronger tomorrow than it is today."\n\nDespite a heavy emphasis on American tradition and patriotic republicanism, Washington insiders have noted that Bennett has promised nothing radically different from his 1964 campaign: a promise of stability and continuity, the amiable patriarch shepherding America through the social convulsions of the early 1960's and to serve as the linchpin of the Free World through the OFN. And this, it seems, is exactly what American voters wanted: a steady pair of hands steering the ship of state into the next decade, tending the hearth of freedom against foreign enemies and domestic radicals."
 USA.1731.a: "Four more years!"

 USA.1744.t: "We Want Maggie Smith"
 USA.1744.d: ""Doesn't matter who she's with, we want Maggie Smith", read a sign somewhere far back amongst the mass of humanity standing along the National Mall. They were silent, awaiting the words of their President, just sworn in for the second time. Maggie herself darted her eyes between all the faces staring back at her, in their tens and thousands. She shuffled her speech papers.\n\n"To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and awesome moment; and yet, in the tides of American history, it is a regular occurrence. The places in which I stand and in which the nation stands are in many ways the same as they were four years ago, and in many ways they are different. Four years ago I spoke to you, furiously admonishing the injustice done to the United States, and how we might recover from her weakened state. Today, I must give more sobering words, for the revival of a nation is a task not easily undertaken..."\n\n"...Let us resolve that we may build a society in which white and black, rich and poor, young and old, may walk together hand-in-hand for a better future. Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. However, history has shown that peace does not come simply because we wish it to. The United States of America must be ever-vigilant in the face of tyranny. We shall embrace Lady Liberty and defend her, so that she too might defend us. She is our strength in our darkest hour, and with classic American optimism, hope, and strength, we shall prevail through the turbulent storms of change our world is currently experiencing. God bless us all, and may God bless America.""
 USA.1744.a: "Hail to the Chief!"

 USA.1732.t: "A Job Half Done"
 USA.1732.d: "As Lyndon B. Johnson recited the same oath of office he had taken four years prior, the feeling going through his mind could only be described as satisfaction. He had done a damn fine job, all things considered. His Great Society had proven a hit, the Republican-Democrats were back in top form, and the NPP was still as irrelevant as ever. It had not been an easy task to recover from the colossal screw ups of the last administrations, but he had come out swinging. As he stood before the crowd, however, he knew that now was the time for tact, not boorishness, and so he put aside his usual bravado for the time being.\n\n"Unity is the first and foremost principle of our American union. For we who are small and few against the forces of tyranny, our continued liberty must derive from commonality and the strength of our collective will to endure. Yet true unity cannot be derived from a nation at odds with itself. It is this that I believe is what a Great Society must truly strive for, and what we have endeavored to strive for these past few years. No longer need capitalist and worker nor farmer and clerk struggle against one another, for we may now stand shoulder to shoulder in the interests of increasing the bounty of all...\n\n...from the many great tragedies of the last few decades, the spirit of one great indivisible nation stands unblemished. It is my hope that this spirit may never be extinguished, and it is my earnest wish to continue to protect and nurture this spirit. We are a nation of liberty and justice, blessed by God, and it is our duty to struggle with toil and tears to ensure that the light of our nation shines on. On my part, I promise to you now what I promised the men of my coalition on that sorrowful day in 1963 - 'I will lead and I will do the best I can'."\n\nOnce more, the crowd roared with appreciation. President Johnson was not a sentimental man, but even he felt the stirrings of pride in his heart. Once more, he had a duty to these people, and it was his solemn oath to fulfil that duty. Four more years lay in front of him, and there was still a lot of work to do. Through the efforts of the Great Society and the efforts of the American people, America was sure to emerge ever greater, and ever more united against all that would seek to tear it down both from within, and without."
 USA.1732.a: "For an ever more perfect union."

 USA.1733.t: "To the End of a Dream"
 USA.1733.d: "When he had last stood to take the oath of office, Robert F. Kennedy had stood before a nation that dared to hope that things could be better. Now, as he gazed out into the assembled thousands who had come to see him, he knew that hope was no longer daring. It was natural, open, loud and proud. In their faces - the men and women, the white man and the black, the Jew and the gentile - he could see for the first time an America that wanted the future to arrive. He beamed as he stepped up to the podium, letting the roaring cheers wash over him. Deep down, he dearly hoped that John was watching, wherever he was.\n\n"We stand here today in the name of liberty and justice. At the heart of western democracy is the belief that all men are created equal, and so the extension of this belief and the enlargement of liberty for all must be the supreme goal of a western society. Others have turned from this goal, and marched on into darkness and decay. Yet where they have faltered, we have pressed forwards, and in four short years we have extended the branch of freedom and human rights to all, no matter their race, their color or their stature in life...\n\n...but as in all things, justice is never final. To walk the path to a better future is to walk a path without end. There will be those who will try to steer us from the path, and those who insist that we have walked far enough. We must always recognize the fact that the work to better fulfil the promise that our God-given country was founded upon shall never be finished. We must keep walking, keep improving, and keep striving to create a true land of liberty that will shine bright in a world of darkness."\n\nPresident Kennedy smiled even brighter as the crowd applauded. He knew that he could not grow complacent. There were still those who would try to stop him from doing what truly needed to be done. Yet knowing that the majority of America was with him made him all the more resolute in his ambitions. His dream, John's dream, the American Dream would be realized for the sake of those smiling faces before him. He would fight for all of them and fight against any who would stand in his way, and he would do it all gladly, not because it was easy..."
 USA.1733.a: "...but because it is hard."

 USA.1734.t: "Dixie's Stand"
 USA.1734.d: "The crowd was decidedly larger than at his last inauguration. A lot more supporters cheering from the front, and a lot more detractors protesting at the back. This pleased George Wallace as he swore his oath upon the Holy Bible. He had been worried that he wouldn't get this far, yet America had clearly placed its trust and support in him and his determination to do what needed to be done. That was all the motivation he needed to steel himself for the coming term.\n\n"Four years ago, I came to you as an insurgent. I stood as a lone voice in resistance against those who would seek to erode our great Anglo-Saxon identity. You, the people of our God-blessed United States, stood up and joined me, and together we secured the future of our culture and our liberty against those who would risk it all in the name of 'progress.' Now, once again you have placed your faith in me, and I vow in the name of God the Almighty that I shall execute your will...\n\n...there are still those among us who would choose to squander the many boons they have been given in the name of naive idealism. I hope that after today they will re-evaluate their position. You and I together have shown them the true will of the people, and our will will not be silenced. In the name of freedom, and in the name of the true American way, we will stand firm against that which would seek to divide us!"\n\nThe crowd roared, equal parts cheers from the front and boos from the back. Countless banners waved furiously in the wind, be they the Stars and Stripes, state flags or the Confederate battle flag. Wallace grinned with pride as he gazed upon the myriad masses who had come from all over to see him. These were the men who had built America with their own hands, the women who had birthed and raised those men, and the children who would one day inherit the American legacy. With them on his side, the path ahead was clear.\n\nIt was time to finish the work."
 USA.1734.a: "Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow,\nSegregation Forever!"

 USA.1741.t: "The Conscience of a Conservative"
 USA.1741.d: "Barry Goldwater presented a stern but appreciative face as he spoke the final lines of his oath of office and took to the stand once more. The crowd before him applauded enthusiastically - many of them lifelong Republicans, some who had been briefly tempted away by the Nationalists, and some who were new faces. All of them had come to him to lead them for four more years, and it was his good and honorable duty to give them what they wished for. There were some of his actions which many may call callous, but he did it all in the name of making America as strong and self-reliant as it needed to be to stare down the forces of evil lurking overseas.\n\n"The first and only duties of a nation's government must be to oversee the security of its people and to provide a hall in which the voice of the nation can be heard and debated. These past four years, we have worked to return our government to this core directive, shedding away the naivety of well-meaning men who bloated and extended the federal reach with their grandiose designs and passion projects. The true glory of this land lies not in what the government can do, but instead in what its people can do...\n\n...I promise to you, America, that we will continue to stand tall against a world of hatred. Our hearts and minds are stronger than the forces of fascism can ever comprehend. Through rugged determination, ingenuity, wit and cunning, we can continue to be a beacon of light upon this Earth. America is strong, and its people are stronger still, and we must never let our determination to better ourselves ever waver."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a small smile as the cheers washed over him. He had much to be proud of after all. With a strong military that the fascists would never dare challenge, a responsible people who would look to their own betterment, and a government that would not have the power to take from the people as much as they gave away, he was securing the future of the American nation. It was a future that, if his victory was anything to go by, was one that the people were quite looking forward to."
 USA.1741.a: "Let us extend freedom to all."

 USA.1742.t: "Ever Onwards"
 USA.1742.desc: "Long ago, John Glenn entered the world of politics on a whim, in a wild hope of standing up for the interests of American space travel in an age where it seemed people had given up on it. Now, he stood giving the oath of office to ascend to the presidency for the second time. In four years, he had helped to create a new legacy of spaceflight that had inspired millions of Americans, all while bettering the lot of the people back down on Earth. As he stood before the people once more, he prepared himself for the tasks ahead, in the hopes of taking America to even greater heights.\n\n"These turbulent decades have not been kind to the American nation, yet we have pressed ahead. We have emerged from a time of darkness and uncertainty into a new era of hope, progress and scientific understanding. Ever since the first pilgrims set foot upon these shores, America has been a land of explorers. It is in our blood to go forth into the unknown and find a place for ourselves there. Today, we once more celebrate the spirit of our nation, and affirm that true knowledge and understanding cannot belong to one man alone, but to all men united in the desire of a better world...\n\n...the work cannot stop here. When man first created fire, he endeavored to improve further. He heated his forge and made steel. He boiled steam to drive his engines. He lit a pillar of light under himself and soared into the heavens. Each new discovery brought not only greater opportunities, but also a more bountiful quality of life for all. We too must embody this proud tradition. Our nation will continue to innovate, continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, and all will be made more prosperous for it."\n\nPresident Glenn gazed upwards as the crowd applauded. Even now, there were Americans up there, and his words would be heard even in their capsules floating above the Earth. He hoped that he could take them further and broaden their understanding ever more. Higher into orbit, to the moon and back again... perhaps even beyond."
 USA.1742.a: "Semper Prorsum"

 USA.1743.t: "Visible and Indivisible"
 USA.1743.desc: "Many of the folks who had come out to witness Harrington's second inauguration hadn't been there to watch him four years ago. Perhaps they just hadn't been interested in politics. Perhaps they couldn't even afford the fare to come to Washington, or the depths of their poverty had made the prospect of working for the day far more important than coming out. Now, they were here. As he finished reciting the oath of office, he surveyed the assembled crowd and saw a people uplifted from their sorrows. The sight alone was more than enough a reward for his work, but he knew that he still had more to do.\n\n"It is often said that a chain is only so strong as its weakest link. So too is a nation only so great as its humblest man. When he and his kindred are stricken, and the nation does not rise to the task of uplifting him, it has effectively split itself in two. It is split between a loud nation of opulence and splendor, and a silent nation of want. For a nation to be great, it must not allow this fractured silence. Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty. America shall be truly one and indivisible, and never again shall we allow an invisible and impoverished world exist right beneath our noses!"\n\nWild applause greeted his closing remarks. President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count. Poverty's grip over the other America had been weakened - now was the time to cut it loose forever."

 USA.1801.desc: "After the recent discord that has plagued the region, tensions appear to be cooling in the increasingly fractious South. Over the recent weeks there have been significantly fewer instances of politically or racially motivated violence, and rallies in major Southern cities, both pro and anti-segregation, have markedly fewer marchers. Time will tell whether or not this recent calm will hold, or if racial tensions will soon be inflamed after yet another tragedy. At least for now we have some time to catch our breath."
 USA.1801.a: "It can't get any worse if we ignore it, right?"

 USA.1802.t: "Cooling Down"
 USA.1802.desc: "Embers have turned to ashes in the North's largest cities. In Chicago, firefighters ended the last of the blazes that had consumed the west side and the mayor suspended a curfew. In Washington D.C. over $15 million in property damage has been accounted for, but order has largely been restored. Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Democrats to the Marxists, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican Party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D. All signatories promised to leave the coalition and encourage others to do so as well. It's clear that the veto of the Civil Rights Act has hardened its proponents, and divided the country even further."
 USA.1802.a: "What is it America has failed to hear?"

 USA.1803.t: "Jim Crow Soars Towards the Sun"
 USA.1803.desc: "In 1877, US Congressmen reached a compromise that resolved the disputed Presidential election of 1876 by giving the Presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes in return for ending Reconstruction and permitting the establishment of Jim Crow laws. Almost a century later, these laws stand unchanged across much of the South. Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Marxists declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate. We may just be forced to choose between the survival of segregation, or of our nation."
 USA.1803.a: "If we don't end this injustice, then it will end us."

 USA.1901.t: "Mafia Money, Stonewall Gin"
 USA.1901.desc: "Like all organised crime establishments the anonymous room in Queens had the smell of cash, and cigarettes, and too many secrets whispered into waiting drywall. The men within paced about and spoke at length on the subjects one would expect; a laundering here, a fiefdom issue there, the latest quotas from the bosses. Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place. The pimps were losing control of the situation on home turf. Something had to be done.\n\nAntony, Joe and Mark (not their real names) fiddled with the map of South Avenue on the table. A new joint, free of the putrid smell of the Old Town, would jazz up the revenues and act as a movement point for money, guns, information. Old trades, new venue, easy money. But who would frequent it? It wasn't exactly Broadway.\n\nAntony smiled. His next words would change history, even if he didn't actually know it yet."
 USA.1901.a: ""We open up to the queers.""

 USA.1902.t: "The Dance Partner"
 USA.1902.desc: "Here in Stonewall Inn the dances are many - dances profane and holy, intimate and vast, moneyed and poor alike. For now it's all John Russo can do to keep up with one. Left and left and right and left again, a swirl of the body so sweeping it belongs on the parade square, not the rough tiles of the inn floor. Then the shoes opposite him trace the contours in lithe slips and end up in their original placing (by some arcane coincidence).\n\nMartin glares at him with visible annoyance. John looks down in sheepishness. The moment stretches taut, pulls apart and snaps. Martin bursts out laughing, tickled by something on John's face, and pulls him to himself. His face smells of smoke and aftershave.\n\nThe kiss is tart and startling in the dim neon. John pulls back with the old instincts of the Brooklyn boy who always knew how much of himself to show, and how much to hide. But today a part of him resists, and instead he stays. It's a raw comfort, and in the glittering sharpness of the moment it's all he has.\n\nMartin pulls away with some reluctance. The date has been brief, and even this hour has been snatched at great cost. They haven't much time. He takes John's arm and together they spin out of the little bar, their little dance studio. Their figures are quickly lost in the chaos and brilliance of the New York night, blending in neon-shaded phantoms before disappearing."
 USA.1902.a: "How romantic."

 USA.1903.t: "Snapshots from Stonewall"
 USA.1903.desc: "It's a quiet night in the Stonewall Inn. Barely anyone notices my scribbling notes in the corner; this corner of America is obscure, but it shares the tendency for aching introspection, abbreviated loneliness hammered out via cheap glass cups. Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."
 USA.1903.a: "Life thrives in the strangest of places."

 USA.1904.t: "The Warning"
 USA.1904.desc: "The Stonewall Inn is a spot of light and loud laughter in a world slipping into autumn. The sounds of occasional retching aside, the Inn is a good place, and the crowds know it to be far more than just a building. For many of its patrons it's the only place they can truly be themselves. But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly. Whatever happens next, he'll stay with the ship, even if the hull's leaking. His passengers deserve nothing less."

 USA.1905.t: "The Stonewall Bust!"
 USA.1905.desc: "It starts with a sudden blackout: 205 patrons of the Stonewall stop and stare in the sudden dark (it's 1:20 am outside), and bartenders reach for panic buttons as they try to calm their customers. The four undercover officers curse as they fiddle with the switches, and the lights flicker back to life. The few who realize what is about to happen begin pushing their way through the crowd, but the Morals Squad have already locked down the window exits and are marching through the doors, flashlights in hand, as they bust the biggest gay establishment in New York.\n\nThe raid doesn't meet with a receptive crowd, to say the least: as officers lead those in women's clothing to the toilets many resist. It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors. None of the bar's patrons have made it this far in a world which mostly despises them without getting a little rough around the edges, and when the Man pushes them around they push right back.\n\nBy the time the raid concludes about 150 people are under arrest. But more are gathering in the late-night darkness of the Big Apple, and a storm is brewing that cannot be contained."
 USA.1905.a: "Just a routine raid. Carry on."

 USA.1906.t: "We Shall Overcome"
 USA.1906.desc: "The greatest riot for sexual minority rights in the history of the United States begins with a logistics problem. The Morals Police have grabbed 28 cases of beer and 19 kegs of hard liquor, but with the patrol vans occupied elsewhere they have nowhere to put it. Instead they keep the patrons on lockdown as the wagons arrive, far too slowly for a police operation. The patrons, of course, are understandably upset, and those few not under arrest quickly join the growing crowds gathered outside the building. Many of them know that once the Inn dies, so too does the living, breathing heart of gay culture in the Greatest City in the World. They have everything to lose.\n\nAs Mafia members and patrons are loaded onto the wagons, many still struggling, a lone voice breaks out. 'We Shall Overcome', a protest song written for the South African War, finds receptive ears in another angry crowd facing another unwinnable fight. Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram. Officers inside prepare for a fiery last stand.\n\nAnd then the police trucks arrive."

Violence explodes on the streets as police officers take the law into their own hands, and hammer their rage onto the defenceless. The mob arrayed against them is far too far gone to care. They form the rough outline of a cabaret chorus line and begin to sing. Their voices are piercing in the late night, and the police have had enough of being needled - they rush the line.\n\nMen and women get hammered with nightsticks as bedlam spreads to the surrounding streets. Crowds run around police officers, laughing gaily like warriors in the light of burning cars. By the time the riots come to a halt, Christopher Street is blocked, half the cars on it are overturned and every garbage can for a mile around has been emptied into the street. Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy. Allen Ginsberg notes, on the way back, that "the guys there were so beautiful -they've lost that wounded look that homosexuals all had 10 years ago.""

 honolulu_accords.1980.desc: "Recently, our diplomats have been talking it over with Japanese diplomats regarding the treaty ports. Luckily, [JAP.GetLeader] is giving us the opportunity to choose where we would like to hold the discussions with the Empire of Japan. While it is a very generous move, we now have to decide where the discussions will take place.\n\nThe Prime Minister outlined three possible areas: Hawaii, one of our carriers, or Mexico. In his offer, the Prime Minister seemed to favor Hawaii, and while this could give the Japanese an advantage, it would be courteous of us to elect these islands to host the negotiations. Alternatively, we could choose one of our American carriers to host the talks, and it would give us the upper hand, but the Japanese may be reluctant about our decision. Finally, we could choose Mexico, a neutral party, to accommodate. That way, neither American nor Japanese will have any major influence on the talks. The weather is also quite nice in Mexico at this time of year.\n\nWhich location should we choose, [GetPresidentHonorific] President?"

It was clear that he obviously prepared for this moment for weeks, and yet, [USA.GetLeader] didn't understand a single word of it - he had a vague notion of the nature of the newly established ARPA and knew that this person was a leading engineer from it, but his difficulties in transmitting his assumedly vast knowledge were apparent. All [USA.GetLeader] knew was that the ARPA representative attempted to convince the President to properly fund his department, which was supposedly set to fundamentally transform a wide range of subjects within just a few decades.\n\nHowever, people like the aforementioned engineer plead for more funding all the time. All of them make big promises about how their pet project will utterly revolutionize the world as we know it, and yet the vast majority of them produce rather unremarkable results. [USA.GetLeader] contemplated for a while if the whole ARPA thing would really be as significant as the man if front of him claimed it would be, and eventually came to a conclusion."

 USA_elec_prim.1.desc: "npp dum lol"
 USA_elec_prim.1_RD_Incumb: "The convention for the Republican-Democratic Coalition has reached its conclusion on live TV, with [USA.GetLeader] giving a rousing speech to the assembled delegates in Chicago's International Amphitheatre, calling for coalition unity, finishing what they have started, and going forth, to bring the United States closer than ever to the "shining city on the hill" that the Founding Fathers claimed America would be.\n\nIt wasn't exactly a cake walk for [USA.GetLeader], as they faced a spirited resistance from Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona, and Senator Hart from Michigan. Both Goldwater and Hart sought to replace the current President, either by going to the right and appeal to the Republicans in the Coalition in the case of Goldwater, or further to the left and the Democrats for Hart. However, neither managed to get many delegates in the few primaries that were held for the RDC, and just as soon as they announced their candidacies, they were forgotten and left on the sidelines.\n\nBut now the President can focus on their eventual opponent in the NPP, and [USA.GetLeader] is secretly hoping that they can win a second term just as easily as he pushed out "AuH20" and "Hart & Soul" from the nomination."
 USA_elec_prim.1_NPP_Incumb: "It has all come down to this. A few days in the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois. The primaries are over, the delegates have been selected, and now it's time to see who will lead the Republican-Democratic Coalition into the 1968 election. There are now only two viable candidates in a race that has seen many trying to win the keys to the White House: Arizona Senator and proud firebrand conservative Barry Goldwater, or the Conscience of The Senate, Michigan's Philip Hart.\n\nFor months, in debates on TV and radio, at rally's from coast to coast, and in living rooms and over the dinner tables of everyday Americans, the battle between Barry and Hart has raged. Pins with their faces, and slogans like "IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT" and "TAKE HART", posters, newspaper ads, cardboard hats and all the memorabilia of a campaign seeking to win the chance to be the RDC standard bearer. Both are claiming that only they can end the anomaly that is the National Progressive Coalition's [USA.GetLeader] who now sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But before they can focus on the NPP, they have to get the nod at the convention.\n\nBut as the night drags on and ballot after ballot shows little movement between Goldwater and Hart, finally one of the few "favorite sons" left on the ballot, only there because some delegates hoped against hope that their chosen candidate could serve as a compromise candidate, finally folded. So with the last ballot, the result is clear..."

 USA_elec_prim.2_NPP_Incumb: "With loud cheers and celebrations on the floor of the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida has greeted [USA.GetLeader] as they formally accepted the nomination of the NPP to run for a second term as President of the United States of America. As the first White House occupant to be neither a Republican or a Democrat since Millard Filmore left in 1853, it was only natural that [USA.GetLeader] would get another crack at four more years in the highest office in America.\n\nThere were two primary challengers, Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine representing a new business oriented faction of the Nationalist Caucus, and Progressive Caucus leader Michael Harrington, both seeking to bring the Pact, and the nation, more in line with their preferred path. However, neither won more than a handful of delegates in the primaries, and both were overshadowed by the current President's popularity and leadership within the coalition.\n\nNow that [USA.GetLeader] has secured the nomination with little in the way of opposition, the plan now is to face the Republican-Democrats, and ensure that the past four years wasn't a fluke in American political history, but the start of a new, multi-partied, coalition-driven system."

While there have been other candidates, some having won delegates in votes across the country, it has become clear that only Harrington and Smith stand any chance of winning the convention and the nomination.\n\nSlogans like "We Like Mike" and "MCS for POTUS!", along with chants for "M.C.S.!" and "Harr-ing-ton!" have filled rally's and meeting halls across America for months.

After four years in the White House, it's time for another Presidential election so the whole country can determine if the incumbent deserves another term, or if it's time for a change.\n\nThe Primaries for the RDC was short and sweet this year, as only one candidate emerged to challenge the President, former-Governor of Michigan George Romney. However, like usual in American politics, it's next to impossible to beat an incumbent President in the convention, and Romney's long-shot attempt quickly fell flat, turning the RDC Convention into a coronation for [USA.GetLeader]. Promising another term of prosperity and success, the President focused his sights on the National Progressive Pact, readying his coalition to take them on."

Kirkpatrick claims that she can take some of the votes of the NPP's Progressive wing with her liberal yet America-First intentions, forging a new coalition that can expand America's progressive future, while Romney's supporters are claiming that Kirkpatrick is nothing but a professor on a book tour who will hand another victory to the National Progressive Pact.\n\nHowever, questions between both options abound.

The votes have been tallied, close races called, victory and concession speeches given. Posters are taken down, buttons stashed in drawers, and the population begins to return to a sense of normalcy.\n\nThe incumbents who won their races return to their offices to get back to work, while those politicians that lost their races, or declined to run last time, are making their plans to pack up their papers and staff to return back to their homes and civilian lives. Idealistic newcomers of every ideological stripe are still riding high on victory as they sort their affairs to make the move to the state capitol or Washington. Those that lost return back to their old jobs and old lives, saddened and disappointed that they will not serve, but nevertheless proud of what they have accomplished.\n\nBut while the political machines of the RDC and NPP are shut down to go into hibernation, as the process of governing the country resumes, soon enough they will be turned on again, and the long, exhausting, exhilarating and exuberant election cycle will begin again."

 USA_election_helpers.9.desc: "The science and art of opinion polling has rapidly turned into one of the most important aspects of any election campaign in America. The weekly or monthly poll, usually conducted by newspapers with the help of organizations like Gallup, is used by campaigns, candidates and the general public as a way to measure the horse race that is American elections. By calling thousands of people across the US, balancing political bias and location, and judging the margin of error, it can be fairly accurately determined, within a few percentage points, of the popularity of the candidates and their ideas.\n\nOf course, there can always be surprises and flaws with the polls, with under-representation or biased questions giving flawed answers, but until the electors go into the booth and make their choices, this is the best info we got."

Unlike many nations in the world where leaders are determined behind closed doors or in bloody coups and civil wars, every four years the citizens of America get to change the course of their nation in a peaceful transition that goes right back to George Washington in 1789.\n\nMany important issues of the day will be debated, from taxes to foreign policy, from infrastructure to welfare. But more and more, the personality of the candidate is what's important: who's the charmer? Who's more charismatic? Who's the one that makes the voter truly feel that they hear them, and will fight for them? The polls, televised debates, newspaper interviews and speeches around the nation will help the undecided make their choice, while reinforcing the partisan's in theirs. The race has begun!"

The resident of the White House has been determined for the next four years, and that of Congress for the next two.\n\nWhile there is still the meeting of the Electoral College in December, and then the inauguration on January 20 to make everything official for the history books, for many people the new presidency begins now. If re-elected, the current President will just carry on with his regular duties. But if a new President has been selected, then the lame-duck will hold the fort, issue his pardons, work with the President-elect to ensure the transfer of power is smooth and uneventful, and maybe begin planning his life after ascending to the highest office in American politics.\n\nThe daily news is now back to the regular crime, scandal, foreign crisis and fluff pieces that had been shunted to the side in the past few months, and soon the campaign will become a distant memory, only for historians and nostalgic staffers to look back on in the future. After all, the work is underway already to prepare for the midterms, and four years from now the whole thing will begin again."

The Supreme Court is ostensibly supposed to be nonpartisan, kept away from petty day-to-day politics. On the other hand, very few things in America are nonpartisan when you get right down to it. Picking a nominee who fits with our ideological outlook could ensure some real political victories down the line, yet, on the other hand, it could draw the ire of those who aren't staunch members of our voting base. So, which option should we go with: a liberal nominee, or a conservative one?"

 USASJ.5.desc: "In a press conference that has dominated headlines across the country today, President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that Thurgood Marshall, currently a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, will be considered for nomination to the newly-vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."
 USASJ.5.a: "The right thing, the right time, the right man, and the right place... I hope."
 USASJ.5.b: "Maybe we should nominate a conservative instead and not rock the boat too much."
 USASC_conservative_nomination_thurgood_tt: "§FYou will nominate a conservative to the §WSupreme Court§!.\n\n§RThis will displease the Black community.§!§!"
 USA_sen_bill.105_pass: "A man who once declared that "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up," will now sit on the most important judicial institution in the United States. In a decisive vote in the Senate today, Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the newest Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court. Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"
 USA_sen_bill.105_fail: "Following the nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, one southern senator was reported to have claimed:\n\n"We will fight this nomination all the way-until hell freezes over, and then we'll skate across on the ice."\n\nIt would appear that, as of today, that fight had succeeded. Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

Blacks are forced to the back of busses, through separate entrances in buildings, into separate neighborhoods and schools, and are buried in separate cemeteries. These laws even prohibit Blacks from marrying Whites or using the same drinking fountains. While fiercely defended in the South, they are seen by all decent men as a backwards atrocity in the so-called land of the free.

It has also outlawed unequal application of voter registration laws and prohibits segregation in schools, employment and private accommodations. By passing and signing this act, Congress and the President have agreed to finally uphold the Brown v. Board ruling which was made many years ago. Jim Crow, at least on paper, has been defeated.\n\nUnfortunately, the devil is always in the details. The devil of this act is that it provides little means of enforcing its provisions. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission established by this act can only investigate claims of discrimination, which must then be referred to the Justice Department to pursue litigation. This bureaucratic process is slow, and places the responsibility for the enforcement of civil rights in the hands of an apathetic federal judiciary. Many in the Black community feel this act doesn't go nearly far enough in addressing the effects of centuries of slavery and segregation; some even allege that it was only passed to "shut Reverend King up." Yet, they all agree it's better than nothing."

This Act includes strong measures for enforcing the voting rights of Black Americans, such as requiring jurisdictions with a history of disenfranchising minorities to seek approval from the Attorney General of the United States before making any changes to their voting laws. It has also temporarily prohibited literacy tests, ensuring Blacks cannot be turned away at the polls through rigged examinations.\n\nThis Act has laid the foundation for further social progress.

The Black community generally agrees more needs to be done, but are pleased with what we've accomplished so far."

It has also permanently prohibited literacy tests, ensuring Blacks cannot be turned away at the polls through rigged examinations. It further includes protections for Native Americans by applying many of the Bill of Rights' provisions to them for the first time. It also prohibits discrimination against "language minorities" and requires election materials to be available in both English and Spanish.\n\nThis Act has surprised many analysts by extending Civil Rights protections to women.

Recognizing that racism is not a uniquely Southern phenomenon, the Act calls for the use of forced bussing to desegregate Northern municipal school districts and the integration of Black and White neighborhoods in the North.\n\nThe Act has been as derided as it has been celebrated. Liberals from the §KProgressive Caucus§! commend this Act as an egalitarian triumph, while the §gNationalists§! and even some §zDemocrats§! claim this Act is an unjust infringement on personal liberties.

It deprives police departments of funding unless they can enact policies to limit brutality while granting the Attorney General almost limitless power to address segregation in all its forms—both de jure or de facto. Already, the Attorney General has vowed to begin the massive and painful process of desegregating communities in the North and South through busing, eradication of redlining, investigations of private enterprise, and other measures.\n\nThough lauded by civil rights leaders who see it as a great step towards relegating American racism to the realm of history, many Black Americans are skeptical this law will see meaningful enforcement. In white communities, meanwhile, the passage of this law has had an explosive effect. In New York, white, blue-collar workers can be heard bitterly yearning for the days of Richard Nixon while marching to oppose integration. Suburban parents have reacted with shock and anger that their children will be subject to bussing. §OWhite supremacists§! across the country have mobilized to prey on white grievances to expand their ranks.\n\nThe President's supporters know that fighting this backlash will be long and hard. They know that enforcing it will be difficult and there will be much pain. Still, they hope that one day their children might see a truly equitable society.\n\n§VMaybe.§!"

 USA_Robert_McNamara: "Robert McNamara"
 USA_Robert_McNamara_eco_desc: "§YSecretary of the Treasury\nRepublican§!\n--------------\n§LRobert McNamara is an outside appointment in President Nixon's cabinet - coming from industry rather than the political class. A veteran of the Army Air Force during World War II, McNamara entered government after over a decade of service as one of the Ford Motor Company's 'Whiz Kids' - turning the company around through the revolutionary application of a statistical and scientific approach to management and business. In poaching McNamara from his position as President of Ford in 1960, Nixon hopes to transplant McNamara's methods from the boardrooms of Detroit to the smoke-filled rooms of Washington D.C.\n\nNixon offered McNamara a choice between the Defense and Treasury portfolios - and while McNamara is officially Secretary of the Treasury, he frequently weighs in on issues of defense, building a network of connections that could see him rise higher in Washington, should he so desire...§!"
 USA_Robert_McNamara_sec_desc: "§YSecretary of Defense\nRepublican§!\n--------------\n§LRobert McNamara is an unusual holdover appointment from Richard Nixon's cabinet - shifting laterally from his position as Secretary of the Treasury to Defense. Given President Johnson's stated focus on improving America at home, the going assumption is that President Johnson is willing to keep the business of national defense in proven hands - and McNamara had already been involved in defense issues beyond his portfolio during the Nixon years.\n\nWith the appointment of Henry Fowler to the Treasury, President Johnson has handed control over the budget and defense to experienced technocrats, with the clear expectation that they will take care of business while President Johnson remakes America. McNamara, no doubt, is capable and willing to serve Johnson as he did Nixon - but with his growing network of connections in Washington, McNamara is now a political fixture in his own right, and some whisper that his ambition may soon extend to the White House itself.§!"
 USA_Robert_McNamara_sec_gold_desc: "§YSecretary of Defense\nRepublican§!\n--------------\n§LThe military is no place for emotions. Fierce, pathos-filled born-and-bred warriors are as obsolete as the trebuchet, replaced by an endless flood of cool and calculating administrators. Optimizing the logistic process to ensure an uninterrupted delivery of materiel to operational theaters may not be the yearn heroic tales are spun of, but modern warfare is all about percentages, statistics, and evidence-based decisions.\n\nRobert McNamara is the undisputed master of this theorem. Instead of wasting his valuable time on irrelevant conflicts, he does whatever is necessary to strengthen America's position on an international stage. At Ford, he was pivotal in transforming the corporation into the fine-tuned highly efficient machine it is today - and now, he intends to apply his principles to the military of the United States. A few members of the old guard fervently object to that, claiming that cars cannot be compared to soldiers under any circumstances. McNamara vows to prove them wrong.§!"
 
 USA_Edmund_Muskie: "Edmund Muskie"
 USA_Edmund_Muskie_for_desc: "§YSecretary of State\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LSome say that international politics is a cutthroat business, where only the fierce and ruthless survive. Others claim that it's a highly delicate affair, where only careful and risk-averse diplomats can avoid the worst possible outcome.\n\nEdmund Muskie can be both.\n\nAs a Maine-born son of Polish immigrants, Muskie always had an affinity for forging bridges between different cultures. His political career is marked by a strong showing of bipartisanship and an unshakable belief in the United States and her military - being one of the first sitting Senators to publicly support an intervention in the South African War, Muskie's dedication to a strong and bold foreign policy is a continuation of his long-lasting history of interventionism and antifascism. Despite this apparent jingoism, Muskie has also been a vocal proponent of partial denuclearization. One has to wonder if this differentiated world view was what moved Bennett to nominate him as his Secretary of State, as his administration is a clear statement against extremism and fundamentalism. Muskie's term is set right in the middle of perhaps the most turbulent times since WW2, and history will be the judge if Bennett's decision was the correct one.§!"
 USA_Edmund_Muskie_hog_desc: "§YVice President\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LEdmund Sixtus Muskie cuts an unusual figure as one of the leading champions of liberalism within the Democratic Party in New England, when many other Democrats come from the South or the more conservative Midwestern states. A pugnacious and combative legislator, Muskie and then-Senator Johnson had more than their fair share of clashes on the Senate floor in the 1950's. However, his commitment to advancing civil rights and American liberalism - much like the late John F. Kennedy - made him the natural running mate for President Johnson, a Democrat he could count on to advance the vision of the Great Society.\n\nBeyond his accumulated experience in the Senate and its Northern members, Muskie is also a passionate advocate for environmental causes, often claiming to supporters that he would pick up the mantle of Theodore Roosevelt's conservation efforts - a claim that won him some support in the West, but has met more skepticism in Washington as the President advances his other priorities.§!"
 
 USA_Absalom_Robertson: "A. Willis Robertson"
 USA_Absalom_Robertson_eco_desc: "§YSecretary of the Treasury\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LA. Willis Robertson is a lawyer by training, a legislator by trade. Having spent over 30 years in both the House and Senate, Robertson's long history within government would not make him an unusual choice for a cabinet position. That is if the President was a Southerner. For Robertson's long history in Virginia rests upon the political machine that has dominated the state for decades, the Byrd Organization. Whose operation as "Independent Democrats" nominally aligned with the wider area of the Democrats has long since faded with the rise of the NPP in the South and the salience of Civil Rights in the North.\n\nOnly his relative moderation, long working relationship with Bennett, and cordial relations with the members of the august Senate kept his nomination from floundering. Robertson's appointment reflects not a rewarding of a political ally but an olive branch to the wayward South and lingering hopes among some in the Democratic Party that the Dixiecrats can be brought back into the fold. No matter the compromises needed.§!"

 USA_Clark_Clifford_sec_desc: "§YSecretary of Defense\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LFew systems can be considered to be as fine and complex as the political machine in Washington, and quite a lot of hopeful reformers were rendered entirely ineffective due to their lack of experience with the inner mechanics of the Capitol and its surroundings. The conglomeration of interest groups, lobbyists, personal feuds and utter absurdities transpiring in the Capitol may be completely incomprehensible to the average human mind, but Clark Clifford is thoroughly clairvoyant when it comes to federal politicking.\n\nHailing from Kansas, Clifford has been involved in legal matters for decades. After acquiring a law degree and practicing for a few years in St. Louis, he decided to enter politics during the aftermath of WWII after witnessing the structural failures of the then-dominant system. He served in numerous posts under a wide variety of Presidents, and over the years, he acquired an astonishing base of knowledge that's sure to benefit Bennett and his ambitious agenda for America.§!"

Born and raised in Nebraska, Curtis' career has been a slow and steady decade-long uphill climb. He passed the bar, practiced for a few years, got elected to the House, got elected to the Senate, and so on - as a firm believer in the traditional democratic process, Curtis never had the opportunity or desire to surf a wave of populism right to the top of the ladder.\n\nGoldwater and Curtis have been close allies for years. His conservative, risk-averse policy concept is a perfect match with Goldwater's ideology, and his decades of experience are bound to be of great importance in both national and international politics.§!"

For hundreds of years, economists have been trying to decipher what keeps the world spinning - and for the man hours spent, the results are mediocre at best. America is a bloated mess filled with obscure regulations, overbearing taxes, nonsensical clauses, and much more.\n\nDonald Regan is poised to clean up that mess and turn the rusty old engine into a fine-tuned machine. As a former Merrill Lynch executive, he has first-hand experience with the inner workings of the American economy, and over the years, he forged his solution on how to fix it. His bold plans will transfer every level of American society, and people are cautiously awaiting the results of his daring experiment.§!"

He embodies his nation as it wants to be.\n\nA son of the businessman and politician Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., JFK has enjoyed a life seemingly unburdened by hardship. As far as the public knows, he grew up in a supportive family and went to the best schools before enlisting in the US Navy and displaying heroism against the Japanese. Bolstered by his eloquence and a rare ability to connect with voters, Kennedy found himself swept into politics upon his return, ascending from congressman to senator, ousting a Republican rival in the process. His unabashed liberalism and uplifting campaign style led the coalition bosses to think of him as a good balance to Nixon on the ticket in '60. While Kennedy has his own ambitions, he is aware of the dangers in upsetting his erratic and confusing boss. He is determined to see their partnership succeed, at least for now.§!"
 
 USA_John_McCormack: "John McCormack"
 USA_John_McCormack_hog_desc: "§YSpeaker of the House\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LAmerica is going through turbulent times, and John William McCormack is a rock of stability amidst the chaos.\n\nThe sudden and unexpected impeachment of Richard Nixon caused John F. Kennedy to assume office, but the line of command did not end there. Someone had to fill the empty seat left by him, and that someone was the Speaker of the House according to the much-treasured constitution. McCormack himself never had any grand ambitions regarding his future career, but fate takes strange turns sometimes.\n\nLuckily, few people are passionate about their vice President. McCormack is perfectly content to stay in the shadows for now, silently performing his duty until he gets replaced by a man the people voted for. This is how he wants history to remember him - not as a grand reformer or a glorious statesman, but as a man who solemnly fulfilled his duty.§!"
 
 USA_Carl_Hayden: "Carl Hayden"
 USA_Carl_Hayden_hog_desc: "§YPresident pro tempore of the Senate\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LLife can be a curious thing. When Carl Trumbull Hayden got elected President pro tempore of the Senate, he prepared for years of administrative work and political legwork. Him being third in line to succeed the President of the United States was more of a fun fact to him, something he could tell his grandchildren - after all, there is no way that three Presidents would leave office in a row, right? Now, two out of three are gone, and Hayden is slowly getting worried.\n\nHayden's apparent reclusiveness when it comes to speaking on the floor of the senate should not be confused with shyness or cowardice. Known as the "Silent Senator", Carl Hayden is famous for winning friends and influencing people in committee meetings and cloakroom encounters. A colleague of him once claimed that "no man in Senate history wields more influence with less oratory", and perhaps these kinds of legislative abilities are exactly what John McCormack needs to enable a gradual return to normalcy.§!"

Leveraging a decorated record of military service in WWII to win a seat in the House of Representatives from Michigan, Ford eschewed the publicity stunts or blatant politicking of many of his colleagues, instead serving as one of the key go-betweens within the Republican-Democratic Coalition in the years after its merger - earning a reputation as a 'Congressman's congressman' in the process.\n\nAs a respected military officer with over a decade of service in the House and with a sterling reputation for integrity and fairness among his colleagues, Ford was a natural fit to Bennett's promise of stability and reconciliation after the tumultuous Nixon years. Ford's support for civil rights and liberalism also helped seal Bennett's support in the North, despite his fiscal conservatism being more in line with Bennett's own views.§!"

 USA_Gerald_Ford_hog_LeMay_desc: "§YSpeaker of the House\nRepublican§!\n--------------\n§LGerald Ford's current position is a testament to his lack of enemies as much as it is his political ability. Fulfilling his dream of becoming Speaker only after the dramatic and improbable ascension of John McCormack to the Presidency and multiple rounds of balloting that eliminated men several times his senior. An achievement due in no small part due to a sterling reputation for fair and even-handedness.\n\nFord presides over a body where ad hoc political alliances have long-held precedence over nominal party affiliation and a caucus that extends from unrepentant segregationists on one end to staunch liberals on the other; wielding his cumbersome majority to mixed success in stymying the legislative agenda of the NPP.\n\nYet, with Wallace removed and President LeMay in his place, Ford now stands next in line for Presidency, waiting warily for where fate will bring him next. America has survived one accidental President. Can it survive another?§!"

 USA_Walter_Judd_hog_desc: "§YVice President\nRepublican§!\n--------------\n§LWalter Judd has never been afraid to go against the grain.\n\nA missionary physician born to humble roots in a small Nebraskan town, Walter Judd spent much of his youth in China as a medical missionary, where he saw firsthand the horrors of Japanese aggression. Guided by his Christian faith and driven by his time abroad, Judd returned to the United States as one of the foremost speakers against Japanese military expansion.\n\nHis staunch internationalism earned him a seat in Congress but Judd could not stem the advance of Rising Sun. In the halls of the Capitol, he stood on his principles, waging forlorn battles against the abandonment of America's Chinese allies and for the liberalization of Asian immigration, lambasting the decision by the Dewey administration to seek terms with the Japanese aggressors.\n\nJudd's selection as Vice President emphasizes not only Goldwater's commitment to the right flank of the Republican-Democratic Coalition but its commitment to combating totalitarianism abroad. There will be no negotiating with tyrants and no peace with dictators. For, if America cannot survive a hot war, then it must win the Cold War.§!"

 USA_Al_Gore_Sr_hog_desc: "§YVice President\nDemocrat§!\n--------------\n§LAlbert Gore is a rare example of a Southern Democrat that refuses to endorse segregation - having bucked the example set by many of his colleagues in both the RDC and the NPP. Having served as Tennessee's senator since 1952 in an upset against the state's machine politics, Gore increasingly found himself out of step with his colleagues as opposition to Civil Rights tore through the Democratic Party across the South, even as his Western colleagues began to rally around Barry Goldwater's call for smaller, limited government.\n\nWhen John Glenn - then the Republican Governor of Ohio - needed a running mate for his bid for the presidency in 1968, Gore was one of the few Democrats left who was palatable to the Civil Rights supporters in the Republican Party and to Glenn's insistence on a large role for the state in public life. Gore, seeing his own political future in Tennessee drawing to a close, chose to stake his career on the political neophyte - serving as Glenn's emissary to Capitol Hill and a key source for policy expertise.§!"

After working to pay his way through both his undergraduate and law degrees, Javits entered politics in the 1930's with the Republicans in order to reject Tammany Hall's machine politics in New York - doing so with aplomb in the wave of Republican victories following WWII.\n\nAfter transitioning from the House to the Senate in the late 1950's, Javits found himself serving alongside other prominent Republican liberals representing New York. Javits' wit and experience was quick to welcome John Glenn to politics, and President Glenn repaid Javits for his support by nominating him as Secretary of the Treasury - leaving the high offices of state in capable hands as Glenn prepares to take America back to the stars.§!"

His tenure has been rather effective, if a bit unremarkable, but one achievement of his garnered the attention of John Glenn - his participation was instrumental in the drafting process of the NASA act, which established the aforementioned agency.\n\nDue to his rather earthly position, Vance is no longer involved with space exploration.

As an attorney he won several landmark cases in the fields of personal injury law and civil rights, winning multi-million dollar recoveries for his working-class clients.\n\nHe was a natural choice for Scoop Jackson's vice President. McMath is the perfect embodiment of the ideal of the "New South": A vision of a South that doesn't try to cling to an antebellum past through segregation and sharecropping, but instead looks forward to a new era of social equality and economic progress.

Byers was certainly not the expected choice of power within the government of President Francis Parker Yockey and his American National Vanguard, but the current cabinet thanks their stars for Byers' position. Establishing his fervent support of Francis Parker Yockey upon the campuses of America across the country after years of supporting George Wallace, Byers' name came to the limelight after continuous writings to newspapers across the country, defending now-Secretary Revilo P. Oliver's postulation about the potential Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy which led to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Brought forward as someone who understands the spirit of the Vanguard, President Yockey set his ardent-fan as his running mate, and now he sits as the chief position of government, behind President Yockey himself.\n\nLuckily, however, Byers has managed to find friends throughout the cabinet, despite the rising tensions from within. Byers has taken himself to be a form of a translator for President Yockey, whose academic rhetoric tends to blow far above the understanding of much of America, as he attempts to popularize the National Socialist values of President Yockey in a digestible format for the American populace.

A heart of steel and fire drove John G. Crommelin throughout the war, as his service as a naval aviator earned him a reputation of courage and skillfulness, before taking command of officership and beginning to rise through the ranks of the Navy. However, as the onset news of several of his brothers' deaths at the hands of the Japanese in the Pacific War, one streak bore a hole into Crommelin's heart, one which he would never escape throughout the war: hatred. Rage enveloped him in his warfare, as his daringness continued even within the losses of America during the war, and would shift towards the government, as they implemented further favorability towards the Air Force, and began implementing further civilian control over the Navy. John G. Crommelin's dissatisfaction, strongmanism, and southern-gentlemenliness would drive him to the likes of politics, eventually being picked up by Francis Parker Yockey as a potentially very useful asset in his representation of the far-right. Crommelin's dreams became realized as he retained control over the armed forces of the United States as Secretary of Defense.\n\nHowever, all is not dreamlike for Crommelin, or his attitude with the rest of the current administration. His furious hatred towards Hitler and the Nazis of Germany puts him in a fierce opposition towards many others in the Vanguard, for his belief in their aid towards Japan's murder of his brothers.

Creighton Williams Abrams Jr., son of a railroad worker, graduated from West Point in 1936 and was transferred to the First Cavalry Division. There he rose up to captain before being temporarily transferred to the 1st Armored Division as a tank company commander. However, it was his work in the 4th Armored Division's 37th Armored Regiment that allowed him to really come into his own as a genius at armored warfare. Serving as the unit's leader throughout the war, it was widely considered the tip of the spear of General George S. Patton's forces. At this, "Colonel Abe" Abrams excelled, awarded the Distinguished Service Cross twice in 1944 for defeating superior German units, and was even declared the best tank commander in the army by Patton himself. After the conflict, Abrams rose up the ranks of the peacetime army, graduating from the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in 1949, serving in Greenland and the Caribbean before being promoted to brigadier general and serving as deputy chief of staff for reserve components at the Pentagon in 1956.

Despite America having lost the war, Westmoreland returned home as a hardened veteran, providing valuable insight to combined arms theory and the improvement of the Armed Forces general staff. Completing airborne training in the aftermath, Westmoreland spent a large amount of his post-war years climbing the ranks of a career officer. Throughout the rest of the 50s, Westmoreland solidified himself as a key strategist and theorist for the new direction of America's ground forces.

 GENERAL_DWIGHT_BEACH_DESC: "§LBorn in Chelsea, Michigan, and graduating from West Point, Dwight E. Beach gained his commission in 1932 into the Field Artillery.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Beach planned and executed four successful amphibious landings in the Pacific. For this feat, Beach became renowned for his valiant service against the Japanese in the doomed Pacific theater.\n\nPost-war, Beach's career has been far less glamorous, serving as Commander General for various installations at home, and also overseeing the Army's Research and Development Department for a time.§!"
 ADMIRAL_DAVID_MCDONALD_DESC: "§LDavid Lamar McDonald almost never began his military career in the first place after learning he was too young to even enter into the prestigious United States Military Academy. Undaunted, McDonald chose instead to enter into the Riverside Military Academy in his native Georgia, later graduating and enlisting in the United States Naval Academy after a renewed interest in naval tactics. Upon graduation in 1928, McDonald served upon the Battleships Missouri and Colorado, later becoming a naval flight instructor. This experience allowed him to become a Flag Secretary in the Atlantic, and later as executive officer of the carrier USS Essex, serving in the Pacific against the Imperial Fleet. McDonald eventually worked further developing naval aviation doctrine after the war, serving on more aircraft carriers before becoming the Commander of the Sixth Fleet, and later becoming Chief of Naval Operations for the entire US Navy. The youngest four-star admiral in the entirety of the Navy, McDonald hopes to use his decades long experience controlling the seas under the banner of democracy once again for the good of the Free World.§!"
 ADMIRAL_THOMAS_MOORER_DESC: "§LThomas Hinman Moorer can trace his family ancestry back to someone who fought for America's independence all the way back to the early days of the Revolution. As such, fighting against tyranny is in his blood. Although he grew up a rural Alabama boy, Moorer entered into the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1933; becoming increasingly interested in naval aviation. Moorer would eventually complete naval aviation training, and would serve most of World War II flying with squadrons assigned to American Carriers in the Pacific theater. After being shot down over the coast of Darwin, Moorer survived with a Purple Heart and tenacity which would further award him for helping to evacuate overrun islands in the Pacific at the height of Japanese air supremacy. At the war's conclusion, Moorer continued to serve in the Pacific Fleet before eventually becoming a Vice Admiral in 1962, hoping one day to get revenge on the Imperial Navy which had defeated the greatest fighting force he had ever known.§!"
 ADMIRAL_HORACIO_RIVERO_DESC: "§LHoracio Rivero, although once a poor student from Puerto Rico, would become the first Hispanic admiral in United States history. After a recommendation to the United States Naval Academy which would change his life, he would graduate 3rd from his class and wind up in positions on heavy cruisers. Studying at MIT to master Electrical Engineering before reentering into the Navy, Rivero would serve on several battleships in the Pacific war, providing naval invasion support. Eventually, his command on the USS Pittsburgh would save all hands on deck during an enemy torpedo attack, gaining him widespread acclaim. After the conclusion of the Pacific war, Rivero continued his career working for several special agencies under the United States Navy. This would land him on the frontlines of the Aleutians Crisis, of which his unflinching tenacity perhaps kept the world from exploding. His leadership would allow him to be promoted to Admiral, breaking the glass ceiling and providing further excellence to wherever the Navy would be needed next under his command.§!"

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC: "What things on this earth are worth fighting for? What things are worth dying for? For Robert Francis Kennedy, the answer to that question has always been obvious: family; honor; and duty to one's common man. These are ideas that he has spent his entire life pursuing, aspirations that were engraved on his soul by a father determined to see his family win at any cost.\n\nRaised in suburban Massachusetts, Bobby Kennedy enjoyed a glamorous but unhappy childhood. While he avoided much of the suffering of the Great Depression as a member of the glamorous Kennedy clan, he was forced to contend with a withholding father who considered him a "runt" unworthy of his attention. Unable to seriously pursue the priesthood or journalism as he might have done in another life, Bobby shed his gentle and generous personality to become a ruthless opportunist unwilling to stop at anything to achieve his ambitions.\n\nThis new Bobby was put to the test in the 1950s. After a brief stint in the US Navy and a tour observing the implementation of the Kyoto Accords, the family installed Bobby as the campaign manager of his beloved brother John's 1952 Senate campaign. Hard-fought against an entrenched incumbent, Bobby earned the approval of the larger Democratic Party by winning. He earned similar accolades as Sen. J. William Fulbright's assistant counsel and an aide in the Kefauver administration. In 1960, he managed his brother and Nixon's run for the White House before winning a special election for his brother's former Senate seat in Massachusetts.\n\nTragedy would strike soon after. Nixon's failures on civil rights and the death of his brother broke Bobby's heart. Enraged at the RDC and in grief, he did not halt the "Draft Kennedy" movement as it consumed the NPP's Progressive Caucus. Having now won the presidency, an enraged Bobby Kennedy is determined to do what it takes to realize his brother's legacy. He will fight whoever stands in the way of his family's vision of a free, prosperous, and liberal America."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC: "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in Texas, he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and dealmaking that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment", he began first as a congressional aide before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate. There he reigned as Majority Leader of the Democrats and then Republican-Democratic Coalition for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC: "Richard Milhous Nixon is a complicated figure. Originally a Representative, and then Senator from California, he rapidly rose through the ranks of Congress through skilled political manouvering. During his time as a Senator, Nixon worked closely with Joe McCarthy in carrying out the Grey Scare, working to root out suspected fascists in government. And while he didn't share the spotlight to the same extent as McCarthy did, nobody doubts that Nixon is still an anti-fascist crusader through and through.\n\nA lifelong member of the Republican Party, Nixon has never been totally comfortable working alongside the Democrats. The broad popularity of the National Progressive Pact dictates that they must, however, and the coalition ticket that won him the 1960 election has made his presidency a living hell. John F. Kennedy's position as the Vice President has driven a wedge in the Executive Branch, as his own magnetic charisma and stunning competence have taken the spotlight away from Nixon more than once.\n\nAs much as Nixon wants to focus on foreign policy, so he can act to undermine the unstable German and Japanese empires, domestic affairs have gotten in the way. Civil rights issues can no longer be ignored, as racial tensions flare and people demand action, one way or another. While Nixon has been reluctant to endorse either segregation or integration, staying on the fence is becoming increasingly costly.\n\nOf course, Nixon is also doing what he can to keep the NPP down, including some... extralegal means. With challengers coming at him from all sides, including within the White House, Nixon will have a hell of a time trying to keep the ship of state steady."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC: "There is an idea of a John Fitzgerald Kennedy. It is in the newspapers and on television, on radios and billboards. The Kennedy that exists in the American imagination is a white knight on horseback. He is a glittering crusader rescuing America from the ruins of the Nixon Administration. He is a selfless hero sent from on high to save this country from itself.\n\nOf course, none of this is true. The real Kennedy is not from heaven but from suburban Massachusetts, the product of a wealthy family determined to triumph at any cost. While he did indeed enlist in the US Navy during the Second World War and won accolades for his heroism, Kennedy has been quick to use his wealth, privilege, and charisma to climb the political ladder. He has relied on dozens of faceless, nameless experts to make calculated, cynical plays for power—first in the House in 1946, then the Senate in 1952, and, after a struggle with the party bosses, the Vice Presidency in 1960. The Presidency should be the culmination of the Kennedy political project, a prize for his political savvy. Kennedy knows that he could serve out the remainder of Nixon's term doing nothing but interviews and photo ops and leave a revered figure.\n\nAnd yet, he can't do it. He cannot sit as the country unravels around him. Perhaps it's a sense of pride after two years of being neglected and abused by Nixon. Perhaps it's out of a sense of self-preservation, knowing that his future reputation depends on the survival of the Republican-Democratic Coalition. Perhaps it's a sense of duty born from so many months fighting for the Civil Rights Act, speaking to civil rights leaders and looking into the faces of those scarred by Jim Crow. Whatever the motivation, John is determined to try and be the hero Americans want him to be. Together with his brother Bobby, he will show that idealism isn't foolish, that America's institutions are still worth defending. So long as he lives, America has some source of stability and the Establishment might still be redeemed of its sins."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC: "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality he is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts from un-American fifth columnists seeking to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Democratic Party, helping act as a firm hand in guiding it to the high ranks of the National Progressive Pact.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin - how do you hold together a party bound only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems he'll be using his time to legally buttress segregation as much as he can. When it is effectively impossible to dislodge, he will return home, where he shall be forever immortalized as the savior of the South."
 POLITICS_MARGARET_CHASE_SMITH_DESC: "Margaret Chase Smith has been making history her entire life. The first woman to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The first woman to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first woman to stand for the Presidency - and win. Every step of the way, her detractors have whispered that she would be a shrinking violet, unfit to serve - and President Smith delights in proving them wrong every time, having built a reputation as a hard-nosed and principled defense hawk over her two decades in Washington.\n\nTo her few allies, President Smith is a pillar of consistency in a fractious NPP; to her many rivals and enemies, President Smith is an infuriating iconoclast. She stunned her Republican Senate colleagues by being the first among them to break ranks and denounce Joseph McCarthy's Grey Scare as 'un-American' for its attack on civil liberties, even as Tokyo labeled her a 'beast in the shape of a woman' for commenting that she would have nuked Japan back after the atomic attack on Pearl Harbor. After abandoning the RDC after their merger in 1951 (refusing, she said, to work with the architects of America's surrender) Smith has had an uneasy relationship with the rest of the NPP, utterly refusing to break bread with the Nationalist's segregationists while chastising Progressive Caucus or former Republican colleagues if they seemed to be losing focus on the fascist threat.\n\nSmith is convinced that America must take the fight to - and defeat - the fascists, without selling its soul in the process. And now that the NPP has rallied behind her - if only to capitalize on the cowardice of the RDC while putting the segregationists to the side - President Smith faces the even more daunting task of convincing the rest of America that the fight against foreign tyranny is never done, while consigning the worst impulses of the NPP to the dustbin of history. It is her greatest challenge yet - but for President Smith, it's only Tuesday."

 POLITICS_JOHN_MCCORMACK_DESC: "For most Presidents, their inauguration is the culmination of years of political ambition and success, bringing them to the highest office in the land and a chance to ultimately shape the nation to their ideals.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House John McCormack is not one such President. Rushed out of Congress and into the White House on a day of panic and blood, he is faced with a nation in turmoil. Outrage over President Nixon's actions on civil rights has shattered any semblance of political decorum in Congress, with constant shouting matches taking more time than legislation. The people have made their voice heard as well, with riots and protests breaking out weekly and voters changing their registration to support the radicals of the National Progressive Pact.\n\nMcCormack has isolated himself in the White House, only speaking to trusted aides and friends on the matters affecting the nation and leaving his deputies to calm the turbulent waters America is headed for. Facing a coalition in crisis, the divisive issue of segregation, and the rapidly escalating war in South Africa, the reluctant President's next days in office will change the nation's direction for years to come."

 POLITICS_CURTIS_LEMAY_DESC: "If someone had told Curtis LeMay in 1962 that he'd be President in the next few years, he'd have laughed in their face and called them a damned fool. And yet, despite never seeking the office, LeMay finds himself in the Oval Office on the heels of George Wallace's disastrous presidency.\n\nNotorious for his comments on the 1964 campaign trail about "bombing Africa back to the Stone Age", the former Air Force general was considered a political liability by many members of Wallace's campaign for his gruff and apolitical nature. Never a true politician, LeMay's main role in the administration has been to address defense concerns, especially involving America's nuclear capabilities. Now, with the departure of Wallace, he must finally take a position on the issue of segregation. Surrounded by potential enemies and tasked with healing the troubled nation, clear skies for LeMay will be short in the coming days.\n\nStill, President LeMay has taken these events in remarkable stride. As the storm rages around him, he is confident that America will make it through this latest crisis. In 1943, he saw the greatest defeat in American history, riding out the storm at the controls of a heavy bomber, and now sees a chance for someone to finally take decisive action and heal the nation. Going forward, the President is absolutely certain of one thing: The United States will not fall into further turmoil on Curtis LeMay's watch. It wouldn't dare."

USA_debate.1.t: "Harrington v. Bennett"
USA_debate.1.desc: "Under the glare of the television cameras, President Wallace F. Bennett and Michael Harrington walk stiffly towards each other, offering each other thin smiles and a wooden handshake. The two are hardly friendly; Harrington has been a vocal critic of Bennett's international policy since day one of the administration, singling out Bennett's preferential trade policies with the OFN as a betrayal of American labor.\n\nAs the debate moves into the topic of foreign affairs, Harrington wastes no time going on the attack. "[GetPresidentHonorific] President, I'm often approached by people on the street - good, hardworking, honest Americans - asking whether they'll have a job next year. These are miners, steelworkers, farmers - the beating heart of American industry. How can you claim to be keeping America strong, when your administration subsidizes the purchase of foreign goods, leaving Americans grasping for pennies?"\n\nBennett smiles neutrally back at Harrington. "The beautiful thing about trade, Mr. Harrington, is that everyone benefits. You say that American industry is being weakened; I say that it's roaring to ever-greater heights, as tariffs come down across the OFN. You say that America is weakened by our purchases from our allies; would you prefer that we squeeze our allies dry, like the Nazis and their puppets? America can never stand alone in this world, and certainly not while facing the likes of the Germans and the Japanese.""

USA_debate.2.desc: "President Wallace F. Bennett and Senator Margaret Chase Smith walked briskly towards each other, shaking hands briefly before turning to their podiums. In earlier times, the two had been cordial acquaintances in the Senate, united by love of country despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle. But there would be no quarter today, with the Presidency up for grabs.\n\nSmith wasted no time shifting on the attack. "President Bennett, you speak of brotherhood between the peoples of the Free World through freer trade within the OFN. Though the OFN must remain united against oppression, I question the wisdom of your approach; your policy confuses leadership with foolhardiness, charging ahead while turning a deaf ear to American workers and industry. The Treaty Ports should remind us all of the costs of ignoring American interests for naive hopes - of appeasement thirty years ago, or of fraternal brotherhood today."\n\n"Senator Smith, we distinguish ourselves from Japan and Germany by our promise that America stands for a free, prosperous world. The OFN is a community of peoples: it is not a vehicle for totalitarian domination, or colonial dependency. Free trade is the surest means by which freedom survives, binding peoples together in free and open exchange." President Bennett stared Smith down. "We must prosper together, or we shall perish alone.""

USA_debate.3.t: "Harrington v. Johnson"
USA_debate.3.desc: "President Johnson and Michael Harrington eyed each warily, looking for an angle of attack. There was surprisingly little traction to be had on issues of policy: pundits had noted that Johnson's Great Society and Harrington's answers for the Other America had a great deal in common. The debate would be decided on the question of trust, of suitability for the nation's highest office.\n\nPresident Johnson cleared his throat. "Mr. Harrington, while I must respect your compassion, I have my questions about the company you keep. The American people wonder how the NPP will govern in practice, instead of in theory, especially when you've got the likes of Gus Hall shouting about nationalization and class warfare. There is plenty to work on in America, but shouting Bolshevik nonsense isn't how you go about it."\n\nHarrington's face twisted in indignation. "Is that how low you'll go? Judging an entire swathe of your fellow Americans by the most radical among us? I will be unequivocally clear: Mr. Hall's views are at the extreme fringe of the pact, I do not endorse them, and the Progressives's leadership does not endorse them. We stand for an inclusive America, a caring America, an America where a man doesn't need to fear the boot of the blackshirt or the commissar, but instead trust in the charity of their fellow man. It is beneath you, [GetPresidentHonorific] President, to fall back on fear instead of civil virtue.""

USA_debate.4.t: "Smith v. Johnson"
USA_debate.4.desc: "President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith, once colleagues across aisles in the brief years before the formation of the RDC, wore stony smiles as they approached each other on the stage. The fallout of Smith's abandonment of the RDC still rankled: for Johnson, Smith was a constant annoyance, while Smith resented Johnson for putting power over principles.\n\nSmith wasted no time going on the attack. "President Johnson, you speak highly of your Great Society, about alleviating poverty and want. But my constituents see an economy stuck in neutral, while the demands of the taxman grow year after year. You may have good intentions, President Johnson, but redistribution without prosperity is simply stagnation."\n\n"Senator Smith, you and I both know the result when business is allowed to pursue profits over people." President Johnson replied acidly. "I don't think anyone's eager to go back to a time when soup kitchens were the only relief for millions of Americans.""

USA_debate.5.t: "Kennedy v. Goldwater"
USA_debate.5.desc: "Senator Barry Goldwater and President Robert F. Kennedy hardly smiled as they approached each other, exchanging a wooden handshake before turning promptly towards their respective podiums. The compassionate gentleman of the Progressive Caucus and the doctrinaire conservative of the RDC had hardly seen eye-to-eye during their years in Washington, and they weren't about to start now.\n\n"President Kennedy, it is my patriotic duty to remind you that the Treasury is not a bottomless well for your bleeding heart!" Goldwater criticized harshly. "The American people have a right to know, and to question, the use of their hard-earned money and the growth of the national debt, and they are saying: 'An American is entitled to the sweat of his brow!'"\n\nKennedy threw Goldwater a disdainful glare. "Senator Goldwater, try walking up to the unemployed veteran, or the mother struggling with the burden of caring for their four children, and tell them that all they're entitled to is the sweat of their own brow. As if they deserve their poverty. These people don't need slogans; they need our help!""

USA_debate.6.t: "Wallace v. Goldwater"
USA_debate.6.desc: "Senator Barry Goldwater and President George Wallace wore frozen smiles as they approached each other, a picture of political collegiality. Too perfect; the two seasoned politicians were too practiced to do something so crass as to let their disdain for each other show in public.\n\n"President Wallace has let far too many of America's sons die in foreign lands in pursuit of - what, exactly?" Goldwater questioned. "Fascists must be resisted, but your support for maximum force in South Africa, the carpet bombings and bombardments that raze whole cities to weed out a battalion! It borders on the bloodthirsty, throwing American lives away for political gain."\n\n"Senator Goldwater, am I the only here who remembers your... enthusiasm for tactical nuclear weapons? That with one bomb, you could do the work of an entire division and save their lives to boot?" Wallace bristled. "War is hell, and we can't pretend it isn't. You say that war can be made easy with a single bomb; I assume you, Senator, that you would put America on the road to Armageddon in the name of victory.""

USA_debate.7.desc: "SWhile urban machines exchanged deals for votes and committees arranged donation drives and canvasses as they always had, America's voting public spectated the quadrennial tradition's most recent addition in the comfort of homes the nation over. At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, President Robert F. Kennedy engaged his Democratic Senator Philip Hart in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of their respectful exchange that night:\n\nKennedy: I have an immense respect for Senator Hart and his steadfast support for this Administration's efforts to pass civil rights. He has been a constant and vigorous ally. But I do not want this nation to forget who has been leading this fight for the last four years. While prior Administrations shirked away from their responsibilities, the Kennedy Administration stood up for the poor and the dispossessed. It worked to address the gross inadequacies at the heart of our system for the betterment of all.\n\nHart: I likewise appreciate the work of President Kennedy and his departed brother. No one can dispute his commitment to the battle over civil rights, but... with all due respect, Mr. President, it has not been you who has led the fight. It has been men like Martin Luther King, Jr., Bernard Lafayette, and countless other civil rights leaders who have forced this issue into the national agenda. What I can promise is that, under my leadership, these individuals would be further empowered to pursue their goals and that we would work to enable them in achieving true economic and political justice in cities across this country."

At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, President George Wallace engaged his Democratic counterpart Senator Philip Hart in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nWallace: Now despite what you might hear in the New York Times, which is quite good at rewriting what is happening on the local scene, I have never made any divisive expressions. I have never made any dispiriting statements about the capabilities of the colored man. I am and always have been a candidate for states' rights and local government. I have never run on this kind of platform or a platform of segregation for that matter. What I have campaigned on is a platform that has confidence in local people, the people of Alabama or Missouri or any other state, can run their schools however they'd like without someone in Washington forcing them to adopt policies that might undermine their natural character and—.\n\nHart: Mr. Wallace, I have tried to be polite throughout this proceeding, but what you have just said is offensive morally, intellectually, and spiritually to millions of Americans watching this debate in their homes. It is patently obvious exactly what it is your government means "states' rights" and what it means by "natural character." Over the past four years, what we have seen emerging from your Administration has been an aggressive campaign to demean and demoralize the African American and the many people concerned with their plight. Your statements, whether lies or willful ignorance, cannot conceal the effect of your policies."

USA_debate.9.t: "Harrington v. Hart"
#USA_debate.9_thurmond: "A nation, traumatized in the wake of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and the chaos of President Thurmond, prayed for the triumph of reason and calm as Senator Philip Hart and Michael Harrington took to the stage.

Hart said. "I admire that, but can you say that your party shares your vision? With respect to the late Robert Kennedy, Americans have seen the NPP spend the past few months arguing endlessly with itself over his legacy, with the policies of the Thurmond administration buffeting your party like a toy boat in a storm. How can you convince the American people that your party shares your vision?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Pact." Harrington responded. "The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, is a travesty that must be addressed. The National Progressive Pact has come behind me, to grapple with and put to rest the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives.

Hart said. "I admire that, but does your party share your vision? Over the past few months, the American people bore witness to the very real fractures in your party, at war with itself over the impeachment of George Wallace. How can you claim that the NPP can lead American into the next decade, after four years of bitter division?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Pact." Harrington responded. "I stand for those Americans who suffer, through no fault of their own, from racial discrimination, from poverty, and from hunger.

Their shared positions, many as they were, made the points of disagreement even more vociferous as they competed for the still undecided voters watching the debate.\n\nThis debate could be seen as a high point for American liberalism, with both candidates firmly on the left-wing of the political spectrum. Whether a sign of changing times, or an odd quirk of the arcane party systems and primaries is unclear. What is certain, however, is the immense attention paid by citizens across the country to the clash between Hart and Harrington."

Goldwater stated emphatically. "But no man is an island, especially in politics. And I cannot help but wonder: how many stand with you in your own coalition? These past months have laid bare the agonizing disagreements within your pact over the legacy of Bobby Kennedy. How can one lead when one's own house is in disarray?"\n\n"Senator, the American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Pact." Harrington deftly countered.

Under my leadership, the National Progressive Pact will not tolerate racism and discrimination, whether by skin color or the quality of their work.

After an exchange of polite handshakes and waves to the crowd both made their way to their respective podiums. Silence fell and the debate began with barbs flying nearly immediately.\n\n"America would be a less safe country under Senator Hart," Senator Smith charged as applause from the NPP supporters in the room filled the air, "We stand against united, powerful enemies who seek to snuff out the torch of liberty and cast the free world into darkness. Any distraction from that struggle, even if well-intentioned, should make any sensible citizen's blood run cold." Shaking his head, Philip Hart of Michigan immediately fired back.\n\n"Senator Smith would rather you be paralyzed with visions of foreign foes than looking at the reality of the United States today. America cannot be prosperous and strong if her cities are suffocating, her roads are rotting and bridges collapsing. The NPP may seem united, but it only appears so as long as it has an enemy overseas to unite against. When it comes to matters of domestic policy the contradictions of the Pact leave it unable to deliver meaningful progress for Americans."\n\nThe debate continued for some time, with Smith emphasizing her focus on national defense while Hart hammered her inattention to domestic affairs. Her promises of greater military spending were met by Hart's ambitious plans for infrastructure investments. In homes across the country, glowing television screens brought the debate into every watching domicile. Undecided voters watched carefully, weighing their votes, while partisans cheered their candidate on."

Harrington, to his credit, refused to budge or flinch, a quiet force radiating against Johnson's energetic presence.\n\nTheir roles reversed as the debate kicked off, with Harrington launching into a surprising criticism of Johnson's administration. "President Johnson, your Great Society suffers from a lack of ambition. The root causes of grinding poverty, of unemployment, of the debasement of human dignity remain unaddressed. We both agree on the role of government in fundamentally bettering American lives, yet you focus on treating symptoms while ignoring the cure that millions hope to receive."\n\n"Well, Mr. Harrington, you certainly don't lack for conviction." President Johnson replied. "But when you speak of dreams, I deliver results. Ask any American on the street: are they safer, healthier, more satisfied with their life? We both agree that politics is about people; but results matter as much, if not more than, ideas in politics.

But the devil was in the details, and Bennett was nothing if not a master of the details.\n\nBennett made a show of holding up Harrington's domestic policy platform - a veritable tome. "I admire your passion, Mr. Harrington. The crusade for the common man." He smiled. "But have you actually considered what it means to implement this? These programs, promising to bring the federal government into every facet of American life - you'd be talking about doubling, tripling the federal budget. Can you convince Americans why the federal government must bear all the burdens carried by our states and our communities?"\n\nHarrington wasn't lacking for a response. "[GetPresidentHonorific] President, it's easy to say that things can't be done. But the reality is, beyond the walls of this auditorium, I have seen another America, one that suffers for want of food, dignity, and security. And this is before we factor in the struggles faced by our African-American communities! How can we claim to be the mightiest, the wealthiest nation on Earth, if we cannot feed our poor and shelter our homeless? The question is not whether we can or cannot; it isn't even a question.

"But it's easy to talk about nuclear annihilation, to casually threaten Armageddon as a solution for America's woes. America will not vote for a suicide pact with Japan under your watch."\n\n"I hardly think your coalition's one to lecture Americans about expansive military commitments, given your coalition's record on South Africa." Smith glared at Johnson. "In the defense of freedom, America must remember that the clearest enemy is the enemy closest to home - the enemy that still occupies American soil in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Hawaii.

"President Wallace, your 'right to work' programs are an abomination against hard and honest work. You would turn the act of labor into a thankless rat race, rather than the means of human dignity. Americans should work to live, and not live to work: It's callous, it's dehumanizing, and wholly un-American."\n\n"Well, Senator Hart, we'll just have to agree to disagree on the value of work," Wallace drawled, an icy smile on his face. "But I'd have to argue that instead of talking about ideals, you should judge a man by their results. A growing economy, surging business, the spread of American products to foreign markets.

"Senator Goldwater, you say you respect states' rights, yet you insist on carrying the torch of civil rights, against the wishes of these states! The voters know where I stand; can you say the same?"\n\n"I'd say that your claim to monopolize the moral high ground on a question of civil liberties is hypocrisy of the highest order," Goldwater seethed.

Kennedy stated. "I think I speak for many when it is clear that liberty means different things in different states. That is an affront; the matter of civil rights cannot be done piecemeal and confined to individual localities; every man must be free, or nobody is free at all."\n\n"You paint me as a radical for wanting to respect the traditions of our democracy, while you demand obsequience and threaten submission for the slightest dissent. Is it not altogether more radical to refuse to accept that differences of opinion must at least be heard in your march to progress?" Goldwater shook his head.

Content to file down the plight of people and communities into neat little numbers to be adjusted in whichever way to satisfy his friends on Wall Street and the Chamber of Commerce. Well, Governor, America isn't a country that needs restructuring, and its people are more than numbers and assets on a balance sheet, and you would do well to remember there is a human face behind every cut program and a human cost to your fiscal penny-pinching."

While there have been a great many number of men in the Administration speaking a great many number of platitudes about human rights, we have seen America's position erode across the world. We have seen the lure of totalitarianism grow not only abroad but domestically as well among the student protestors we see on the streets of our cities. If I am elected your President, I can assure you that this weakness will end. We will gather strong allies who can work alongside us to smash the forces of totalitarianism wherever they arise.\n\nHarrington: When Congresswoman Kirkpatrick speaks of allies, what she means are American-backed dictatorships. When she speaks of totalitarianism, she speaks of any person or group who is not immediately supportive of America and its interests. Now, I have always considered myself a patriotic American, but the degree to which the Congresswoman must villainize her enemies and posture over issues of "strength" should frighten any American. She would commit America to a dark and dangerous path, one of aggressive and senseless militarism that could leave scores dead. She would do this at the expense of our nation's health systems, its welfare programs, and its educational systems, which she has derided again and again as providing for "able-bodied lazy persons."

USA_debate.18.desc: "Hall waited only five minutes for Romney to appear. In truth, he had no illusions that Romney ever would - Romney had told reporters several times he was going to skip the debates. Yet he spent a great deal of time considering that number. Wait too long, and everyone's tuned to another channel. Say something too soon, and you appear aggressive - already a problem for a communist candidate. Five minutes - that was the perfect spot. Hall firmly and calmly began. "Moderator - my opponent has refused to appear for these debates. I believe it states in the rules of the debate that I may take the floor should such a situation occur. "The moderators flipped through their notes and whispered amongst each other. Finally, one nodded. Hall began his prepared remarks. "Hello, My fellow Americans. My name is Gus Hall. Today, we are here to talk about the problems of America. Yet my opponent has refused to even consider them. Rather than engage, he would rather stay home. I respect my opponent. He, like myself, worked his way up from a life of poverty, on the fringes of America. Yet in this moment, I cannot help but feel disappointed.""Does he not see the plight of the worker, the farmer, the common man? In his time at AMC, he heard his workers in the automobile union protest. As Governor, he saw the people of Detroit wake up and fight for their freedoms. He has seen the same America as you and I. Yet now, when given a chance to consider real solutions, he refuses. It is a sign from the Republicans and Democrats, same as always - willing to tinker, yet unwilling to change.""

For who was so foolish as to stand before nature's red reckoning?\n\n"Will they pay for their crimes?!" said Hall to the podium.\n\n"No!" said the Bougies. Their expensive suits and cocktail dresses, pelted with rotting fruit and garbage. A taste of what they turn their noses from - if the People's wrath were less restrained, a taste of where their noses would have turned. Permanently.\n\n"Will our cause suffer the work of traitors?!" said Hall to the audience.\n\n"N-no!" said the Scabs, their grubby hands stuck trembling to their hefty wallets. They came back to the People in an instant, prodigal sons and daughters all. Time will tell if their new comrades forget as easily as they forgive.\n\nThe General Secretary spread his arms astride, bearing wide smiles for the People, the Bougies, and the Scabs.

USA_debate.22.desc: "Humiliation. Rage. To say that Yockey was furious was to express the mere feeling of one man, but Yockey felt much more. He felt the shame that had fallen upon every good American the moment they saw their priests and their mayors and their Presidents shed their morals and values and join the debased carnival of modern, hedonistic America. It had been fifteen minutes. Romney had already told friends and advisors that he was going to skip the debates - that they weren't worth his time. The rumor had swirled across America all summer. Yet Yockey had assured himself it had to be a lie. The one thing liberalism prided itself on was its traditions, its so-called 'good faith' - would Romney be so crass as to destroy all of that just to humiliate his opponent? Yet here he was on the debate floor, on national television, alone. Yockey was silent. He had no one to speak to, yet everything to say. Why was he surprised? This was the way of the liberal, the capitalist, the parasite. Steal, lie, cheat your way wherever you can. Romney was perhaps the best example of the capitalist class, hiding within his mansion, gorging on ill-gotten wealth while his race suffers. The debauched creature in front of the teleprompter smiled uncomfortably, ugly sweat dripping off her brow. She opened her mouth. "Since Romney is not here... I suppose you have the floor." Yockey's voice came out a rasp. "That Romney would not appear in front of me tonight... he is a disgrace to his race and his nation. The White Race... it deserves better." He turned directly into the eye of the camera."

At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson engaged his Democratic counterpart Jeane Kirkpatrick in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nJackson: I admire my opponent and her commitment to preserving and expanding America's strength abroad, but what I question is her inexperience and decision to pursue this office at such a treacherous moment in our nation's history. What America needs now is experienced leadership and a steady hand. It needs men and women who have proven their capabilities to the American public for decades—not merely a political theorist. Ms. Kirkpatrick is an intelligent and capable woman, but I say: Let's go with tested leadership.\n\nKirkpatrick: Likewise, I deeply admire Mr. Jackson and the leadership he has provided for many years. Indeed, I would remiss if I did not highlight the variety of programs and initiatives which he has promoted for the betterment of our national security. But, I ask, is America ready for more of the same? I am sure Mr. Jackson means well, but we need more than just politics as usual. We need to let the best and brightest from academia, industry, and civil society rise to the top. We need a new generation of leaders who can inspire our country to take the fight to totalitarianism wherever it may be—among the student radicals in our streets or against the empires of Europe and Asia."

Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nRomney: I am here because I profoundly believe that present basic trends and perils are rushing us toward a national crisis and I believe to avoid or to survive that crisis, the American President must provide the leadership that will capture the interest, respect, and support of all Americans. The future of this nation depends on vigorous efforts to address the inadequacies of our society. It requires the strong and forceful collaboration of the public and private sector, of all of society, to meet our needs. We need to free the hand of business to promote the public welfare, just as we need the government to further efforts to eradicate prejudice.\n\nJackson: Mr. Romney speaks of collaborations between business and government and, perhaps, there may certain areas where that is necessary. But I think the American people still have memories of when cities were paying $25 a barrel for oil. Why are international oil companies being given a tax incentive to go abroad and drill? Why are we subsidizing corporations with excess profits that leave America a weaker state, more vulnerable to disruptions as we saw during the Oil Crisis. Before we can collaborate with business, what America needs is to complete the work of Franklin Roosevelt domestically and internationally. We need to be strong at home and abroad."

At the Eastman Theatre in Rochester, New York, Jeane Kirkpatrick engaged her National Progressive counterpart Phyllis Schlafly in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of one explosive exchange that night:\n\nSchlafly: America's national interest is America, not the Philippines, not Brazil, and certainly not West Africa. I know this is a hard concept for many in our press to grasp, what with the many wonderful pictures and reports that Mrs. Kirkpatrick's allies leak to the press, but we are not going to be made safer by sending our children to fight and die to defend one dictator over another. Instead, the United States should act to do what it takes to preserve its security. And that security can only be found in building up the nuclear strength needed to force Germany and Japan to stand down. We need overwhelming nuclear supremacy, not fair weather friends and a so-called international community.\n\nKirkpatrick: I... Goodness. I don't know if I should laugh about all that or to cry. But it's indicative, I think of the kind of foreign policy offered by the Opposition. People like Mrs. Schlafly believe that saving the people of Wolofia from terror and totalitarianism was the wrong thing to do. They don't blame the Wolofian leadership or the Japanese for threatening American warships in the Gulf of Guinea and murdering civilians. They blame the United States instead, but then again they always blame America first and never her enemies. On my watch, we'll see America do whatever it takes to back up its allies and act to overthrow violent oppressors wherever they exist around the globe."

Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nSchlafly: The threat to the traditional American family is just as dangerous, and even more insidious, than the threat posed by the Germans and Japanese. It is a threat that cuts to the soul of our Judeo-Christian civilization and our miraculous Constitution. Just like the National Socialists in Germany, the libbers want to use social engineering to make us forget the values that made us a strong, prosperous, and free people. They want to replace the Constitution with a system that glorifies them and their radical agenda, that puts them in charge of our lives. They would throw open the doors to abortionists, homosexuals, and all manner of other radicals while putting down hard-working Christian men and women. These are policies of national suicide.\n\nRomney: I don't know if I need to say more when my opponent has exposed the kind of radical, conspiratorial politics she represents. The people trying to promote sexual equality are not promoting "national suicide" nor are they seeking to oppress Christian families. I've worked hard in Michigan to bring these groups, and all groups, together, to identify best practices and promote common understanding. By working with leading citizens in the public and private sector, we can do more than work ourselves into a frenzy over petty grievances.

Now, I have no qualms with Senator Jackson—he's a good man, a patriot, and liberal advocate—but I ask my fellow Americans whether they want to risk the current efforts of this administration for an uncertain future. Are we ready to risk these investments in our roads and railways? Are we willing to abandon the largest reform effort since the New Deal? Are you better off than you were four years ago?\n\nJackson: Philip and I go a long way back and I cannot fault his intentions, but... we live at a dangerous moment in American history. With conflicts brewing abroad and our enemies gathering strength, we cannot afford to merely focus on our domestic affairs. We need investments at home, yes, but these investments will never be secure so long as our energy sources are threatened and our place in the world fragile.

Each of them, without fail, ended as they began: with an invocation of America's values. Yet as I shuffle through the morning papers and learn of another good American led astray by hunger, of another patriot imprisoned for exercising his right to assembly, I found myself asking: are the values you've espoused truly worth calling American?"\n\nGoldwater: "Ladies and gentlemen, here we have a turncoat lecturing us all on American values - and in live television too! The irony would've been hilarious had it not involved a presidential election, but as it is it's only laughable.

Whether it be a crime in the streets of our cities, masculine-hating malcontents on our college campuses, or the assault by 'equal rights' anti-family, anti-children, and pro-abortion fanatics on our way of life, this administration has, time and time again, shown an unwillingness to stand up for American values."\n\nGoldwater: "With all due respect to Mrs. Schlafy, it is not the job of the government to unduly interfere with the private lives of our citizens. I don't think it is prudent, as Mrs. Schlafly would have it, to have the government taking sides on every social issue of the day.

We have paved hundreds of new roads, laid tens of thousands of miles of new tracks, and built countless rest stops and way stations for the American people. These investments will not only enable new economic growth but will make our communities more interconnected than ever before. If I remain in office, I can promise you that we will keep building. We will ensure America keeps moving forward.\n\nSchlafly: Forward off a cliff, perhaps. The present price tag on Mr. Hart's highway fantasy is a whopping 115 billion. Even ignoring the regular cost overruns, not even the most sycophantic members of the President's own Bureau of Budget believe they will be able to pay off this cost without increasing the tax burden on millions. And even with all these expensive new rest stops and train stations, there is considerable doubt that the average, God-fearing American will take their chances in these spaces which are already being taken over by criminals and alcoholics. I don't know about you, but I think this country has enough muggings and rapes already."

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy!\n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc: "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army.\n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc: "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above.\n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"
USA_ww3_emergency_naval_procurement_act_desc: "The Pentagon's forecast attrition rates beggar belief. Soldiers, equipment, ships, and aircraft will be written off at an astronomical rate, expended to keep the war far from the American homeland.

If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."

The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc: "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."
USA_ww3_nationalize_air_industry_desc: "The United States has had a long term of industrial superiority, both as it continues to grow within history, as well as when it is spurned into a furious upkeep in supporting the nation, such as what happened during the Second World War. In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above.\n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"

The largest, well furnished and well funded United States Army installation in the state of Kentucky, sitting right on the outskirts of Hopkinsville, with all of the Army's latest and greatest. And as Private Rodney Bannister was about to find out, as he sat resting in his bunk with dreams of his family and girlfriend swimming through his mind, it would be the most comfortable place he'd have the grace to pass through for a long, long time.\n\n"Get your fucking asses up, now, all of you!" Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers. Bannister hurried to attention, as had his fellow Soldiers all around him as they all faced forwards where the Gunnery Sergeant came forward. "Get your shit together, men, the United States is at war! Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon.\n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States. Hooah, soldiers." the Gunnery Sergeant concluded.\n\nAs Private Bannister continued forward with the rest of his platoon to get onto the trucks heading to Fort Carson. But no matter what, he couldn't shake the fear out of his head. This was it, what if he never got to see Jennifer again? Or, what about the rest of his family, and his little brother? Hell, what if he never got to see the rest of the world again, he thought, as he boarded the truck with thoughts of nuclear winter abroad."

USA.WW3.3.desc: "The car ride was quiet, nearly silent. Considering the circumstances, Isaac Summers figured that his mom, the one driving the car, would be her usual chatterbox self, gushing and embarrassing Isaac. She'd always been that way whenever Isaac decided to go to one of the school dances. Rather, he found himself in a somber atmosphere as his mom drove him down the Pennsylvanian road to the Army office in Harrisburg. Finally, the car came to a halt right in front of the big brick building. He felt his mother's tears grace his cheek as they hugged one last time before he walked towards the building.\n\nThe inside was an absolute disaster. Hundreds, if not nearly a thousand boys like him had received the same yellow slip titled "Order to Report for Induction" notifying him of his draft into the military. He waited his turn in line for hours until finally, he exchanged his paperwork with the woman behind the desk, approving him for his conscripted entrance into the United States Army after a quick physical and mental health check and approval test with the words "infantrymen" written on top. A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines.\n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

Despite all of the harrowing difficulties, he had been hastily transformed from the next applicant to an Ivy League college to a true soldier of the United States Army. His feelings had devolved from resentment to a difficult mix of steadfastness and dread as the ship journeyed onwards. The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention.\n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans."\n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going. Besides, fascism's gotta suck for the economy, huh?" the Corporal said, offering one last pat on the shoulder before walking away."

USA.early_flavor.1.desc: "Henry Jackson - known affectionately to his contemporaries as "Scoop" - sat at his desk, looking expectantly at the two figures sitting opposite. Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Progressive wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Progressive's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Progressive's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the pact was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the pact, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the pact if some lunatic like Wallace gets on the ticket. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Progressives as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say. Scoop glanced out the window with an uncertain look. "I don't know who the man to lead us is. But he better show up soon. Or we are screwed.""

"How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing coalition unity'."\n\n"But this is far more important than coalition unity, Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President. At the very least you can use your voice in the name of those who have no voice."\n\nJohn was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. "You've always been a good man, Bobby.

The circumstances aren't ideal, but I can think of no better man to be President right now." Robert could barely contain his smile. "Think of all the things we can finally accomplish!"\n\n"Come on, Bobby, you're embarrassing me," chuckled John, who beamed nonetheless. "But thank you. I know I can always count on you."\n\n"Always. Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The coalition's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace. As the time finally came for them to leave, Robert quickly glanced at the list and noted his brother's first destination.

That was true enough, but as he sat in the holding area awaiting his cue, he could only think of John as the brother he had looked up to. His greatest inspiration and his closest friend. He wondered if he should just call it off, so great was his grief. Grief, and anger.\n\nJohn was killed because he was the President. He was only the President because of the Republican-Democrats. Because of Nixon lying like a bitch and doing everything in his power to stop progress and change, killing the Civil Rights Act and forcing John to step up to the firing line in the most damnably literal way. The coalition had chewed him up and spat him out. They had used him, just like they had used the entire Kennedy family and dragged their name through the mud.\n\nWhen a staffer poked their head into the room to wave him on stage, Robert stilled his tears, and prepared to give what would become one of the most shocking speeches of his career. After slowly ascending to the podium, he addressed the assembled crowd, giving a short but passionate eulogy in honor of his brother, extolling his candor, his way with words, and his dedication to America. The crowd nodded along, some cried, some bowed their heads. But none of them could prepare for what came next.\n\n"My brother was loyal to the Republican-Democrats through and through. He was loyal as they made every effort to avoid bringing this country true equality and justice. He was loyal as they charged blindly into an unnecessary and bloody war in Africa. He was loyal as he was ignored until the time where they needed a man to clean up their mistakes, and he was loyal as the fallout of their ignorance resulted in the loss of his life." He paused as many in the crowd stared agape. At least two from the coalition mouthed words of astonishment and curses at him. His next line would live on in infamy.\n\n"I was loyal to the Republican-Democrats also. That ends today.""

Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington. The three regarded Kennedy curiously yet hopefully as they sat opposite him, each shaking his hand in turn. Scoop was the first to speak. "This is certainly unusual. But I hear good things about you, Mr Kennedy. We have a few questions for you before we go any further."\n\nOver the next twenty minutes, the impromptu Progressive committee picked Robert's brains over a wide variety of issues. "How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up. "The Republican-Democrats no longer represent this country, nor are they willing to do what is necessary for its people. I want to join you because I feel that you represent the change that I believe in... and the change that my brother believed in."\n\nScoop glanced sideways to his associates.

Partly because the thought of never going up there myself again is saddening to consider, but that's not the only reason."\n\n"By ending our involvement in space, President Nixon has given up.

I implore that the President reconsider his options. The future of America, and the human species as a whole, lies above us."\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Glenn made his closing remarks, and was greeted with raucous applause. He felt satisfied that his words had hit their mark, and with so many journalists in attendance tomorrow's papers would carry them further still. Yet he still felt defeated. His words alone would not be enough to save NASA.\n\nIf American space travel was to have a future, it would need a voice to represent it in the halls of power. John Glenn had never been one for politics, but as he thought on it, he realized that political office may be his best course of seeing his dream fulfilled.

This was the third time he had explained this concept to the assembled legislators, and many were listening. But Johnson had chosen to enact his signature bullish persona to derail the discussion.\n\n"And I also say it's pretty simple - that you are wasting time arguing over which metal we base our currency on. Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson. Myself and my colleagues have done much research into the matter. We haven't even begun to get into the hard data - allow me to show you the charts-"\n\n"I will gladly look at your graphs, Mr Bennett, but given the times we live in, I still say that silver is a rather small thing to get worked up over." Johnson chuckled idly as Bennett launched into more discussion, clearly not listening.\n\nBelittling as always, thought Bennett. Johnson was supposed to be his ally. The Republicans and the Democrats were supposed to be allies. Yet even the Progressives and the Nationalists of the NPP seemed to have a better and more equal relationship than the two sides of his coalition did these days. As a Republican, Bennett felt increasingly sidelined. That would have to change, he decided then and there.\n\nAfter the ultimately fruitless discussion came to a close, the two men passed each other as the senators left the hall for lunch.

We know that this has occurred because of the efforts of a coordinated Japanazi plot to replace our free republic with a National Socialist collectivist autocracy. They have carried out this plot through the use of their "useful idiots"; the integrationists, the Marxists, the Progressives, the Republican-Democratic Coalition and Presidents Nixon and Eisenhower, all the Kennedy brothers and especially the family patriarch, and all those who have sought to weaken the United States through implementing liberal, communistic policies that will sow chaos and discord and leave us helpless before the Japanazi onslaught.\n\nThere is only one political leader in this country who I can say with complete confidence is not a part of this National Socialist conspiracy. That man is George C. Wallace. This man flew bombing missions against the Japanese in the war and never gave up that fight, not even after America was stabbed in the back at Akagi. He has now taken the anti-socialist struggle from the Pacific skies to the town halls of America, and is the lone voice speaking up for states' rights, free speech, free enterprise, and all those rights which our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Constitution. He is not afraid to stand against the Nazi-created "Civil Rights movement" and its anti-constitutional demands and has wrested the National Progressive Pact from the control of the Japanazi agents in the Progressive Bloc.\n\nWallace is the last and the best hope for the United States of America.

Wallace and Yockey were open radicals, and he knew that it'd take an incredible series of concidences for them to come anywhere close to the oval office - but this man was something else. He was electable, he was composed, he was... scary.\n\nLooking at his daughter, the man said "Nothing, dear. He just talked about some adult things, that's all. By the way, you really should get to bed - god, it's already ten past nine!", laughing as if the whole scene was somehow comical in nature. But as he tucked her into her bed, all he could think of was Barry Goldwater, and what he might do in the future."

USA.early_flavor.11.desc: ""Starving the Beast," the magnum opus of professors George F. Kennan, James Burnham, and former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, has landed with a splash within the circles of foreign policy. The product of years of correspondence, debate, and discussion, it is at once a scathing rebuke of isolationism, a defense of interventionism, and a blueprint for American foreign policy.\n\nArticulating Kennan and Burnham's proposed "Toolbox Theory," the two professors call for the United States and its allies to pursue a total "war without war." Aiming to contain and starve the German and Japanese Empires by utilizing every available tool in America's toolbox to aggressively contest fascism. Whether it be through proxy conflict in the battlefields of the Third World or via economic, technological, and diplomatic means.\n\nHaving been guided for over a decade by the hands of the Dulles brothers and the twin mantras of "Rollback" and "Fortress America." The death of John Foster Dulles and the inauguration of the Nixon administration has created an opening for new theorists and policies in the State Department. An opening that is eagerly being filled.\n\nWith a readership encompassing Prime Ministers, Dignitaries, and even the President of the United States, only time will tell how this new "Toolbox Theory" will affect policy and strategy as the United States grapples with its enemies the world over."

USA.flavor.1.t: "Death of MacArthur"
USA.flavor.1.desc: "Today, General Douglas MacArthur, who led the defense of the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War, has died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center of biliary cirrhosis at the age of 84. After a state funeral authorized by the President, he will be laid to rest in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMacArthur has a contested and complicated legacy; he had served in France in the First World War, as Superintendent of West Point, served as part of the court-martial of General Billy Mitchell. After he was assigned to the Philippines, during which he became the youngest American Major General at the age of 44, and was appointed Army Chief of Staff in 1930, and after leaving that post was named the Field Marshal of the semi-independent Philippine Army in 1935. But his role in putting down the Bonus Army of WW1 veterans in 1932, and his failure to prevent the Japanese from occupying the Philippines left his reputation in tatters. It was the latter that resulted in his dismissal by President Thomas Dewey, and has since been considered either the "man that lost the Pacific" or as a scapegoat for the failed American war effort against Japan. He used his new civilian role to try to rally the American people to fight the war, but his constant criticism of Presidents Dewey and Eisenhower alienated him from politicians and the general public, especially when he made comments favorably admiring Asian cultures and peoples later in the war.\n\nThe General's detractors considered him egotistical, aloof and pretentious, while others called him courageous, intelligent, and inspiring. Many National Progressive Pact members and leaders have long believed that MacArthur could have won the war against Japan had he been properly supported. But that is a question that will never be answered."

USA.flavor.2.t: "Moratorium to End the War in Africa"
USA.flavor.2.desc: "Over 500,000 people have marched on Washington to protest the violence and brutality of the continued US presence in [USA_central_africa_ongoing] Africa, denouncing the deaths of young American men and calling for peace on the troubled continent. Other marches throughout the US have also taken place with similar demands to end the war and bring our soldiers home. The most striking image was the sight of thousands of men and women, in single file, carrying placards with the name of a dead or wounded American soldier, or a town or village in West Africa that had been destroyed, marching in single file down Pennsylvania Avenue, past the White House, before reaching the Capitol Building.\n\nThe Moratorium is a different kind of protest: it's not left-wing "hippies" denouncing the draft and leading to violence and riots. Instead, the Africa Moratorium Committee sought support from "respectable" institutions like the civil rights movement, churches, university faculties, unions, business leaders, and politicians. Some of those that spoke in the big Washington march include Coretta Scott King, Dr. Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger, W. Averell Harriman, and Arthur Goldberg. One news reporter has called the marches taking place "...a sober, almost melancholy manifestation of middle class concern..."\n\nIt's difficult to say if the presence of so many thousands of everyday Americans will change the country's policy regarding South Africa, with some supporters of the President are claiming that the protests are actually a Japanese Imperalist ploy, simply to undermine the efforts to fight fascism, a new "America First" committee to undermine the nation's democratic resolve. Some White House staffers are sure that a "silent majority" actually does support the President in the current path forward. But if the war continues on much longer with more American lives lost, it will be that much harder to stay the course."

Johnson took a long drag on his cigarette, before turning to Smith. "You stabbed us in the back over 'principles,' and now you get to watch us burn for Nixon's skulduggery. Must feel nice."\n\n"It doesn't feel nice at all. It's infuriating, watching how Nixon took an axe to our democracy," Smith replied, playing with the rose on her dress. "I'm glad some of you are speaking up. I wish you'd found your moral compass sooner."\n\n"You don't get it, do you?" Johnson stubbed out his cigarette. "Nixon went too far - but politics is about numbers, and I'll take votes in my pocket over tilting at windmills every time!"\n\n"What does that make you, Lyndon?

USA.flavor.4.desc: "The poor man drives home from his daily grind at the auto factory. His next payday is weeks away and he wonders if he will be able to eat until then. He questions why he can barely afford the necessities while his rude, lazy supervisor owns a second car and a vacation home in Florida. Commiserating his lot in life, he turns on the radio. Another man speaks, his voice loud and commanding. He decries the state of America, that squeezes the worker dry while funneling his wealth towards the upper classes. He calls for the wealth that belongs to the people to return to the people. The poor man listens to his words intently, all the way back home.\n\nA university student pores over her essay on American history, knowing that her professor will scold her for how unpatriotic it is. As a girl, she believed that her nation was the greatest in the world, but after reading what scarce few books she could find about the history of native genocide and the Red Scare and the legacy of Jim Crow, she found it hard to feel any sense of pride anymore. She spies a leaflet pinned to a corkboard on the wall. It advertises a student activist group claiming to preach "the real, sordid history of America." After some musing, she sets out to attend its first meeting.\n\nThe Black man had been politely turned away from some offices, or actively laughed out of others. Finally, he finds someone who will take him seriously. The White man greets him warmly, and asks him about his previous experience. He talks about his days as a lawyer, primarily defending civil rights activists and the poor and downtrodden, and the official listens to him patiently. After a lengthy interview, both are smiling. The Marxists are coming into the light, and a Black lawyer and defender of civil rights is exactly the type of person they'd like to put on the ballot.\n\nSomething is changing in America. The ideal of the American Dream no longer holds the luster it once did, and anger is beginning to mount. Decades of broken promises are finally catching up to this country, and unless something changes, the people may well turn to ideas once considered anathema."

USA.flavor.5.desc: "The Klan rallies, as they often do, through the streets of a southern town. The locals are amenable to them, furious as they are at being forced to live alongside Blacks, and so they march confidently and proudly as they go. Suddenly, they find themselves faced with another crowd. A wash of all races have gathered to stand against the Klan's marchers. Many have come in from out of town, in an unprecedented level of organized resistance. Soon, violence breaks out between the two sides, and the Klan are forced to retreat.\n\nA gaggle of union representatives sit across from the factory boss. Once, police would have quickly dispersed the striking workers outside like they did at Blair Mountain. Now, with union membership soaring, the boss sits and quietly seethes as he reads their list of demands. He's damned if he lets the strike go on any longer, but fulfilling their demands will ruin him in the long run. The union reps sit and smile, knowing that he has no choice, confident that they finally have the strength to effect real change. There is power in a union once more.\n\nThe once lone voices of the Marxist caucus meet with the most radical of the Progressives in Washington. The Marxists argue that they have done all they can by playing nice and adhering to the system - America is ready for real change, and it is time to push and push hard. For the first time, the once-moderates are amenable to their argument. A decision is made, more funding is allocated to the Marxists, and those within the Progressives who are tired of getting nowhere agree to help the radicals with whatever they need.\n\nThe time of mere questioning is over. More and more people are beginning to take direct action against what they perceive as injustice and indignity in this country, and they are beginning to push towards the halls of power. Unless the establishment can offer up a meaningful solution to the problems faced by the American people, they will continue to turn towards those with fire in their hearts."

They shout, chant and whistle, and when police arrive to quell the unrest they soon turn to roars of anger. Within minutes there are fires, tear gas, broken glass and broken bones. This is the scene in New York. It is the scene in California. It is in both the Rust Belt and the Black Belt. All America is beginning to unravel.\n\nIn a disused warehouse, a gaggle of militants meet. They hail from the Panthers, the more radical unions, and one or two previously unknown, somewhat esoteric leftist sects. Once they would have discussed plans for armed resistance, but now, paradoxically, they have decided to quell their violent intentions. For the first time, the system seems to be bending in their favor, and revolution might be achieved by the ballot box for the first time ever. Their plans instead turn to more peaceful matters - electioneering, voter registration and rallying the base. Of course, if the powers that be stop them from manifesting the true will of the people, they can always return to plan A.\n\nIn Washington, the NPP begins to buckle. Once they would have spoken softly, but now any pretense of civil discourse has broken down. RDC senators are shouted down and derided as corporate stooges, while what little remains of the Right are forced to remain silent for fear of immediate ejection. Once, championing Marxist policy within the halls of power would have been tantamount to political suicide. Now, it seems like the order of the day.\n\nA spectre is haunting America - the spectre of socialism. The powers of old American values have entered into alliance in an attempt to exorcise this spectre. However, across the nation, fury at the system reigns supreme, and unless something can be done to quell this fury, America may be about to enter a radical new era."

USA.flavor.7.desc: "A man stands upon his soapbox in the busy city square. His yelling is often rambling and incoherent, but anyone who would bother to listen can get the gist. America is under siege, he says - not by fascism or imperialism, but by liberalism. These 'treasonous lowlifes' seek to destroy America from within with their low moral character, their cowardice in the face of foreign aggression, and their tolerance of the Black man and the Jew. Most passers-by pay him no heed. However, the small audience that does listen has grown slowly larger over the last few weeks.\n\nA Black woman hums a gentle tune as she browses the store for her family's evening meal. Suddenly, a White man approaches her. He accosts her, telling her that her kind have no place in this store, spitting and addressing her with a slur. She stands her ground, and he attempts to assault her before he is dragged out kicking and screaming obscenities by store security. The woman had once hoped things could be better, but the racists have been more brazen than ever lately. She goes back to her shopping, her tune silenced.\n\nA pair of Nationalist senators sit at lunch in the Dirksen Building cafeteria. Their conversation begins innocently, idle comments on traffic and the weather and the elder senator's buxom new secretary. Then, one begins to commiserate on the coalition's change in course, longing for the days when they could openly stand for true White American values. The other smiles, and tells him that one day they might be able to again. He has been having some talks with Yockey's people lately, and the time may soon come where they can come out into the open.\n\nTo the untrained eye, all is well in America. But for those who know where to look, the signs are all there. There is a darkness building in this country, and those who would welcome it grow more and more bold. Their influence is still small, and things will carry on as they are for now, but for how long will that last?"

USA.flavor.8.desc: "The streets of Birmingham echo once more with the cries of unrest. This is no mere protest, but a rally. It is organized and coordinated, and its members are filled with a feverish passion. Their placards bear slogans of hatred, pictures of Yockey and even Hitler, and calls for liberal and progressive politicians to be lynched. They are greeted with a band of counter-protestors, and soon the city echoes with screams of obscenity and fury. Soon, both crowds have grown too large and unruly for the police to control, and the violence begins.\n\nThe police gather in the remains of the salon. According to the owners, the thugs had come during the night and set the place alight, shouting racist obscenities as they did so. The former employees, all African American, weep at the loss of their livelihoods. This is the fifth report of arson in a month, including two other Black-owned businesses, the office of the RDC backed mayor, and a Jewish family's residence. No evidence of the culprits is found, and the police leave with no further inquiries. More than one of them quietly smirks as they go.\n\nIn a conference room in Washington, the Sovereigntists meet. Their fundraising efforts have yielded more fruit than ever before. For the first time, they begin to talk of campaigning, of distributing media to the public and pushing for their members to speak at NPP events. The mood is cheerful, even if they do not quite have the influence yet to begin pushing their agenda. Every man in the room can feel the change in the air. Their time may finally be coming.\n\nThe cracks are beginning to show, and from those cracks pour the forces of reaction. All across the country, these ideas are beginning to take root, and no longer are those who hold them afraid to hide it.

Openly, loudly, proudly, they proclaim their defence of the White race against those who they say would destroy it. Once, they would have been greeted with counter-demonstrators. Now, they march unimpeded. The Klan's enemies stay away now, ever since the clash which saw three dead and twenty four beaten to within an inch of their lives. No longer do the town's police protect the Klan's enemies from harm. No longer do the police hide their allegiance to the Klan.\n\nIn an idyllic clearing in the Appalachian woodlands, all is quiet, save for the wind. As the gust begins to quicken, a slight tapping joins the fray. It is the gentle tapping of a Black man's boots against a tree as he hangs from its branch. Suddenly, a second tapping joins him, from the body hanging on the next tree. This one is not Black. Those who seek to cleanse their community of the other have seen fit to hang a Jew this time. They are the third and fourth men to be hanged in that forest in a week. They will not be the last.\n\nIn Washington D.C. there is a disquiet. Where before there would be the veneer of civility from even the staunchest segregationist, now there is open contempt. Those who call for equality and greater government clarity are loudly decried as traitors by the backbenches of the NPP. Ideas once confined to the Volkshalle now openly circle within the chambers of Capitol Hill. Cornerstones of American democracy, such as the notion that all men are created equal and that all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, are now being brought into question by the faction of Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nA rot has set in at America's heart. Even in Jim Crow's heyday, never before was there such a sense that hatred was the way of the world. Before, it was quiet. Now, slowly, the fury begins to build. Very soon, it could erupt into a scream of hatred, and all of America might be consumed by it."

The Argentines still claimed them as the Malvinas, though few took their claims seriously. The few ships that did arrive were mostly cargo vessels bringing in new supplies to keep the islands habitable and exporting wool, hides or fish brought in from the rugged landscape and the freezing waters. What has changed, however, was where those ships were from. The majority of them used to fly the Red Ensign of the British Merchant Marine, but now the Stars and Stripes fly from the mast of the ships that stop by.\n\nThe small airfield has been lengthened and strengthened to accept the fighters and bombers of the US Air Force, and the US Navy has a small fueling, resupply and maintenance base to help the US navy protect the southernmost tip of the Western Hemisphere.

Luckily, Pablo's family lived not all that far inland, so he was in relative reach of all those lucrative hospitality and tourism jobs along the island's coast.

As the capital of the nation, it isn't officially part of any state, instead a district governed by the US Congress as a whole to ensure that any local government couldn't overpower the federal seat. When it was a half-built, swampy square of land where few lived if they could help it, this presented few problems. But as the nation grew, so did Washington, and with over 750,000 people living within its borders, more than 11 states in the Union from the 1960 Census, it seemed hypocritical that the population of the capital of the world's most important democracy shouldn't be able to vote for their leaders.\n\nThe recently passed 22nd Amendment has changed that. The citizens of Washington, D.C., now have the right to vote in Presidential elections, granting them no more electoral votes than the smallest state in the union, so just three electoral votes for the 1964 election. The city is a buzz of activity, as voter registration drives are taking place and polling stations in school gymnasiums, fire stations and community centers are taking place, as a high turnout is expected among the residents and citizens of the city.\n\nFor many, this is a long time coming, a historical injustice finally righted. For others, this is only the first step. For while they can now vote for the resident of the White House, other avenues of political representation are missing: DC gets no member in the House of Representatives, nor the two senators that the other 50 states have, and no ability to help change the constitution that had so long denied them their rights.

The smoke from the twin funnels dwindled as the engines were shut off, and the lights were eventually turned off.\n\nSeventeen years before, the crowds were much larger, more jubilant, as the SS United States left New York on its maiden voyage. Designed by the famed naval architect William Francis Gibbs, the United States was the largest passenger ship ever built in America, as well as one of the safest. She was virtually fireproof, with aluminum, asbestos and fiberglass composing almost everything inside the ship.

The lack of passenger travel between the US and Europe, and the arrival of new passenger jetliners that can cross the ocean in a fraction of the time of even the world's fastest ship has sounded the death knell of the ocean trade.\n\nWhat the future holds for this great liner remains to be seen."

His eyes glanced over the room, and Wallace took a moment to just appreciate the atmosphere of the room, knowing that this would be one the last times he would be able to do that. The wooden Resolute desk was as magnificent as ever, the plaster seal on the ceiling was impressive, if a bit kitschy, and Honest Abe still looked at him with his legendary smile. Everything was just as it was supposed to be, but one flaw shattered that serene image - a massive black stain ruined the beautiful hardwood floor.\n\nBennett didn't know how it got there - maybe some cleaning lady dropped something she shouldn't have dropped, or one of his guests came in with dirty shoes. All he knew was that the stain existed since at least 1965, and over all the years, Bennett could never find an opportunity to remove it. Sure, he had his reasons - visitors had to be welcomed, meetings had to be held, and much more. There was simply no time left to deal with that, especially considering that the entire floor would likely have to be replaced just for that one spot.\n\nHe could have removed it, but he didn't. He left it alone for years, and now, it almost seemed like it was growing, seeping deeper and deeper into the foundation of the building.\n\nBennett sighed and went back to work, crunching numbers and formulating long-winded memos to federal departments the average citizen has never heard of. "Perhaps the next President will deal with this stain...", he thought to himself - and if they didn't, the stain would likely turn into a permanent fixture."

Lyndon was nothing but a pathetic loser, a man who failed at his only job and got replaced by someone better than him, a man who captured the hearts of the people and his office with them. He would smile, he would ensure a smooth transition, and he would immediately afterwards disappear into irrelevance just as -\n\n"Could you please elaborate on your foreign policy regarding North Africa? You brought up some interesting perspectives I haven't even considered so far."\n\nThat was the beginning of a long and fruitful conversation. Johnson and Harrington talked about foreign policy, domestic policy, economics, and much more. Not as opponents, but as equals - and for circa two hours, it seemed like the deep divide within American society finally closed.\n\nA few hours later, the day started to come to a close. The temperature dropped, the light started to fade, and the streets slowly emptied until nothing but a few cars remained, weaving through the dimly lit roads.

All of their letters are filled with valid concerns, justified demands and hopeful pleas. Every single one of them was unique and thoughtfully written, but they all blended into each other after some time, like a uniform mass of paper and ink.\n\nHarrington was almost done with his daily allotment when one letter caught his eye. It was a simple letter - both the postage stamp and the envelope were the usual ones you could buy at your local USPS station, and the return address was handwritten with a pencil. Among the heap of elaborate signatures and luxurious, impregnated envelopes, it stuck out like a sore thumb - it was the "other letter", in a way. Intrigued, Harrington picked it up and opened it. A barely legible scribble awaited him, which he could only decipher with some trouble:\n\n"Dear [GetPresidentHonorific] President,\n\nThank you so much for giving my school more money!

Whenever he watched klansman march through the streets, whenever he drove through the neglected streets of the Bronx, whenever he watched that empty suit known as Martin Luther King spout empty platitudes about forgiveness and love, he felt like was going to snap. Reciting that mantra in his head dozens, hundreds of times sort of dampened the seething hot rage deep within him, but it didn't fully extinguish it - it merely funneled it into productive thoughts, a fervent drive that turned him into one of America's biggest civil rights advocates through nothing but his own labor.\n\nHowever, the comfortable knowledge of the fact that the eternal oppressors would get their just desserts in Jahannam wasn't enough for Malcom. He had no patience for the afterlife - he longed for racial justice in this world instead of the afterlife, and he dedicated his entire life to this cause, going as far as to change his surname to highlight the systemic destruction of West African culture waged by the institutions of slavery. No actions were too radical, no words were too dangerous when it came to dismantling the century old white supremacy that defined the United States since their inception.\n\nMalcolm X made lots of enemies over the years.

Over the past few years, he has been rather occupied with worldly matters, but recent events finally enabled him to take a week off - there was much to be done, but the situation wasn't as desperate as before.\n\nThe city was an everlasting tornado of different peoples, a place where the world came together as one to worship the great god above it all. Malcolm shared his accommodation with a Bosnian, slaughtered a lamb with a Turk, and attempted to explain his role in the civil rights movement to an Indonesian grandfather, and even though his monologue was barely intelligible due to his rather lacking grasp on Arabic, he still felt like he bonded with him on a rather spiritual level.\n\nWas this what Hajj is really all about? Malcolm circled the cube and kissed the rock like he was supposed to, but the real purpose of Hajj was to embrace the ummah and transcend the barriers that divide believers from each other - the real Hajj was the friends he made along the way. Maybe Martin Luther King had a point - if racial equality can be achieved in Mecca, it could surely also be achieved in America.\n\nIn retroperspective, the Nation of Islam did seem like a rather impious and overly revanchistic organisation. Perhaps it was time to distance from it, to abandon the hate-filled clique in favor of the one true denomination - Sunni Islam.\n\nSome of his old brothers in faith might take grave offense to that, likening his revelation to apostasy and treason.

Not content with his rescuing of the company, Romney had continued his ventures into Michigan politics.\n\nAt the head of the Citizen Crusade, Romney and his allies had managed to challenge the RDC monopoly in Michigan. Their efforts forced a state Constitutional Convention and a rewriting of the state's governing documents to be more efficient and protective of citizens' rights. This effort had attracted the support of many in Michigan, including the NPP, even as it challenged the established powers of the state.\n\nIn spite of his clash with the RDC in entering politics, Romney had no interest in joining the NPP.

In a divided country many voters gravitated towards this style of governance that was different from the RD blandness and NPP anger.

After years of stagnation, where the RDs had acted like nothing had changed in the state since the state, Michigan agained seemed to be on the move.\n\nThis has only further harmed the position of the NPP in the state. Locked out of the legislature and governor's mansion for years by the coalition, their strength in the state has been further reduced by the popular governor. Naturally, Romney's sweeping victory has prompted media speculation regarding a run in 1968 for the RDC nomination.

He imagined an America where he, having come so far in spite of so much already, would be able to climb another rung on the ladder of American society. He thought of the good he could do, the example he would set for Black Americans around the country, how it would be a small but important repudiation of America's founding and original sin.\n\nUnfortunately Brooke's hope was dashed. The buttons vanished and no call from Romney about a run came. Brooke learned about Romney's campaign collapsing due to financial issues from the newspaper. 1968, it seemed, would not be Romney's year as Philip Hart and Barry Goldwater had swept up all the support from their sides of the political aisle, leaving none for the centrist Romney."

I wish for them to reach from one corner of the nation to the other. I want them to employ as many Mexicans as possible wherever it is possible. Truth be told, I want to have Ford do the same thing in Mexico that they did in the US. It is time Mexico begins moving forward with the rest of the world. Soon we'll be part of the first world right alongside you." Salinas spoke with complete confidence as though he believed in every word that he spoke without the slightest bit of worry. But Romney could see it, the inferno of brilliance hidden behind the man's eyes. It was as though he was talking with a sweet talking devil.\n\n"Well I am more than confident that Ford could do that and more here in Mexico if given the chance." Romney replied with a smile on his face. Truth be told, Salinas wasn't half bad. Sure, he was a tiny bit friendly with the Japanese, but Romney had heard he'd been friendlier to the Church than his predecessors. And besides, he offered a good opportunity for American companies to profit."

USA.spyflavor.1.t: "Langley"
USA.spyflavor.1.desc: "Jacob Friedman's entire life had been leading up to this point. Everything he had done, everything he had learned, everyone he had known, had all led to this moment, to this location: 10:27 AM, June 15, 1963, Langley, Virginia.\n\nHe had no reason to be nervous; he was everything they were looking for. Graduated from George Mason University with honors, almost fluent in German, good with people- his list of achievements went on and on.\n\nAnd yet, he could feel beads of sweat make their way down his back as he entered the building. What if they said no? What if everything he had done for most of his life was for nothing? What if his heart was shattered like glass?\n\nHe ignored these questions as he pressed on, passed the front desk with the pretty receptionist. His heart pounded as he approached the room he was told to; he could barely hear his own hand rapping against the wooden door.\n\n"Come in," came the response. He opened the door, and sat down, across from the man who held his heart in his hands. They made eye contact, and the other man smiled and began.\n\n"Son, what makes you think you're a good fit for us?"\n\nJacob had a habit of rambling; of letting words spill out in a desperate attempt to make his thoughts make sense. With effort, he had trained himself to stem this flow of words. In careful, calculated sentences, Jacob sold himself to the man. He answered his questions and responded to his thoughts, ignoring the fear that lurked in the back of his mind.\n\nFor a moment, there was silence. Then the man smiled, and reached out his hand."
USA.spyflavor.1.a: ""Welcome to the CIA, son.""

USA.spyflavor.2.t: "A Hard Goodbye"
USA.spyflavor.2.desc: "It was a hard conversation- but it had to be. Jacob just didn't expect her to be this stubborn, this unwavering about it.\n\n"I don't get it. You're going to Germany, of all places? They'll kill you!"\n\nJacob sighed. This was the third time he'd tried to explain this to his mother, but she still wouldn't get it. "Mom, I told you before. I'll have a fake name and a fake identity. I'll just be another gentile American businessman looking to get rich off of Nazi money."\n\nShe grimaced.\n\n"But what if they find out? While the new Führer seems better than Hitler, he's still a Nazi! And what company business is so important that they're sending a Jewish employee to Germany, of all places?"\n\nJacob tried to get a word in, but his mother continued her tirade.\n\n"'Aerospace stuff'? That's all you'll tell me? I know Germany has the best engineers but they're still Nazis! Can't you ask your boss or whoever to get an appointment somewhere else? Somewhere that they wouldn't want to kill you?"\n\nJacob shrugged, laughing internally at his mother's attempt to guilt him.\n\n"I'm sorry ma, but this is what's happening. I'll try to write to you, and I promise I'll stay safe."\n\nHis mother frowned and shook her head.\n\n"I just wish you would tell me what you were really doing over there.""
USA.spyflavor.2.a: "Jacob wished he could."

USA.spyflavor.3.t: "Impostor"
USA.spyflavor.3.desc: "Jacob fit in well with German high society- mingling with the rich businessmen reminded him of when he'd walk around Wall Street back home, and they always had such interesting things to say. The fancy suits and thick stench of cologne never failed to take him aback, at least at first.\n\nHe had to constantly remind himself of two things: that a. Most everyone here would kill him in an instant for being Jewish; and that b. He wasn't here for leisure; he was here on work, and he had a mission to accomplish.\n\nHe spoke to anyone and everyone- his German was near flawless by now. He was able to gently insert questions into his conversations: questions that the businessmen would eagerly answer.\n\nThey were ecstatic to give the nice young man their thoughts on anything and everything. Jacob's head swam with a thousand people's thoughts on a million topics. The Führer's reforms were chief among them. Every businessman was more than happy to rant about how bad Speer's market reforms were for their companies, the economy, and even the Reich.\n\nAnd of course, Speer's actions on minorities were ruining Hitler's great vision for this nation! They need to be put back in their place.\n\nJacob -or Siegfried, at this point- would agree with them; he'd say whatever needed to be said to get in their good graces, to keep them talking. The things he had to say disgusted him, but it was his duty to say them. So he continued.\n\nWhen one "Helmut Schmidt" came up in conversation, Jacob always paid more attention. The foreign minister of the Reich had always interested him; sometimes, he seemed as if he actually wanted democracy."
USA.spyflavor.3.a: "Jacob let his thoughts wander."

USA.spyflavor.4.t: "A Letter Home"
USA.spyflavor.4.desc: "Dear Maddie,\n\nI miss you more than you could ever know. It's weird, being here- a nation that a few decades ago we were at war with. I mean, things seem much better under the new Führer; it seems like there's a genuine attempt at reform, but I'm not too sure sometimes. Schmidt seems interesting at least. Still, some things stay the same. They'll probably read this letter, for instance. Hi Klaus! Or whatever your name is.\n\nIt's hard to purchase things here. Knowing everything was made with... less than ethical means kind of puts a damper on everything, haha! But it's still livable. I try not to buy anything too extravagant anyway- it's not like I have the salary for it!\n\nSpeaking of work, it's going fantastic! We just made a major sale (too many planes to count) and I get to meet the most interesting people. They all have such fascinating things to see, especially about people like us! I wonder what our Pastor would say if he could see me now.\n\nMy German is coming along excellently, and I'm a much better person for it! It's so much fun to speak, especially due to my "German heritage."\n\nWork provides me with the best hotels and the best restaurants. But you know what I'm really craving? One of those pretzels that we used to get in Central Park. There's pretzels here, of course, but they aren't the same. They're too "artisan," I guess? I just want a cheap, warm pretzel from a cart.\n\nOr maybe it's not even the pretzel. Maybe I just want something that reminds me of you. I miss you so much. I can't wait to see you again! I understand that you won't be able to come visit, but I should be heading home for a bit soon! It depends how my next meeting goes. It's in this coffee shop that I really like. I know you like your coffee sweet, but their coffee is perfect when it's pure black. You'd probably hate it, honestly.\n\nI love you so much. Please, write back soon!"
USA.spyflavor.4.a: "Love, Siegfried"

USA.spyflavor.5.t: "Coffee Date"
USA.spyflavor.5.desc: "The mission was simple: first, Jacob was to speak with a German student about some of his... anti-Reich opinions. Second, he was ordered to drop off a small briefcase full of... something. He didn't even know himself; the CIA simply wanted it placed in a specific location, and he was happy to oblige.\n\nThe "dissident" didn't look like much. He was about eighteen or nineteen; barely an adult. He was short, with greasy hair and glasses. He carried himself confidently, while still looking around nervously. When he locked eyes with Jacob, he began to raise his hand in a wave, before thinking better of it and nodding towards a booth instead.\n\nAs the two men slid into their seats, Jacob grinned.\n\n"Guten Tag, Kröte."\n\nThe student's eyes widened as he heard the codeword. Without hesitation, he responded, as he had practiced countless times in the mirror.\n\n"Guten Tag, Frosch."\n\nThus, they began. They didn't exchange pleasantries, nor inquire about each other's days; they didn't do any of the things that may be expected in typical society. No, Jacob simply answered the student's questions- and he had a lot of them. Questions about America, questions about the Reich, questions about freedom, questions about foreign service. Jacob answered all of them- until it was his time to ask. The student gave him answers. Some answers were nothing; and some answers were everything. Jacob's skill at unraveling knots of secrets came in handy. He noticed that there were some words that were often repeated, or at least alluded to.\n\nFinally, Jacob paid for both of their meals (it was polite, after all) and stood up. He thanked the student before briskly walking out; it was time for the second part of his mission.\n\nIt went off without a hitch. He was able to enter the alley and drop off the briefcase without seeing another person; it was out of his hands now. While he walked, those three little words echoed in his mind still:"
USA.spyflavor.5.a: "Rot, Schwarz, Gold."

USA.spyflavor.6.t: "A Good Night's Sleep"
USA.spyflavor.6.desc: "Jacob would be lying if he said he missed home; here, in Germania, everything was new and interesting. He got to eat the best food, talk to the most interesting people, and sleep in the fanciest hotels. Most importantly, however, he was able to serve a greater purpose: fighting for freedom.\n\nIt was inside of one of these hotels that he now resided: working for the CIA had its benefits. As he lay down on the most comfortable bed he had ever been on, he dared to close his eyes- before feeling something cold and round pressed to his forehead. His eyes shot open, and he made eye contact with his assailant- a blue-eyed, blonde-haired man in a well-cut suit. The gun was a simple black Luger. The man opened his mouth and spoke to Jacob, in English.\n\n"Scream, and you're dead. Make a move, and you're dead. Tell me your name."\n\nJacob's German had been honed from a life of interest, a background of Yiddish, and years of intense study. As such, it was no surprise that his response was in German, an unspoken challenge to the blond man.\n\n"My name is Siegfried Köhler. Put down the gun."\n\nFor a moment, the blond man was startled- he hadn't been expecting the man to respond in German. Was it possible that he was wrong? Was it possible that this was just an ordinary German whom he had mistakenly accused? His resolve hardened: no, he had seen "Siegfried's" dealings. There was no way he was wrong.\n\nThe other man's moment of indecision was all it took for Jacob, however; In one fluid motion, he moved his head to the side, while grabbing the 1911 pistol stowed beneath his pillow. He pointed it at the man.\n\n"Now, it seems like we're in a predicament, aren't we. Tell me your name."\n\nThe man responded,"
USA.spyflavor.6.a: ""Kurt Friedrich.""

USA.spyflavor.7.t: "The Handshake"
USA.spyflavor.7.desc: "Both the American and the German made the realization at the exact same moment: neither the Luger, nor the 1911 had suppressors on them. The cold steel barrels that were pressed on both of their foreheads were just that- a barrel. There was nothing to dampen the sound.\n\n"If either one of us takes a shot, the entire hotel will know."\n\nThe German took a deep breath and nodded. Then he began to chuckle. His laugh was infectious, and Jacob felt himself struggling to contain his own mirth, before he finally gave in.\n\n"This is stupid. This is all so stupid."\n\nThe German doubled over in laughter, barely able to get words out.\n\n"Not just one of us forgetting to bring a suppressed weapon, but both of us? It's like something out of one of your shitty spy movies. I should have just stabbed you."\n\nJacob grinned.\n\n"You should have, but you didn't. Instead, now we're just two dumbasses pointing unsuppressed weapons at each other. Why don't you sit down? Neither one of us is going to shoot the other. Why don't we just talk? Like adults?"\n\nThe German smiled, nodded, and sat down on the bed next to Jacob. Jacob sat up, and for the first time, the two men were on the same level- both physically and in terms of threat. And it showed- they were able to talk as equals. Things were tense- of course they were. They were from opposing superpowers, of course. Through the night, the tension began to ebb away; the jokes came easier, the smiles more comfortably. They talked long into the night, until the morning sun's rays began to peek through the hotel's windows. Finally, Jacob outstretched his hand: a silent question being asked."

USA_IRCW_aid_iran_category_desc: "Once one of the few allies belonging to Germany in the Middle East, Iran has recently imploded into civil war following the death of its Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a largely unpopular figure following his overthrowing of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and establishment of his pro-German regime. As the instability of the region has been threatening to boil over since the beginning of the Oil Crisis, it seems only natural that with the death of its leader, the partisans of Iran have made their move for power.\n\nAmong these rebels moving against the government of Iran are the Democratic Republic of Iran, led by Karim Sanjabi, the Socialist Federation of Iran under Iraj Eskanderi, and the Baluchi Liberation Front, an independence movement in the south of the nation led by Sher Mohammed Marri, among others. Of course, there is also the remnants of the pro-German government holed out of the north of the nation.\n\nAs fresh arms flow into the region, and the anti-German alliance already shows cracks, it would seem as though it's in the best interest of the world powers to send aid the way of their preferred candidates."

### Events
USA_IR.1.t: "The Iranian Civil War"
USA_IR.1.d: "In recent years, we have seen Persia become a wide breeding ground for oppression and ruthless authoritarianism during the rule of Pahlavi. Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago.\n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."
USA_IR.1.a: "Yet another struggle for freedom is all we need."
USA_IR.2.t: "The Iranian Aid Bill"
USA_IR.2.d: "Just this morning, Congress passed the Iranian Aid Bill with an acceptable majority, giving us the power to send volunteers and military advisers to the National Front forces. Until our equipment can reach the Persian coast, we have invested $100 million to keep the Liberals fighting. Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible.\n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade. We cannot fail the public now."
USA_IR.2.a: "Quite the lending hand to a faraway land."
USA_IR.3.t: "Grand Strategy of the Iran War"
USA_IR.3.d: "Our generals are currently divided over our potential policy for the war ahead. Two options were given: we either send our own men into combat to directly influence the course of the war, or we supply the National Front from a distance and let the Iranians be the ones fighting.\n\nThe advisers supporting direct involvement argue that offensives will be carried out quicker and that results will be seen much faster. Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval.\n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom. We can trust that the Iranians are capable of using the latest technologies we have to offer. The introduction of our arsenal is enough of a boost for the National Front troops. The Germans and Japanese are less likely to intervene if we only send supplies. Critics believe this will produce a larger death toll and the war will be drawn out longer.\n\nWe either send troops and risk it all or we trust the National Front to take care of the job using our technology."
USA_IR.3.a: "Iranian men need to die for freedom."
USA_IR.3.b: "Men need to die for freedom."
USA_IR.4.t: "Long Term or Short Term?"
USA_IR.4.d: "Military plans are nearly complete, and high-ranking officers are again at a crossroads. This time, the U.S. must decide whether its soldiers will attempt a swift advance to end the war or prepare for the long haul war of attrition. If we send enough soldiers in to overwhelm the enemy, there is a clear chance the war would end once Tehran capitulates. However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally.\n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe.\n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us. It is a matter of offensive or defensive; risk or no risk. Time is not of the essence."
USA_IR.4.a: "We'll take a chance with this war."
USA_IR.4.b: "Prepare the trenches immediately."
USA_IR.6.t: "The Liberals Lose in Iran"
USA_IR.6.d: "An American soldier stands in the midst of the waiting party preparing to leave Iran. Looking up, helicopters whirr by, a helicopter following too far behind is blasted to pieces. It was the final moment of action he would ever see out of Iran. "The public won't be happy with this," he laments, remembering how his closest friend was shot in the head, left to die, as his division withdrew from the front lines. The two had become friends in a deep Georgia training camp seven years ago. Both had older brothers who faced hell in South Africa.\n\n"How could we just... give up on this war?"\n\nAmerican forces held time and time again, but any offensive they tried just couldn't break through the rough enemy defenses. Once the U.S. lost enough men, generals made the quick decision to pull out and leave the war solely to the Liberals. Not even a day after the last U.S. soldier left Iran did the National Front sign a peace agreement. The leaders of the movement were subsequently executed by firing squad.\n\nThe public did not greet the returning soldiers with the respect they were promised. Many were spat on and some were even attacked. Nevertheless, our soldiers did the best they could to promote freedom abroad, and those who made the ultimate sacrifice will be given a proud funeral. The fall of the Iranian National Front marks the end of any hope for democracy in the Middle East. The dream of liberty has escaped the hearts of Iranians, never to be seen again."
USA_IR.6.a: "Iran was simply a mistake."
USA_IR.7.t: "The Liberals Win in Iran"
USA_IR.7.d: "It is finally over. We have successfully lifted the Liberal faction above all its enemies, and the fascists and communists remaining are being dealt with as we speak. Though we suffered significant casualties, what matters is that we finally have a partner in the Middle East that we can count on. Negotiations with the new government have started and we believe they will continue promoting our cause as long as we help them rebuild.\n\nA handful of our soldiers remain in the country to subdue any rebel factions that could harm Iranian leadership. Since Tehran also suffered serious damage, our engineers chose to stay behind so that the city would be rebuilt. In accordance with the Iranian Aid Bill, we have also sent economic and industrial advisers to the new government.\n\nThe rebuilding of Iran will take time, but when it is complete, our sole ally in the Middle East will be even more formidable than it was before the war. The torch of liberty shines brighter than ever before in Asia."
USA_IR.7.a: "We can only hope it stays lit."





#################### CULTURE




 USA.culture.1.t: "Death of Joseph Kennedy"
 USA.culture.1.desc: "A spokesman for the Kennedy family reports today that former Democratic Party Icon Joseph P. Kennedy passed away in his Massachusetts home at 81. He is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nThe elder Kennedy leaves behind a complicated legacy. His success as patriarch of the Kennedy dynasty was substantial, as his sons John, Robert, and Edward all made names for themselves in the political sphere. Despite serious criticisms for his non-interventionist policy, both in economic and foreign policy, he surely influenced the course of Democratic politics over his life.\n\nKennedy was the source of much criticism in the aftermath of the Democratic presidencies of the 40's, which only increased after the failed intervention in England and the signing of the Akagi Accords.\n\nKennedy had spent the years after the war retired from public life, having lost his son Joe Jr. in a bombing raid over the Pacific, but he reemerged to help with his son's bid for the vice presidency. However, the elder Kennedy kept himself out of the public eye, due to widespread criticism of comments he made advocating détente with Germany to focus on confronting Japan, and refused to help with his son Robert's presidential run in 1964.\n\nRegardless of how the American people remember him, Kennedy left a lasting mark on the nation's history, and his family will most likely continue to have a major role in politics for the foreseeable future."
 USA.culture.1.a: "His dynasty lives on."

 USA.culture.2.t: "The Boys Are Coming Home"
 USA.culture.2.desc: "As the address from the White House ends, so too does the first major conflict between the U.S. and a major power for the first time in nearly two decades.\n\nThe housewife of a military man, having heard that her husband will, indeed, be coming home, screeches in delight - as her neighbor, having only received her flag for her deceased the day before, stares at the television in a broken torpor.\n\nCollege students put aside their protest placards and megaphones for the day, choosing instead the bottle and the blunt for a day basking in the fruit of their success - or the unstated delight that they will not be called up anytime soon. The draftees in boot camp continue to curse their fate, and their drill sergeants, but a tad quieter, relieved that their service might be a peaceful one.\n\nIn the Pentagon, planners quietly vacate their desks for a longer-than-usual smoke break, their immediate work mercifully concluded. Concluded, that is, until the inevitable orders come to prepare for the soldiers' return. And in the White House, the President receives another briefing, their thoughts unknowable beneath a facade of practiced calm.\n\nAcross America, the nation welcomes the first day after the South African War.

 USA.culture.3.desc: "It seemed as soon as the boat docked at the Norfolk, VA port that Jonathan Stafford, soldier of the 134th "Jayhawk" Plains Division, would finally find peace after years of turmoil in the South African War and his subsequent stay in the peace initiatives. He was born to a poor farming couple in central Kansas and learned to drive a tractor when he was only seven years old. His skill with a rifle came when he crossed the border into Arkansas and began hunting wild hogs to feed his mother and father. When he turned eighteen he was faced with a dilemma: either join the Army and provide his parents a substantial income, or stay on the farm for eternity. Once the recruiters arrived at the farm, Jonathan's parents would not see their son again for another six years.\n\nTraining came and went, and before he knew it, Jonathan's division was sent off to Port Elizabeth. The Jayhawk Division, organized in Kansas, was well-prepared for the lowly plains of South Africa, but mastering the terrain was only one step in the process of combat. Stafford himself was involved in several offensives against the Germans and pulled together several kills, almost being sent home from a bullet he got to the shoulder, but he recovered in time. Now, fighting against an invisible enemy to maintain stability within the Mandates, a rebel ambush almost landed him in the grave. Stafford was evacuated in time but he lost several fingers, meaning that, much to his chagrin, he had to return home.\n\nNow, Stafford was a very proud American, and he hoped the general public would hail him as a hero who fought for his country and for freedom in the middle of who-knows-where. To put it bluntly, he received the exact opposite: protesters spat on him, threw dirt in his face, and even tried to frame him for murder. Students from Kansas State found his address and attempted to set his parents' farm ablaze, but police arrested them before they could act. This whole welcome was possibly far more scarring than his experience in the war."

These stories, ranging from poems to novels, detailed the barbarism of plains warfare. Many described common heroics and regular combat against the opposing Germans. However, not one story had gained as much attention as Hal Moore's We Were Young Soldiers. A New York Times bestseller in its first three weeks of publication, the novel chronicles Colonel Hal Moore's adventures as a commander in 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.\n\n"The savanna was harsh, hot, and desperately in need of action. Laying in the bushes for hours on end was grueling, but if you were tired of being on the ground, the Germans were not afraid to shoot. Sometimes they'd shoot anyway. I couldn't imagine how frightened my men must have been."\n\nOne thrilling part of the novel focuses on Moore's successful gamble to ambush an important German position, and how it resulted in twenty German deaths and a hundred captured POWs. The superb commentary of the event was likened to that of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, and reviewers have considered it one of the greatest military novels of all-time. One newspaper argued that the novel is "the one military journal you must read before you die.""

Its crew, Andreas Bogenmann and Franz Teich, are helped in their day-to-day activities by the powerful artificial intelligence EPAC. However, as the film goes on, it becomes clear that EPAC has decided to kill the crew.\n\nIn a tense struggle, made all the more nerve-wracking by Kubrick's long takes and understated sound design, Bogenmann is able to deactivate EPAC, who mournfully sings "Stille Nacht" as his circuits are disconnected. Bogenmann then realizes that the mission of Entdeckung Eins is to investigate an alien monolith orbiting Jupiter. The monolith transports Bogenmann across space and time, transforming him into a bizarre space fetus floating beside Earth.\n\nAudiences have been divided over the film. Some call it meaningless drivel, while others have found it to be most enjoyable, especially when paired with certain substances.

Of how a US Air Force general, gone completely insane and thinking the Japanese were destroying America from within by destroying 'precious bodily fluids' with fluoride, could order a nuclear strike on them? To American audiences, the thought that someone could just order a nuclear attack on a whim was something that could only happen from Germania or Tokyo, not in the good ol' USA. The flailing efforts to recall the bombers, and the German revelation of a Doomsday Device that would kill all life on earth as the bombers head for Japan just further confounds the audience's expectations. The movie showed that everyone, from the unnamed yet all powerful and raving Nazi Führer and the over-ceremonial puppet Japanese Emperor were just as incompotent as any corrupt politican elected in the US, especially in the face of nuclear armageddon...\n\n...Yet, 'Dr. Strangelove' is much more than a surreal look at mid-20th Century fears of nuclear war. It will be recognized by future generations as a classic of filmmaking. Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail in everything from the camera work to the exact facial expressions of the actors on screen. The brilliant acting of Peter Sellers in three separate roles: as a British émigré RCAF officer who tries to restrain the American general, the unready and soft-spoken President of the US thrust into a diplomatic crisis, and the creepy and comedic Dr. Strangelove, a Russian scientist who has some crazy ideas of how to rebuild the US in the aftermath of the now inevitable nuclear war involving cross-breeding people with plants. The over the top and hammy acting of George C. Scott as he reveals just how the world was to end with American B-52's flying low over the Kanto Plains, with his arms stretched out and making sound effects with his mouth. The cowboy riding the bomb down like a bull at a Texas rodeo to obliterate a Japanese military base, and finally the montage of nuclear bombs exploding to the haunting 'Maybe' by The Ink Spots...\n\n...it is, perhaps, the perfect dark comedy: funny in the face of terror, horrifying despite the levity. It brings in stark contrast the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction to an audience that just didn't quite comprehend the fact that a nuclear war will be the last war. And it could all happen because of a mistake."\n\n-Chicago Tribune, 1964"

A rickety steamer carried them past vagabond corsairs and the Bering Sea's tempests, landing on Anchorage after President Dewey granted them safe haven within the US.

Billy is a poorly-trained soldier who has come to dislike war, refusing to fight for his country. During an Allied bombing of the city, his acquaintance and fellow soldier Roland Weary dies of infection and shortly before his demise, he blames his death on Billy. Billy escapes the slaughterhouse and the novel proceeds to his near-death experience in a plane crash, where he was "abducted by aliens". These aliens, the Tralfamadorians, taught Billy their outlook on life, death, and fate, causing Billy to become an orator.\n\nCritics condemned the disorderly structure of the book but praised its clear anti-war message. Many readers appreciated the way Vonnegut included his own war experiences in the novel, quickly making the book a bestseller. The book itself was printed in multiple European languages but it was banned throughout Europe shortly after its publication.\n\nThrough the book's anti-war message one can see Vonnegut's disdain for the Reich and the Japanese."

Seeing how the Fatherland neglected to print stories about life in the United States, citizens under the jackboot could only rely on their relatives for an accurate portrayal. It was uncommon for foreigners to contemplate whether there truly is poverty in the promised land of America.\n\nMichael Harrington's novel The Other America debuted in bookstores across the country today. The novel discusses the issues of poverty in the United States and exposes readers to the significant number of Americans living below the poverty line. Harrington claims that many poor residents live in social isolation and are not commonly seen by the middle and upper classes. He calls for politicians to take "immediate and remedial action" to rid the country of every aspect of poverty.\n\nCritics of the novel disagree with Harrington's socialist tendencies, but most readers agree with the call to action. The book has already gained influence on a number of politicians in the capital who want to create a better country for every citizen, rich or poor.

Then transport it, under armed guard, with motorcades, block traffic and more, to deliver it to the ship to take it on it's trip across the Atlantic. Then, when it does arrive in New York, load it in an armored van and take it to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and when it is finally displayed, station two Marines, each with loaded rifles, on either side to ensure no one gets near it.\n\nThe more interesting question, however, is why would you send one of the most famous paintings in the world to the US?\n\nWhen the French heard that their government was considering loaning the Mona Lisa to the US for a couple of months, there were protests and riots. The painting has been in the Louvre for so long, through war and catastrophe, an enduring symbol of French cultural history (even if it was taken from the Italians hundreds of years ago), and now it was being given to the Americans? What a travesty this is! To hell with diplomacy! This is an outrage that can never be lived down!\n\nBut for the 500,000 Americans, including the President, every member of the House of Representatives and Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Court, and many, many more average people, the image of the lady has captivated them. With her enigmatic smile expertly captured by Leonardo de Vinci, the Mona Lisa has captivated a nation and people that for so long was considered uncultured.

With the Oil War and hardships it brought, America's tastes have finally shifted in full towards fuel economy and cost.\n\nThe now-venerable Mustang would have suffered the same fate as its fellow burdensome beasts were it not for the haste of its parent company's engineers. Plans were made in Dearborn to accommodate the gasoline rations and reigning economic slump to their car's design: Lengths and widths were cut short, gas-guzzling V8s replaced with compact I4s, and frames modified to reduce noise and vibration as its dimensions shrink. Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today. Seemingly satisfied with this compromise between economy and style, men with means have gone out to purchase Ford's new-old car in droves.

The series has undergone numerous changes in both art style and content since their introduction to the viewing public in 1940, but MGM has promised to maintain the consistently high quality of comedy it is known for. With the venerable Chuck Jones of Warner Brother Cartoons' fame in charge of the reboot, observers believe the Big Five studio has every reason to be confident in their claims.\n\nRegardless of the details, fans both young and old have since expressed their ecstasy in seeing the duo's slapstick escapades every Saturday morning with bags of heartfelt mail delivered to MGM's post office box. The future seems bright for a centerpiece of an entire generation's childhoods, and it may just remain such for another for as long as it continues to run."

Both teams had swept their opponents in their league championship games and were set to face off in this year's World Series.\n\nThe 1969 Baltimore Orioles squad had been considered one of the greatest baseball teams in MLB history, led by slugger Frank Robinson and pitcher Jim Palmer as the team won 109 games and lost only 53. On the other hand, the Mets achieved their first-ever winning season this year, led by coach Yogi Berra and pitcher Nolan Ryan.\n\nThe mid-October matchup would go down as one of the most shocking upsets in the history of baseball. The talented Baltimore team routed the Mets 4-1 on October 11th, but the Mets stormed back and won the final four games of the championship, defeating the Orioles 5-3 tonight in front of 57,000 fans. The team was quickly dubbed the "Miracle Mets" for their outstanding play against a formidable rival. It is the Mets' first World Series pennant."

 USA.culture.25.t: "A New Genre Rises"
 USA.culture.25.desc: "For American observers, the Libyan interior, with the half-abandoned villages mottling dry plains and brush that roll for miles without end, strike similar to the long-gone days of their own Wild West. Much like the frontier, Libya is rife with outlaws and constabularies, saloons of sin and banks of marble, and poor settlers caught in the middle as they toil a miserable living out of sands streaked with blood and oil. Never in the present has there been a depiction of this mythical age truer than Italy's youngest province.\n\nItalian filmmaker Sergio Leone demonstrated his awareness of such when he released For a Few Dollars More late this year. Featuring up-and-coming Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood as a rough, tough-speaking mercenary, the movie brought new life to an old genre while introducing its own refreshing themes. Standoffs between lawmen and bandits in desolate mining towns were joined with the ambitions of laconic bounty hunters and long-held grudges, tied together in a captivating plot centered around a heist. Though the film depicted America's Old West, the conflicts it had shown resonated with the Italian pioneers seeking their fortunes in their country's new frontier.\n\nDespite less than stellar reception from film critics for its over-the-top violence and "campy" tone, the film nevertheless broke records by reaching $4 million in ticket sales in Italy by year's end. North America added an extra $14 million to the film's gross revenue, proving that there is a place for the now-termed "Spaghetti Western" in the Free World's silver screens. Already rumors abound of a sequel, and directors and studios hint of filming their own reimaginations of a bygone era in the very same savannahs that evinced its stories in the hearts and minds of millions."

 USA.culture.26.desc: "Hollywood took on the political wildfire of the Nixon Presidency this past weekend as the critically acclaimed film "All the President's Men" stormed theaters across the United States. Critics from the Chicago Sun-Times have regarded the movie as being "a brilliant showcasing of the depth of investigative journalism, as paranoia, self-doubt, and harassment dominate the cases of the heroes of the Washington Post." The movie soared to reach a cemented number one spot at the box office as Americans rushed to see the political thriller.\n\nDirector Alan J. Pakula provides the American audience a journey across the spheres of journalism, writing, and politics as the film looks into the journeys of renowned reporting duo Katharine Graham and David Halberstam as they take on the haunting shadows which peer over their every move. Together, the duo follows one step after another in the journey to unveil a secretive and dangerous conspiracy involving the White House administration, scaling all the way up to former President Richard Nixon himself, who, just two years ago, resigned from his office as President of the United States. Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same."\n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democratic Coalition have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States." Meanwhile, spokespersons within the National Progressive Coalition have stated their "appreciation within Graham, Halberstam, and Pakula's work." Nevertheless, despite political experts' criticism, the American audience has driven in scores to theaters across the country to enjoy the "film of the decade," as some have called it."

Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling crime novel of the same name, "The Godfather" tells the story of the Corleone family, of New York City's most powerful organized crime syndicates. Its don, Vito Corleone, is an honorable and respected Sicilian immigrant. His position among New York's Five Families, though, is being threatened by the growing heroin trade. This conflict spirals into a bloody gang war, which claims Sonny, Vito's eldest child. After Vito promises to end the war, his second son, Michael, a veteran of Scotland, begins to take control of the Corleone empire. In 1955, Vito dies, and Michael exacts his revenge on the Five Families in a vicious series of assassinations, establishing his status as the new Godfather of the Mafia.\n\n"The Godfather" has garnered rave reviews. Critics around the country are praising the performances of the legendary Marlon Brando as Vito, and the budding young Al Pacino as Michael. Others have acclaimed the score, editing, and the themes of immigration and family, seeing it as a parable for America's complicated relationship to Italy. Many are already calling "The Godfather" the best film of 1972. It would seem that Mr. Coppola has made Hollywood an offer it can't refuse..."

It's bizarre, profane, provocative, and a gauntlet thrown onto the table of American literature.\n\nInspired by Kesey's work as a psychiatric orderly in Menlo Park, California, the novel follows one Randle McMurphy. McMurphy, a veteran of Scotland and proud street brawler, is sentenced to time in a psychiatric hospital for battery and illicit gambling. There, he meets a number of characters, including the novel's narrator, "Chief" Bromden, and the tyrannical head nurse, Nurse Ratched. Over the course of the novel, McMurphy challenges Ratched's rule, standing up for himself and the other patients in the ward. He is rewarded for this with a lobotomy, courtesy of Ratched. The novel ends with Bromden smothering McMurphy in an act of mercy, before escaping to freedom.\n\n"Cuckoo's Nest" has already garnered its fair share of accolades and controversy alike.

Enough was enough, they said: America must leave [USA_central_africa_ongoing] Africa immediately. War was good for absolutely nothing but the pockets of Death's business-suited merchants, and neither rhetoric nor propaganda can sway their commitment to peace and love for all men. So with their long flowing hair and picket signs and slogans, they packed Wall and Broad Streets by the thousands to profess their unconditional demands.\n\nThe city's working men disagreed. Among their most vocal is Peter J. Brennan, President of an alliance of New York's largest construction and engineering unions. To a man he and his fellow unionmen agreed: America had a moral obligation to protect democracy from fascism's encroachments not just at home, but also abroad. Dissent from the war effort was tantamount to treason. So with their hard hats, Old Glories and steel-toed boots, two hundred construction workers coalesced into a counter-protest in Federal Hall to profess their unconditional patriotism.\n\nAll that kept a semblance of order was a thin, shaky border of policemen sandwiched between two raucuous mobs. And when it broke -- or opened wide as does a gatekeeper does when bribed -- order had collapsed into bouts of naked assault. Hippies and hard hats brawled each other out until they couldn't anymore, while a broad swathe of New York lay sacrificed as collateral damage. It took the city two hours to rein both in, but by then more than seventy people and untold millions in property damage had fallen victim to one of the worst riots since the Civil War.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] is expected to make an announcement to ameliorate tensions lingering from the "Hard Hat Riot", though whether or not it can succeed in doing so remains to be seen."

Cash had several meetings with former President Nixon in the early 60s about prison reform, and has expressed interest in meeting with President [GetPresidentLastName] as well. The album's lyrics reflect the harsh and alienating conditions of prison life and the yearning of prisoners to break free and return to their loved ones.\n\nThis album may have reinvigorated Cash's previously ailing career, and Columbia Records has suggested that a future live album might be recorded at San Quentin State Prison.

The album has risen to #2 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums nationwide, an absolutely meteoric rise for any musical group, let alone a bunch of relative newcomers to the recording industry.\n\nIt seems that the Beach Boys were able to capture that California mythos and encapsulate it in a record, with their carefree and fun-loving lyrics about surfing, the beaches of LA, and the girls that inhabit them. The American people are positively enchanted by it, and people are scrambling to get their hands on singles and LPs as soon as the record stores have them in stock.

Their celebrity has reached a fever pitch, with legions of devoted fans following the surf rock band's every move. All their concerts have been played to sold-out stadiums packed with screaming fans, they constantly perform on variety shows like The Ed Sullivan Show, any public appearance is followed by a swarm of paparazzi, and their every action is chronicled by dozens of fanzines.

However, the singers are still the Beach Boys as always, and their vocal arrangements have become even more elaborate and layered. Critics are already making comparisons to Phil Spector, a music producer whose "Wall of Sound" style is immensely influential on Beach Boys frontrunner Brian Wilson.\n\nAlthough critics are split as to whether the album was a failed experiment or a bold new step for music, many of the fans have taken to it eagerly nonetheless.

There are string sections, banjos, bass harmonicas, recordings of bleating goats, slide whistles, harpsichords, theremins, and more, which combine to make a truly surreal symphonic experience. The rhythms and lyrics bring together folk songs, tone poems, classic Americana, national introspection on our country's sordid past, spiritual epiphanies, and the intertwine of the body and soul!\n\nAt least, that's what some say. Others deride the album as a self-aggrandizing catastrophe made by someone high on LSD and delusions of grandeur. The melodies are muddled and chaotic, and the lyrics range from kitschy ("Vege-tables") to downright nonsensical ("Cabinessence").

Also in attendance were Brian's pregnant wife Marilyn, singer Mark Lindsay of the Raiders, and Melcher's mother, movie star Doris Day. During the night of March 8-9th, an unidentified group of people entered the property on foot after cutting the phone lines. Doris Day was leaving the party in her car and must have seen them; the car's front door was open and she was shot four times in the abdomen. The group then gained access to the front door through an open window and brought all the house's inhabitants to the living room. Brian Wilson and Melcher were stabbed multiple times to death, while Marilyn and Lindsay were found shot dead on the back porch, likely attempting to flee. Dennis Wilson's body was far more heinously killed compared to the others: he was shot in both his knees, his abdomen was stabbed over four dozen times, and his face was severely disfigured by blunt trauma. The words "thief" and "pig" were written in blood on the living room walls.\n\nThe only survivor of the event was Mike Love, who endured half a dozen knife wounds and being shot in the shoulder before passing out from blood loss.

Wilson, hoping to aid Manson's dream of becoming a published folk musician, introduced him to Melcher, but they had a falling out due to Manson's violent and erratic behavior. Manson was already in LAPD custody for an unrelated petty crime when he was charged. His cult of followers, colloquially known as his "Family," earlier caught the FBI's attention for their leader's support of Francis Parker Yockey and preaching a bizarre synthesis of messianic apocalypticism and white supremacy. When questioned if his beliefs motivated the crime, Manson claimed that the murders were "all personal" and unrelated to his plans to "Wake the World"-his prophesied race war with its name taken from a Beach Boys song. According to Manson, Wilson adapted the lyrics to his song "Cease to Exist" without crediting him and deserved retribution.\n\nA court date is set, and a conviction is all but guaranteed due to band member Mike Love's agreement to testify after emerging from a coma last week.

Eli wasn't entirely sure how much of this extraordinary performance was imagined, but he felt every little twist and riff ripple in his head and in his soul.\n\nJimi switched from somber, more connected-feeling chords into wild riffs and solos seemingly on a whim. Eli's eyes remained locked on the guitarist, and the rest of the world seemed to just melt away in whorls of color. Finally, it seemed like the hard and fast playing was beginning to morph into something more akin to what Eli knew and loved. Eli prayed that the Star and Stripes he saw in his mind's eye would never leave. He loved his country, he loved this place, and he hoped he would never have to leave."

Bennett replied, passing a copy of the bill to one of his aides.\n\n[GetPresidentLastName] nodded, "How soon can you get this past the Senate?"\n\n"Today or tomorrow, there are a few holdouts, but not enough to matter."\n\n"Well then," the President offered the Senator a hand. "It has been a pleasure working with you, Senator."\n\nBennett took the hand, "Mine as well, [GetPresidentHonorific] President, despite our differences."\n\n"I'll be seeing the Chairman later today. Any recommendations?"\n\n"I would focus on curtailing inflation, though I'm sure many of our more liberal friends would push for a more aggressive monetary policy," Bennett replied evenly.

Bennett quipped. "But our Silver reserves aren't getting any bigger, and demand isn't getting any lower. If you don't tackle this crisis, Romney might pick up where I left off."\n\nJohnson scowled, bypassing Muskie to bring every inch of his frame to bear as he towered over Bennett, his face mere inches away. "Well, then. Senator, if you have a solution, I'll be glad to hear it."\n\nBennett didn't budge, his face expressionless as he stood eye to eye with the President. "I'm sure Fowler has briefed you on the outlines-"\n\n"I know what Fowler said, Senator." Johnson leaned in closer, "I want to know what you have to say."\n\n"A Bill, [GetPresidentHonorific] President, to give you the authority to direct the Treasury to suspend the convertibility of the dollar into silver. Free-float the dollar, let the Fed put more money into circulation.

I hope you will remember that and the countless signs of support I provided you over these past few years.

With your devotion to committee work and political courage in all aspects of congressional business, it was clear you were destined for greatness. Your focus not merely on sectional issues but on issues of broad, national importance deeply impressed the likes of Mr. Rayburn and Mr. Vinson, who took it upon themselves to guide and mentor you. The late President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to know and appreciate your dedication and ability. Even after you moved from the House to the Senate, I also held you in deep respect and counted you as a close friend.\n\nI have no doubt you will use your abilities for the betterment of our nation. You have always been a hard driver devoted to the betterment and welfare of the people. At a time of great disunity, tragedy, and upheaval, this country needs those qualities more than ever before. You will need to rely on all your skill and ability to win the passage of progressive legislation that can transform this country and complete the work of Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Kefauver.\n\nYou do not need any further advice from me on these matters.

Many in the leadership considered you a paragon of stability and a man dedicated to upholding the traditions of the Senate.\n\nWhile there are many matters of policy that we do not agree on, I hope you will continue to serve with decency and dignity over your next few years in the White House. These qualities will be essential if America is to live up to the promises of its founding documents and serve as a leader to the larger world. Already, many have grown disillusioned and alienated with our society.

Would he think we'd done enough to achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves? Or would he look across our nation's capital, with all its signs of unmet promise, and weep?\n\nBoth of us know the answers to those questions. Despite the great labors of brave men, living and dead, gross inequalities persist. Millions labor with no promise for liberation and no hope for equal treatment under the law. The toll of this suffering is evident in every American town and in the faces of its most disposed citizens. It is apparent in every alleyway, every prison cell, and every segregated business.\n\nI am proud of the work that President Nixon, Kennedy, and I contributed to the Civil Rights Act of [?USA.USA_CRA_year].

I wasn't able to go to high school because I had to work to support my mother and my siblings, first doing the newspaper routes and then odd jobs at Western Union. I felt alone, desolate. I never thought I'd amount to anything and that this world would swallow me up like it had so many other people in my life. Still, I told myself I had to try for my family. I found a job as an errand boy at a law office and over the course of many long, hard years built up the knowledge I needed to pass the bar. A decade later, I was elected to Congress.\n\nIt would be foolish to say that my own experiences mean that I have any sense of the agony that you are surely going through now. Every tragedy is unique in the pain it inflicts. The wounds remain with us for our entire lives, unseen by the outside world. But those same pains serve as a reminder of our obligations to the people we have lost and those who remain with us.\n\nYour brother was a good man. He was one of the most decent men to have graced the halls of Congress in my entire career there. I admired him deeply for the passion with which he pursued the issues important to him and the idealism with which he viewed our country. The hole he leaves behind cannot ever be filled.\n\nBut we must endure in spite of that. We must press forward to give this country hope again, to offer it some prospect of improvement. There are millions across this country who still live in dire poverty, who are deprived access to basic accommodations, and who live under the constant threat of violence. Even as we grieve, we must find some way to ease their suffering.\n\nI know you will make your brother proud. Godspeed,"

You will be worse than Nixon, worse than Hoover, and your legacy will be one of pain and suffering.

We hold very different visions of what the future of America looks like. I am not sure I can offer you much that you will find useful or relevant. Still, I wanted to provide you with a few reflections.\n\nFirst, know that there will be trying moments over the next eight years. Allies will abandon you. Foes will attack. The press will look for any opportunity to smear your name and there will be days that you question everything you held to be true. If you are intent on following through on your agenda, it is vital that you find some external source of strength.\n\nSecond, I advise you to keep mindful of the political truism that, "campaigning is easy, governing is hard." Our nation is one plagued by deep divisions over a variety of issues. Inflaming public passion can allow for momentary successes but if you work too quickly, too fast, and too uncompromisingly, you risk igniting flames that you will struggle to control.\n\nFinally, remember that Washington is not without its virtues. The people here are good, decent people—even if they disagree on occasion with the Commander-in-Chief. While it can be tempting to want to bring in new people who have bought in wholly your political program, long-standing knowledge and expertise do come in handy.

Between sunset tonight and sunrise, the German Empire would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation.

While we are not members of the same party (or indeed the same coalition), I cannot help but be heartened by the passion you demonstrate for our country.\n\nKeep fighting the good fight and don't let yourself be talked into doing things you don't want to do.

 USA.succession_letters.29.desc: "Mrs. Kirkpatrick,\n\nWhen I first pursued this office four years ago, it was motivated by a fear that the failures of the welfare state over the previous decade would serve as stimulus for, and rationale of, a conservative reaction against it. Exaggerating the amount of social innovation attempted and mistaking activist promises for operational plans, a new generation of disappointed liberals would come to adopt a national policy of timidity in the face of the problems we face.\n\nI regret to say that this fear has been borne out by the rise of you and other figures who, whatever your personal predilections, are indicative of a move of public intellectuals toward pessimistic conservatism. Indeed, I know of no better way to differentiate the political programs of Lyndon B. Johnson—who understood the urgent crisis facing America's poor—than your own. In place of ambition, you offer moderation. Instead of guaranteeing access to aid and accomodations, you have spoken at length of supposed waste and fraud by "able-bodied lazy persons." This new type of conservative thought will do nothing to resolve the inequities at the heart of our system, nor will it prove satisfactory for the millions of Americans who remain vulnerable to economic disruption.\n\nThe only innovation in your program appears to be on matters of foreign policy—which to me appears to be barbarism in the worst sense of the word. Instead of laboring in pursuit of global human emancipation from tyranny, you appear intent on expanding upon it. You would spend the next four years pillaging and looting the nations of this Earth to enable American supremacy. While I can support wars of necessity to oppose the direct manifestations of totalitarianism, your proposals—cloaked in insistent academic language and promises of benevolent autocracy—are imperialism.\n\nI have few hopes for the next few years and worry greatly that whoever succeeds you will trot further down a reactionary path. I will do what I can outside the presidency to restrain these impulses."

Far too long, industry has been neglected in this country and I am happy you are pursuing new ways to bring them to the table for the betterment of all Americans. I am likewise heartened by your "Concerned Citizens Movement" as it seems an opportunity for the people to involve themselves in their elected government.\n\nHowever, as you act, I would advise you to remain aware of the constitutional limitations on the federal government and its tradition of deference to the States. Contrary to propaganda you see in the press, no region of this country is against any particular group or class of citizens. All of our states work, in their own ways, to fight for the betterment of all their citizens. I did this as Governor of Alabama and I know these efforts have been continued over the last eight years. This is as our forefathers intended, having created a framework that preserves individual liberty by preserving certain authorities for the States and others for the national government.\n\nI am sure you will do your part to see that we remain a nation united in peace, retaining individual rights and liberties in opposition to those who would seek to end our great American experiment.

While I have done nothing but pursue my understanding of the national interest, you promoted all manner of discouraging propaganda that smeared myself and my allies as being against the interests of the Black man. As I said at the time, the South does not oppose the advancement of the race and I, myself, have been deeply involved in improving their condition through the creation of universities and other centers of learning for them while removing thugs and criminals from their communities.\n\nFor the good of the country, it is this very issue that I hope to address now. While you may have won the presidency, many patriotic Americans were deeply alienated by the tenor of the race and the issues which you promoted. They see you as seeking to undermine the checks and balances within the framework of our governmental system, to blur the distinction between local, state, and national affairs. Efforts are already being made within these former two authorities to protect against the dangers opposed by the latter.\n\nI implore you to seek a conciliatory approach to those who did not support your candidacy. There is much good that you can do for the development and betterment of our people and their cities, but it cannot be conducted in a way that fosters destructive centralism or undermines our freedom and liberties.\n\nAs Henry G. Bohn wrote, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." I will pray that you will accept this fact before our nation must travel down this road itself."

As overreaching as your view of federal authority is, I do not believe that you act out of malice. You are merely beholden to urban activist elements within your party. These groups, infiltrated as they are by lawbreakers and pro-communist elements, would see us eliminate the liberties granted to the states in the name of "progress."\n\nI advise you to look beyond these voices to the nation as a whole.

   USA.epilogue.1.t: "Lost and Forgotten"
   USA.epilogue.1.desc: "In truth, he had only decided to do this on a whim, but there he was, wandering in the city center all by himself. He had begun this walk without much of a sense of purpose or direction. It was nice to be out and about in the town, nice to see happy faces again—actual, warm, smiles, ones that said hello without malice. These were people who actually respected what he did for his country, and he soaked up every bit of praise he gave them. If he was being honest, though, that wasn't really why he was here.\n\nAll along the crowded street were columns of people just waiting to see him, but a similar pattern emerged. Middle-aged men and women—most on the older side, white—were coming up to him, shaking his hand politely, and calling him Mr. President. They were apologizing profusely, always saying sorry, telling him how unfairly people in this country had treated him.\n\nHe didn't quite know why. This left him angry at first, then dejected, then depressed. George Wallace knew that he was popular in Alabama, of course. No one would doubt that. But the way the folks on the street spoke was as if he was dead and buried and they were paying their respects.\n\nNo one feels sorry for someone on the rise, someone who still has a long way to go. He didn't need their sympathy. They acted as though he needed their support. A stray thought found its way into his head: Did former Presidents always become irrelevant so quickly?\n\nOf course Wallace was aware of just how unpopular he was nationally, but what made it worse was that seemingly everyone in the Nationalist Party wanted to forget about him. This won't do, he thought, but it isn't too late. As he continued walking along the streets, the only thing he could think about was how he could secure his legacy, his influence."

I would like to begin by asking Mr. Wallace how it is possible that an anonymous poll of over one hundred NPP lawmakers reveals there is, quote, "little to no interest in Mr. Wallace having any role in active politics again."\n\nMR. WALLACE: Personally, I wouldn't put much stock in these anonymous polls. People can say anything they like, you know, and the pollsters can spout gibberish.\n\nMR. BUCKLEY: But Mr. Wallace, can you name a single active NPP lawmaker outside the South who you can confidently say supports you?\n\nMR. WALLACE: I—well, does it matter? Even if they don't say it in public, you and I both know they share my views. I'm as strong a supporter of states' rights as anyone else in the party, even stronger—\n\nMR. BUCKLEY: But a state's right to what, Mr. Wallace? You are a man who is intent on multiplying the functions of government on every other issue. Your policies make it clear you are no conservative. It is suspicious that you invoke this principle of states' rights on only one issue: race.\n\nMR. WALLACE: Now wait there, Mr. Buckley. Let me finish. You're trying to make this only about race. It isn't. What's more important is that the states should decide these matters for themselves, without federal meddling.\n\nMR. BUCKLEY: Mr. Wallace, do you realize just how unpopular your position is within your own party? The fact that most of the NPP has moved beyond you is no surprise. I will be blunt: you use states' rights only to defend your oppression against the Negro."

As he continued, Walllace noticed that the young man was clearly reading from a printed script. "Now, I'm sure you're aware of Phyllis Schlafly's meteoric rise in the polls. I have two questions. First, what are your views on Schlafy's recent polling performances? Also, have you spoken to her recently?"\n\nWallace blinked once, then twice, staring the journalist in the face. "No, I wasn't aware she was doing so well. I will say that America needs candidates like her and that she has my full and total support. But no, I haven't spoken to her in the last few months."\n\nThe journalist continued jotting down notes for a few seconds after Wallace ended: the former President interjected. "Say, son, why are you asking these questions?"\n\n"Oh, it's just because Mrs. Schlafly wants absolutely nothing to do with you, so we're tryin'to see what you have to say about her."\n\nLong after the journalist left, the incident remained in Wallace's mind.

   USA.epilogue.4.t: "Consequences"
   USA.epilogue.4.desc: "It was three in the morning on a Thursday, and George Wallace was standing in his yard, blinking sleep from blood-shot eyes. Ordinarily, he wouldn't be out here at this awful hour. He hadn't planned to be standing in his yard right now either, and indeed he had been sleeping peacefully with his wife beside him twenty minutes prior. For once, there had been no nightmares, no dreams at all - just rest. He cherished the few times he got that lucky nowadays.\n\nBut it's hard to sleep when a policeman raps on your door, and even harder when he tells you that there's a bomb in your basement.\n\nSo here they were, dressed in their night clothes like two particularly solid ghosts, Lurleen's arms wrapped around him as firefighters combed through their house. There would be no bomb, he knew. Goddamn hippies had done it before, calling in these evil threats through payphones, knowing that they'd make his life just a bit harder. He wasn't even President anymore. Why couldn't they just leave him alone?\n\nStupid question. He knew why. Because some silly Arkansas bumpkin couldn't keep their fucking finger off the trigger, because Orval Goddamn Faubus had the IQ of a potted plant... and because it had been his order that put them there. Because it was his fault. He could blame everyone else in the state when he was in front of the cameras, but he knew just as well as everyone who the burden fell on.\n\nOutwardly, George Wallace's face remained a mask of stoicness. Inwardly, though, a wall caved in. If he wanted to salvage his legacy, to soothe his conscience, to quell the demons he'd let loose, to get a good night's sleep again, he'd have to face what he'd done."

   USA.epilogue.5.desc: "The first trickle of doubt in George Wallace's mind started when a rock sailed through the protest signs, over the picket line, and into the bulletproof window of the limousine. It bounced off with a terrific crack, jolting him in his seat and forcing a gasp from Lurleen. Quickly, he turned to the crowd, searching for the perpetrator, but whoever it was had disappeared into the sea of angry faces and obscene gestures that faced him. He slumped back down with a sigh, resting his head in one hand. A "reconciliatory visit", his secretary had called it. Anyone else would call it an apology.\n\nThe state car pulled to a stop in front of the house of one Mrs. Louisa Brooks, followed by a throng of protestors, journalists, cameramen, and passer-by caught up in the commotion. Wallace slid out of the car, black shoes tapping against cracked pavement as he passed the waist-high chain-link fence, made his way up the asphalt path, and came to a stop before her. He was smoldering - not just from the Arkansas heat, but from the deadly stare coming from the woman in front of him. He cleared his throat and the crowd fell silent, straining to hear what would happen next. "Mrs. Brooks, ah..." he started. A high-pitched whistle from one heckler or another stung his ears and he shifted unsteadily. "I... came here today to, ah..."\n\n"A year ago, you killed my son. Because he was Black and tried to go to a good school." Brooks cut him off, shoving a finger squarely in his chest. "I pray to God that you die with even half the pain your soldiers brought on him. Don't even start with your..."\n\nThe crowd roared in furious approval, drowning the teary-eyed mother's tirade out amid a wave of vitriol. Amidst the resurgent wave of debris and jeers raining down on the two of them, George Wallace found that, for the first time he could remember, he couldn't think of anything to say."

   USA.epilogue.8.desc: "Former Pres. Robert F. Kennedy made his first official post White House appearance this evening, joining his wife, Ethel Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy at a showing of the musical "Mass". The musical, commissioned by Jackie, is based on the Tridentine Mass of the Catholic Church, featuring liturgical passages sung mostly in Latin, though the "Sanctus" includes portions in Hebrew.\n\nUpon his entrance to the Theater, Kennedy was met with a standing ovation by the audience, continuing until Kennedy had found his seat. Kennedy was visibly shaken by the performance, tearing up upon the conclusion of the show. Kennedy was invited to give a speech on the stage, in which he praised the actors for their performance, commenting that "he hadn't seen such a wonderful rendition of the Mass in 40 years".\n\nAfter leaving the Theatre, Kennedy made a small statement to reporters, saying he had wanted a more official first appearance but that "his wife convinced him to go." He thanked Jackie for the invitation, saying it was "the best possible way to start off his new retirement."\n\nKennedy's approval ratings remain high, especially amongst Democrats and Progressives, who continue to praise his administration's role in combating segregation and poverty. Many African American groups have commented on his administration's great leaps in racial justice, with some backers reportingly nicknaming him the "New Lincoln." Kennedy's future activities are still a mystery, though rumors have continued to circle on his other family members' ambition for the White House."

He looked at the fireplace, staring at the last Photo of Jack he had.\n\nHe'd failed Jack. He'd not just failed Jack, but failed the desperate people across America, who saw in him as their only chance to right the ills that plague America. He'd failed all of them, and now there was nothing he had to do; there was no next step for him. For 20 years, he'd followed the path laid out to him by God, aiding his brother as campaign adviser and senator, then fighting to secure his legacy as President. Yet now, there were no wars to fight, no hand to shake, no chances to help. He was lost, stuck in this old house, with no way to move on.\n\nHe looked at the photo once more, Jack's friendly eyes staring back at him, so full of joy. He'd want him to move on, he knew that. He'd tell him to see it as an opportunity, a chance to do something new with his life. But He could see no pathway forward, no door to a new horizon.

Jack Kennedy and the Kennedy family, details his life from his childhood to his time as President.\n\nThe book starts on his childhood, detailing his mother's impact on his faith and his friendship with his siblings. Special focus is given to his time in London during his father's time as ambassador to the United Kingdom. From here, the biography reportedly details his time as his brother's campaign advisor, his time in the Senate, and his eventual run for President.\n\nThe most anticipated part of the novel is expected to be his reflection on his time in the presidency. Kennedy's time in the White House was a notoriously unstable one, helping the nation heal from Nixon while dealing with domestic ills and foreign conflicts such as the West African and Indonesian War. Kennedy's reflections on his actions during this period are sure to be a selling point of the new memoirs.\n\nYet rumors abound that Kennedy's days in the political arena are not done yet. With his brother's swift movement up the hierarchy of the senate, it seems increasingly likely that Ted Kennedy looks to the Presidency as his next goal. Robert's involvement in such a campaign is seen to be an absolute certainty. But these are all passing rumors, and no official response has been given by Ted Kennedy on these."

Through a pointless act of violence, a man's life was snuffed out, ended far too soon. The assassin thought he was doing God's work, protecting the world from an evil zealot. Yet I ask you, what has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by an assassin's bullet. A sniper is only a coward, not a hero. A man stricken down does end his cause, it strengthens it. The next generation looks to that martyr and sees a world that could be, a world they could make themselves.\n\nMy time as head of his movement is over, the next generation must set themselves to build the world my brother dreamed of. A world Martin Luther King Jr Dreamed of. A fairer future, built upon the sacrifices of the old. Jack Kennedy's sacrifice must not remain as just a tragedy, it must be a rallying cry, a name upon which a better America is built."\n\nFollowing Robert's speech, Ted Kennedy was invited to give the next remarks, thanking his brother for his service before launching into his own speech.

He checked that the other drawers were not broken. Then he struggled over that bottom left side drawer again for another minute, which did not work.\n\nFinally he physically pulled out the drawer and was pushed back into his seat by the force as it came free. Looking inside, he saw a lot of documents written in his predecessor's hand, including a piece of paper in the Presidential letterhead.\n\nThurmond read it more closely. It seemed to be a note to Kennedy's successor as President. He knew that Bobby Kennedy hadn't made any complete plans on the matter, so it came as no surprise to him that there was no name next to the word "Dear" at the top of the note. But the rest of it struck Thurmond as few things did.\n\n"If you are reading this, I am out of office. I may be dead or just retired." Some of it was scribbled out. "You can be certain that I have every faith that you will do right by the American people and fulfill the legacy I left behind." More things were scratched out below it, and what was left was that same uplifting type of talk.\n\nStrom Thurmond sat back down and shook his head. He had never liked Bobby Kennedy, but what man would not feel pity seeing something like this? After a few seconds in quiet grief, wherein a slight twinge of something akin to guilt was replaced with an increasing sense of responsibility, Thurmond resolved himself.

However, as I have stated beforehand, I am deeply sorry for your loss. I pray that the scourge of violence that has tormented us for far too long may be quickly banished from our Nation.\n\nThere is no way that I can ever know what you have gone through, to have been so cruelly deprived of your husband so long before his time.

He was home.\n\nThe former President slumped into his leather chair, staring at the splashes of orange and purple lining the horizon. The porch beneath him trembled and cracked, having withered away slowly as it stood the test of time. In his own absence, Johnson thought, the ranch had been worn down. It made him reflect on the past for only a moment before he realized that, in the absence of the presidency, politics, and power, he, too, had become worn down.\n\nDick wasn't careful enough. He stuck his nose in the NPP's ass and was hit with the smell of horse shit, nearly sinking the coalition in the process. Then, Jack got his head blown off, and everyone shed some goddamned tears for him. Johnson was there to heal the nation, make America a beacon of hope, and build a Great Society. All that, just to get replaced by some fucking idiot. Johnson scoffed and instinctively reached for a cigarette and a lighter.\n\nLighting it, the tip glowed orange as he inhaled.

Looking down, he squinted as the number on the scale hit him: 235. Johnson slowly released a tired sigh and, without a second thought, made his way to the living room.\n\nWalter Cronkite waited patiently on one of the couches, a small notepad resting in his lap. The ranch was a nice place with its welcoming interior and comfortable furniture. It had a history, as if the farmstead was a relic from the days of Texan independence.

A faithful man had to go out to the world and bring the word to it. To live how others lived, to see what they saw, and to understand what they understood. Only then would he see all of God's creation, and only then could he bring people down the righteous path.\n\nJust like the man who left his business and longtime home to go to Washington and the nation, this elder statesman would see the rest of the free world he had a hand in shaping. The Bennetts would not be serving the nation or the Church or any higher cause. Only to see the people he had brought together, brought up as equals, and united behind a single idea:"

  # Harrington Loss 72
   USA.epilogue.22.t: "Publisher's Notice"
   USA.epilogue.22.desc: "EXCLUSIVE:\n\nFmr. President Michael Harrington has announced his new book, The Poverty Problem, to be released sometime later this year by Simon & Schuster. Summarized as "a deep dive into the state of the American poor", the book has been Harrington's primary work ever since he left office this January. Unlike many of Harrington's academic works prior to his administration, many expect the book to weave the former President's own policy which he planned for his second term in with his usual writing style. The most outlandish rumors say that some personal stories from his time in the White House may be included as a dig at the political opponents which sank his re-election bid.\n\nHarrington, for his part, has not commented publicly on the planned outline of his next work, nor has he made any public intention of running again for any office. If he has chosen a writer's path for the next stage of his career, he certainly won't be subject to the financial woes which many authors have - should public interest in the work be indicative of anything, Michael Harrington's The Poverty Problem will have no trouble flying up the best-seller's list come the holiday season."

  # MCS Loss 72
   USA.epilogue.23.t: "Reflection"
   USA.epilogue.23.desc: "The hand of the clock of the wall clicked past 11, lit dimly by the yellow glow of a reading lamp. The ticking of time and the occasional flutter of a turning page were the only sounds to disturb the silence that made up Margaret Chase Smith's Skowhegan home. It was a cozy quiet, she idly thought. A good atmosphere for thinking.\n\nWhat was left for a former President to do? No husband, no children, no office to hold, no constituents to answer to. It had been decades since she was this idle, and she no longer knew what to do with all this free time she found herself with. It was almost uncomfortable to be this comfortable, somehow. Occasionally inspiration would strike her, and she would write a chapter or two of a memoir she had half-outlined in her mind, or maybe she would write the first few sentences of a letter to one think tank or another which interested her. Always, though, she'd throw out the paper.\n\nIt wasn't that the prospect of these weren't of any value to her. It was that they seemed like such a step down. A memoir was practically waving a flag to say she was washed up, a think tank seemed so minor. And, of course, no elected office would do besides the Oval Office - and, despite her far-flung dreams, she knew that wasn't happening. So what was there?\n\nA speaking tour? Academia? Lobbying? She sighed as she slid a bookmark into the pages of her book, putting it aside as she stood. Her back was sorer than ever these days, her joints a bit stiffer. Yes, rest would do her good. God knew she deserved it."
   USA.epilogue.23.a: "With a click, the home plunged into darkness."

   USA.epilogue.24.t: "Mistakes Were Made"
   USA.epilogue.24.desc: "What had Margaret Chase Smith done?\n\nThere was the radio again, blaring the latest news out of Washington, more dire than she'd ever heard it. Nevermind what she had done, what were those idiots doing? Blind, dangerous, extreme idiots, dogs who had finally caught the car and didn't know what to do with it. Or maybe they did. She didn't know which one of those prospects scared her more. How could the voters have been so blind, so stupid, so downright reactionary to think that she was worse than [get.President]? No, her presidency didn't go to plan, but did that really warrant this?\n\n...well, did it?\n\nIt filled her with dread - no, not dread, guilt - to think that she'd been so incompetent as to drive the voters to this. It filled her with shame to think that she could be the harbinger of the apocalypse, the bringer of destruction to the shining city on a hill which she called home. It filled her with all sorts of emotions, none good, that she had no idea what she could do next or what she could do to stop this madness. Was she really so powerless, so helpless as to not be able to control the very monster which she'd let loose?\n\nThoughts crystallized, came together from the flurry of despair which drove her deep into her chair. The ticking of the clock was the only noise that broke the silence of her home now. Ticking of clocks, clicking of cameras. What would [get.President] do about her? A political opponent, one with legitimacy and at least some prestige... would he see her as a threat? Would that paranoid loon come for her? Was she really sure he wouldn't?\n\nOh, God, what had she done?"

"Well, winning your House seats would be a good start." A gaggle of chuckles erupted from his audience, to his amusement. At least his humor still translated. "But it fills me with pride to know that so many young men and women like you are carrying on the fight. That an old pilot from Arizona can inspire so many around the country... I'd say the honor's all mine."\n\n"We did everything we could for you last November, sir. I really thought we had it." Another man piped up. "I had blisters on my feet from all the walking I did. And... well, now I don't know what's gonna happen. To everything you built. I just don't get it."\n\nGoldwater considered that for a moment, leaning against the armrest of his chair. The bright desert sun, brightening the room through a large window, reflected off his glasses as he thought. "I was confident too." He began slowly. "I still think that if the people really understood what we were trying to do in Washington, they'd back us to the hilt. But that doesn't mean we should give up."\n\nNow he straightened in his seat, steepling his hands in his lap. "No, not at all. Someday, someone in this country is going to continue the work right from the Oval Office. Just like in '48. Maybe you all weren't around for that, but Bob Taft went up against Ike and got crushed. It was a terrible damn thing. A lot of people said that was it for small government conservatives. Twenty years later, I came around, and..." He grinned, noticing the upswing in the room's mood. "I don't think it'll take twenty years this time, I'll tell you that. What was your name, son?"\n\n"Dan, sir. Dan Quayle."\n\n"Dan Quayle. Son, sooner rather than later you'll see a man in that office who'll finish what I started, and I hope you remember this talk when he does.""

   USA.epilogue.26.t: "By Any Means"
   USA.epilogue.26.desc: "It was an odd group to have gathered in the office of a conservative Republican. Conservatives were a given, and even some interlopers from the Nationalists weren't to be totally unexpected, but liberals? Progressives? Labor organizers? Never in a million years. And yet here they were, sat in a rough semi-circle within an enclosed conference room that smelled like dust and coffee. Barry Goldwater surveyed their faces, his hands set firmly on the desk before him. It wasn't the War Room, but it was close enough.\n\n"Gentlemen." He began. "We have an unprecedented situation on our hands. The American people have made a... very unfortunate decision, and it's down to those of us who are more level-headed to impede this new administration until, God willing, they leave office one way or another."\n\n"And whose fault is it that we're here to start with?" Someone in the back rows of the room piped up. Goldwater recognized him immediately - a man from the United Steelworkers, brought in from the copper mines. Ordinarily, the former President would dispatch the heckler with a witty remark or two, maybe ignore him entirely. Not today.\n\n"It's my fault, yes." His eyes met the heckler's as a gasp rang through the room. "I believe all of you think that, whether you'd tell me or not. I failed in beating this... radical, whose very presence disgraces the White House and the country. I failed, and many of you would love nothing more than to stick that to me. But this is bigger than politics, bigger than grudges."\n\nHe took his hands off the desk for the first time, wandering around the room. "This is for the very life of this republic. When our children inherit America from us, will they know it as a lifeless, authoritarian husk? Or will they remember the vibrant, shining city on a hill which we all fight for each and every day? I promise you here and now that I will do anything - anything - to preserve this republic, to defeat these forces of evil which surround it." He stopped dead in the center of the room, their eyes enraptured on him and his words. For a moment, Barry Goldwater was President again."

  # Hart Loss 72
   USA.epilogue.27.t: "All That Matters"
   USA.epilogue.27.desc: "Defeat was an unpleasant experience. One impactful enough that the first days after Philip Hart had returned to his quiet home with his wife, he had been rather dejected. It was a natural reaction, compounded by the uncertainty of what would come next for the country.\n\nHowever, over the following days and weeks, that uncertainty and concern began to fade.\n\nHis life now was quiet. It wasn't quite idyllic, but he found that spending time with Janey and his family diminished the call of politics and public service. He had wondered if he'd be content with what would come after the presidency, and to his mild surprise, it was easier than he'd imagined.\n\nWhile he hadn't fully divested himself from politics, he found that it was less important to him now. When his family and friends came to visit, they talked about sports, hobbies, and other subjects. He didn't feel it right to bore them with politics. Their company was all that he wanted or needed.\n\nAll the same, sometimes they did ask; they sometimes wanted his opinion on a certain politician, or a bill Congress was debating, or even what he thought of the political climate. He answered them as honestly as he could, and admitted to some concern about the state of affairs in Washington, but none of them dwelled on those topics for too long.\n\nHis electoral loss was still disappointing, but Hart ultimately found it was a bittersweet thing. He might no longer be the leader of the free world, but he found that this quiet life, surrounded by family and friends, and away from the noise and chaos of Washington, suited him just fine."

# SCHLAFLY INTRO/WAR CONCERN EVENTS #

 USA_schlafly_flavor.1.t: "The First Meeting"
 USA_schlafly_flavor.1.desc: "When Phyllis Stewart Schlafly, a senior member of the National Federation of Republican Women, went to meet with President Richard Milhous Nixon, effectively the most senior grandee of her party, she expected frank and respectful discussion. But for some reason the meeting was completely unsatisfactory.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that the delegation had as its aim to attempt to convince the President not to bother with proxy wars in Malaya and the Philippines when the real concern was domestic communist and fascist infiltration. Unbeknownst to Schlafly at that time, Senator Barry Goldwater had made such points to Nixon's face recently. Since Nixon already hated the senator from Arizona, it made sense that he would outright dismiss people—especially women—that repeated Goldwater's words.\n\nIt could just as well have been Nixon's nature. The President was distracted and indifferent to anything that any of the women said. He could not open his own mouth without saying something ungentlemanly and dismissive. Looking at Schlafly, all he had to say in response to her words was, "What's an attractive woman like you doing wasting your time out here?"\n\nThe other women looked at each other with no small amount of disgust. Schlafly was not as... free-and-easy with her reactions as her colleagues were. She knew she had a God-given duty to pay due respect to the President of the United States."

 USA_schlafly_flavor.2.desc: "It was a pleasant evening at the Taft household in Cincinnati, and Phyllis Schlafly was very pleased with the company she was keeping there.\n\nSenator Robert A. Taft—the Republican candidate in the 1948 election 'sabotaged' by what the dinner attendees would call 'internationalist demagogues'—left behind a family that commemorated his death anniversary every year with a memorial dinner. This was the 10th anniversary of his death, and the ceremony was suitably imposing: all the most important (and, more importantly, radical) Midwestern conservatives were in attendance.\n\nIt came time for Schlafly to give a speech to the assembled guests. Squeezing her husband's hand before she got up, she spoke: "Ladies and gentlemen, we know all too well how President Richard Nixon has failed us. His lawlessness, over-preoccupation with foreign wars, and callous disregard for the lives of American citizens define the entire internationalist Establishment." Applause.\n\n"I cannot emphasize the following enough: we need a true challenge to the corrupt Nixons and Rockefellers that have infected the Republican Party. Therefore I call upon you all to support a true conservative visionary, Barry Goldwater, for the 1964 election."\n\nThe assembled conservatives made their approval known with eager cheers and a standing ovation. A feeling of hope suffused Schlafly as she sat down."

 USA_schlafly_flavor.3.desc: "Phyllis Schlafly sat down at her desk in St. Louis, trying to rewrite her book, which she planned to title "A Choice Not An Echo". She had had to throw out her first draft after the altered political landscape of 1964 made the old draft worthless.\n\nRichard Nixon, that brute that the liberals were right to call a 'crook', had done himself in politically; that struck Schlafly as being for the best. Then there was Kennedy, whom Schlafly had always hated—but his murder, that had been an awful thing. No one could ever have wanted that. "God rest the departed," she muttered as her mind wandered to the present.\n\nGoldwater, sabotaged just like Taft was by internationalists, had been forced to pull out of the contest. Now the RDC primary was between LBJ and the feckless internationalist Wallace Bennett, a Republican in name only. The NPP was hardly better; their primary was split between the overambitious lunatic RFK and the unrefined, unsubtly racist liberal Wallace.\n\nDeeply dissatisfied with what she saw in front of her in the political sphere, Schlafly sorted the old draft into a binder and put it away. Hoping that the new version of her book would make a difference in 1968, she began to write."

America will stand against fascism with one of the few friends we have left between Washington and Canberra. But we should not - cannot - confuse defending democracy with building it from the ground up in Africa.

I understand chomping at the bit to give the Nazis a bloody nose - but America's democracy wasn't built overnight.

Yet you've always drawn a line between yourself and the traditional 'establishment,' particularly on questions on security. Where is that line drawn?"\n\n"I'm not naive to think that America can survive with smiles and flowers in a world with Hitler's ghost on one side and Hirohito's servants on the other. The defense of America requires we arm ourselves with terrible weapons, to be forever vigilant in the defense of liberty. But this is a marathon, not a sprint - and the Germans and the Japanese would be happy to see us exhaust ourselves while they catch their breath."\n\n"So on the topic of South Africa - how do you see the Administration's policy to continue the war?"\n\n"So many soldiers come home every week in coffins, and yet the Administration seems to have stopped asking themselves why. I don't disagree on the first purpose - to defend South Africa - but after years of war, South Africa has shown it will not be taken without a fight. We've shown the Germans that we can't be bullied into retreat - and if a peace is found that is acceptable to the South Africans, then we can leave with honor.""

This was the late-night fixture of American television, a mixture of highbrow conversation and mass entertainment embodied by the disarming wit of a single man, even as the war in Africa entered another grinding year.\n\n"I'm joined tonight by Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative firebrand taking bookstores and auditoriums alike by storm for her one message: that our boys are fighting a hopeless war and America needs to wake up. Mrs. Schlafly - you're speaking with America tonight. Tell us what you think Washington needs to hear."\n\n"Well, Johnny - they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I don't doubt we had good intentions when the Nazis invaded South Africa. But where are we now? We're fighting Africans more than we fight Germans, and the Africans never wanted us there at all! And for what? It's appalling that multiple administrations have asked Americans to sacrifice for these 'OFN mandates' and expect us not to ask 'why' when coffins come home, all while Tokyo and Germania plot their next trap for well-meaning Americans."\n\n"That's a line we're hearing more and more on Capitol Hill - something that you can claim at least partial credit for."\n\n"Let's be clear: I'm not a pacifist, but we're throwing our young men away for something nobody understands anymore. People wonder what else is worth fighting for, just like in the days after the War - and you see it in rising crime and drug use, in families where children are raised without fathers and where mothers are forced to work in their stead. We've made our point in South Africa - what else are we proving?""

"Mrs. Schlafly, we would like to hear your views on the recent decision to send troops into West Africa."\n\nSchlafly was poised, pleasant, and sure in her convictions, the showrunner would later recall. Her reply came quickly and bluntly: "I will be honest with you. I fail to see any possible reason for the United States to involve itself in some piddling little conflict between socialists, exiled Frenchmen, and unorganized African tribes that gains us nothing in return. What exactly does America lose if the Japanese tie themselves to some feckless communists?"\n\nThe hosts were mildly surprised. "Surely there is some merit to preventing Japanese incursions into any region of the world? Surely General de Gaulle has some legitimacy in resisting the Pan-Africanist onslaught?"\n\nBut their guest did not back down, retorting, "No, there is no merit to that, certainly not in comparison to preventing domestic fascist and communist incursions. Furthermore, there is no reason whatsoever that American boys should give up their lives for Charles de Gaulle's restorationist fantasies. Absolutely not.""

Walking to the first class of the day, they noticed a huge crowd of people—surrounded by reporters and photographers—carrying anti-war placards and listening to a woman speak from behind a lectern.\n\n"The hell's that?" one student asked the other.\n\nAfter squinting at the placards and the woman, the second student made his reply. "It's this Phyllis Schlafly lady. She's having a rally against the war."\n\nThe first student laughed. "You're kidding me! My mom loves her. She's all she talks about nowadays.

Years of speaking futilely on the same topic had darkened her mood and strengthened her mettle, and now she was on the National Mall making her point to an unprecedented audience.\n\n"These parasitic degenerates that sit in the White House and on the Capitol—what word is more suitable for them than 'gravediggers'? What is their purpose but the destruction of America? And what point is there for us to obey their dictate to fight on behalf of the half-dead colonialist de Gaulle?"\n\nThe crowd, suffused by dark rage, shouted its approval; Schlafly continued on.\n\n"All this is clearly a fascistic plot to distract America with sideshows, while the evil empires in Japan and Germany build their arsenals and prepare to snuff out the last abode of God-given freedom. Thanks to these gravediggers, America is dying; our nation's soul is being corrupted unto death because of this war and because of communist infiltration at all levels!

Mrs. Schlafly, how should America respond?"\n\n"Well, I would say that America needs to be extremely careful in the wars it chooses to fight. Our obligations to the OFN can't be blank checks - because as much as Australia might want this war, it's going to be America that has to finish it."\n\n"The Australians were our partners in South Africa. Why should America turn Australia away from fighting a threat on its immediate border?"\n\n"I would never say we should turn away from Australia! But as far as I'm concerned, how the Japanese or Indonesians choose to kill each other isn't a fundamentally American problem - or one we should think of 'solving' at the cost of American lives."\n\n"Even if the Free Indonesian government promises a more democratic Indonesia, one aligned to the United States?"\n\n"I'm not willing to send our sons to die, in a war of choice, for some desperate jungle promise from people we barely know.""

The Administration tries to sell America on its next battle in the crusade for freedom, and it's not hard to take them at face value - that by sending our sons and husbands to die in Indonesia, we'll be keeping the Japanese away from Australia.\n\nEven a cursory investigation of the facts on the ground makes this comically untrue. A long history of pent-up grievances in Djakarta, the fact that Mohammad Hatta barely seems to control his own generals on the best of days, and how nobody seems even particularly enthused to leave the Japanese embrace - just find a new settlement of their own.\n\nIf I can't explain this war to you in one paragraph, I doubt the administration can, except with platitudes about the value of freedom in alien lands, where democracy is as foreign a concept to the Indonesians as Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd now that we've taken the first step in the door, where does it stop? When will we say enough is enough, as our soldiers are asked to cross thousands of islands spanning from Palembang to Makassar?\n\nThere is no justice in fighting a war for those who do not want our help, nor have our best interests in mind.

These words would surely be seen as a barb, and that perception would spread like a plague post-haste. For Phyllis Schlafly, that sentence she wrote would forever sting her more than any other being living.\n\nThe sniggering elitist political field of battle had not been kind to conservatives throughout history. That was what she wrote with a quiet sort of anger. Today was no different than the last. First, the sabotage of Taft. Now, the despicable coalition she had called home had betrayed them all. Conservatives from shore to shining shore had looked up to Goldwater like how the sick looked up to a doctor. A subject to savior. The Liberals, with forked tongues, had snatched away that golden carrot. One too many times, she said. Joining the Nationalists was her stated goal: MCS and Wallace were not elitist stooges, for all their buffoonery. They were not Tantalus, eternally bound to this cycle. They did not have to be driven insane.\n\nHearth and home had betrayed conservatives, betrayed her. Betrayed her. The pen became heavier in her hand. She stopped, bringing her arm across her eyes for fear tears would mark the article.\n\nShe looked up, in that office full of night's darkness. She imagined a Presidential office for herself, where she would select true Republican heroes, giving their portraits a prestigious spot before her desk. That warm fantasy had become cold. For now those eyes were terrifying ones, staring down at her in judgment. She saw in those eyes something horrible, as the pressure she had placed on the pen caused it to shatter."

Your company has always been welcome, here as well as in my party." Wallace mused, his meager, artificial courtesies unbecoming of the splendor of his White House office. "It does our party well, to have the image of us, standing together, in the press. It is a uniting one, and against the pull of Socialist nominees. And it does me well to know you better."\n\n"I'm sure it is. I'm quite flattered," Schlafly offered stiff words and stiff smiles, all lies. Conversation spun on for some time. Entertaining this invitation was expected of her, to show respect to the office of the President. She could stand next to the President when the cameras were on, but not too close. It could not be expected of her to forget her principles, the fire that held her against the tide. The man across from her-liberal, racist, intent on reducing America to the status of a banana republic-was not on her side.\n\n"So," Wallace's tapping on the desk was beginning to annoy. "I'm very proud of my son, recovering very well from that sporting injury. Graduated recently, too. I imagine you're proud of yours, too."\n\n"Of course. My little Andrew, a boy of 10, is growing strong. I'm sure he'll grow up to have an interest in combating liberal bias, just like his mother."\n\nWallace nodded as if he knew what she was talking about.

She must have been called in to give her well renowned input into this new Administration. There was a brilliantly golden notion she might have been called here to become a part of his cabinet. A dream made true.\n\n"Ah, Mrs. Schlafly," President Barry Goldwater responded with less warmth than she had expected.\n\n"I must say, Mr. President," Schlafly beamed, each word buzzing with joy. "My most heartfelt congratulations on your electoral triumph. It's about time we had someone to sort out the Federal Government. Purging every single one of those gravediggers, starting with McNamara."\n\n"Excuse me, Mrs. Schlafly?" Goldwater flinched, his head receding backwards in a quick flash of surprise. "I hope you don't seriously think I mean to do that. McNamara is a dear friend and ally of mine, and I'd wager a bet I know who you mean by "gravedigger" in fond terms."\n\n"I see..."\n\n"Truth be told, this was my staff's idea to accept this meeting. Mending rifts in the Republican Party, or at least appearing to do so, is in everyone's interest.

She hoped her exit hurt them as much as it did her. It was a shameful thing to think of and wish for. She did it all the same.\n\nHer misery, the history books taught her, was a strong and proud tradition. Leeches beneath the honors of presidency had ruined Taft. Now, just as the conservative cause reached seeming respite, Goldwater, the mouth of the movement, proved to be unable to take deep enough breaths to satisfy the near drowned lungs. Beholden to the Kingmakers, dancing their tune for mere scraps. Better than the rest, but similar. Never enough, never enough.\n\nShe would not be some junior member of a coalition like that. The notion of being some toadie, some propaganda piece to stand around and look agreeing stank in her thoughts, like a rancid plague. Childish, ungrateful whelps who designed to support Democrat agendas - socialist social engineering, warmongering - were no friends of hers. George Wallace and MCS stood as the only possible allies left: Flailing buffoons and incompetents they might be, at least they had the stomach and moral conviction to spurn elite influence.\n\nSchlafly slumped backwards into her chair, sighing. She felt the compulsion to scratch and claw, rub herself red until she felt untainted. She was too tired. Her tired, half-lidded eyes scanned the room. She had been frantically and furiously writing for hours, she realized. The lamp wasn't even on, so the room's nighttime darkness was deep. Her desk was alone, so alone.

"Read it," he spat as he began pacing angrily.\n\nGuy hesitantly picked up the paper, and quickly saw what had caused such a reaction. The op-ed of the day was written by someone called... Phyllis Schlafly? The subject was on John Kennedy - and while it was framed with compassion, the snide contempt was palpable, as she wrote that while his death was a tragedy, she bemoaned that he had failed to transcend his do-nothing liberalism before his passing.\n\n"Well," he said after a moment.

Unfortunately, John was a sensitive subject for Bobby. He tried one more time. "I don't think this will help, Mr. President."\n\nKennedy paused, and for a moment, Guy hoped that he'd broken through.

Both of them shared a laugh at the questionable joke.\n\nWallace played over the exchange again. He'd never heard of Phyllis Schlafly before, and this was not a great first impression. He found himself more insulted the more he thought about it. This was so absurd that he needed to put her in her place.\n\n"What do you think?" He turned to LeMay, who'd watched the clip beside him. "Target the absurdity? Smear her in return? What's the tactic here?"\n\nLeMay glanced at him, frowning. "Respectfully, Mr. President - why the fuck do we care about this woman?

What stood out about these women was what they were protesting. The lady leading them had been rallying the crowd for hours now, accusing him of 'social engineering,' and 'trampling on the sanctity of life.' She altered between speaking to the crowd, and then turning to the White House as if she was 'addressing' him directly.\n\nUsually women were protesting for greater representation, more government support, and more liberties - not the opposite. It was almost fascinating to witness, though he suspected it was just a trojan horse to attack his welfare policies. The 'socialist' smear was not exactly new to him, and he idly wondered which party this women belonged to.\n\nTimes like this, Johnson wanted to go out and set the record straight, but he'd dealt with enough stunts in his life to tell that this was certainly one of them.
