 #desert_plateau_desc: "§F--------------§!\n§L"Death Valley" is a misnomer. The American Southwest is actually teeming with life of many different varieties, and it forms a complex ecosystem. The Atacama Desert, on the other hand, is a true Plateau of Death.\n\nAmong the hottest places on Earth in the day, and among the coldest at night, the Atacama is one of the most unlivable ecosystems on Earth; south of the town of María Elena, it is supposed by modern science that there is literally zero non-human life. However, despite the aridity, despite the temperature flux, despite the thin air from the elevation, the Atacama is one of the most starkly beautiful places on the planet. It is trite to compare it to an alien world, and yet, there is no better comparison to make. It is not a place meant for human life, and to gaze upon the endless badlands is to gaze upon the forbidden face of God.§!"
