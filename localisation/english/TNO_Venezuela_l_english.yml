VEN_Wolfgang_Larrazabal: "Wolfgang Larrazábal"
POLITICS_VEN_WOLFGANG_LARRAZABAL: "For a man of the Navy, a long voyage becomes a thing of simple beauty - the whistling wind on weather-beaten faces, the cold lapping of the tides, and duty, most importantly, to both one's sailors and vessel. Though the Palace of Miraflores may have whisked this sailor far from the shore, that duty has never died - like the sound of the tides, it follows him through sleep and wakes and guides him even in the most tumultuous storm. Wolfgang Larrazábal may now pilot a vessel far larger than he ever did as an Admiral, with a crew far larger than he ever thought possible, and yet duty remains.\n\nFrom sea to land, Wolfgang Larrazábal would find himself elevated to astronomical heights in the coup of 1958. In its wake, it would be he, alongside his colleagues, who would carve a new Venezuela from the ruins of the Pérez Jiménez government. Larrazábal's commitment to the principles of democracy would bring his winning smile and charming demeanor into the hearts of the Venezuelan people. Unsatisfied with the Venezuela he left behind, Larrazábal's charm would ensure his victory in the 1958 election and allow him to build something from the ashes - a Venezuela with promise against the tumultuous tides of history.\n\nAnd so, from the wheels of the Navy of the Caribbean Sea to that of a nation, Wolfgang Larrazábal steers his burgeoning country with care. Struck with tragedy after tragedy, it is Larrazábal's dream that the decade of punishment will end for Venezuela, and in its place, the modern Venezuela built by Betancourt so many years ago will thrive - with a careful steer and a keen eye dead set on the horizon."
VEN_German_Borregales: "Germán Borregales"
VEN_Jesus_Maria_Castro_Leon: "Jesús María Castro León"
VEN_Rafael_Caldera: "Rafael Caldera"
VEN_Raul_Leoni: "Raúl Leoni"

VEN_Alfredo_Tarre_Murzi: "Alfredo Tarre Murzi"
VEN_Alfredo_Tarre_Murzi_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Defense\nChristian Progressivism§!\n--------------\n§LWriters and politicians usually come hand in hand, the frantic scurrying of ideas, the chaotic drumming of mental noise, the fuel of caffeine and alcohol, and the somber bliss of completion of said work. For Alfredo Tarre Murzi, this has made the marriage of the two in his career a perfect compliment.\n\nWhen Tarre Murzi writes, he is a critic - ever at the typewriter, infallible and indomitable, and when he is a politician he is frugal, warm, and a keen negotiator. Such skills have made him an indispensable pick for Jóvito Villalba's cabinet; a man able to read the turning tides of the new decade of Venezuelan history built in the fallout of the Pérez Jiménez dictatorship.\n\nTarre Murzi has worked tirelessly to create a Venezuela of compromise, between the military, the police and the people. Though this has never been easy, riots plaguing the first two years of Larrazábal's presidency, and military dissidence remaining a core issue within the country, the forces that once were at one another's throats have settled their daggers at ease, at least for now.\n\nAs for Tarre Murzi, he remains the conciliator in all of this. Where lesser men may have perhaps bowed to one or the other, or cowed to both, he, with all the warmth an aging statesman can give, reminds the disparate of Venezuela they owe allegiance not to him, but to their country.§!"

VEN_Miguel_Angel_Burelli: "Miguel Angel Burelli"
VEN_Miguel_Angel_Burelli_for_desc: "§YMinister of Outer Affairs\nLiberal Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LIn backrooms filled with the ashy air of cigar smoke, and sweaty men pouring over policy reports and documentation, hastily desperate to ensure their own horse wins in the proverbial constant race of politics, Miguel Burelli Rivas stands as a man at ease. The gristle of the underside of politics has long remained his forte, whether that be the schizophrenic world of foreign affairs or the nail-biting psychosis of economic policy - Burelli Rivas remains a careerist through and through.\n\nBorn to an Italian father, languages would come easily to the young Rivas, learning several before even leaving university in Madrid. A core internationalist, he traveled vast distances before being ushered under the wing of Jóvito Villalba, who quickly recognized a protégé within him. When traveling, his thick jowls, smoker's voice, and bulldogged persistence would soon win him comparisons to a young Republican front-runner, to mixed reactions from Burelli himself.\n\nGoing forward, Burelli has placed his trust in Villalba - Venezuela needs leadership above all else, politics aside. After the decade his country has seen, all Burelli seeks is competence, from whom and where, irrespective.\n\nGood politics require good men.§!"

VEN_Fabricio_Ojeda: "Fabricio Ojeda"
ojeda_eco_trait: "Champion of the Poor"
VEN_Fabricio_Ojeda_eco_desc: "§YEconomic Minister\nRevolutionary Gaitanismo§!\n--------------\n§LAmongst the heroes of the 1958 Venezuelan Revolution, the downtrodden and lost Venezuelan society sings only one man's name from the bell towers to the slums.\n\nFabricio Ojeda, one of Venezuela's youngest politicians at only seventeen, became a pillar of the emerging Unión Republicana Democrática. Hopes of a republican society, truly free of the ties that had bound it, were scattered to the wind, however - Venezuelan democracy, like its founder, Rómulo Betancourt, would perish on a cold January morning.\n\nIn the hushed society built by Pérez Jiménez, his lofty ambitions would crush those on society's lower rungs like ants. Ojeda would stand in open defiance with the people of his birthplace. Though Larrazábal may have led the Revolution, without Ojeda's rallying call or communications across all of Venezuelan society, no coup would have ever been possible.\n\nIn the post-war government, Ojeda had won Larrazábal's trust as an apt Economic Minister. In a few short years, the boot of Perezjimenismo had been lifted from the people's necks. In Ojeda's deepest wishes, however, the boots that once wished to crush them would soon be on the feet of every man and woman in the barrios - not just to walk towards a brighter future, but to dare to run to it.§!"

VEN_Jovito_Villalba: "Jóvito Villalba"
VEN_Jovito_Villalba_hog_desc: "§YMinister of Internal Affairs\nNational Liberalism§!\n--------------\n§LTo take a man of middling stature like Jóvito Villalba lightly would be to greatly mislead oneself. Though his well-mannered demeanor and weary appearance may incite visions of a civil servant or accountant more than a revolutionary, without Villalba, Venezuela would not breathe today. What an Amazonian soldier does with his rifle and spirit, Villalba has done with equal fervor through impassioned speeches and late nights of writing.\n\nFrom his days as an idealistic student campaigning against Gómez to his stand against Pérez Jiménez, vigor and integrity remained core to Villalba's values. Though he would suffer for it, from jail to exile, he remained unbroken. In 1952, he would stand against Pérez Jiménez, defeating the dictator in a military election at the zenith of his influence. For the years following, an exiled Villalba would become the mouthpiece of resistance against the regime, lighting a match that would explode into a wildfire in 1958.\n\nLarrazábal would see a kindred spirit in Villalba, stepping down from office to run alongside his newfound ally. A populist campaign of restoration would follow, in which Larrazábal would become its grinning public face, and Villalba its arms and legs.\n\nJóvito has built the government he was denied in 1952, with the trust of the people and faith in his government, hoping to usher in a wave in politics, one where his vision for URD and the country may come to fruition. Not just a party of hope, but one of national unity to bring together all of Venezuela's lost children and give them the torch to light their way forward.§!"


### National Spirits ###
VEN_black_gold_raw_gold: "Black Gold, Raw Gold"
VEN_black_gold_raw_gold_desc: "As Italy's lifeblood flows like wine, and Russia's like Vodka, Venezuela's flows like oil, twice as thick and double as strong. The Venezuelan economy, since the nation's inception, has been one built on the banks of the Orinoco River, and the belt which runs throughout it. Such a boon has won her a special candor with the other nations of the Organisation of Free Nations. Though Venezuela may, in a season of plenty, cultivate a great harvest, she has grown too comfortable from a long spring - one which may soon turn to fall."

VEN_game_of_the_three_kings: "Game of The Three Kings"
VEN_game_of_the_three_kings_desc: "The fall of one tyrant, as it tends to do, leaves his kingdom shattered and its people lost - shattered between fiefdoms. Since the fall of Pérez Jiménez, and the death of national hero Rómulo Betancourt, three giants have been stuck in perpetual competition: AD, led by Raúl Leóni, COPEI, led by Rafael Caldera, and URD, led by Jóvito Villalba, have been locked in a bitter political rivalry over the nation's future.\n\nThough in 1958 that unease may have been sufficed by the election of the people's admiral, Wolfgang Larrazábal, the hero of the 1958 Coup, as the next elections approach, so does factionalism - and the ghosts of past enmity."

VEN_democracys_fraying_lifeline: "Democracy's Fraying Lifeline"
VEN_democracys_fraying_lifeline_desc: "With the fall of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, so was felled 150 years of Venezuelan militarism, and the brief experiment of Venezuelan democracy, launched by Betancourt and Gallegos in 1945, was vindicated. Those in the military, however, shaped to rule by previous military regimes, rest uneasy with this break from tradition, from the high offices to the lowly academies - ideas, new and old, are fostered in the name of Venezuela's one true King, above democracy or dictatorship:\n\n§YBo§!§mlív§!§Rar§!."

VEN_the_crimson_spectre: "The Crimson Spectre"
VEN_the_crimson_spectre_desc: "In the rural landscapes and mountains, a lowly song plays - half of tragedy for a past lost, half of hope. In 1958, these people were nearly vindicated, and yet their hope, under the watchful eye of right-wing traitors and the American eagle, stole a truly free Venezuela from them.\n\nNow, under the guise of another generation of revolutionaries, the MIR and burgeoning FALN have taken up arms. From the tropics of Zulia to the plains of Bolívar a slow hum plays, ever present but low - however, as Venezuela enters her most uncertain decade to date, what is a hum may turn to a shout, to a scream, to a cry for all the country to hear."

VEN_el_esequibo_es_nuestro: "¡El Esequibo Es Nuestro!"
VEN_el_esequibo_es_nuestro_desc: "§Y"First stolen by the Anglos, then by the Yankees."§!\n\nThough the fires of nationalism were tempered with the Guyanese and Venezuelan alliance under the OFN, there is no hiding the ruse of land that cannot be held. For now, the Venezuelan matriarchal anger may be calmed, but only on the comfort of their lost sons and daughters across the border - and should that change, so will the wrath of the mother."

VEN_Puntofijo_Pact: "The Puntofijo Pact"
VEN_Puntofijo_Pact_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Jiménez government in a coup and its replacement by a democratic polity, various measures were taken in order to ensure that Venezuelan democracy would never again fall apart in the face of tyranny. The Puntofijo Pact was the crystallisation of these plans; it was a written guarantee that the signatory parties would respect election results, prevent single-party hegemony, and work together to fight dictatorship.\n\nHowever, all good things must come to an end, and that end seems to be coming rather quickly for the Puntofijo Pact. The once ironclad agreement is beginning to show cracks, and whether that will lead to its renewal or to its ruination no one can tell with certainty."

VEN_Essequibo_Dispute: "Essequibo is Ours!"
VEN_Essequibo_Dispute_desc: "Guayana Essequibo is to Venezuela what the east is to Bolivia and the Falklands are to Argentina. As is the case with all such disputed territories in Latin America, it is a land forever claimed by its neighbour and a perennial problem for the people of the region.\n\nAny and all Venezuelan politicians elected to any office above that of environmental health officer (that is, rat-catcher) breathes fire when asked about the region; they all aim to reclaim it, and that desire has brought even socialists and conservative hardliners together even if only for a few moments.\n\nObviously, if this is not controlled or solved in a rational manner, the Organisation of Free Nations—to which both Venezuela and Guyana currently belong—is at risk of being split over this."

VEN_King_of_Oil: "The King of Oil" # (Pandas)
VEN_King_of_Oil_desc: "Verily, Venezuela is the King of Oil, and we are doing remarkably well with this position. The economy is doing marvellously, and since previous governments successfully nationalised it all we have total control over it. Yes, you heard it correctly: it's ours, all ours.\n\nOur control over this large oil reserve enables us to punch well above our theoretical diplomatic weight. We can make friends and enemies as we please and suffer less than, say, the Colombians might if they copied our actions—all thanks to our oil."
