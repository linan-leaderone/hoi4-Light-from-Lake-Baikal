POLITICS_FIDEL_CASTRO_DESC: "Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on 13 August, 1926 to a wealthy family, the bastard son of his father's mistress. Despite a conservative Jesuit education, Fidel became a devout anti-fascist. His political life began at the University of Havana, throwing aside his law studies to join the populist Ortodoxo Party.\n\nIn 1952, General Batista launched a coup and crushed Cuba's fragile democracy under his boot. Fidel resorted to armed struggle, leading a daring but doomed attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26th July, 1953. Released from prison, he fled to Mexico to form a new rebellion under the 26th of July Movement, or M-26-7. Despite a disastrous landing in Cuba, Fidel and his rebels fled into the mountain jungles to wage a six-year guerrilla war.\n\nAlthough M-26-7's urban wing made invaluable contributions, it was Fidel and his colorful, bearded rebels who made headlines worldwide. It was their exploits and stunning victories that made Fidel the symbol of anti-Batista resistance in Cuba. The tide turned against Batista, and on New Year's Day, 1959, a triumphant Fidel entered Havana with his rebel army.\n\nCastro now serves as Cuba's President, ruling as a flamboyant populist in the Latin American tradition. Since 1959, major reforms have swept Cuba to international acclaim, and the revolutionaries remain in the OFN's good graces for their proud anti-fascist stance.\n\nFidel espouses socialist views alongside Ortodoxo populism, and endorses direct democracy, but rules in a rather autocratic manner blended with Cuban nationalism. It's unclear if he'll be a democratic champion or another caudillo, but every Cuban knows that the self-proclaimed heir of José Martí will shape history forever."
POLITICS_FIDEL_CASTRO_DICTATOR_DESC: "Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on 13 August, 1926 to a wealthy family, the bastard son of his father's mistress.

It was their exploits and stunning victories that made Fidel the symbol of anti-Batista resistance in Cuba. The tide turned against Batista, and on New Year's Day, 1959, a triumphant Fidel entered Havana with his rebel army.\n\nWhile many hoped he'd be the exception, Fidel has gone the way of Robespierre and rules as caudillo. Embracing his autocratic streak, he now holds the Hobbesian worldview that change and order can only be brought with an iron fist.\n\nAs for ideology, he has forsaken Gaitán's democracy for the PRI's perfect dictatorship, although he is still committed to socialism and anti-fascism. Perhaps this is not what José Martí envisioned, but to Fidel, the strong hand is the only way to fulfill his hero's dream."
POLITICS_JOSE_ANTONIO_ECHEVERRIA_DESC: "Amidst the countless leaders and heroes of the Cuban Revolution there is only one man that can rival Fidel Castro man-to-man in terms of the numbers of his admirers. This is José Antonio Echeverría, just over three decades out from his birthday of July 16, 1932 as he enters the Presidential Palace in Havana as its tenant.\n\nOn the streets of Cuba they call him Manzanita, "Little Apple" - but to university students and, more recently, the Catholic Church in Cuba, he is known as their hero. As well it should be: he was, after all, the man behind the Catholic students' DRE or Revolutionary Student Directorate. Founding the DRE with his fellow Catholic students, Echeverría carried out student protests and urban guerrilla warfare against the Batista régime, quickly allying with Fidel Castro. The greatest of his exploits before being elected President was his failed but daring attack on the Presidential Palace on the 13th of March, 1957 from which FBI and DFS agents helped him escape alive.\n\nThat failure proved temporary - though he had to regroup in the Sierra Maestra and lead urban warfare against Batista, the tyranny eventually came to an end. Now in power, Echeverría wants nothing more than to revive the radical democracy that José Martí dreamt of, strengthen antifascist solidarity across Latin American campuses, and most importantly, turn the Church into a revolutionary force.\n\nWill that succeed in Cuba, a nation where religion was never really popular? It is the people's decision."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PRIO_SOCARRAS_DESC: "The ascension of Carlos Prío Socarrás to the dignity of President of Cuba is not his first entrance into that arena. In fact, the man passing into his seventh decade as he enters the Presidential Palace is the last legally elected President of Cuba before the revolution, and the second such President after it.\n\nPeople call Prío Socarrás "El Presidente Cordial", the Cordial President; his legacy is one of sadness. Whether it was his fault is still hotly debated, but his promising administration was mired in corruption and political violence having as their result the most violent election in Cuban history. It is clear, however, that by the end of his term he was seen as weak and ineffectual.\n\nBut another chance eventually came. The man that usurped Prío Socarrás and forced him into exile was a tyrant, and the Revolution brought the struggle against Machado back to the old President's mind. He jumped into the fray, coordinating funding for M-26-7, even mobilizing young Auténticos to fight; anything and everything to free his nation. When it was done, Prío was welcomed home in 1959, surrounded by young rebels eager to pay their respects.\n\nNow the new President has a second chance. The ideals of 1933 have clearly not lost their old appeal; the Auténticos still have some vigour and hope left in them. Carlos Prío Socarrás is determined not to squander this precious opportunity—for he knows what faces him if he fails at the test: brokenness, and a lost sense of what could have been."

# Ideas
CUB_idea_cuban_revolution: "The Cuban Revolution"
CUB_idea_cuban_revolution_desc: "To many, January 1st, 1959 was the end of the Cuban Revolution. Batista had been exiled, his regime toppled and his government scattered to the winds. To us, that January 1st was not an ending, but a beginning.\n\nSince that day, Cuba has been in a period of ongoing change, a permanent revolution, one where the myopic traditions holding her back have been swept aside in the name of national progress. Politically, socially, economically, nothing has been spared the hand of change, and yet, as the Revolution continues, the people rejoice. The Revolution enjoys great success and popularity at home, and even draws the interest of actors abroad. Our people are proud of the Revolution, and support its every tenet."
CUB_idea_reform_frenzy: "Reform Frenzy"
CUB_idea_reform_frenzy_desc: "Since the beginnings of the Revolution, Cuba has found herself in a state of constant flux. Nearly every month some new sweeping change is announced. Be it changes to land reform, healthcare, welfare, or education, the Cuba of ten years ago is hardly recognizable compared to the Cuba of today.\n\nTo many, these changes are a good thing; many of Cuba's immediate needs post Revolution have been addressed, and the life of the average Cuban is much better today than it was but a mere decade ago. A select few, however, worry that these changes are too much, too quickly, and fear that as the old Cuba unravels, she may find herself flying a bit too close to the sun."
CUB_idea_uncertain_direction: "Uncertain Direction"
CUB_idea_uncertain_direction_desc: "In the days following the Revolution, the myriad factions that banded together to overthrow the Batista regime have continued their one-time alliance. Forming the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, or the ORI, these disparate factions have little more in common than a desire to see Cuba changed, and most desire to see El Comandante at her head.\n\nThis has led to an extremely dysfunctional political scene, and as the various factions that make up the ORI continue to pull the organization in opposite directions, the future of Cuba becomes more and more uncertain. Castro increasingly finds himself the only man in Cuba who can direct the ORI, and he must pick this direction soon, unless he should see his grand dream driven to ruin from infighting and division."
CUB_idea_question_democracy: "The Question of Democracy"
CUB_idea_question_democracy_desc: "Despite the extreme popularity of Castro, many in the ORI have begun to speak in hushed whispers of his more authoritarian tendencies. They speak of how comfortable he has become with his power, and question if he is to ever abandon it.\n\nAs time goes on, the idea of an end to Castro's governance seems like an increasingly distant possibility. With dissidents openly calling for elections in the streets, and Castro's ambiguous statements on the matter, the age-old question of the democracy that José Martí dreamed of has begun taking hold in the ORI's leadership. It is a question that must be addressed, and soon."
