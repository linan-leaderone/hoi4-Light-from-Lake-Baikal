#Bills
USA_sen_bill_name_1:0 "Segregated Education Enforcement Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_1:0 "The American Education Separation Act will officially implement a state of segregation for all schools within the United States, North, South, East, and West, bringing an end to those liberal dreams of those progressives that want to ruin the truly patriotic American nation. Tradition must be maintained, and tradition will be maintained, so long as I see fit!"
USA_sen_bill_name_2:0 "The Perth Conference"
USA_sen_bill_desc_2:0 "The Perth Conference is the meeting initiated by the USA, containing nations aligned against the Japanese to fight them through mutual trade with each other rather than dependence on the Japanese. The terms will be negotiated during this meeting and then submitted through Congress, should they fail to pass through Congress, they will have to be renegotiated at a later date."
USA_sen_bill_name_3:0 "The Silver Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_3:0 "The Bennett Administration has grown frustrated with America's continuously outdated monetary system causing the economy to stutter and fall. Thus, it is time for America to depart from the Silver based system of currency and move to a much more profitable system: the Gold Standard. We look forward to uniting the country under an improved financial system, so long as we manage to get the bill passed through the houses of Congress."

USA_sen_bill.3.t:0 "The Silver Act Fights Through Congress"
USA_sen_bill.3.d:0 "The Bennett administration has worked relentlessly on the scrutinizing reviews regarding the Silver Act. The President has collaborated with a multitude of secretaries within the upper levels of the West Wing to finalize the bill. Vice President Ford has declared that the bill's passage has become "one of the most prioritized plans of the Bennett administration in an effort to aid the American economy."\n\nBennett leads the charge to rouse the Democrats to action, driving them to support his plan to place the American economy into a more stable position by transferring the currency-backed metal to that of gold, which is now far more reliable than industrial silver as a store of value. One of the most important details of the Silver Act would be the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which would level off the focus on silver mining and "promote fiscal responsibility within the government," as quoted by Treasurer Absalom Robertson.\n\nHowever, while the bill appears to be siding towards approval within Congress, there are those within the United States that would seek the bill's failure. Many spurned southern Democrats who have turned to the NPP's Nationalists find the bill to be distasteful, hurting current silver miners. Likewise, in an odd coalition, the Progressive branch of the NPP has outspoken members standing against the bill, claiming that it will hurt American jobs. All that's left is to see whether the bill will survive the battleground of the Congress."
USA_sen_bill.3.a:0 "The Legislative Branch decides our fate now."

bill_3_passed:0 "After gathering on the steps of the Congressional building in Washington D.C. in the early morning, political analysts report that the Silver Act, a bill shepherded by the Bennett Administration through multiple discussions, analyses, and negotiations, has successfully passed in both houses of Congress and is set to be signed into law. The Silver Act's passage proves the potential of the hardworking advisors and officials who managed to construct the piece of legislation after months of hard work within the West Wing, the Treasury, and those outside of D.C.\n\nPresident Bennett himself commented on the bill's passage this evening, declaring it a "crowning achievement of both unity and potential for the United States of America, and a step forward for a new era of economic success." Multiple figures in Bennett's administration, including Treasurer Absalom Robertson, have echoed President Bennett's enthusiasm, stating that "the silver system served to bog the United States down in an outdated system, while the gold standard will allow us to continue to show American economic strength worldwide." Republicans and Democrats applauded each other for their bipartisan cooperation towards the bill's success.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, NPP senators and representatives appear rather quiet over the outcome of the Silver Act. While some hail the success of the bill alongside the RDC, others exchange confused glances over the ease of the bill's passage. For now, however, the United States takes the first steps towards adopting gold to back the dollar."
bill_3_passed.Option:0 "We've done it, everyone."
bill_3_passed.Title:0 "The Silver Act Passes in Congress"
bill_3_failed:0 "We have just been informed that the Silver Act, a thought-to-be unanimous bill built up to be the pride and joy of the Bennett Administration, has died on the Congressional floor. After months of work within the Treasury, and months of planning to finalize attempts to push it through Congress, the bill has failed to make it through a floor vote.\n\nPresident Bennett offered his "sincerest apologies to the citizens of the United States for the extreme partisanship within the federal government." Throughout the Senate and House of Representatives, Republican and Democratic congressmen continuously shake their heads, grimace, and express their frustrations over the Silver Act being defeated by political chicanery. Administration officials stated that "the administration will continue its efforts to aid the American economy, despite the evident political hurdles to even the most basic of tasks."\n\nOn the other hand, NPP congressmen have related surprise over their success on the legislative floor. Nationalist and Progressive NPP congressmen shake hands and congratulate one another in the Capitol, while RDC legislators field angry calls from their voting base. The Democratic branch of the RDC, in particular, are reeling, with large swathes of former Democratic voters turning to the NPP, even as the Republicans raise questions about the Bennett administration's fitness for office. The administration is scrambling to find a solution to the bill's failure."

USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "The Federal Student Aid Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "Education has been a local issue since the beginning of America, with local school districts maintaining schools and the states providing some direction. However, this has meant that there are wide disparities based on wealth and state mandates, meaning that many students are not receiving the full education they need for the future. The Federal Student Aid Act will fix this, by providing resources to states and districts that desperately need it, and a baseline standard of education across the US."
bill_6_passed:0 "President Robert Kennedy, surrounded by the students and teachers at Strong John Thomson Elementary School in Washington DC just a few blocks from the White House, is signing the Federal Student Aid Act to applause as news cameras and photographers record the event for posterity.\n\n"Today, we say that all of America's students deserve the chance to learn and grow, to become the well-informed, smart and intelligent adults of tomorrow that will make America better than ever. The doctors, teachers, artists, inventors and leaders of tomorrow are in our schools today, and we must do all we can today, to make tomorrow even better."\n\nThe FSA Act will set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government will provide money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the new standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile education groups and civil rights organizations are really pleased with the FSA in their equality and standardization edicts, many states' rights proponents are angry at the law, which is pretty much stripping the local control over education that has long been one of the most important roles of the states. While most of the articles of the law are only for those school districts that require the funds and are "opt-in," the need for money in many of the poorest states will force them to compromise on their beliefs in order to get the money they need to operate. Nevertheless, the FSA will soon make America one of the best educated nations in the world."
bill_6_failed:0 "In a shocking announcement, the Federal Student Aid Act has failed to clear the Senate. Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n"The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years," Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. "The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world."\n\nThe FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile states' rights supporters cheer the failure of the "draconian" and "tyrannical" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

RD_R_compromise_desc_6:0 "Senator Scoop Jackson has been meeting with multiple Republican senators throughout the sprawling Senate Office Buildings, most of them individually in the attempt to get enough votes to pass the Federal Student Aid Act.\n\nIn fact, Scoop has been surprised about how receptive to the idea of additional education funding is with his colleagues from the other side of the aisle. After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\nBut, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\nHaving taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "The Affordable Housing Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "The American dream is centered around one thing: owning your own home. But since the end of the war, real-estate developers have been more focused on developing middle-class suburbia: thousands of cookie-cutter homes on twisting cul-de-sacs far from the centers of the big cities. This has left millions, especially racial minorities, squeezed out of the housing market. The Affordable Housing Act will solve this issue, and build many new homes and the amenities to make new communities."
bill_7_passed:0 "As the signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office to the flash of photographers' light bulbs, an assortment of real estate developers, civil rights leaders and mayors from cities big and small across America applauded as President Robert Kennedy signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.\n\n"I'm pleased to sign this bill into law, which will make it easier to build affordable, liveable, and safe housing for those Americans that could only dream before of home ownership," the President said moments before he signed the law. "Today, we say that every family in the United States has the right to own their own home."\n\nThe new law will allow cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill will also provide subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and help establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not be apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding is only provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\nAlready, there are many plans being drawn up for the "Kennedyburgs" in every city in the nation, redeveloping areas that had overlooked and abandoned for years, promising a new construction boom that will last for a decade or more."
bill_7_failed:0 "The votes are in, and the Senate has rejected the Affordable Housing Act, one of the key planks of President Robert Kennedy's agenda. Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n"The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act," a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. "Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on."\n\nThe defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill would have also provided subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and helped to establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city.

RD_R_compromise_desc_7:0 "Going to the Senate cafeteria and seeing the various senators dining is an eye opening experience. Men and women who are diametrically opposed ideologically can be seen chatting and having a good time, while those that are of the same party often can be seen avoiding each other. It's a great way to see who is an introvert, who's an extrovert, and even how the nitty-gritty details of politics can get done.\n\nIn the haze of cigarette smoke and the smell of the meals served hot by some of the best chefs in Washington, "Scoop" Jackson was sitting with some of his Republican colleagues, enjoying their mid-afternoon break.\n\n"So, about the housing bill," one of the Republican Senators said, cutting into a chicken breast. "I can tell that you are here to get that passed, right?"\n\n"Well, if you want to get to business," the Senate Leader of the Progressives replied. "But you know it will help your communities greatly, make a lot of new homeowners, taxpayers, and all that shit that will make your cities and states happy indeed. And it won't be just Chicago or Seattle or Miami that gets the money. Every city and town in the country can apply for it."\n\n"It's going to cost a lot though," another senator said. "Not sure if my constituents will appreciate having to foot the bill."\n\n"It will pay for itself in time," Jackson replied, as he took a drink of water. "Besides, if you give a man a home, go and cut the ribbon when they open it up, I'm sure lots of folks will support you in your next term." Jackson set his glass on his tray, and stood up, preparing to hand off his dirty dishes and return to work. "You can't get better publicity than that.""

USA_sen_bill_name_9:0 "The National Labor Relations Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_9_minimum_wage:0 "For far too long, industry, business and capital have dictated the terms to their workers: how long they will work, what they will be paid, and what benefits they will receive, and if they will recognize unions or not. While there has been advancement in the past century to make working conditions safer and increased wages, many companies do their best to undermine all these promises. The National Labor Relations Act will fix that: unions are officially recognized and will be supported by the government, an eight hour work day for all industries will be codified, and a national minimum wage will be established."

bill_9_passed_minimum_wage:0 "In one of the biggest changes to American economics in the 20th century, President Bobby Kennedy has signed the sweeping National Labor Relations Act into law. Overnight, the balance of power in the largest economy in the world was shifted, with workers and employees granted unalienable and legal rights that would further balance their position vis à vis their employers.\n\nOne of the NLRA's largest components include the recognition of trade unions, banning employers from firing workers or trying to intimidate and halt anyone who tries to organize any work places, with steep penalties and fines for any company found to have broken this law. Regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay is another large component of the NLRA. Penalties will be put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as "part-time", a "contractor" or "freelance", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would be re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n"The only way to maintain a strong economy and a strong democracy is to give everyone in the nation the ability to make a living," President Kennedy said as he signed the law. "To make enough to put food on their table and a roof over the head, to enjoy the fruits of their labor with leisure, and to maintain their dignity and freedom, never to be undermined by the greed and short-sightedness of their bosses."\n\nWhile opposition from business groups, conservatives, anti-unionists, and free market proponents has been intense, and Wall Street has seen a sharp drop in its value when the bill passed, the NLRA has proven to be popular with the majority of the American workers and voters. This will secure its place in American law for years to come."

USA_sen_bill_desc_15:0 "Education has long been the purview of the states and local governments, with no federal oversight or control except for some funding. But in the past decades, the Federal government has attempted to force the states to accept top-down dictates on how and what to teach. The Power to the States Bill will prevent this. It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the "Power to the States" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote.

Each state, county and city knows what is best for them."\n\nThis law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\nThe controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Pact, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states. But the law has passed, and a new normal for teaching will soon come to America."

Education in America, after the upheavals of the past few decades, will have a few more years of calm now at least."

USA_sen_bill_desc_16:0 "The Statue of Liberty says "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." Sadly, many may breathe free in America, but they die tired and poor regardless. It is unconscionable that so many Americans must suffer from want in a land of plenty, at the whim of 'market forces' - the predations of a bourgeois elite who care more for money than for dignity. Where individual states and capitalists will not act, the Federal government will intervene to provide comprehensive unemployment benefits and job support. This is the great calling of our times - the Crusade for the Common Man.\n\nWallace and the §gsegregationists§! in the NPP may have other ideas... but §Pthey don't matter§! anymore."

The social worker from Newark had been one of many to respond to the Smith Administration's call for new administrators in the federal bureaucracy, responsible for implementing the Federal Poverty Act and the Crusade for the Common Man.\n\nNow, surrounded by both earnest, but untested civil servants and the jaded, but experienced mandarins of Washington, she couldn't help but wonder if this was actually going to work.\n\nA screech of a microphone brought everyone to attention, as a greying gentleman, the Director, stepped up to the podium. "Ladies, gentlemen," he began. "I'm sure many of you have questions our mission to implement the Federal Poverty Act. Many of you will wonder if there is a plan, some kind of template for our work."\n\n"I will be honest. There is no template, no plan, no prior precedent." The Director surveyed the room, as Sally's eyes widened. "The coming days will be difficult, so I want you all to remember this. We are the vanguard of America's most ambitious social experiment, to grab the problem of poverty by the horns and to bring it to heel, with all the passion and wisdom at our disposal.""

USA_sen_bill_desc_17:0 "Progressive and conservative elements of the National Progressive Pact have always disagreed over the implementation of welfare programs. The Far-Right wing of the party, in particular, has been outspoken against welfare. Now, due to the poor nature of the South, whence much of the Far-Right draws its support, a compromise is possible. With Senator Michael Harrington of the Progressives and Governor George Wallace of the Nationalists working together, the new National Welfare Act would allow economic opportunity to millions of Americans, particularly in the South."
bill_17_passed:0 "After being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the National Welfare Act was passed in the Senate today and is soon to be signed into law by President Margaret Chase Smith. Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Pact and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Pact is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."
bill_17_failed:0 "After a period of being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the results are in: the National Welfare Act died in the Senate. There was no dramatic filibuster from the Republican Democrats, nor a surprising change of allegiances that swept the vote; rather, there simply was not enough political support behind the bill. Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result "unfortunate".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Pact over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the Progressives and Governor George Wallace of the Nationalists, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace. While they will likely recover their reputations, it seems unlikely that welfare legislation will be passing through Congress anytime soon."

# Harrington Bills

USA_sen_bill_name_20:0 "Elementary and Secondary Education Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_20:0 "Perhaps the well-being of a nation can best be measured by how its children are treated. If so, in America, that well-being is woeful at best for the poor and marginalized. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act seeks to address that issue. ESEA will provide substantially more funding to public schools, but the Act goes far beyond that. It also expands after-school programs, makes free breakfasts and lunches widely accessible and free of potential stigma, and, perhaps most radically, gives subsidies and tax breaks to poor parents who can verify their childrens' public school attendance. This suite of policies would improve grades, attendance, mental health, and basic childhood nutrition for millions of American children, in urban and rural areas alike."
USA_sen_bill_name_21:0 "Federal Healthcare Regulations Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21:0 "American healthcare is, like so many other things in this country, a massive enterprise. It's also an unequal one. Our hospitals are the envy of the world, yes, but millions of Americans don't have adequate insurance, if they have it at all. This burden falls especially hard on the poor and elderly. The Federal Healthcare Regulations Act will set minimum standards for all private insurers, requiring that they cover a variety of out-of-pocket expenses, non-hospital fees, and primary care, in contrast to the hospital-based business models we've seen before. HMOs may protest, and healthcare-providing business owners may balk, but it's a small price to pay for a healthier, more secure society."
USA_sen_bill_name_22:0 "The Food Stamps Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_22:0 "It is time to address one of the most fundamental problems within our Nation, the clawing hunger that pervades our lower classes. This new bill will begin handing out special stamps to our poor, these stamps can be used to purchase food. Passing this bill will hopefully allow us to put our agricultural surplus into the hands of those who need it most. Such "handouts" are unlikely to be popular with much of Congress, as such, we need to begin building support for our bill."
USA_sen_bill_name_23:0 "The Hunger Bill"
USA_sen_bill_desc_23:0 "Right now, there are people starving within our cities. Thousands sleep on the streets, unable to find shelter. Mothers desperately try to secure nourishment for their children. This injustice can not be allowed to go on any further. They may be impoverished, but they are our people, and they must be protected. Harrington's Hunger Bill seeks to begin mitigating these problems, and if possible, end them entirely."

This act will construct a safety net, to ensure that in times of need, our people can stay afloat. Unfortunately, this act is going to be quite expensive. We will have to determine an appropriate avenue of funding in order to guarantee this bill's success."
USA_HAR_economic_equality_act_desc:0 "The Workers of America has been mistreated by the greedy for far too long. In addition to providing economic security, our bill will begin to address the many problems of the worker. We will guarantee a high federal minimum wage, as well as implement a 8 hour workday. These measures are seen as radical by the majority of Congress, we are going to need to build a large amount of support if this bill has any chance of passing. If we are able to move mountains and get this bill passed, we will finally give our workers the rights that they deserve."
USA_sen_bill_name_25:0 "The Higher Education Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_25:0 "For all that the media harps on about long-haired draft dodgers and "women's libbers", higher education plays a vital role in the social and economic health of the nation. It produces our teachers, our doctors, our future leaders, and countless varieties of tradespeople. It's also not exactly cheap. The Higher Education Act seeks to fix that. It lowers costs for public colleges and universities that receive federal money, and provides additional subsidies to expand the student body. This will make it easier for poor and working-class students to get ahead in life. Of course, it's encountering opposition from dyed-in-the-wool conservatives and ostensibly progressive liberals alike, who claim that it will upend the order of things. To which the Harrington administration might respond, "It's about time.""
USA_sen_bill_name_26:0 "Affirmative Action Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_26:0 "One of the largest factors in the continuation of America's racial inequities has been lack of access. This can include access to employment, to promotion, to higher education, and so forth. Such a lack of access keeps families locked in a permanent cycle of poverty, keeping them from building wealth and improving their personal lot in life. And such a lack of access almost always falls on American minorities.\n\nThe Harrington administration is proposing the Affirmative Action Act, a plan to address these inequities directly. It will establish new hiring guidelines for federal contractors, give preferential support to minority-owned businesses, and implement quota systems to ensure that public colleges give more opportunities to the underserved. The GAO has estimated that such a plan, if implemented, would raise millions of peoples' incomes over the next twenty years. In addition, their report finds that the AAA has the potential to drastically improve standards of living in numerous communities across the country, and would measurably reduce the racial wealth gap."
USA_sen_bill_name_27:0 "Medical Care Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_27:0 "Insurance can be a good thing to have in a pinch, but regardless of how much it covers, if it leaves one destitute, it isn't much good. That's the case for millions of Americans, who are driven to bankruptcy, or just can't afford insurance in the first place. The Medical Care Act, or Medicare, would change that. It would create a government insurance program that citizens could voluntarily sign up for, if they met certain income criteria. Such a program would cover any and all prescription, primary care, and hospital needs. Medicare could serve as the foundation for a truly universal American healthcare system. But the potential costs, paid through income taxes, have raised more than a few eyebrows in Middle America."
USA_sen_bill_name_28:0 "The Veterans Service Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_28:0 "Harrington will start his program to remake America with a softball: by legislating in benefits for America's weary heroes, the serviceman who sacrifice life and limb in the defense of liberty. Nobody will object to the nation rewarding those who served it so bravely overseas - from educational benefits to expanded healthcare access, all of America can agree that its warriors deserve a home fit for heroes."

# Goldwater Bills

USA_sen_bill_name_30:0 "Goldwater's New Budget!"
USA_sen_bill_desc_30:0 "President Goldwater's proposed budget bill would drastically cut welfare and social security spending, and instead focus on debt reduction and paving the way for the free market. While the budget would provide the foundation for Goldwater's domestic policy if it were to be accepted by Congress, it is rather unpopular at the moment. The administration would need to reach out if it wants its bill to have any chance of passing."
bill_30_passed:0 "In what is sure to be a landmark moment for President Goldwater's administration, the proposed budget has been accepted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Initially highly unpopular and still polarising even now, extensive lobbying has managed to secure the support necessary for the bill being passed.\n\nThe bill, which includes the slashing of welfare and social security budgets, has paved the way for the President's broader economic and fiscal agenda. While it is uncertain how this budgetary reorientation is going to impact the American economy in the long run, analysts have been cautiously optimistic. The Goldwater administration meanwhile, is overjoyed at this major political victory. It is likely the administration will want to capitalise on the momentum the passing of the budget has generated, and more proposals are expected to follow.\n\nAs could have been expected however, the adoption of the budget has unfortunately widened the divisions within the Republicans-Democrats. Many Republicans have expressed their deep opposition to the President's fiscal agenda. Consequently, many of them now feel tempted to flock into the welcoming and eager arms of the Progressive NPP. How this will affect the stability of the coalition will remain to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, it is a major victory for the White House and Secretary Don Regan in particular, whose fiscal philosophy, dubbed "Reganomics", has been the cornerstone of the bill. This victory is a momentous occasion which is undoubtedly to lead to the popping of champagne bottles in the oval office. Certainly, the President can sleep a little easier knowing this battle has been won."
bill_30_failed:0 "In a bitter defeat for President Goldwater's, the budget bill his administration has proposed some weeks ago has been rejected by congress. Having been unpopular from the start, the bill's defeat has come as no surprise to many. Still, the administration had made every effort to garner enough political support to see the bill passed. It now seems however, that these efforts were to no avail, as the bill lies dead on the floor of congress.\n\nWith the rejection of the President's budget, the flagship of the White House's economic and fiscal agenda has been sunk. Weeks of hard work have been undone in a single stroke and it seems ever more uncertain if President Goldwater will be able to push the other elements of his fiscal and economic agenda through congress. For now, the new administration's efforts have been stopped dead in their tracks. Reportedly the cabinet is currently convening in a room in the West Wing on how to proceed from here on out. Secretary Don Regan, whose fiscal philosophy has been a central component of the bill, seems particularly infuriated at the news of the bill's defeat.\n\nOpponents of the bill have been overjoyed however, with the Republican half of the Republicans-Democrats having found cause to celebrate. How this will affect the Democrats' position is uncertain, although this legislative defeat has certainly shown their weakness. In any case, it is a serious blow to the President's agenda. The White House will have to find a way to regain the initiative."

Opposite of him, Senator Richard Russell Jr., representing his faction of the NPP.\n\n"Mister President-" Russell began. "-I've looked at your bill in detail, and I am convinced it can be salvaged." Goldwater knew exactly what "salvaged" meant here. He had no illusions who he was dealing with, and what sort of price Russell would ask in exchange for cooperation. It was why the President had invited him here today, hoping that Russel's demands wouldn't be too outrageous. On the other side of the table Senator Russell looked at him with appraising eyes. The Georgian senator too, knew perfectly well who he was dealing with. Goldwater was many things, but committed on the issue of civil rights he was not. Russell was well aware of the President's ambivalence on the matter. Such ambivalence might be an opening for Russel's own political agenda, so he thought to himself. If the President was willing to budge here, Russell would be able to budge on the topic of finance.\n\n"It seems to us that your budget proposal entails a significant reduction in spending, freeing up a significant amount of federal funds." the President could already guess where Russell was going with this. "Perhaps it is time some of these funds made their way back to the south.'" Russell leaned forward on the table, closing the physical distance between him and the President. "We'd be willing to lend you the votes you need, Mr. President."

Rarely the occasional aide briefly interrupted as they entered to refill the two state men's coffee cups. Through the windows they could see the sun make its daily retreat beyond the horizon, giving way to the night.\n\nGoldwater sat not behind his desk, but opposite of Rockefeller on one of the couches with a coffee table in between them. Despite Rockefeller being Goldwater's vice-President, the inner politics of the Republicans-Democrats had complicated their working relationship significantly. Indeed, many times Rockefeller had been a vocal critic of the President's proposed course.\n\nOn the coffee table before them laid an assortment of papers. They were parts of the proposed budget bill, with certain clauses underlined or stricken with a pen: the result of three hours of back-and-forth between the two men.\n\n"I'm asking you to put the party first, Barry." it was the first time Rockefeller had addressed the President by his first name. It took Goldwater by surprise, but there was no hint of disrespect in Rockefeller's voice. "If we agree on this, you'll get your budget, and we'll keep the party intact."\n\nGoldwater leaned back on his couch, thinking to himself. In the back of his head he still heard the ringing of secretary Regan's urgings not to compromise. Yet the deal Rockefeller offered was a tempting bargain. If he was willing to slow down just a little bit and water down the budget bill, his vice-President would make sure the Democrats would support it. Rockefeller leaned forward and clasped his hands together as he awaited the President's reply.\n\n"Nelson, here's where I stand.""

This proposed piece of legislation would finally put a cap on the debt ceiling, and reduce the debt we have acquired over the last decades."

The administration's effort to put a cap on the debt ceiling, the 'financial responsibility and erasure of debt' bill, has gained the requisite amount of votes to be accepted by both houses of congress. The money freed up by President Goldwater's reduction in welfare spending now has a place to go. As a result, the United States of America has taken the first steps towards eliminating its national debt and ending the long-standing self-destructive policy of deficit spending.\n\nThis cap marks a minor milestone in the series of fiscal measures proposed by President Goldwater. While the bill is but a sideshow to the greater ambitions of the President, any victory in the American political colosseum is to be welcomed. Morale has surged amongst the President's supporters, and the Democratic wing of the Republicans-Democrats feels particularly empowered. It looks good for the President and his administration as now they have shown they can deliver on their promises and that they can cash the checks they write. This victory is bound to play particularly well in the South. The existence of vast national debt is humiliating to a proud and prosperous nation such as America, and many Southerners share this patriotic sentiment.\n\nWith this victory, the Goldwater administration can set its targets on the next piece of legislation."

The administration and its supporters are disappointed. It seems that for now, America debt ceiling will remain uncapped.\n\nThe failure of the bill is regrettable, but it is no disaster. Ultimately, the bill was but a sideshow to the greater ambitions of the President. Yet the rejection of the bill has made a few question whether the President can deliver on his promises and whether he can keep his party together.\n\nInternal divisions within the Republicans-Democrats proved to be the bill's undoing. Republican support of the bill was far from unanimous, and it seems that this dissent was the bill's death knell. It proves that the lingering cleavages within the party are still as relevant as ever. Reportedly, President Goldwater himself has voiced his frustration with the Republicans in congress to his vice-President, Nelson Rockefeller, himself a Republican.\n\nPresident Goldwater will have to hope he has more luck next time."

This way, we can end our dependence on the much more unstable silver: that second-rate inferior metal. In doing so, the ever-increasing trend towards inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks and prices will be stabilised.

This move has been welcomed by many in the financial market.\n\nThe passing of the bill is no major surprise to the Goldwater administration or most political observers.

Senator Jackson was known as a dedicated opponent of both communism and fascism, and this made Goldwater like him at least somewhat, despite their differences.\n\n"Thank you for coming over, senator." Goldwater said as he entered the oval office, Senator Jackson being seated already. Goldwater dismissed the aide accompanying him and sat down behind his desk. The President explained his ambition: getting America back on the gold standard. All the while Jackson listened while smiling politely. When the President was done Jackson leaned forward in his seat and shared his thoughts.\n\n"Mr. President. I think we can come to an agreement here." a smile formed on Goldwater's face. "But let's look at some of your administration's other policies first. Specifically, what you're doing to the unions." Goldwater's smile changed into a more neutral expression, awaiting what would come next.

From his intonation, Goldwater could already sense the looming word 'but'.\n\n"But-" Russell continued. "-I do have concerns on how this affects business." Goldwater was a laissez-faire man through and through, and Russell knew that an appeal to the President's belief in entrepreneurship was as good a bet as any. Still, Goldwater knew very well Russel's real reasons were much more pragmatic. In politics, everything has a price.\n\n"I am worried about business in the South.", and there it was, the reason for Russell having entered the White House today. Goldwater already knew Russell was fishing for some kind of exemption or preferential measure, but he would let Russell say it aloud himself first. Instead of getting to the point, Russell went off on a tangent about legalities building up to the question of how he wanted to achieve an exemption exactly. It was the kind of convoluted argument that would hold up in a court, but convince not a single rational individual.\n\nThe President can have his CWA, in return, Russell wants his CWA to apply just a little bit less to the South."

After all, we should preserve the beauty of God's creation for the coming generations." the senator took a breath, leaned forward, and continued "But let me be quite frank, the last thing I want is a federal board telling Southern businesses what they can and can not do do." Goldwater listened attentively and leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of water. "Be a bit more specific, Richard." he requested, as sometimes the political double-talk that plagued D.C. became too tedious for anyone to bear.\n\nRussell grinned and continued as requested "If we were to be a bit more involved in how this agency is run, it would certainly assuage some of our worst fears." The President inquired further: "If I am understanding correctly, you want your people on the board." Senator Russell smiled and shrugged in an exaggerated fashion, but the President already knew now what Russell wanted. "Well, Southerners from the NPP, definitely.

This law would officially ban segregation nationwide, desegregate the armed forces, and institute a series of voting rights protections, to be enforced by the Department of Justice.

The draft bill goes into greater detail about military procurement and development programs than any preceding legislation, laying out a multi-year, program-based budget to address the McNamara administration's specific needs from the military. It also comes with a price tag to match its ambition - something the NPP's peaceniks and fiscal conservatives have been eager to oppose - but President McNamara believes that defending America can't be done on the cheap."

The Foreign Relations Executive Efforts Act will grant administrations the ability to respond quickly and decisively to foreign conflicts that affect American interests - with a 'Deployments, Overseas Military' provision for deploying American military units overseas if deemed necessary.\n\nMuch opposition is expected to the FREE Act and it's DOM provision. Constitutional hardliners within the RDC and more dovish members of the NPP are already arguing that the Act would gut Congress' traditional powers to declare and prosecute wars in the pursuit of short-term geopolitical objectives.

USA_sen_bill_desc_421:0 "The Family Assistance Against Injustice Act, better known as the FAAI, is a piece of legislation crafted by Jesse Helms and championed by the Schlafly administration to instate a nationwide prohibition on abortion. Expansive in its aims and its attempts to interfere with state authority, the bill would redefine legal personhood as beginning at conception for all people across the United States regardless of "race, sex, health, or condition." The Department of Justice would be given funding to enforce this law and any person found seeking, performing, or otherwise facilitating an abortion could face various charges, up to and including manslaughter.\n\nNeedless to say, the bill has created a firestorm. Women's liberation activists see this as an unconstitutional infringement on their reproductive rights. Many moderates are uncomfortable that the federal government has stepped in to prohibit a practice that has only recently become legal in a handful of states and which the courts are only beginning to address. Only members of the far right and religious right have come out in enthusiastic support of Schlafly's actions."

Its authors claim that, for the United States "occupies a special, preordained role in preserving the high culture of Western civilization", information which depicts the country in a negative manner must be punished accordingly, and its distribution subsequently curtailed.\n\nIn service of those ends, the SAFE Act stipulates press restrictions reminiscent of similar measures instituted during the Second World War. News of all media must be vetted by relevant federal agencies for "propaganda" before public dissemination; likewise, entertainment and associated paraphernalia must adhere to strict content guidelines established and enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe act is derided by both Republican-Democrats and non-ANV National Progressives alike as a blatant assault on the American people's First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, quiet voices beyond the President's abstruse worldview argue in favor of conceding free speech in order to sate his growing, and rapidly radicalizing, base.\n\nBut better things are yet to come, claims President Yockey.

As one African-American woman in Atlanta related, " President Bennett's taken a larger step forward than anyone else regarding civil rights, but we've all been here before, with empty words and nothing to show for it."\n\nMany in the nation, however, are relieved with President Bennett's success, figuring that if more issues arise, they can be handled in due time. This sentiment, however, is not shared by the RDC's Southern Democrats and the Nationalist branch of the NPP. With this latest act, the Southern Democrats are likely to tilt further to the Nationalists on concerns over federal overreach."

President Bennett remarked that the bill's failure "serves as an example on how great of a divide there is between the leaders of the nation."\n\nAfrican-Americans across the country have expressed their deep disappointment upon hearing the news from Washington, with one man stating that:\n\n"We are tired, just so damn tired. We've been trying to win our protections and rights for so long - and nobody ever listens."\n\nMeanwhile, across the South and beyond, Democrats and Nationalists in the NPP have declared the failure of the Voting Rights Act to be a unmitigated success. Southern Democrats have lined up before the media to crow about their "pride in the protection of our states' rights," while Southern Nationalist congressmen went further in declaring that "the federal government ought to learn it needs to mind its own damned business!""

For African-Americans, the President and his administration are a rare light of hope in a Democratic Party that has more often sided with the status quo, with one man praising the President for "stepping past his political leanings to serve the people."\n\nHowever, many Southern Democrats have publicly criticized the bill for "overstepping the States' rights to make decisions for themselves." Furthermore, the Nationalist branch of the NPP has sided with the Southern Democrats, claiming that the law is "an act of tyranny by the federal Government." It is left in the hands of the executive branch to implement and ensure that the Voting Rights Act can fulfill its promise for African-Americans."

"Decades of failure in the legal system have fed our anger, and once again the President's promises were empty!" one protestor argued.\n\nIn statehouses across the South, the Democratic and Nationalist opposition celebrate their victory. One Southern Democrat stated that "the extreme measures of the Voting Rights Act far exceeded what the Federal Government can decide in regards to States' rights." Southern leaders in the Nationalist Caucus were less circumspect, with one politician declaring that "segregation is here to remain in the United States, whether the Republicans like it or not!""

Even back in November, when the Associated Press announced her victory and the NPP headquarters exploded in a hurricane of cheers and hoorays, she left the party as soon as the cameras turned off, returning to her office to put some finishing touches on her foreign policy concept.\n\nBut today, Smith decided to celebrate. It was nothing massive, of course - a mere flute of champagne before today's stack of paperwork - but the gesture itself was all that mattered. After decades of work, of politics, of endless traveling across the American continent, she finally accomplished something monumental. People rarely feel the effects of whatever goes on in Washington, but this bill was sure to fundamentally change the lives of millions of Americans for the better. Her campaign was all about Japan and Germany, but Smith herself never forgot about the nation that mattered the most - America.\n\nMargaret took one last sip of champagne before returning to her duties. It was remarkably sweet, a taste that reminded her of her younger years, back when she was nothing but an office worker at Daniel E. Cummings Woolen Company and had enough time for a regular social life, enough time to go out with her friends or have friends at all. Sometimes, she missed these times - but days like this one reminded her that giving it all up has been very much worth it.\n\nShe put her glass aside and went back to work.

Yet underlying these atrocities is an essence that, for good or ill, so defines America's character that its qualities are imbued unto the nation's body politic: an uncontrollable drive to delve where none else had ventured.\n\nWe have chosen to harness America's pioneering spirit towards rectifying the injustices its elites had meted, and in restoring the justices they had deprived, for the Hall administration's first bill constitutes nothing less than an unprecedented leap towards racial equality. Its provisions surpass Harrington's vision for his "unseen Americans", itself miles ahead of the Republican-Democrats' pissant attempts at compromise. Abolishing the South's much-abused loopholes, enforcing total desegregation at the federal government's leisure, enacting affirmative action to all aspects of public life - what even idealists call fantasy, our version of the Civil Rights Act translates into leatherbound law.\n\nTrue justice will face no shortage of impediments between itself and Black America. Liberals will decry its breakneck pace for disregarding the milquetoast "baby steps" over which they obsess.

Historically, African Americans had little help from the government in their fight for freedom; even the Fifteenth Amendment only gave blacks the right to vote on paper. There was no way of enforcing the policy, and over time, Southern States exploited loopholes in order to maintain the status quo of the land: poll taxes, literacy tests, the infamous "Grandfather clause". All of this would change when the senators voted in favor of passing this bill. Desegregationists rejoiced, Southern politicians foamed at the mouth.\n\nThis act sternly outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Unequal voting requirements were abolished; schools, businesses, and other public accommodations were officially desegregated. African Americans essentially gained the right to go to any school, work for any business, and attend any public facility they choose. As a whole, African Americans had political power that the race had never seen before, and this was only the first step towards full desegregation.\n\nBut not all was well in the South. Immediately, Southern voters flocked to the NPP's Nationalist Caucus in hopes that the bill would be reversed, that society would return to normal. Many Southerners despised this blatant attack on their livelihood, and with support from Southern politicians, they had the power to physically defeat desegregation.

The bill would also empower the U.S. Attorney General to pursue lawsuits against states, school districts, and other entities that undermine the ability of individuals to exercise these rights.\n\nWhile Kennedy presents a strong face, it is well-known in Washington that the bill is a ghost of its former self. Subjected to a slow campaign of attrition by Southern senators, protests by segregationists, and antipathy from the White House, Black leaders were forced to watch as stronger provisions pertaining to labor rights, hiring discrimination, and police brutality were stripped away. Many on both sides have come to blame Nixon for the current state of affairs-with segregationists outraged that the President let the bill move through Congress at all and civil rights advocates accusing Nixon of attempting to sabotage his Vice President to remove a potential challenger in the 1964 presidential primary."

I am therefore most pleased to be resolving this discrepancy today. This is truly a historic moment, and as a woman it is a deeply personal moment as well. In signing this act, I look forward to the day when my brave sisters will play their part in reclaiming our temporarily occupied territories.""
USA_failed_RR:0 "President [GetPresidentLastName] was deeply disappointed by the Senate's failure to pass the WOMEN Act today. While the party had aimed to build a broad enough coalition to implement gender equality in the Armed Forces, resistance from conservative Democrats, cautious Republicans, and renegade NPP senators doomed the act.\n\nThis grave legislative defeat has set back Women's equality for years, and it is unlikely the NPP will make another attempt at similar legislation in the near future. The dreams held by countless American women of serving their country in the military have been dashed by sexist reactionary politics today."
STROM_passed_RR:0 "In a move few were expecting from this lame duck, President Thurmond successfully passed and signed the WOMEN Act into law today and opened up military assistance roles to women.\n\nThis was a surprising move coming from a traditionalist Dixiecrat; it is especially surprising that he was able to muster enough support in the Senate to get this bill through. His approval rating has been in a free-fall ever since he took office and his hopes in the next election grow bleaker by the day.\n\nIt is likely that he passed this bill in order to salvage the support of the hawkish northern members of the Far-Right bloc. They are certainly more open-minded on gender issues than the Dixiecrats, at least when it comes to improving our military might. One can only speculate how well this will play out for Thurmond, but it's doubtful this will be enough to save his legacy in the future."
LEMAY_passed_RR:0 "After a swift passage through the Senate, the WOMEN Act has been signed into law by President LeMay. The act allows women to serve in military assistance roles for the first time in U.S. history. The act is hailed by its supporters as an important step forward in gender equality and is derided by its critics as a threat to the traditional order of American society. It is particularly surprising that the former Vice President of a conservative Dixiecrat like Wallace would pass this remarkably progressive piece of legislation.\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after signing the bill, President LeMay remarked, "A lot of people advised me not to sign this bill. They said it would damage any chance I have at re-election. But I'm a general, not a politician, and my loyalties are with the women who have wanted to serve their country but were always told no by stick-in-the-mud politicians. I never asked to be President and the women this bill will help have asked to serve for a long, long time. I'm using the time I have in office to do what's right for this country; to do the things my predecessor was too afraid to do. This country needs these women in uniform more than it needs me in the White House so frankly, my dears, I don't give a damn about re-election. Thank you.""

In this desire for the care of servicemen, the LeMay administration managed to construct the greatest expansion of the G.I. Bill to date, adding several expanding chapters which include a growth of pensions for veterans of the Second World War, as well as a controversial chapter to explicitly introduce African-American servicemen as beneficiaries of the G.I. Bill. Eventually, as the dust settles, LeMay finds pride in his success through the Senate, as the chapters stand approved.\n\nPresident Curtis LeMay, in an act of self-satisfaction and pride of his country, stands as one of the most happy in the eventual passage of the bill. Having been harassed regarding the needs of African-American veterans, and the overall need of veterans as a whole, President LeMay has used the opportunity to throw together several celebrations alongside figures in the military high command as well as veterans throughout the countries. "Though I appear to you as Commander-in-Chief, know that it is I who seeks to serve you, now, after all your years of service."\n\nHowever, as all things within the span of the Wallace and LeMay presidencies, nothing can stand without the potential rise of controversy in its wake. In particular, Progressives throughout the country have criticized the Nationalists' focus on veteran social standing when all of the country has been put through economic hardships, some of which they say "comes from the Nationalists' insessance of a free market." One group of Republican protesters in Washington D.C. continued to shout "They fight, we fight, we all fight!" while waving around banners depicting X's over the President's face."

President Curtis LeMay, a man known for his service to his country above all other political schemes, worked towards the expansion of the G.I. Bill to grow benefits towards veterans of the Second World War, as well as several chapters working to include African-American servicemen into such benefits. However, despite the dedication to their country, the Senate refused to agree upon the bill, and thus left it as a failure.\n\nThe administration alongside President Curtis LeMay can be, in witnessing the Senate's refusal to sign the chapters of expansion towards the G.I. Bill, appalled. Appalled over the failure to pass such a bill. Appalled to learn of the failure of the country to its veterans. Appalled in seeing the thousands of veterans out there who suffer, day in, and day out, hurt by political scheming taking precedence over humanity. "How could anyone call themselves a patriot in acknowledging that they have destroyed simple aid towards those who gave themselves over to fight the Nazis, to fight the Japanese, to fight tyranny and despots themselves?" President LeMay said, regarding the failure.\n\nHowever, despite the shaming remarks lashed out by the President, many stand proud of their defiance of the Nationalists. In particular, many sects of Progressive wings sought to stand against President LeMay and the administration inside the White House, claiming that the President's actions had only been an opening into furthering Wallace's Nationalist ideals. "LeMay doesn't know what he's doing out there, and yeah, maybe he wants to look good for all those who served their country. But everyone knows if we just sit back and watch, it's gonna be Wallace all over again," said one leftist organizer."

This has been the descriptor behind the Civil Rights movement and its constant battle throughout the United States' modern history, crawling its way into political, economic, cultural, and now militaristic ways of life throughout the United States of America. The constant fights have exhausted Americans throughout the country, with the clashing coming to a head as the military has come under fire for being regarded as racially segregated and, thus, without justice to all Americans. President LeMay, refusing to allow a military without prosperity, brought together his administration to produce the National Armed Forces Freedom Act, establishing quotas for African-American prominence in military units, which has found outstanding success in the Senate and shall be signed into law.\n\nOnce more, the Presidency of Curtis LeMay, whether concerned over the needs of the Nationalists and the National Progressive Pact or not, has issued a new sweeping reform of the Armed Forces in the United States, pleasing both himself as Commander-in-Chief and the hardlining military staff within the administration and beyond. Throughout the country, African-American veterans of the Second World War have gathered, some back into their old military units, to celebrate President LeMay's long-needed reforms. "We fought just as hard as any white soldier did, whether they were in the Pacific, or out there on top of machine guns in England. We did what we had to do, and the government finally recognizes that other African-Americans will do as well," said one African-American retired Lieutenant, having fought in the Army.\n\nHowever, despite the generally well-received nature of NAFFA, others remain statuesque in their desire to stand against the Nationalist involvement in the government, even if a lack of apparent organized protest has occurred. "I am just as willing to support African-Americans in the military as anybody else, I stand alongside any African-American fighting for justice throughout society. But I can't support the Nationalists handing out anything else and looking to get something out of this goodness." Meanwhile, other fringe far right groups under the banner of Francis Parker Yockey have protested against President LeMay's actions as well, lamenting the association between the two wings of the NPP."

And now, after the decisive effort to bring about the National Armed Forces Freedom Act, which would maintain quotas and, thus, allow for greater expansions of African-American servicemen. However, opposed to President LeMay, NAFFA only found failure in its attempts to expand its outreach, having been shot down by the Senate.\n\nPresident Curtis LeMay, although typically not the greatest figurehead in the world of civil liberties, was reportedly "displeased at the highest level" upon hearing the failure of NAFFA, having it shown to be a failure of the military at the hands of Congressmen, rather than justly on the battlefield. "If Senators wish to exclude African-Americans from service as we wish to maintain, then that is their duty. But mark my words in knowing that I have fought dearly for you, the young Americans who seek to serve their strong, godly country." African-American veterans of the Second World War protested the acts of the Senate, having organized marches upon the steps of Washington D.C.\n\nDespite the lengthy efforts of the President and his administration in working towards the progressiveness of the United States military, some remain silently proud regarding the Nationalists' senatorial failure. Many groups have claimed several statements regarding their support of African-Americans looking to serve their country, but their outright refusal in bending towards the desires of the Nationalists. "All LeMay wanted was to look nice so that he could put in the next big Nationalist hammer of oppression. I can't stand by to allow that to happen, and it appears that the wise men and women of the Senate can't do so, willingly, either," says one African-American worker, wishing to remain anonymous amid the controversy."

The bill outlaws discrimination based on race, color, and religion. It prohibits unequal application of voting laws, allows the Department of Justice to prosecute incidents of redlining, and would integrate schools across the nation.\n\nWhile some activists see gaps, the proposal is undeniably ambitious and already sparking fights nationwide. §rSuccess§! or §xfailure§! could deeply radicalize an already divided nation."

Out on the lawn was a small choreographed scene falling into disarray. There was a crowd of decrepit senators, standing stiff and uncomfortable before snapping cameras. There were a handful of civil rights activists, still in shock that "Bombs Away LeMay" had somehow pushed a real civil rights bill through Congress. At the center of it all, was her husband, smiling broadly and looking ridiculous sitting in front of a tiny bill-signing table. Clinging to him were dozens of Black little boys and girls.\n\nHelen smiled as Curtis pulled a small kindergartener in a suit onto his lap and handed him one of his pens, which the boy immediately put into his mouth. The children, students at the Thaddeus Stevens School in Washington, had been her idea. Curtis had always been fond of children and always been willing to open up to them in a way he didn't with other people. She'd passed the idea along to some member of his staff as a way to get him to be less stiff, to be more human. When people looked at her husband, she wanted them to see more than a cigar-chomping caricature. She wanted them to see a man ready to serve as President for all Americans.\n\nOf course, there were people who wouldn't like that. It seemed that every letter thanking Curtis came paired with a death threat. Just the other day, police had stopped a man at the Capitol with a bomb strapped to his chest. The day before, some raving fascist had tried to climb over the White House's wrought-iron fence. On television were images of celebrating Black Americans and dark rallies attended by growing throngs of discontented whites. At the head of them was a pale, thin man warning of the threat of "miscegenation and liberalism" and vowing to stop it at all cost.\n\nBut for now, Helen pushed these thoughts from her mind. There would be a time to worry about the future. For now, she wanted to celebrate what her husband had achieved, to acknowledge the countless lives that would be transformed by his hard work. As a girl hugged Curtis and he erupted into laughter, Helen stepped into the Rose Garden and into the brilliant day."

When Wallace had come to her husband and asked him to join his ticket, Helen had begged and pleaded with her husband to reject the offer. It would destroy him, she said, transform him from a hero to a bum.\n\nNow, years later, she found herself sitting numbly in the White House residence, hands clasped together, waiting for her husband after the failure of his civil rights act. On the television there were pictures of rioters spreading across the country, of laughing segregationists, of some smirking communist speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis. The one thing that united them all was a burning hatred of her husband. It was not just that he had betrayed Wallace but that he had failed, that he had once again proven that no man escapes from the morass of Washington.\n\nHelen heard the click of an open door behind her. She turned to see her husband. There was no anger in his face, no sign of the clever, cigar-chomping character invented by the newspapers. The Curtis LeMay she saw looked gaunt and hollow, his face empty of all hope. The only time she had ever seen him look like this was when he came home after the War, when they sat in her mother's little kitchen in Cleveland and he told her in a deadened voice of all the cruelty he had inflicted. For nothing.\n\nShe felt herself rise and wrap her arms around his stiff form. "Things will get better. You did your best," she whispered as the television sputtered nightmare upon nightmare. "There will be someone else from the party. There will be someone willing to go as far as you were."\n\nAs they stood there in the residence, sounds of screams and jeering all around them, she heard a soft reply."

Second, it also strips away various regulations that limit how these institutions seek and receive donations and how they manage their endowments, provided they first increase enrollment to meet certain benchmarks.

### Benett CFN bill
USA_sen_bill_name_700: "The Trade Expansion Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_700: "The Trade Expansion Act is a radical attempt to promote free trade, perhaps the most radical attempt to be seriously considered by the US Congress. Masterminded by Secretary of Commerce Henry Fowler, the bill would grant the President of the United States unprecedented authority to negotiate tariff reductions with other nations by up to 80 percent. It includes various provisions meant to spur free trade arrangements and otherwise "strengthen mutual trade benefits in an open and nondiscriminating way."\n\nWhile the bill has enthusiastic support from the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups who extol the virtues of free trade in "unshackling America's economic potential," the response in other quarters has been notably muted. Trade unions have expressed concern that unrestricted trade will undermine US wages and encourage manufacturers to relocate their factories overseas. Even the White House's support appears tepid, with the President offering bland platitudes about the ways the bill would expand OFN cooperation and little more."

The bill would instigate a reform of the federal bureaucracy, splitting the existing Department of Health, Education, and Welfare into three new departments—the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the Department of Urban Affairs.\n\nThe bill is seen in Washington as part long-needed reform and part overture to current Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Jane Jacobs, a way to allow her to operate autonomously on urban reform while ensuring Morrison's ownership over other priorities. While generally supported by liberals as a way of continuing the programs of the Hart Administration, conservatives have argued that the bill dramatically expands the size and scope of the federal government."

USA_sen_bill_name_21002: "Land Reform Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21002: "Introduced by Rep. Donald H. Clausen of California, the Land Reform Act is the first conservative package seeking to reform the Urban Renewal Initiative. The bill would allow public housing authorities to refurbish and sell units to private interests and, in certain contexts, allow these groups and individuals to purchase extra rooms and sell them for marked-up costs.\n\nThe proposal has been characterized by the Hoover Institution and other conservative groups as a vital reform that both provides flexibility to communities and ensures the solvency of public housing. However, the bill has been loudly condemned by many liberals and urban reformers as defeating the purpose of public housing, reducing the number of affordable units and reducing the overall housing supply."

USA_sen_bill_name_21003: "America's Choice Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21003: "The America's Choice Act, introduced by Indiana Representative Earl Landgrebe, is a conservative package that seeks to reform jobs programs initiated under the Urban Renewal Act. The bill would transfer administration, control, and financing of existing federal jobs programs to "private sector partners." While these programs would still be liable to some degree of federal oversight, program sponsors would be free to use workers for any purpose they deemed fit. Employers would further be free to disregard federal requirements on affirmative action.\n\nThe bill's sponsors have argued that this bill reduces distortions in the market created by the previous Hart Administration, removing the federal government from most job markets and ensuring employment figures are not artificially inflated. Proponents also point to projections by the Congressional Budget Office suggesting that the bill would substantially reduce federal spending without significantly impacting the economy. Liberals, including former Hart officials, have strongly opposed this bill for reducing support for workers."

USA_sen_bill_name_21004: "Responsibility in Government Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21004: "Representative Paul Laxalt's Responsibility in Government Act is a conservative bill created with the ostensive goal of furthering accountability and transparency in government. If passed, all recipients of federal funding through the Urban Renewal Initiative would be required to complete and submit an audit on their financial activities within 24 months. Additionally, some funding currently devoted to Urban Renewal Initiative grant programs would instead be redirected to fund investigations into alleged corruption.\n\nThe bill is part of a larger conservative effort to identify waste, fraud, and mismanagement that may harm taxpayers. While it has received mild support in the press as a straight-forward good governance bill, many liberals have warned that the bill places the URI under permanent investigation, at its own cost, and would provide its opponents with a steady stream of examples of urban malfeasance. Others have expressed concern that the audits could discourage some smaller municipalities from seeking URI funding."

USA_sen_bill_name_21005: "Workers' Welfare Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21005: "The Workers' Welfare Act is Earl Landgrebe's latest attempt to modify the Urban Renewal Initiative. The bill would, quite simply, require those seeking welfare through federal programs to provide evidence that they have or are actively seeking full-time employment. Those unable to prove they are seeking gainful employment would face steadily increasing "penalties" limiting the amount of welfare money available to them and their families.\n\nThe Workers' Welfare Act has been applauded by a variety of conservative activists, including Missouri firebrand Phyllis Schlafly, as both reducing federal expenditures and providing people with "incentive" to pursue work. These individuals argue that current programs reward "laziness" and other self-destructive behavior. Urban activists have roundly condemned the bill, saying that there is little evidence that welfare programs disincentivize job seeking and that the bill harms those already facing financial hardship."

USA_sen_bill_name_21006: "Transportation Assessment Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21006: "Paul Laxalt's Transportation Assessment Act is the latest conservative attack on the Urban Renewal Initiative, one targeting its most basic component: infrastructure. Recognizing the huge costs that the United States Government took upon itself to manage and maintain previously privatized rail and road systems, the Transportation Assessment Act would re-privitize these transportation networks. Properties currently held by the government would be available for bid by private interests, both removing recurring maintenance costs as well as granting the government a one-time infusion of cash to address challenges such as the Oil Crisis.\n\nMany private sector companies argue that the bill would represent a return to normalcy for the United States. Many of the roads and railways held by the government operated sufficiently before federal involvement and would likely continue to do so if re-privatized. Many in Philip Hart's cabinet view this as a dramatic winnowing of the government's ambitions and one that could bring a permanent end to efforts to improve transportation management."

USA_sen_bill_name_21009: "Presidential Libraries Act of [GetYear]"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21009: "The Presidential Libraries Act of [GetYear] is a bill written by the senior advisors of H.E.W. Secretary Jane Jacobs and President Chep Morrison to transform the historical archival process for Presidents. The bill would establish a publicly accessible, federally funded system of facilities dedicated to preserving the papers, records, and all other material pertaining to former US Presidents. Certain decision-making authorities pertaining to the style, operation, and location of these facilities would be granted by the former Presidents themselves (acting with oversight from the National Archives) or, in lieu of them, their immediate family.\n\nThe bill has garnered broad support across Congress, with even the most firebrand conservatives refusing to provide robust opposition. Many see this bill as a way to guarantee the legacies of the past generation, to preserve examples of political honesty and integrity for future generations. Many in the press have hailed what they see as a new system of civic temples and hope that past Presidents — among them Philip Hart — remain in the public consciousness forever."

USA_sen_bill_name_21007: "Federal Finance Act of [GetYear]"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21007: "The Federal Finance Act is the latest conservative effort to bring an end to the Urban Renwal Initiative using Congress's oversight authority. If passed, the bill would impose intense restrictions on URI recipient cities. Any city that receives URI funding and runs a deficit would be stripped of debt protection. Cities that are consistently unable to deliver balanced budgets would be forced to drop out of the URI and made ineligible for future loan and grant packages.\n\nThe advocates of this bill, including Representatives Laxalt, Clausen, and Landgrebe, have not concealed that their intention is to force as many cities to drop from the URI as possible. While there has been vague language about ensuring cities don't abuse taxpayer money, the overall objective is clearly to cripple an expansive federal program supported by liberal Democrats."

USA_sen_bill_name_21008: "Urban Divorce Bill"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21008: "The Urban Divorce Bill is a sweeping conservative attempt to reverse the "consolidation" of metropolitan areas into large, "ungovernable" municipalities. The bill would require the Census Bureau to assess each community by zoning. Then, based on this assessment, communities containing demonstrably different types of housing would be split into new groupings. In practice, this bill would end urban sprawl by permanently severing suburbs and exurbs from downtown urban areas. All future federal funding would then be made based on these reduced groupings.\n\nThe bill is a transparent effort to reduce the strength of cities and the amount of URI funding they are eligible for. If passed, it would effectively kill the initiative and seriously compromise the ability of cities to seek federal support through other programs. City leaders have spent the last week begging Congress not to pursue this bill, warning of cataclysmic consequences if signed into law."

Furthermore, the bill comes with anti-discrimination provisions to guarantee equality in education and prevent the existence of a tiered education system.\n\nThe bill found the support of much of the RD coalition senators as well as the Progressives of the NPP. Its only opponents were nationalists concerned about the use of the law to force the integration of schools and conservatives who view this act as the latest instance of federal overreach. In spite of the opposition, the bill sailed to its passage.\n\nAlready, schools across the country are revamping curriculums and purchasing new materials.

USA_sen_bill_name_406: "The Economic Opportunity Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_406: "The American worker could use a helping hand and luckily for him, President Johnson has just the right thing: the Economic Opportunity Act. The Act not only raises the Federal minimum wage, guaranteeing a huge swathe of American labor a payhike, but also institutes plenty of new public works projects to assist in the construction of Johnson's Great Society. The economic implications of the bill are grand indeed."
bill_406_passed.Title: "The Economic Opportunity Act Passes!"
bill_406_failed.Title: "The Economic Opportunity Act Fails!"
bill_406_passed: "Economic justice in the United States advanced another step today as the Senate passes the Economic Opportunity Act. With a stroke of a pen, President Johnson will add another major accomplishment to his progressive legacy. The bill will not only increase the minimum wage but also establish many new public jobs programs. This will guarantee good-paying jobs for our citizens while also leaving future generations plenty of new public works, including highways, parks and waterways, to enrich society.\n\nIn spite of conservative and moderate opposition the ambitious legislation sailed to confirmation in the Senate. Senator Barry Goldwater called the bill "an atrocious interference by the government in business it has no understanding of or appreciation for" while some conservatives claimed a wave of layoffs would come with the bill's enactment. Much of the credit for the bill appeared to lie with President Johnson who used his voluminous experience in the Senate to nudge the bill across the finish line.\n\nWhat is next on the President's agenda is unknown, but he is coming off of a victory and fatigue with his ambitious plans seems to be growing. Even as Johnson pushes further and further, a backlash becomes more and more likely."
bill_406_failed: "Many said it was overambitious, that it would fall afoul of special interests, that vulnerable senators would be unwilling to vote for it. All of those things said of the Economic Opportunity Act were proven true today as the Senate failed to pass the Economic Opportunity Act. The law would have created new public works programs as well as raising the minimum wage, but economic justice in the United States will have to wait for now.\n\nThe bill failed to overcome unified opposition senators who coalesced on complaints regarding the minimum wage hike's potential effect on employment as well as concerns about the new public works program's cost. One Nationalist NPP Senator said "this law would have created a lot of make-work government jobs for Johnson voters that would be paid for by actual, working people. A No vote on this was the easiest decision of my life."\n\nThe White House has criticized the Senate's failure, calling it a missed opportunity to raise the nation's poor to a decent standard of living. Some in DC wonder if this failure is evidence that President Johnson has lost his touch on the pulse of the Senate, or if he even cared about this bill at all. What is for certain is that this failure to pass the Economic Opportunity Act will be a tarnish on Johnson's legacy as a progressive."

#LBJ SS expansion
USA_sen_bill_name_407: "The Social Security Expansion Bill"
USA_sen_bill_desc_407: "The Social Security Act revolutionized American society as for the first time the federal government promised workers some amount of retirement support. Now, the Johnson administration wishes to advance the law one step and extend its reach to the disabled. Unable to work and often existing in dire poverty, disabled Amercians seem a natural candidate for an expansion to Social Security."
bill_407_passed.Title: "Social Security Expansion Passes!"
bill_407_failed.Title: "Social Security Expansion Fails!"
bill_407_passed: "The New Deal, or its successor, marched on in Washington D.C. today as the Senate passed a bill expanding Social Security. Previously Social Security only covered the elderly, those over the age of 65. With the expansion however, the disabled of America will now be covered by Social Security.\n\nDue to their disabilities, many of these people are unable to work and live in poverty, suffering at the margins of society. No more, thanks to President Johnson's bill. Thanks to a combination of hikes to income and payroll taxes, Social Security will vastly expand its reach, alleviate poverty, and still remain solvent. Many conservative critics had alleged that the program would ruin the Federal government's finances but thus far the books seem to be balancing.\n\nThe bill's passage is another triumph for President Johnson, the aid to the disabled representing another plank in his platform for a Great Society. The new Social Security payments represent a new salvo in the War on Poverty and President Johnson does not mean to call off the attack until his opponent has been obliterated."
bill_407_failed: "In a sad blow to the hopes of disabled and handicapped Americans across the country, the Senate refused to pass President Johnson's Social Security Expansion bill. With Republican Senator Goldwater describing the bill as "as budget-busting as it is humanitarian" and States' Rights Senator Strom Thurmond deriding its "messianic ambition", the bill went down to defeat on the Senate floor.\n\nConservatives and other rightwingers are thrilled at their victory, having prevented another massive growth in the size of the federal government. Progressives and liberals are, more than disappointed, genuinely angry with the Johnson White House. One prominent but anonymous progressive told the Washington Post that, "Whatever other victories the President has delivered, this failure absolutely stings. When he absolutely had to get the football into the endzone, Johnson fumbled. No way around it."\n\nThe Johnson Administration itself has blamed RDC Senate leadership for the bill's failure. Nevertheless pundits note that President Johnson's alleged mastery over the Senate is now very much in doubt. Whatever bill the administration puts up in the Senate will be facing an uphill battle."

#LBJ Workplace Healthcare
USA_sen_bill_name_408: "The Workplace Healthcare Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_408: "Even as American healthcare reaches new heights of recuperative and restorative capabilities, access to it remains based on economic factors, leaving the poor undercovered and unhealthy. To improve healthcare access, the Workplace Healthcare Act will place new regulations and price controls on health insurance companies, preventing discrimination against patients with pre-existing conditions as well as restrictions on medical bills for simple procedures."
bill_408_passed.Title: "The Workplace Healthcare Act Succeeds"
bill_408_failed.Title: "The Workplace Healthcare Act Fails"
bill_408_passed: "Today in Washington, the Senate finally took the side of the consumer over the healthcare giants. With new regulations of health insurance companies and subsidies, many Americans previously denied coverage or facing massive medical bills for needed surgery will finally have options. Insurance companies will no longer be able to charge patients with pre-existing conditions different rates than other consumers, nor will they be able to deny them coverage. Further federal regulations aim at suppressing rising healthcare costs to protect consumers.\n\nThe bill's positive effects became clear almost immediately. One good example was a construction worker named Vito Corelli. A few years ago on a job his hand had been injured in an accident. While he'd avoided amputation, nerve damage rendered it nearly useless. Any doctors who had taken a look had quoted him such an eye-popping sum that he had nearly fainted. After the new Workplace Healthcare Act provisions kicked in, he had the surgery done for a single $300 co-pay. With a few weeks of rest and plenty of physical therapy he was back to coaching his sons' little league teams again.\n\nStories like that multiplied across the country, Americans finally getting the healthcare they needed. Each healed person, rendered whole again, knew that they had President Johnson to thank. No society could be great until sickness had been eradicated and this new law goes some distance to achieving that goal."
bill_408_failed: "Disappointment ran through the nation today as President Johnson's Workplace Healthcare Act died on the Senate floor. With conservatives labelling it "unconstitutional and anti-market overreach", President Johnson's nominal Republican allies were some of the bill's most vociferous opponents. Behind the scenes, the lobbying arms of the health insurance companies could not be missed, with plenty of senators having their ears bent or arms twisted by big business.\n\nGrowling at the bad news, President Lyndon Johnson paced the Oval Office, aides knowing to stay quiet when he was this way.\n\n"Those damned Republicans!" He snarled, "Nothing like someone who values the idea of a free market over sick Americans. We're in a coalition with people who see no role for the federal government on this issue, none, that we shouldn't prevent discrimination by healthcare companies. What a world! What a party!"\n\nThe bill's failure bodes poorly for the remainder of President Johnson's agenda. His opponents suspect his political senses have faded, or that the cracks in the RDC run deeper than most suspect. Whatever the issue, his next piece of legislation will find itself facing a much-emboldened opposition."

#LBJ Right to Liberty
USA_sen_bill_name_409: "The Right to Liberty Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_409: "Racism runs deep in America, corrupting all it touches and extending the misery of the marginalized. The Right to Liberty Act aims to take the most ambitious stance against racism in America yet. By instituting affirmative action programs for the federal government and its contractors, non-white Americans will be assured of equal opportunity to account for centuries of disadvantage. Furthermore, the Civil Rights Act will be extended to cover those under the poverty line, protecting the poorest in society from discrimination."

bill_409_passed: ""And we're live, Mr. President," the television camerman signalled President Lyndon Johnson who, well-practiced at this particular dog and pony show, began speaking.\n\n"Good evening, as I am sure many of you are aware, the Senate today passed my administration's Right to Liberty bill. This legislation is the next step in a tradition stretching back to the founders: that we leave the nation better and fairer than we found it. That is the history of America, recognizing our wrongs and working earnestly to right them." He tapped a thick, powerful finger onto the legislation next to him, a pen waiting nearby.\n\n"This bill does two main things which I believe are necessary for us to measure up to that tradition. First, it institutes preferential hiring and diversity initiatives for federal programs and contractors. To counteract the legacy of slavery, of racism, a reweighting of the scales of justice is necessary and just. Second, the Civil Rights Act will be extended to cover those beneath the poverty line. No longer will the poor be discriminated against or saddled with worse city or states services. We are all Americans and we are all in this together."\n\nWith triumph rising in his heart, he picked up the pen and signed the bill. This would seal his place in American history, putting a beautiful capstone on a storied career. It would also, of course, help those in need, he remembered belatedly as the cameras in the office flashed, capturing and preserving the moment."
bill_409_failed: "Lyndon Johnson's Right to Liberty bill has failed to pass following a controversial session and filibuster from Southern senators in the National Progressive Pact. Some have called its methods affirmative action. It intended to guarantee equality among all sectors, in the eyes of the law for every state, but it looks like Johnson's idea ended the way reconstruction did."

#LBJ Medicare and Medicaid
USA_sen_bill_name_410: "Medicare & Medicaid"
USA_sen_bill_desc_410: "For millions of Americans, healthcare is a luxury and a medical bill a potential disaster. The Johnson administration will seek to change that with the Medicare and Medicaid bill. Under the bill, citizens over the age of 65 will have a great deal of coverage for healthcare costs by the federal government while medicaid will focus on assisting poor workers and other groups. While expensive and an ambitious plan, it is a necessary one for proper healthcare reform."
bill_410_passed.Title: "The Medicare and Medicaid Act"
bill_410_failed.Title: "The Medicare and Medicaid Act fails!"
bill_410_passed: ""And the Medicare and Medicaid Act passes by a vote of--" But the voice of the President of the Senate was cut off as cheers from the gallery and among the supporting senators overwhelmed his voice. This moment would be lifechanging for millions of Americans and the news of the bill's passage spread across the country. While facing strong opposition from conservatives, both in the RDC and the NPP, the bill survived and will now reshape the entire country for the better.\n\nThe act establishes two programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is available to elderly citizens and is paid for via a broad-based payroll tax. It covers a variety of healthcare costs, including long-term care through reimbursements to providers. Medicaid is a program operated jointly with participating states that offers a huge breadth of reimbursements for healthcare services but only covers the "categorical poor". That is to say, only those poor who are working, or pregnant, or elderly, or if their family is of a particular size.\n\nWhile a massive step forward for America, the bill does have flaws. Some Americans remain without health insurance, with calamitous health outcomes potentially arising for many while for others the healthcare they do receive is either of poor quality due to a lower reimbursement rate compared to private insurance, or still too extensive. If the Johnson administration is going to build a truly Great Society, they must follow this victory with another."
bill_410_failed: "Disappointment spread throughout the Democratic and Progressive senators of the Senate as the Medicare and Medicaid act went down in defeat. The conservative opposition had simply been too fierce, with many fearing that the government's projections of the program's costs were unrealistic. Some senators, Goldwater in particular, warned that the new program would have the potential to bankrupt the country while having a deeply inflationary effect on the cost of healthcare, raising prices for private insurance holders.\n\nThe criticisms seemed to strike true, as the bill's supporters fragmented and failed to secure the necessary votes. The defeat is a deep embarassment for the Johnson administration, which had prided itself on able maneouvring within Congress. Many liberal supporters of President Johnson increasingly criticize the President's willingness to make extravagant promises while failing to deliver for his constituents."

USA_sen_bill_name_411: "The Right to Life Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_411: "Universal access to healthcare should be a priority for any just society. Allowing our citizens to go bankrupt from medical bills or die from preventable diseases due to unwillingness to incur costs is unacceptable. By expanding Medicaid to become a fully opt-in program available to all citizens we shall guarantee all Americans universal coverage. While certain to be expensive, the benefits surely outweigh any price to be paid."

bill_411_passed: "On the steps of the Capitol building, Lyndon Johnson breathed a deep lungful of crisp air. Holding the crowning achievement of his presidency in his hand, he scrawled his signature at the bottom of the page. The Right to Life bill had become law and cheers from the surrounding crowds immediately erupted. For each and every one of them, this law was completely life-changing.\n\nUnder the Right to Life Act, Medicaid became a full opt-in program that allowed anyone to access the program's benefits. While not achieving full cost-coverage as more radical Progressives would have preferred, the law did finally solve the problem of lacking healthcare access, allowing every American to have affordable healthcare through Medicaid. Universal healthcare finally existed in America, and Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats, with some help, had been the ones to do it.\n\nInwardly, Johnson was thrilled at this triumph. They had said it would be impossible, too ambitious for a single President, no matter his mastery of the Senate. When historians looked back on American history, he thought as he looked out over the cheering crowds of his supporters, he knew he would be ranked among its titans. After all the work he had done he thought it was the least he deserved. A smile grew on his face as he greeted grateful citizens, many sharing how this law would specifically help them. Maybe this wasn't a Great Society yet, Johnson reflected, but it was closer than ever."
bill_411_failed: ""It is always a pleasure to welcome friends like Senator Barry Goldwater back onto the Firing Line. Senator, how are you?"\n\n"I'm doing fine, more than fine even with the recent defeat of the so-called Right to Life Bill. Johnson has proposed program after program, bullying and pushing and wheedling to get them through but the Senate held firm here."\n\n"You're referring of course to the expansion of medicaid to be purely opt-in. The cost of that must be absolutely extraordinary, and what about the effects of so many new federal dollars in the healthcare market?"\n\n"Nothing good," Goldwater replied seriously, his eyes boring into Buckley's, "If we had passed this, the government's tentacles would reach us in the most private and intimate moments of our lives. That is not the philosophy of the Republicans or the Democrats. If the government pays for your healthcare it is a very short distance away from demanding a say in your healthcare decisions. Perhaps the government decides it's too expensive to keep you alive, or does not believe you should get an abortion..." Here a small smile crossed Goldwater's face as Buckley twisted at the word.\n\n"Yes, well..." Flustered, Buckley moved on in his interview as Barry Goldwater continued his victory lap. The crowning achievement of Johnson's presidency, a colossal piece of federal overreach, had been thwarted and the Arizonan could afford to celebrate a little."

The bill not only aims to fix the funding and resource issues many poorer American schools face but also to fill in some of the cracks in the fractious RDC with a bipartisan bill. Under this legislation, schools shall receive federal funds to bridge the gaps they are facing as well. Updated curriculums and testing standards will follow to ensure taxpayers' resources are used productively and that progress on this issue is made. Most agree the state of education could use reform and Romney believes the disparate wings of the coalition will unite around his bill."

bill_21010_passed: ""This piece of legislation represents a step into a brighter future as well as a promise to every American child. They will be given the tools and education to become a productive worker and an informed citizen ready to make a positive mark on our democracy and society. No longer will old books, missing desks or over-loaded classes be a barrier to educational attainment."\n\nWith a flourish, President George Romney signed the American Education Modernization Act. The cameras flashed and his broad smile, his first success as President, was beamed out across the country. Looking around the Oval Office at the smiling faces of senators, staff and even the journalists, Romney felt a rush of elation. He had done good for the entire country, far beyond what he had been able to accomplish merely as governor of Michigan. This legislation guaranteed measurable and immediate improvements to millions of childrens' lives.\n\nThanks to this bill, the United States would be richer, safer and stronger in the years to come as its youth grew smarter and better educated to solve the country's and world's problems. He had also done it with a united and capable Republican-Democrat coalition behind him, the parties' acrimony for once not hobbling their ability to work together.\n\nThis would be the first of many victories, he believed. With a strong and united coalition, and an administration eager and able to tackle any problem from any direction, he knew America stood on the threshold of a new age. He felt honored to be the one to usher it in and, with that thought in mind, smiled even more brightly for the cameras."

His ambitions in civil rights and economic matters went far beyond this relatively moderate piece of education legislation, which he had believed to be a shoo-in. Resolving himself to try again harder next time, he looked up as Vice President Donald Rumsfeld entered the Oval Office. The normally stoic Rumsfeld had an air of anger to him today, sharing the President's frustration.\n\n"I heard the news from the Hill sir, my apologies," He said, "I'll be sure to knock some heads together and talk to Senate leadership, there's no reason for the coalition to be this out of step."\n\n"Thank you, Donald," Romney said, "This is just the first of many, many opportunities to do some good for this country. The Senate rejected a good bill here, but we have plenty more where that came from and we can learn from our mistakes here."\n\nAn air of optimism had returned to the room as the two men began to plan their next steps. The Senate was more hostile than they had expected, but that was fine, neither men had expected this to be an easy task."
