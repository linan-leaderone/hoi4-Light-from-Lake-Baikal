TRK_Fragmented_Tribes: "Fragmented Tribes"
TRK_Fragmented_Tribes_desc: "The social and political structure of Turkmenistan is almost entirely composed of the Turkmen tribes living within its borders. Politically, they are the foundation of Poda's support, but they are also the greatest obstacle to some of his reforms.\n\nThe tribes do not want to change their ways or support the development of Turkmenistan. Finding a way to manage them without losing their confidence is one of the most pressing issues facing this young nation."
TRK_Question_Of_Identity: "Question of Identity"
TRK_Question_Of_Identity_desc: "Turkmenistan is a country, but it is not yet a nation. In fact, what remains now is the remnants of a much larger country that has been completely destroyed—the Soviet Union. This leaves Turkmenistan in a strange liminal state without its own identity.\n\nWhat makes a Turkmen? Is it the land beneath our feet? Is it the tribes we claim as our own? These are questions that will eventually need to be answered, and the country's ability to unite and act in concert depends on it."
TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road: "A Modern Silk Road"
TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road_desc: "History has a funny way of repeating itself. In ancient times, the Silk Road was the great trade route that ran through Central Asia, connecting the Far East and Far West of the ancient world. So, just as it was then, Turkmenistan now finds itself at the center of a new Silk Road.\n\nCompared to other Central Asian countries and northwest China, Turkmenistan is a relatively stable beacon; though it may seem harsh and unforgiving, this attracts those seeking refuge and opportunity, and welcoming them with open arms greatly benefits us."
POLITICS_PODA_ANNAORAZOV_DESC: "The revolution in Turkmenistan did not end with the fall of the Soviet Union. The will that the Soviet Union represented remains the steadfast faith of the Turkmen people. However, when Iran invaded Turkmenistan in the wake of the Soviet collapse, the Russian bureaucrats and administrators abandoned the Turkmen people and fled back to their homeland. Thus, the task of defending Turkmenistan fell to a doctor, a protector—Poda Annaorazov, a native Turkmen.\n\nLeading a motley crew of Turkmen tribesmen, Soviet partisans, friends, and allies, Poda not only repelled the Iranian invaders but also drove the simultaneous Afghan invasion back to their homeland. The hero of Samarkand achieved great victories that moved the nation, and naturally, he was nominated as the Chairman of Turkmenistan. However, ruling a country is far more difficult than defeating an enemy army. After the war, Poda spent several years living a life more painful than being on the battlefield or recovering from wounds, a life that greatly stressed him.\n\nPoda does his best to govern Turkmenistan, but he is ultimately not a manager. Although he firmly believes in Bukharinism, he also finds himself at times being led by the nose by his advisers, ministers, generals, allies, and bureaucrats. Among them, some are just as devoted to Bukharinism, while others, despite admiring him (and he likewise admires them), support ideas that run counter to the principles of Bukharinism he advocates. As time goes on, their attitudes become increasingly unclear. Sometimes, this life makes him wish he could return to the front lines."

 POLITICS_MIRSAID_SULTANGALIYEV_DESC: "If any man in Central Asia today represents its traumatic and conflicting heritage from the last few decades, it is Mirsaid Sultangaliyev.\n\nBorn in Bashkiria, deep in the most Russified parts of Eurasia, Mirsaid was an early follower of the revolutionary ideas spreading like wildfire across Russia - seeing in them the solution to the imperialist oppression clamping down on the minorities and Islamic faith, and the way forward for the organization of these peoples. His time in Baku in the early tens and twenties pushed him further to the Bolsheviks' path, and when his time came to fight for the Revolution he did so with aplomb, using his familiarity with national movements in Central Asia to cripple the Whites - earning the trust of none other than Vladimir Lenin himself in the process.\n\nAll seemed set for a steady rise through the Soviet ranks as a representative of the Turkic nationalities of the USSR and its Islamic people - a rise which never came. The rest of the Party remained suspicious of his tolerance of regional nationalism and religion, and so Mirsaid remained marooned in Central Asia, far from the decision-making, working steadfastly to improve the local situation but without much hope of influencing the top.\n\nThat was, until the Nazi war machine crushed the USSR entirely and left its peripheral republics reeling in a chaotic void of power. Now, Mirsaid Sultangaliyev stands as a symbol of Turkic cooperation amongst those left standing - still believing in the end goal of Marxism-Leninism but adapted to truly serve the people instead of the Russian despots in a far-away capital."
 POLITICS_ZIYAUDDIN_BABAKHAN_DESC: "Hailing from the line of Ahmad Yasawi comes another great Turkic scholar of the Islamic Faith. Ziyauddinhan Babahan was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and grew up among the faith, following in the footsteps of his father in the early years of his life and being educated by Shami Domla, whose theology and politics influenced his own greatly. When Kalinin accepted the request of Uzbek and Turkmen Imams to establish the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (or SADUM for short) during the Second World War, his life took a distinctly different turn, not one of mere theology, but of politics in turn. Though officially his father led the organization to start, as its secretary, much of the administrative duties fell to Ziyauddinhan.\n\nWith Islam in one hand and Marxism in the other, Ziyauddinhan sought to shepherd the faithful of his homeland fairly and equitably. Training of the clergy, the management of charity, and the publishing of religious material fell to himself and the organization that he ran. As the war took a sour turn for the USSR, it fell to him in turn, to be their guide and protector as the Union disintegrated, and more and more of the people of Central Asia turned to the faith for truth and comfort. Even after the war's end, Ziyauddinhan continues to fight this good fight.\n\nThese days, he is far from home, running SADUM from the safety and security of Turkmenistan. Both he and his organization represent a sense of continuity and structure remaining from the days of the Soviet Union. In spite of everything that has happened, the dual spirit of Marxism and Islam lives strong, and socialist thought justified by his interpretations of Islamic law provides an additional avenue to security and to justice in a world that so often lacks both."
