MEX_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The United Mexican States stand at a precipice. After the revolutionary turbulence which characterised the start of the Mexican twentieth century, the country enjoys a relatively high degree of stability and economic growth. Mexico enjoys cordial relations with both the OFN and Sphere, and is a growing hub of international commerce.\n\nHowever, this stability may prove to be short-lived, as the nation faces increasing tensions, both within and without. Mexico's firm commitment to neutrality is being shaken by increasing pressure from both sides of the Pacific. The Institutional Revolutionary Party's long grip on power is threatened by internal factionalism, and growing disaffection caused by the widening divisions emerging in Mexican society. President Adolfo López Mateos has proven himself a shrewd politician and diplomat, and has been able to maintain the balance thus far. However, his term is soon to end, and it remains to be seen if his successor can guide the nation through this tumultuous era."

MEX_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "An Austrian-made derivative of the more familiar Gewehr 98, this rifle was sold by a nation which no longer exists to a very different Mexico. Even after decades of political strife, global conflict and changes in the national arsenal, this carbine remains a popular civilian weapon, and is still used in training by the Mexican Armed Forces."

MEX_infantry_equipment_1:0 "M1 Carbine"
MEX_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "M1 Carbine"
MEX_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "This carbine variant of the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle has a higher magazine capacity and is less cumbersome than the standard variant, at the expense of lower stopping power. The M1 Carbine quickly found a large market in Latin America, and primarily serves in Mexico as a firearm of the Mexican police and security services."

MEX_infantry_equipment_2:0 "SEDENA Mini-14"
MEX_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "SEDENA Mini-14"
MEX_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Mini-14 was developed by Sturm, Ruger and Co. as a lighter, more compact alternative to the M-14 assault rifle, and is found both on the civilian market and in various national militaries.

MEX_infantry_equipment_5_short:0 "DGIM FX-87"
MEX_infantry_equipment_5_desc:0 "An evolution of the last generation of weapons, this series is built by the Dirección General de Industria Militar del Ejército to combat the growing mechanization of all aspects of warfare. More customizable than any that came before, this rifle can be built and rebuilt with additions which change its role in any given situation, making it more reliable and more precise in whatever mission is at hand."

### LEADERS

## Bios ##
POLITICS_ADOLFO_LOPEZ_MATEOS_DESC: "Adolfo López Mateos was either the child of a dentist and teacher in Mexico City or a bastard from Guatemala who faked his Mexican heritage to fulfil his political ambitions. The story is under dispute, with the latter theory having special prominence amongst his detractors. However, the documents he provided in the only official inquest in 1946 evidently were enough for him to be placed above suspicion. This minor speed bump did not stop his ascent from secretary to the State of Mexico's governor, to its senator and president of the PRI, the Mexican ruling party. From there, it was a mere matter of friendship and dutiful service to President Ruiz Cortines to place him as his successor, which guaranteed him an easy election not atypical for the PRI.\n\nLópez Mateos' term was marked by a continuation of the economic success and stability of previous presidents overall. Land reform, the building of museums, expansion of healthcare and education, and the nationalization of the electrical industry were all major successes. He also balanced Mexico's position between the Sphere and the OFN, which has served the nation well, and may have been the critical factor that prevented conflict between the two superpowers.\n\nHowever, not all has been well. Relations with the PRI's union support base have soured, and student groups collide with the government. Some are concerned the PRI is blindly running away from the policies that have been successful for Mexico. And now, Adolfo López Mateos must take all of this into account, in order to make his most critical decision: who will succeed him in the Presidency of Mexico?"
POLITICS_LUIS_ECHEVARRIA_DESC: "To much of the world, Luis Echeverría Álvarez is a chimera, a stitched-together symbol of everything wrong with the PRI. To the people of Mexico, he is much the same, but he portrays himself as everything RIGHT with the PRI. Born in Mexico City in 1922, Echeverría joined the party as a young man. He quickly gained favor in the office of the Party President, and over the decades, he would move from job to job, culminating in a stint as Secretary of External Relations. Now, as President of the United Mexican States, he seeks to establish Mexico as a truly independent nation, insulated from the great power conflicts of the present age, and secure in its neutrality. The American and Japanese corporate barons have other plans, of course, but they will face a fearsome man in Echeverría. If he succeeds, Mexico will achieve that revolutionary goal of standing on its own, free from the interference of foreign capital.\n\nWith himself in charge, of course."
POLITICS_RAUL_LOZANO_DESC: "As the old Mexican saying goes, "change always begins in the north."\n\nBorn on a middle class ranch in Nuevo León, Raúl Salinas Lozano's rise didn't come from military might or political patronage. Rather, it was through his hard work and skill at economics. Thus he quickly raised through the then-PRM, from militant in 1940 to director at the Secretariat of Hacienda in 1948, then Secretariat of the Presidency in 1954, and Secretary in his own right in 1958. And now, he sits in Los Pinos with his beloved family just a few short years after his remarkable rise began.\n\nAnd his background isn't the only thing radical about him. Because out of the economic ministries comes a new doctrine - that of Technocracy. The Revolution is in danger, not because of political machinations, but because it is not advancing fast enough. With new Sphere-style economic management, Salinas and his compatriots promise a new era of massive economic growth and modernization. But it will have a price Mexico may not be able to pay..."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MADRAZO_DESC: "From a distance, Carlos Madrazo is the perfect leader of the PRI and, thus, the leader of Mexico. Anyone can appreciate a man who challenged his childhood poverty with hard work and determination, and such a long history of activism within the party would give him the respect of its members. His oratory skills have caught the attention of the nation ever since secondary school, and have enraptured the youth and workers. Madrazo has already leveraged these advantages to become governor of his home state of Tabasco, where his roadways, schools, hospitals, and improvements to the dairy and cacao industries have transformed the land. Most importantly, his vision of a Mexico no longer tied to the slave drivers of the Sphere or the neoimperialists of the OFN has aligned with that of former President López Mateos. With the continuation of Mateos' economic policies, and his broad electoral support, Madrazo was the obvious pick to become the next leader of Mexico, and to reinvigorate the PRI.\n\nBut Madrazo is not a simple continuance. And that is what alarms many in his own party.\n\nMadrazo is not here to simply be a fresh face for the decaying carcass that is the PRI. He has vowed to remove the corrupt party officials and radically reform the organization. This has united a broad swath of businessmen and party members against him. With no shortage of enemies and few allies, Madrazo's presidency must go through the strongest, oldest structure in Mexico. However, that structure now must withstand the so-called "Cyclone from the Southeast" that has come to Mexico City."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_ORDAZ_DESC: "All things considered, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz was just what the party wanted. The young man rising up through the law profession caught the notice of the Governor of Puebla, and thus benefitted from a string of appointments to successively higher levels. Though political patronage and connections are the rule of the PRI, Ordaz had the ability to excel in the roles he was given. There's no denying that when the Ruiz Cortines Interior Secretariat was plagued by paralysis due to political infighting, Senior Officer Díaz Ordaz stepped up. When his friend López Mateos named him Interior Secretary, Ordaz skillfully handled much of the work needed, becoming the indispensable force behind the throne. He could make mistakes, but he could never be anyone but the one to the party. And thus he became President.\n\nDíaz Ordaz has something for everyone in the party. No-nonsense law enforcement for the right. Reasonably pro-OFN policies for business and the Americans. Moderate economic and social reforms that delight the left. Yes, it's no wonder what they see in him. To the PRI, Díaz Ordaz is the perfect President for the 1960s.\n\nBut Mexico isn't the PRI. And time always changes..."

His strong oratory and young talent first caught the attention of the brother of future president Avila Camacho, and by the '50s he was a senator. In the Senate, he found his opposite, then-senator López Mateos, and ever since the two have complemented each other and braved the mess that is Mexican politics together.

Quickly rising to Undersecretary, he then became Secretary during the government of Miguel Alemán, and retook the post under the current President.

Not only married to another economist, Margarita de Gortiari Carvajal, Salinas boasts a long résumé of positions overseeing economic progress after joining the PRI in 1940: founder of the National Institute of Public Administration, head of Economic Studies of the Secretariat of Finance from 1948-1954, tax advisor to Honduras, then Director of the Investment Commission of the Secretariat of the Presidency from 1954-1958 and now serving as the Secretary of Industry and Commerce for the whole nation of Mexico, it is said no man in Mexico could fill the shoes of the minister incumbent.§!"
MEX_Del_Rosal_sec_desc: "§YSecretary of National Defense\nInstitutional Despotism§!\n--------------\n§LAs an experienced politician and general, Alfonso Corona del Rosal is a man who knows how to get his point across. With his new appointment as Secretary of National Defense, his main goal is to strengthen and reequip the ailing Mexican Army to meet his high standards.\n\nDel Rosal's history with the PRI as the former Party President made him a rational choice for the position. Now, with his seat at the table secure, Rosal finds himself enforcing Salinas' agenda throughout Mexico, although unenthusiastically. Personal opinion is irrelevant, however. Orders are orders after all.§!"
MEX_Agustin_Olachea_sec_desc: "§YSecretary of National Defense\nInstitutional Despotism§!\n--------------\n§LOlachea is an extremely accomplished man, with his military experience in the Revolution pushing him to the rank of Major General. After his time in the military, he moved into electoral politics, being Governor of Baja California Sur, then Baja California, the only man to hold both those positions. After a short break, he became Governor of Baja California Sur once again, before leaving to become President of the National Executive Committee of the PRI, a post he dropped to become Secretary of National Defense.§!"
GENERAL_AGUSTIN_OLACHEA_DESC: "José Agustín Olachea is a model Mexican general. Born in 1890, he served with valor in the Revolution, becoming a colonel in 1917. He swiftly got involved in politics, signing onto the Plan of Agua Prieta and revolting against President Carranza. Olachea suppressed two rebellions against the government in 1923 and 1929, proving his loyalty beyond doubt.\n\nOlachea's career pivoted towards politics in the 1930s, and he served as the Governor of both Baja California Sur and Baja California Norte before becoming the President of the PRI in 1956 and the Secretary of Defense to Adolfo López Mateos in 1958. "
MEX_Marcelino_Barragan_sec_desc: "§YSecretary of National Defense\nInstitutional Despotism§!\n--------------\n§LA veteran of the Mexican Revolution. A decorated soldier. A respectable politician. Marcelino García Barragán's story on paper sounds quite venerable. However, the truth is that Barragán's colorful past is full of contradictions and holes that he would rather cover up with the facade of an honorable revolutionary and general.\n\nBarragán is committed to national security and the stability of the PRI regime. His approach is rather heavy-handed, and he has no qualms about enacting brutal measures against individuals deemed threats to the government, even those he once rallied alongside. This all goes to show his willingness to protect at any cost what he believes in. Whatever that may be.§!"

To avenge their deaths, he joined Villa's Northern Division, though he later defected to the Constitutionalists, serving under Plutarco Calles.\n\nCárdenas would lead offensives against Villistas, the second extermination of the Yaqui, and Michoacán's bloody liberation. A generalship and an appointment as Provisional Governor followed. Again he took up arms against the Cristeros before returning to govern Michoacán. After leading the PNR, he was appointed President by Mexico's true ruler, Calles.\n\nHis presidency would see the end of Calles' power, social and economic reforms, stabilization after thirty years of violence, and the formation of what would become the PRI. As that party moved rightward, Cárdenas grew increasingly critical, founding the MLN in 1961 to oppose it.

They all said the same: President López Mateos was dragging the Pacific to war. The world to nuclear oblivion.\n\nMateos' commitment to the Estrada Doctrine of neutrality had warped his mission to mediate the Aleutians Crisis. He insisted on equating Japan's phantom claims of treaty violations in the demilitarized islands with the actual violation of American airspace by a concrete spy plane. Again and again, he pushed this futile, useless investigation, ignoring the ever-growing risk of catastrophe in the north as two hostile fleets swelled and drew closer. After the aerial collision today near Attu, a volley of sources stated that nuclear exchange was imminent.\n\nOrdaz raised his head from the evidence. 3:31 A.M. If he could speak to the President, he, Mateos' most trusted confidante, could sway him. But Adolfo was somewhere in the air between Canberra and Tokyo, hours and hours ahead of him.\n\nAnd no. Mateos would be no help here. He was soft with the Japanese, drawing the matter out as he had the Rail Strikes. Talking and talking when what was needed was a firm hand, and firm action. In the absence of the President, Ordaz had the power and the duty to safeguard the Mexican people.\n\n3:40 A.M. Ordaz wiped his brow. A simple, truly neutral proposition.

But waves of emotions won out. Rage at Ordaz's insubordination and incompetence. Shame at the Secretary's shattering of Mexico's neutrality and diplomatic reputation. Fear. If war had broken out... if nuclear war had broken out, he would have been vaporized along with Tokyo.\n\nThe plane flew through the gloom for hours more, the President wracked with torment.

Let me be frank Gustavo, you nearly caused World War Three. Your so-called terms were completely unacceptable to Tokyo, and let the Americans get away with whatever the hell they were doing in the North Pacific. What's more, your 'credible intelligence' came from LITEMPO sources and FBI agents.

Governor Carlos Alberto Madrazo Becerra was going to be one of the most accomplished governors of the brave new world that his state found itself in.\n\nBut that brave new world had been turned upside-down. First, it had nearly been obliterated over some islands far more remote than Tabasco. And now, news was spreading, even here, of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz's catastrophic error in the diplomatic crisis. Only hours ago, Manuel Mora had burst in and told him that Ordaz had released that first, horrifically pro-American, draft agreement without the President's knowledge or support. Madrazo had been stunned that Ordaz, hardly known as impulsive, could have thrown away Mexico's neutrality and independence, could have destroyed everything in an instant.\n\nThe world had not ended, but the career of Ordaz, the supposedly left-wing candidate, the moderate Cardenista, the successor to the throne, likely would. That left...who? Olachea, maybe, and...that bastard Salinas.\n\nMadrazo shook his head. The Revolution could not survive another Alemán. Díaz Ordaz had destroyed his chance at a smooth succession, and now everything was in danger. Someone needed to step up from the left, to take his spot.

López shouted out to his motorcade riding partner, a certain Fidel Castro.\n\nCleaving their way through the crowds, a speech was organized in the center of the bustling city. Both the most senior officials of the main political parties of Cuba and the poorest residents of the city stood together, listening to the words of Mateos and Castro as they preached about the ideals of Latin American revolutionary unity. While the words still echoed down the dimming streets of Cuba's capital, both men retired to private quarters, where the main event of Mateos' trip began; the one-on-one.\n\nRelaxing into his seat, Mateos began. "Your people are extremely affectionate, even to a man they probably haven't thought twice about in their lives."\n\nWith a chuckle, Castro poured out both himself and the Mexican president each a glass of wine. "We love easy. Consider it one of our faults." He gestured towards the glass.\n\nMateos, licking his lips, continued.

The grapevine tells me some of your ministers have been dabbling with eastern influences."\n\nMateos' brow almost began to furrow, but he prevented it from fully forming. He was here to establish a personal connection to Cuba, not assail its leader. "Excuse me, that was out of line.

It was all Mateos could do to not laugh. Lott's Spanish sounded as disjointed as what Mateos' assumed his Portuguese sounded. Speaking in his native tongue, Mateos reiterated. "Perhaps polyglotism isn't our thing, huh?"\n\nEarning a laugh from Lott, the other man answered, this time in Portuguese. "No, perhaps not."

The Canadian capital was, if one were to view it as a static model, far more presentable than Mexico City, and certainly far more affluent. This was what the centre of power looked like in a developed nation.\n\nDespite all this, López Mateos's impression of Ottawa was that of weariness, and it wasn't just the low throb of his head. It seemed as if every other street corner held its own small memorial to where the area's sons had died in Hong Kong, during Sealion, in Hawaii, all for nothing. The homeless lined many streets, staring blankly. The country had been going through hard times for a while now, even as Mexico's economy boomed. Salinas blamed the embargo on the Sphere, though López Mateos doubted that was the whole truth. Queen Elizabeth's aura was as regal as he had imagined, though her voice and the lines on her face carried a weight far beyond that of a woman still under forty. The whole city seemed on edge, awaiting some great unseen monster from beyond the horizon.\n\nBut López Mateos was not here to sample Canada's atmosphere. He was here to ensure friendship and cooperation between the two poles of North America. And if the two ends could meet without going through the middle, all the better. Prime Minister Pearson certainly seemed receptive, and hopefully this would result in more intensive economic talks in the future. However, they had very different ideas of what 'economic independence' meant, one side appearing to mean independence from US trade and one from Japanese trade, but neither stating their case explicitly. By the end, López Mateos was sure he had made a good impression, but time would tell if it would reap any significant benefits."

It's because I have my eyes on the prize: hosting the Olympics in Mexico. Bringing the world's athletes to our nation and making our statement in the history books.

"Your Excellency, I believe Japan is the ideal partner for this. You proved your sincerity to Tokyo during the Aleutians Crisis, and if they support us the rest of the Sphere will follow suit.

"Your Excellency," Ordaz interjected, "With all due respect to Secretary Salinas, I believe we should be approaching the United States."\n\nThe President glared daggers at him, but Ordaz pushed on. "As he says, Japan was satisfied by your handling of the crisis, it's the Americans that feel slighted. We cannot afford to upset them further. A tour of North America will help repair our relationship," for a split second he hesitated, "And I assure you, they can be reasonable."\n\nHe had a point, Mateos thought, tempering his anger. For as much as Nixon's antics during the crisis had stung, basic geography dictated that Mexico must not alienate the United States completely.\n\nYet Mateos saw this proposal for what it truly was: a chance for Ordaz to redeem himself. A tour of the U.S. would make use of his connections up north, just as a tour of the Sphere would require Salinas' network.

Heh, he'd done that before, and would gladly do it again if it meant another commie or fascist put away for good.\n\nWhich would it be this week? The agent knew his target was stealing military reports from his day job, that was confirmed. But who was he passing them to? Could be a synarchist enamored with Trujillo, a spy for the gringos, or an opportunist out to grab briefcases of yen from the Japanese. You met so many interesting people when working for the Directorate of Federal Security.\n\nHe swallowed and popped another batch of peanuts in his mouth. It was a good gig, the DFS. Hell, it was the best gig. Use every instinct in his muscled body to track, corner, and beat the shit out of scum that threatened his country.

He could feel the slight tinge of anger build up in him, but it was let go, there was nothing he could do. Accepting his reality, he stared at the light trying to make the process go faster. The red reminded him of the abundance of lights of seemingly all colors he encountered back in Texas.\n\nIt wasn't just lights either. Seemingly thousands of products, hundreds of trucks, clean paved roads, and new machines that seemed to revolutionize the factory entirely. Meanwhile on his drive south, he got all too accustomed to the shaking after driving over potholes. Sure it was home, but there was just something about imagining what he saw up north to be in Mexico. He glanced at the rearview mirror and imagined his homeland behind him. Sitting inside of a car, hoping that soon the light would allow it to move forward.\n\nWhat could he do? Sure he might think those things, but the CNOP? If they could even agree on something or for starters listen to him at all, they would reject any change before it could even be proposed. That was just how the 'glorious' National Confederation of Popular Organizations worked. It was a monster with all its different heads disagreeing with each other. You could have perfectly content businessmen on one side and teachers striking on another, with the Confederation only praying that they all remain obedient to it and the PRI.\n\nThere had to be something, though. Something that would put Mexico on the right road and let it shine just like El Paso, the city he had been in just hours ago, before it lagged further and further behind."

"Let him know there's a job in the capital, if you ever feel like parting with him."\n\nSalinas tipped the rim of his black cowboy hat appreciatively. "He would refuse even if you asked, I'm afraid, he feels that leaving the north would remove something from the food, turn it into a pale imitation for the palates of Mexico City."\n\n"Is that so?" asked López Mateos. "Some would say we may be heading in a similar direction, heading towards some distant metropolis which will swallow us up and strip us bare. Will that become of us, do you reckon?"\n\n"Do you see those?" asked Salinas, pointing at the horses. "Their ancestors once roamed these lands wild and free, until one day vaqueros and fences and civilization came and brought that to an end. If they had pushed on, deep into the unfamiliar, the mustangs may have remained so. Instead, they pranced as they always had, now in an enclosed space for our amusement. For Mexico to thrive, to avoid being enclosed by our neighbours, we must press on in a firm, uncompromising direction, even if we fear the monsters that guard the way."\n\n"An interesting philosophy," said López Mateos.

His headaches seemed to have no end no matter how many pills he took, and they were finally affecting his work. He had spent all morning reading the regulations being proposed post-Kabuki, but with every word he understood, another three became mindless scribbles. For the first time in years, he felt completely overwhelmed to deal with this by himself. He needed help, so he turned to the man who he trusted the most.\n\nA few knocks on Ordaz's office's door were all he needed to get a stoic "Come in" from his old friend. Ordaz put down a set of papers and rose from his chair to greet the President. "Your Excellency, with what may I help you?"\n\n"Please, Gustavito, sit and forget about titles. I just need some help going through these regulations." Mateos said as he threw a handful of documents on top of Ordaz's desk.\n\n"I see you too have also fallen prey to this mess. One certainly doesn't expect that becoming a politician involves reading things cobbled together by monkeys on typewriters," Ordaz said as he sat back down and revealed his copy of the documents. "But I guess it's our party of monkeys on typewriters."\n\n"That seems a bit too harsh," Mateos said as he sat down across from Ordaz, and picked up his documents. After a glance, he turned back to Ordaz. "Though some of them definitely need pointers. Well, let's get started."\n\nAfter hours of reviewing the legislation, but mostly just joking and laughing over its many, many flaws, the pair was nearly done for the day. For Mateos, working with Ordaz almost didn't seem like work, even if many people called them polar opposites. Sure, the duo had their differences, and Mateos couldn't count the number of times they had butted heads, but that was due to Ordaz being his oldest ally. Both met when they were senators and now here they were, holding the two most important positions in the country and laughing. Clarity seemed to reach Mateos as his laughter died down.

"The truth of the matter is simply this: we stand to lose much more than we gain if we invite American companies and experts to extract our own resources."\n\nAn awkward silence hung in the air briefly before Ordaz began to make his rebuttal. "Nobody is advocating to give them unfettered access to our oil wells. However, it would be equally foolish to believe that we have nothing to gain at all from limited and cautious American aid. They have a tremendous amount of capital at their command, experts and equipment which could speed this process up greatly.

While the US could be persuaded to lower tariffs in many other economic sectors, these tariffs would require something extra in return.\n\nThe president looked at Ordaz and simply asked, "So what are our options here?"\n\n"Well..." Ordaz began. "We have several options but I can assure you from my many years in the PRI, each one will upset some interest groups. Lowering our own tariffs on American-made automobiles would likely be incredibly well received in Washington, however the industrialists in the party won't enjoy hearing that news. Dropping our request for lowering their tariffs on our agriculture could persuade them to lower the energy tariffs, but logically that would upset the agricultural base of the party. Lastly we could offer the Americans some vague platitudes about liberalizing our economy in the future. Since there is no concrete plan there the Americans won't love that offer but it'll please the PRI greatly."\n\nThe president massaged his temples rhythmically as if he had a headache.

The Americans get their cheap labor and we get a steady supply of foreign currency."\n\n"Yes, yes, I understand that," Mateos began.

"Your Excellency, the Americans will try to use this conference to push their own agenda, and that of the OFN. But the OFN is not the Americas, and the Americas are not the OFN.

However, we shouldn't ignore how this might be an easy win with the PRI. The party would love nothing more than to proudly proclaim that the future of Mexico is being built by Mexicans."\n\nThe President stopped to give this decision some thought. Letting the party handle the highway's construction would be an easy win domestically and perhaps buy him some more wiggle room for less popular policy initiatives that might come out of this meeting.

All that is required is time and effort and we can smooth things out."\n\n"I do not think so, Your Excellency." Salinas confessed to the president. "Throughout much of modern Mexican history we have rightly built our country in opposition to the United States. These are not simple things that can be papered over with 'time and effort' ; these are fundamental differences that cannot be ignored."\n\nHe could see how both men came to their conclusions. Salinas Lozano's belief that America's influence in Mexico is so pervasive that the only way to be truly neutral is to actively combat it. Meanwhile Ordaz, a man whose entire life has been defined by working his way up the ladder, would naturally believe that such a divide could be bridged with hard work and time.

They were going to be heading north through the United States into Canada, before looping back down to finish in Washington D.C. That was for certain, and had already been negotiated by their respective ambassadors and embassies. What was less certain was how López Mateos planned on getting to Canada. He and Ordaz had put together two proposals for the potential path, and debated the merits of each back and forth until he couldn't stand hearing another word from the minister and dismissed him for the night. Yet he had to choose one by morning.\n\nThe first was to head up along the western coast, starting from Sonora into Baja California. Here, he could speak with the growing Mexican communities of California and get in touch with the people once more. Standing before a crowd of his constituents always made him feel more alive, and perhaps it was the perfect thing to uplift his spirits after the disastrous past few months. There would be press along and that brought risks, but if they could catch him in his element once again, it just might bring him the positive exposure he was looking for.\n\nThe second route was to head up through Texas to visit Lyndon Johnson. Mateos had not spoken with Lyndon in quite some time, and if what he needed was a break, then a visit with an old friend may just be what he needed. Additionally, Johnson controlled much of Texas' barons and could be just the man he needed to strike a deal that would boost growth throughout the northeast. Of course, the press might jump on this as evidence that he was trying to hide from the cameras.\n\nMateos leaned forward against his desk, his chair creaking underneath him as the two possibilities rattled around in his brain. After the chaos of the Aleutians Crisis, there was only really one choice that made sense."

The California sun was hot on the back of López Mateos' neck as he stepped out, but what caught his attention was the scores of his countrymen seated around a collection of tables, eating and enjoying a break from their demanding work. In the corner of his eye the press were stepping out of their own vehicles, having been hot on his heels the whole journey here. He stepped forward towards the workers who were already beginning to turn and take an interest in the arrival of what all of them knew to be their president.\n\n"Laborers and countrymen..." Mateos began, and he saw the press out of the corner of his eye begin scribbling down the words that came next. "I only wish for a moment of your time. Being up here in California makes one nostalgic for the company of his own people." He gave them a smile, and was rewarded by many of them replying with their own greetings to the president. He sat down at one of the tables and generously accepted a plate of rice and greens, and made casual conversation with those seated. Casual, at least, until one of the men across from him spoke up.\n\n"Are you here to talk with them about our conditions?" The man said, skin tanned from hundreds of hours beneath the grueling California sun. "We work for so little pay, and because we are not from here, they think they can treat us worse. There must be something you can do?"\n\nMateos' heart dropped. He was planning on meeting with American businessmen in San Diego to set up some lucrative investment deals, and if he came to America waving the red flag, they may not be so willing to give him what he needed.

Alfonso's angry voice carried across the receiver, forcing Ordaz to hold the phone slightly off from his ear.\n\n"Yes, I-" Ordaz began to reply, but Alfonso left him very little room to try and calm his fury.\n\n"If you were hoping this would make you friends in the US, you were sorely mistaken. You know how many angry calls I've gotten from Washington demanding to know why there's a Mexican president stirring up shit in the southwest? We approached you in good faith about this, and you've thrown it back in our faces. I can promise you, whatever trade deals you were looking for will be hard to come by if you start putting migrant rights in your demands."\n\nWithout another word, the line was cut as Alfonso hung up the phone. Ordaz seethed, slowly placing the phone back down. It always ended up being his job to fix less competent men's messes, but here he did not even know where to begin. His influence on the president was slipping away before his very eyes. Yet he would do as he always did: persist."

MEX_Mateos.36.desc:0 "Leaning back into his chair, Ordaz calmly flipped the page to a picture of Mateos waving goodbye to a crowd of migrants, most of whom looked much less enthused about seeing their president than one might expect. His eyes flicking up to the headline, those bold black letters told him exactly why. 'Mateos Waffles on Migrants'. It wouldn't earn him any favors on this side of the border, to be sure. There might be some grumblings out in the countryside or amongst the lowest classes about a betrayal of values, but those always ebbed and flowed.\n\nWhat was important was that it secured them a favorable meeting with business leaders in San Diego, as per the schedule he and Ordaz had agreed on. Now, if everything continued as scheduled, they would have a new set of American investments across Mexico's industries. If Mateos had done things differently, if he had decided to stir the pot... Ordaz did not want to wonder what troubles might have arisen from a meeting with American industrialists so soon after declaring support for workers rights in their own backyard. As it stood, their plan was progressing just as was to be expected.\n\nOrdaz dropped the newspaper back down onto the desk, thinking of what came next. He would have to find ways to calm the nerves of the peasants and workers here at home. Nothing too extreme, to be sure. Ordaz glanced down to look once more at Mateos's face, and a feeling of pride spread in his chest. Perhaps he was finally beginning to remember the value that Ordaz provided him, and all those rumors of him shifting his support would turn out to be just that: rumors."

MEX_Mateos.37.desc:0 ""I think either proposal has its merits..." Salinas spoke carefully, waffling on the center in a way that was beginning to grate on Mateos's nerves. He had asked him here to this meeting to advise, but he had spent the last hour jumping back and forth between either proposal with no end in sight.\n\n"Perhaps if we reframed what these proposals mean, we can reassess," Ordaz suggested, breaking through the simmering anger. Mateos turned expectantly to listen to what Ordaz had to say. "One option is the Nuevo Laredo border, heading into San Antonio. There is a large Mexican community living there, and will play well with the press here and the press there. It puts you where you are strongest: in front of a crowd, talking with people. This first stop sets the tone of the entire trip, and it puts you on a positive foot with the people.\n\n"The second proposal is the Reynosa border, with the first stop being Corpus Christi and then on to Houston. It's a much smaller city, with less opportunities for big gatherings to catch the headlines. However, it is a center of commerce, in particular the petroleum industry. If we are wanting to make inroads with the American industrialists, I can't think of a better place to start than with Corpus Christi."\n\nMateos nodded along as Ordaz spoke, glad to have a new voice to listen to. But as he neared the end of his speech, and they were no closer to making a decision, Mateos felt his annoyance slowly rising back to the surface. "So there are merits to both... that we have established. What I am curious about is what you think I ought to do? Which is better, San Antonio or Corpus Christi?" Mateos watched Ordaz's expression and waited, that stoic gaze never changing as always, until finally Ordaz leaned forward with an answer."

I hope you come and visit when you grow up, the city is beautiful."\n\nLópez Mateos says his goodbyes to the 3rd grade classroom, then walks out with his team. South San Antonio was majority Mexican-American, so López Mateos felt mostly at home among the people here. With speeches at a community center, stops at local restaurants, the president began to genuinely enjoy his stay in the Lone Star state, feeling more connected to the growing Diaspora. As they exited onto the street, however, history got into the way.\n\nStanding on the several pick-up truck beds, a group of Texans gather in the parking lot across the street. "Remember the Alamo" Their signs read, accompanied by the Lone Star Flag. "Get the hell out of our country, Japanese puppet!" The chants grow louder as a dozen more people joined them, following the Mexican convoy.\n\n"They obviously aren't from this neighborhood," Mateos quips, though his tolerance for them deteriorates rapidly.\n\nThe next morning, before leaving, López Mateos walks in on Ordaz, reading him the morning paper. "Mexican president met with "patriot" opposition? Runs away like a coward? Ordaz, did we not account for this when making the itinerary? That was in a mostly hispanic neighborhood, too."\n\n"Your Excellency, I can assure you all precautions were taken, though Americans can be" -Ordaz searches for an excuse- "unpredictable."

We should extend our offer to the US, as a token of our goodwill, and to increase upon the deal's existing economic benefits."\n\nSalinas frowned. "Gustavo, this deal is about securing further investment and goodwill from the Sphere. The economic benefits of fishing alone are besides the point. The sector isn't all that profitable or important to our economy. Extending the deal to the US is counterproductive to the whole point of said deal."\n\n"And if we don't get all this hypothetical investment?"\n\n"Well, extending the deal's also going to result in a swarm of Californian and Texan trawlers coming over our waters, far more than Japan are willing to cross the ocean with. Exactly the kind of thing which some governor or congressman with an urge to self-promote could take advantage of. Do you want that?""

"If not for your brilliant idea, done outside of my oversight, I wouldn't have half our governors screaming down my phone! Being lead by guess who, of course!"\n\n"Well, of course Madrazo's there! There's a pot to be stirred, and that's all he does. What does he even have to complain about, anyway? The deal's mostly for the Pacific, and Tabasco's coastline is tiny. It's hardly like he's in Baja Sur or Sinaloa. Ridiculous."\n\n"You're going to scale this deal back, and you're going to do it now," said Ordaz in a low growl.\n\n"No, I don't believe I will."\n\n"Excuse me?" A vein throbbed in Ordaz's head. "This has been an internal disaster, all for a handful of pesos, and we both know it!"\n\nSalinas' voice was flat and cold. "So handle it then. I've already compromised with you once. I'm not about to compromise the little political and economic benefit we have gained from this deal because your compromise has blown up in your face. The governors will stop caring about this in a week, and you're in charge of the interior. So handle it.""

And you'll never guess which governor has signed on to their petition."\n\n"You mean the governor of Tabasco, a state on the other side of Mexico from where all Japanese fishing occurs?" asked Salinas. "Last time I checked, they still can't get through Panama and they're not about to go around Cape Horn just to fish in the Gulf."\n\n"Be that as it may, it may be advisable to scale back the deal somewhat," said Ordaz. "This may end up causing more trouble than it's worth."\n\n"But if we do that, and for such an unproductive sector, then we'll find ourselves obstructed any time we have to make unpopular decisions."\n\n"I disagree.

The President had, in the PEMEX board room around him, an assembly of every Mexican lucky enough to pull levers controlling the flow of its black gold. So why, then, had he wasted an hour of his life listening to a cacophony of objections and excuses?\n\nHe stood up, gritted his teeth, and pounded that table with a fraction of his old force as a boxer. The room froze as a thin line of blood appeared on the President's hand. "You. Get me a bag of ice. And you three-" with his undamaged hand, he singled out Secretaries Salinas and Ordaz, and the Governor of oil-rich Tabasco, Carlos Madrazo, "make your points. Thirty seconds each."\n\nSalinas started, "Mexico's northern states already possess the infrastructure necessary for large scale export. Unfortunately, it flows to only one nation, leaving the north and the nation as a whole vulnerable to economic shocks and political pressure. Reorienting that infrastructure to serve both the US and Japan is both efficient and prudent."\n\nMadrazo next, "Your Excellency, deprivation stalks southern Mexico. While we don't yet have the pipeline to serve the Pacific, the construction and oil jobs this opportunity represents would lift countless communities from poverty..." he trailed off, watching the dark blood leaking from Mateos' fist. But then he rallied, "You know my reputation, that infrastructure would be com-"\n\n"Time's up," Ordaz cut in, "I question the premise of this deal.

Making his way to the table with the diplomatic team, the president eyes the catering on the side of the room. Burgers? Interesting choice, the president thought. "Why not?"\n\nAs he sat down and dug into his meal, the president reflected on his experience in the small city. The visit to Corpus Christi had mostly gone off without a hitch, and he definitely made some leeway with the businessmen in the city. It would be a small, but noticeable boost to the Mexican energy sector and cross-border trade, exactly what he had come here for.\n\nBut what of the masses of San Antonio? He did not exactly arrive here to the applause of tens of thousands of Mexican-Americans, though he also avoided any of the potential controversy that would have come with such a visit, Alamo and all. "I'm glad we came here," Mateos said to the table, upon which the team nodded in agreement. "Sometimes, something lighter is needed."\n\nThe same could not be said for López Mateos' stomach, however.

Being president meant that he spent all day every day surrounded by advisors, lobbyists, and other individuals who sought to both give council and influence his decision making. This moment was a fleeting opportunity to ignore the duties of his office for a small length of time and just relax. Yet as he allowed his mind to wander his attention was brought back to a looming decision he had to make for the Canadian leg of his North American trip.\n\nLópez Mateos and his entourage were expected to visit Ottawa, the seat of the Canadian government, to meet with their Canadian counterparts. Yet if he decided to take a brief detour to Vancouver a myriad of opportunities would present themselves. The city was Canada's gateway to the Pacific Ocean, and it was chafing under OFN rules that restricted trade with the Sphere. Businesses there would jump at the chance to use Mexico as an intermediary to reach the Japanese market.\n\nHowever, there were other factors to consider. Offering Canadians a backdoor to the Sphere wouldn't be popular with the Americans, and the whole point of this tour was to win them over. Was detouring from his primary objective for a chance at a few extra Canadian dollars really worth it?"

Several businessmen have already promised to open branches in Mexico, and many more are planning joint ventures with Mexican firms."\n\nOrdaz wanted to reply that they might as well be joint Canadian-Japanese ventures, since the Mexicans were only serving as middlemen, but he held his tongue.\n\n"I'm thinking of extending our stay a few days," Mateos said suddenly, "With a bit more time we can strike even more deals."\n\nFinally getting his teeth under control, Ordaz frowned. "Your Excellency, are you sure about this? The Prime Minister is still expecting us in Ottawa. None of the investments we're getting are very large, and every extra day here could be better spent making deals in the United States."\n\nMateos paused, considering this advice, then replied..."

Businessmen continued to invest in Mexico, but in smaller and smaller amounts. All of them were interested in trading with the Sphere through Mexico and hesitated to expand cooperation beyond that. At this rate his efforts might win some positive press at home, but not much else.\n\nOrdaz entered the hall frowning and placed a newspaper in front of Mateos. He read the headline: MEXICAN PRESIDENT HELPS CANADA SKIRT TRADE RULES.\n\n"This is a copy of the Seattle Daily Times," Ordaz explained, "and the author paints a less than flattering picture of our efforts to facilitate trade between Canada and Japan."\n\nNow Mateos frowned as well. Leave it to the Yanquis to get up in arms over minor trade deals.\n\n"Your Excellency," Ordaz continued, "I believe we must act quickly to ensure this does not complicate our tour.

Ordaz replied, "I explained to the Prime Minister that you weren't able to sleep on our overnight flight and would prefer to save the meat of our talks for tomorrow. He was very understanding.

In the end two possible avenues were discussed, Oil and Ships.\n\nThe first would be an offer to open up Mexico's oil supply to Canadian business. The goal was to entice them with lower energy costs through a new, relatively close, supplier in Mexico. In return the President was hoping that Mexico could use these investments to continue building up Mexico's oil industry. A win-win situation where both sides benefit.\n\nThe other option was to attempt and create a partnership between Canada and Mexico based on shipbuilding. The logic behind this offer was that Canada needed to increase their supply of commercial ships and Mexico has the labor to assist in that endeavor. This proposal also has the convenient side effect of lessening Canada's dependence on the American merchant marine.\n\nIn the end López Mateos had to decide on which proposal to build his overall pitch around..."

One of them said, "Investors in the United States are much better equipped to invest into your energy sector. Perhaps we could help facilitate cooperation between you and them?"\n\nOther investors made similar noncommittal comments, including some references to Mexico's "checkered past" in foreign oil investment. Being the charmer that he was, López Mateos eventually mended the awkward social climate in the room. However as he did so he couldn't help but wonder what Ordaz had been thinking.\n\nAs much respect as he had for Gustavo's political prowess, this was something of a mismatch. Canada did not have the same appetite for oil that the United States or even Japan had after all. When he was out of this room the President decided that he wanted to have a chat with his advisor."

"We would also like to trade with the Co-Prosperity Sphere." The President paused for a moment as everyone became a little more relaxed.\n\n"While the Japanese have done much wrong, it does not give Washington the right to completely dictate our trade practices.

This was his doing, his making, borne out of countless hours of manual labor in the months prior at his workplace in Ectapec.\n\nWhen hearing of the potential deal between López Mateos and Boeing, the workplace lit up with joy. Their expertise would have placed them first in line to be absorbed into a hypothetical Boeing Mexico Plant, an integral piece of a new Mexican supply chain that would produce planes for Mexico, in Mexico, along with the Boeing pay grade. In the end, it seems the president was content with selling his cheap labor instead in exchange for a few planes.\n\nSuch childish hopes, Javier thought.

But that would take time, and in the meanwhile, Mexico's workers would be hurt by the exporting of Mexico's resources. While it might make the executives happy, Mateos couldn't betray the workers like that. Could he?\n\nThe other option would be to propose Mexico as a source of investment for these executives. They could invest in companies in Mexico where pieces of the car would be manufactured, and so they could line their own pockets while giving the people of Mexico more money. That notion sounded a lot more pleasing to Mateos, but it would be a harder sell to the executives."

MEX_Mateos.56.t:0 "Courting the Auto Execs"
MEX_Mateos.56.desc:0 ""Mexico has quite a few resources that could help bolster your efforts here," Mateos proposed, a small tightness in his chest growing. "I'm sure discussions between you and some industrialists back in Mexico City could be quite fruitful in that regard."\n\nThe auto executive smiled and glanced at a few of the others taking part in the tour. He then looked back towards Mateos and nodded. "That could certainly be fruitful indeed. I've heard quite a bit about the resources of Mexico and its industrialists, and a meeting between us would go a long way towards aiding both our nations' economies. In fact, I'll start discussing scheduling with my secretary after this." Some of the other executives nodded, all of them seemingly pleased with the suggestion or at the very least open to it.\n\nThe man's smile was comforting in some ways. Mateos returned it, and the auto executive gestured to another part of the factory as the group began to move on their way. Local industrialists in Mexico would welcome this, and there was a good chance that they could learn a thing or two from the Americans that would help them both. But Mateos knew that his workers needed the investments more than the industrialists needed the innovations. There was a part of him that couldn't shake the fact that he was in some way betraying the workers for the interests of Mexico's industrialists, even if in the end it did bring more prosperity to Mexico.\n\nThis deal was important, though. Getting closer relations with the United States was essential if he was to get the deal over the Olympic Games. The pain in Mateos' chest subsided, and he refocused his attention on another set of innovations the American manufacturers were making."
MEX_Mateos.56.a:0 ""This is what is best for Mexico.""

MEX_Mateos.57.t:0 "America First, Mexico Second"
MEX_Mateos.57.desc:0 ""Perhaps you could put some investments into Mexican industries, and our manufacturers could aid in supplying your factories here." Mateos gestured around. "I know of some factories in Coahuila which manufacture engines. They could be made to export here, if funding allows." While Mateos smiled, hoping that he could get some much needed funds flowing into Mexico, he could already see the faltering expressions of the auto executives.\n\n"I must apologize, Mister President, but that is likely outside of our control. You see, the unions here in America can get quite upset if we start throwing cash outside of the United States. They'll complain about us not giving them higher wages, better benefits, or other such bunkum. I really wish we could help you, and we do appreciate the suggestion. Perhaps in the future, we could consider such ventures?" The executive offered the olive branch, one that Mateos begrudgingly accepted.\n\n"Yes, perhaps in the future." Easing the tension quickly, he gestured onwards. "Shall we move along?" As the auto executives jumped at the chance to move the tour forwards from that brief awkwardness, Mateos stewed. Why Ordaz had not given him better advice, he could not grasp. Did he not want this deal with America as much as Mateos did, if not more? What the hell was he thinking? These American corporate executives were vultures, and they would never part with their money so easily. Perhaps he still put too much faith in Ordaz. Or perhaps he was simply tired.\n\nMateos turned his attention back to the tour as one of the men pointed towards another set of innovations the American manufacturers were making."
MEX_Mateos.57.a:0 "A deal would have been nice."

MEX_Mateos.58.t:0 "A Meeting of Two Eagles"
MEX_Mateos.58.desc:0 "The car pulled up before the large white building that was the residence of the most powerful man in the OFN. López Mateos took a deep breath, and stepped out before the crowd of cameras and reporters all hoping to get a shot of him. They certainly got it, Mateos' aides having to push some of them aside so that he could actually reach President Nixon.\n\nNixon scowled at the reporters as one might look upon flies swarming around in the summer heat. His expression shifted only slightly when Mateos reached him. Nixon put his hand out to shake Mateos', a gesture Mateos accepted dispassionately.\n\nAs the two men did their best to smile and make small talk, Mateos concealed his bubbling anger. He'd met with Nixon several times before, and though he was hardly a pleasant man Mateos once believed him to be trustworthy.\n\nThe Aleutians Crisis had disabused him of that notion. Nixon was obviously lying about U.S. activity in the Northern Pacific, and to cover his tracks he'd undermined Mateos' mediation, duped Ordaz and threatened to start a nuclear war.\n\n"Please, come inside," Nixon said at last, although his tone was far from warm. Business-like was the way that Mateos would describe it. Nixon let go of his hand and led him into the White House.\n\n"Richard, let me cut right to the chase," Mateos said as he followed behind. "Our first order of business ought to be the Chamizal border dispute. This issue has become a perpetual thorn in both our sides."\n\n"On that we are agreed," Nixon replied as they reached the Oval Office. "I had some thoughts on that...""

MEX_Mateos.59.t:0 "The Rio Grande Flows Undeterred"
MEX_Mateos.59.desc:0 ""The 1911 arbitration results are the surest path to solving the dispute, I've come to believe," Nixon answered as the two sat across from one another, surrounded by the trappings of the Oval Office. "That ought to settle the matter and keep both our peoples happy."\n\nMateos grinned despite himself. "Yes, that will go over well with both the party and the people. It won't take much convincing at all to get them on board." It was as if a weight had been lifted from Mateos' shoulders, even if the real battle was yet to come.\n\nThe rest of the conversion flowed from there, with the two discussing topics ranging from cross-border trade to continued efforts to coordinate opposition to the Nazis. The meeting was going quite smoothly, as the two seemingly found accord on numerous topics. At some point in the conversation refreshments were brought in. Nixon seemed more relaxed than he had been out with the press, something Mateos was grateful for. With spirits flying high and the two finding common ground on several issues, López Mateos pushed towards his ultimate goal with renewed confidence.\n\n"As to the last item on our agenda..." he began, "I was curious how the United States might feel about supporting a bid for Mexico to host the Olympic Games? I know that Detroit has a competing bid, but given how much we've found agreement on already, I think that this presents a golden opportunity to show the world the wealth and unity of not just Mexico, but the whole of the Americas. So I was thinking you could drop the bid for Detroit and support Mexico City, as a symbol of our renewed friendship.""

MEX_Mateos.60.desc:0 ""I've already spoken with the U.S. Olympic Committee, and they've agreed to a compromise," Nixon explained as he began pouring some champagne for a toast. "The plan we've agreed to is this: the OFN will support Mexico City as the next site of the Olympic Games. In exchange, Mexico will support America's bid to host the Games next time we're in the running."\n\nMateos was light headed as he finally released the breath he had been holding in. His mind fizzled almost as much as the champagne that was being handed to him.\n\nGladly taking it, he replied, "What a well-thought-out compromise, Richard. We'll have to discuss this proposal back in Mexico City, but I am certain that there will be no resistance. I will ensure my successor knows that this agreement is essential."\n\n"Good!" Nixon slid forward as they held their glasses together. "To unity against the fascists!"\n\n"To a renewed friendship!" Mateos clinked the glasses together and took a sip of the champagne, letting the liquid slide across his taste buds. The tingling sensation it left behind was just the feeling he needed after a victory like this. It was as if he could already hear the cheering crowds filling stadiums across the nation. He could see the press from all over the globe coming to see the wealth and prosperity of the Mexican Miracle. And he could feel the jubilation of the masses, inspired to see Mexico triumphantly rising to a position of prominence on the world stage.\n\n"And to a lasting legacy," Mateos said through a wide grin."

MEX_Mateos.61.t:0 "Legacy Has its Costs"
MEX_Mateos.61.desc:0 "Nixon frowned. Mateos couldn't read the expression well enough to put his mind at ease. Was he upset that he had moved the conversation along? Was there a problem with his request? Worst of all, was he going to say no? Mateos could feel an oncoming migraine, or perhaps it was just lightheadedness. As he braced himself for the pain, Nixon finally broke the silence.\n\n"While there are some in the OFN who are... skeptical about Mexico, given its continued ties to the Sphere, there are also those that still remember Mexico's long-standing opposition to Nazism. There will be some grumbling, but I can make a few calls and ensure that your bid won't face significant opposition from the member states. Let sport be sport and politics be politics, I'll tell 'em. How's that sound?"\n\nMateos felt like a weight had been lifted from his chest. He still felt a pounding beginning to build itself within his skull, but he had something to work with at least. "Yes, that sounds reasonable," he replied. "I will happily let Mexico City know of this. I hope that this will represent a renewal of the friendship between our two nations, and I look forward to continued cooperation."\n\nHe stood and held out his hand for Nixon to take, which the American President did. The handshake was firm, though not as warm as he thought it would be. Or perhaps hoped was the better word. With the meeting over, Mateos was able to make it back to his car, waving off the press that were hounding him for news on the results of his meeting. Once inside he leaned back, undid his collar and tie, and felt his neck press against the soft, cool cushions of his seat. Only one thought was on his mind as he readied himself for another migraine..."

MEX_Mateos.62.desc:0 "Nixon's face darkened, and Mateos felt his heart jump into his throat. "I'm afraid that is out of the question. We've given ground on many other issues - significant ground at that. You've made these negotiations difficult with the deals you've been striking in other areas, and you expect us to just hand over the Olympic Games for nothing? No. We're not discussing the Olympics today. And if that is all you were hoping to discuss, then this meeting is over."\n\nFor a brief moment, Mateos sat frozen in shock. Fuck. He should have known Nixon would react like this. Instead of bowing to American pressure Mateos had stood up for Mexico, and now this miserable, ugly man was taking his revenge. Nixon's words stung like a punch to the gut, just as they had during the crisis.\n\nMateos got to his feet stiffly, his hands beginning to shake. "I understand, Richard. I hope that you will reconsider, as there are some issues I am open to renegotiating."\n\nNixon did not reply, so Mateos knew that it was fruitless to push on. He made his way back to his car, the press cameras flashing through his fingers as he tried to hide his face. Once inside he undid his collar and tie, tossing it down onto the floor of the car.\n\n"Do you need anything, sir?" His driver asked, voice laced with concern. "Water, perhaps?"\n\n"Water, yes... I will take some water..." Mateos breathed out, barely comprehending what he was saying. His skull was crashing inwards, the pain sending shivers down his body. If he had anything else other than water, he knew it wouldn't stay down for long. Chugging the cool liquid once it was in his hand, he sighed with whatever relief he could muster and leaned back."

Ordaz heard the strain in Mateos' voice and knew that it was one of his migraines.\n\n"Your Excellency, perhaps it would be best if you got some rest.

Ordaz, I'm calling to tell you that I've managed to get the Americans to agree to the Olympics proposal. I've had to stay an extra few days-"\n\n"An extra few days?" Ordaz interrupted with growing concern. "Your Excellency, that was not on the schedule."\n\n"You think I don't fucking know that?" Mateos replied, his anger rising. "I had to give up a hell of a lot to get these Yanqui bastards back into the talks. It isn't going to go over well back home, but it needs to get passed. And you're the one who's going to pass it, because you got me into this fucking mess!"\n\n"Your Excellency-" Ordaz began to protest, but it was too late. Mateos had hung up.

His palm dropped to his leg, then came up to hold his chin in contemplation.\n\n"Maybe..." López Mateos mumbled, glancing at the wall.\n\n"Maybe not..." he mumbled again, looking towards the floor.\n\nAfter quickly retreating to his desk, Mateos flipped through the pages of his journal. Holding it to his face, he closely re-read each and every word. These pages contained reports on the behavior of Ordaz during López Mateos' stay in Australia, piled from discussions he'd had with his staff since returning.\n\nHe shook his head. He doubted himself, but more than that, he doubted Ordaz. While Mateos still had faith in his old friend's political capabilities, his planned voyage to the Sphere will leave Mexico in the hands of Ordaz longer than any time before. Perhaps it would be best in this scenario if Ordaz was monitored... or, well, greatly assisted by the Mexican Cabinet in governing the country while Mateos is away.\n\nMateos bit his lip, and shook his head once more. Placing the cabinet in power was the safe option, but Ordaz has previously been such a dependable ally and forcing this arrangement on him would be humiliating.

The one who seized the heavy reins of leadership from a chaotic vacuum, and who, through the Plan of Guadulupe, would not relinquish them until the traitor Huerta was defeated and stability restored.\n\nBut his errors had compounded, and once-loyal instruments had turned upon him.

Ordaz conceded that a few Japanese language courses might be appropriate at the university level, but balked at extending the program to high schools. He claimed that costs would be severe, especially with Salinas' recommendation to hire teachers from the isles themselves.\n\nOrdaz followed, over the course of several pages, by arguing that Japanese would distract students from several more practical subjects. English was given as an example of the latter - along with department estimates highlighting the number of Mexican emigres heading to the US and Japan respectively. There was a difference of multiple digits.

López Mateos nodded, angling between a parked Ford and a gaggle of pedestrians. Salinas waited until the President passed through Scylla and Charybdis before continuing, "Better fuel economy as well. Most importantly, competition between Japanese and Yanqui brands would drive down prices for our citizens."\n\nLópez Mateos took a sudden left down a side street, as the tires of the trailing security detail screeched in protest. Taking in the working class tenements, he asked Salinas, "What about shipping costs? The Pacific's not cheap to cross." Salinas began to answer, but Mateos cut him off, "What if we get them to invest in facilities here? Make these Toyotas in Jalisco or Michoacán. We'd create jobs and the Japanese would be more competitive." Salinas thought it through - Toyota and Mitsubishi factories would be an immense win, but would the Japanese accept?\n\nWell in front of them, a traffic light began to blink.

On top of that, we have intellectual property popular throughout Latin America that, through tie-ins, could introduce their series and actors. For example, I assume El Santo and a sumo wrestler would do well together at the box office."\n\nA new thought seemed to strike Salinas, "Our natural and historical assets may also be key.

Privileges such as preferential treatment at warehouses and economic incentives for trade. While this would certainly please Tokyo and benefit Tijuana in particular, I caution against this course of action as it would cause problems for us in Washington. Instead, I would recommend simply opening the port to Japanese trade without any sort of preferential treatment. This would placate both Japan and the United States, as well as allowing us flexibility in future trade policy."\n\nOnce again the decision fell on the President's shoulders.

You can get the same thing from a cockfight!"\n\nThe joke, novel as it was, usually received more laughter than it deserved - still, it spread across Mexico. From its humble beginnings, the joke soon supplanted the story it was about; it was soon predictable, being made instinctively when something related to the dragged-out fight between Salinas and Madrazo was mentioned.\n\nSoon, the newspapers were involved: why run Salinas' dry corrections or Madrazo's long speeches when you could run a cartoon of the two men as chickens pecking at each other?\n\nThis did not last long. Drumming up a media circus out of a spat between two powerful men was one thing, but brazenly mocking them was another. The papers heeded the 'advice' of the government, and soon the whole story was dropped.\n\nIt was not forgotten, though. The joke was not so popular and few cared about who was right or wrong, but for years to come many would think of chickens first and politicians second when they heard the names Madrazo and Salinas."

MEX_Mateos.78.desc:0 "López Mateos stood outside the shrine gate and felt a strong gust of wind on his face. His travel fatigue had faded, replaced by excitement and fascination.\n\nThe Japanese authorities had put together a very impressive tour on such short notice. The President got to see a concert at the city's Public Auditorium, visit the Office of the Governor General and the Taihoku New Park outside of it, and view an impressive collection of artifacts in the Taiwan Governor Museum.\n\nMateos was no fool. He knew these stops were chosen to showcase the benefits Japanese rule had brought to the island. Yet along the way he was allowed to see and interact with real people going about their days, so it all felt very genuine.\n\nThe most interesting stop was the very last: the Taiwan Grand Shrine. It was the largest Shinto shrine on the island, built atop Yuanshan Mountain just outside the city center. In all his travels Mateos had never seen anything quite like it.\n\nHe watched with rapt attention as worshippers made their way up the mountain and bowed before entering the gate. They all washed their hands and mouths, put money into an offering box and rang the bell. It was a cultural practice he didn't understand, and yet it did not feel entirely alien. Many Mexican Catholics visited pilgrimage sites with their own unique rituals.\n\n"Enjoying the tour, Your Excellency?" asked one of his guides."

At last he produced a world atlas and flipped it to a page on East Asia, covered in detailed notes.\n\n"Your Excellency, the plans for your tour are nearly complete. We'll start in Japan, of course, but we should save the home islands themselves for later. For your first stop I recommend visiting one of Japan's outer territories, as a prelude of sorts."\n\n"That sounds reasonable. What did you have in mind?"\n\nSalinas laid a finger on the atlas. "There are two obvious candidates: the Korean peninsula and the island of Taiwan. On paper Korea has several advantages over Taiwan. It has a larger population and thus a larger consumer market, and its industry is more developed..."\n\n"Is there a 'but' coming?" Mateos asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Yes, Your Excellency," he replied with a sigh. "Korea has a distinct culture and a long history of independence. And some of Japan's past actions in the territory have been... less than pleasant. A state visit could prove controversial, at home and abroad."\n\nMateos studied the atlas for a moment before looking Salinas in the eye. "I'll be honest Raúl, I'm not an expert on East Asia.

He meant to apologize, but the mayor responded faster.\n\n"Perhaps Your Excellency would prefer a tour of the city instead?

You'll be able to make connections with high-ranking Japanese officials there."\n\n"So, I should visit Keijō?"\n\n"Not necessarily, Your Excellency. There are other possibilities worth exploring. For example, Fuzan is a major trade hub with state of the art port facilities-"\n\n"Enough," Mateos said, growing impatient. "We don't have time to discuss every possible location.

Was this man from the home islands, or one of the Chinese native to Taiwan? All of them spoke perfectly fluent Japanese, so it was hard for Mateos to tell the difference.\n\nIn the end the talks had gone nowhere. The small group of industrialists on the island lacked the capital for anything more than token investments in Mexico. Agricultural exports were also a bust. Taiwan was primarily known for sugar and rice cultivation, so they were not exactly eager to import Mexican grains or sugar cane. Mateos wondered why he'd decided to visit this island in the first place.\n\nThen, nursing his aching head, he remembered that it wasn't his idea. Salinas had told him to come here, along with planning the rest of this trip. His advisor either had no problem wasting the President's time, or was quite ill-informed about Japan and its economy."

It symbolizes how we may all grow and prosper together under the venerable sun above, don't you agree?" Sukarno gestured to the myriad of plants growing in a central garden from all over the region, all rising high to try and reach the sun shining through the opening in the roof.\n\nPart of Mateos had wished the roof was closed so that they might be air conditioned. "Yes, quite lovely," he replied instead. The symbology was not lost on Mateos, however. In the end, all of these nations were still oriented towards the rising sun of Japan. Yet he knew that in many ways, Sukarno was different. He had a well-documented anti-imperialist past from the Second World War. If he could get Sukarno on his side for any documents signed in Tokyo, he knew it would bring heft to any agreement. But how?\n\nHe could offer to spend a day visiting the war memorials for those who lost their lives in the defense of Indonesian independence. That would go a long way towards showing the world Mexico's firm anti-imperialist stance, as well as showing solidarity with the Indonesian people, but he knew that that might also inflame tensions with the United States.\n\nHe could also simply keep this visit narrowly focused on trade and agriculture. While less likely to upset the Americans, it would also mean that he'd have to deal with negotiations. And negotiations might mean giving up more than he was willing."

Thankfully, the cameras had not caught his exhaustion, as most of the press were equally struggling to keep pace with Sukarno and his entourage. When they finally reached the top of the hill, rows of stones came into view. The stones went on for several hundred meters in every direction.\n\n"These are all men who died in defense of Indonesian freedom. They gave their lives so that we might live as a people free from the colonial yoke," Sukarno explained, slowly waving his hand out to gesture to the graves. He looked to Mateos, awaiting his own reaction.\n\nMateos may not have been a particularly superstitious man, but even he could feel as if the dead were watching him in a place such as this. The hairs on the back of his neck stirred as he turned to reply to Sukarno, "A noble struggle. I know I stand with my Indonesian friends when I say that these men died for a righteous cause: the cause of independence."\n\nMost of the press had finally reached the two leaders, creating a semicircle around them as Sukarno said, "It is not only Indonesians who died for our freedom. Out there you will find men from all across the Sphere. There, for instance," Sukarno pointed across towards a grave a few meters off, "is a Japanese man who died on Borneo."\n\nHis breath caught in his throat. He could feel the press closing in around them, the flashes of their cameras near blinding as they waited to hear what his reply would be. He knew that he could reply to Sukarno's praise of the Japanese with praise of his own, but that would be sure to enrage the Americans. If he provided canned responses, however, it might come across as insensitive and ruin this entire venture. With what felt like the world watching on, Mateos finally responded."

While he was currently touring the Sphere that did not mean he was free from the balancing act between the two superpowers.\n\nThe president's speech was as safe as safe can be in the context. He kept his statements broad, talking about the bravery of the Indonesian people while also carefully wording his speech to not mention the Japanese in a positive or negative light. It seemed like his verbal tiptoeing had worked, as when he reached the end of his prepared comments the faces of the various Japanese diplomats in attendance did not show joy or contempt, but apathy and boredom.\n\nWhen it comes to relations between the United States and Japan one can somewhat predict how the other will react. If one superpower is happy, the other is angry, and vice versa. So when President López Mateos managed to neither anger nor excite the Japanese diplomats in attendance, he was confident that he had the same effect on the American observers overseas."

However, his speech also had a number of unintended consequences...\n\n"THE FACE OF FOREIGN SOLIDARITY IN THE SPHERE" was plastered on the headlines of the first newspaper the president saw the next morning, with a picture of his face right beneath it. While he was happy that they chose to use a flattering picture for their newspaper, President López Mateos was far more concerned with how this paper would be received overseas.\n\nTo start, it was very easy to see how the Americans and the rest of the OFN would react to this quite negatively. The president lavishing their political rivals with praise would only serve to anger them. That's not to mention how the PRI would react to this back home.

Across the table Sukarno had been looking visibly bored for the last hour and it was honestly hard to blame him. Much of the meeting had been driven more by their staff than the pair of presidents.\n\nWhile the two leaders had already agreed to the principle of increased trade between the two nations, clearly their aides had much more specific and in depth topics they needed to work out with one another to make that happen. Percentages, harvest numbers, and many other phrases were thrown back and forth between the two staffs. The president could have kept up with them if he had the energy but in hour three of the meeting he was struggling to stay locked in.\n\nHowever he was brought back to attention when one of his aides began to tell him that he had to decide to liberalize tariffs on one of two products, either rubber or peppers. Whichever he chose the trade delegations would visit to "encourage a deeper understanding of the industries involved" and more importantly, to take political photo ops."

At the end of the tour the two presidents reconvened with their staffs to put the finishing touches on the trade agreement.\n\nEverything that President López Mateos read in the agreement lead him to the conclusion that Mexico only served to benefit from the deal, potentially even at the expense of Indonesia. That is what made the president suspicious of Sukarno. Things were too good to be true, both at the rubber farm and at the negotiating table today. Since there was nothing concretely wrong President López Mateos signed and finalized the agreement, but that sinking feeling in his stomach never went away..."

Though the sweet, sunny air of the Indonesian countryside washed against López Mateos' face as the scent of black pepper tingled his nose ever slightly, the sensory contradiction made itself clear.\n\nSurrounded by the lush rolling hills of western Lampung province, the plantation that lies in front of him and the delegation reminds him less of an ideal to aspire to, and more like the sweltering valleys of California where Mexican-Americans toil every day for that sweet green dollar.

No longer will our agricultural sector be tied to the market fluctuations of Washington and the needs of those north of the border."\n\n"Our only decision in this regard is volume" -he points to China- "or price" -Salinas points to Japan. "Getting the foothold in the Chinese market early on will be key, seeing as the modernization program is picking up steam. As the average Chinese gets even a little more change to spend, the demand for different crops is bound to skyrocket in a market of hundreds of millions." López Mateos remains silent - Salinas is in his element here.\n\n"However, when it comes to potential price, the Yen is at its strongest on the home islands. We could be talking multiple times the price for the same goods - fish, corn, you name it. They also carry the advantage of possible deals in the machinery sector."\n\nLópez Mateos listened closely, the sounds of the city drowned out in favor of the conversation at hand - a decision had to be made. "So you are saying that China could serve as a possible investment into the future -a huge, untapped market- while Japan is a more stable investment in the market?"\n\n"Just so, Your Excellency.

"Due to my scheduling of the China trip, we have an open day to travel somewhere else, like Guangdong or Manchukuo."\n\n"Oh, yes," López Mateos genuinely desired to visit one of the two - see the conditions for himself, "the Jewels of the Pan-Asian experiment."\n\n"Yes, exactly." The light sarcasm of the president flew straight over the secretary's head. "Both options have their merits. Manchukuo is arguably the industrial center of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, and a deal with the court would mean many opportunities in the area of machinery, sure to boost our capacity."\n\nLópez Mateos was slightly confused at this point, not sure why Guangdong was even on the table when placed next to that offer. "And Guangdong, they are mostly focused around tech, right? How would that benefit agriculture?"\n\nSalinas' eyes lit up. "That is the thing, Your Excellency. I have done my fair share of research into the kinds of products coming from the Delta, and the applications of machines used by the likes of Fujitsu have applications that go far beyond business. And, being a much more urban population, the growing middle class 'Zhujin' there is an untapped market for foreign foodstuffs and products."\n\nLópez Mateos, though a worldy, educated man, knew admittedly little of the various Japanese companies and their products, and sat in silence as Salinas gave his take.\n\n"Personally, I would recommend...""

The President politely gestured to the interpreter, "Do you happen to know when His Majesty will arrive to negotiate?"\n\nAfter consulting with the official next to him, the man coughed up an unsatisfactory answer. "Unfortunately, it seems that the Emperor had to attend to important matters of state, though the delegation here has been graciously authorized to conduct matters of business on his behalf."\n\n"That emperor" -López Mateos whispered to Salinas next to him- "What a pushover."

Here he had finally found a brief respite, even if out of the corner of his eye he could see the Japanese hosts watching him carefully.\n\nOne of the translators spoke up.

After the hosts had bowed and made their exit, Mateos said, "Remind me of the suggestions they had made for tomorrow."\n\n"Well," his translator began, "the first was a visit to the Tsukiji Fish Market. It's more local, and an important market for fishermen here. Fishing is a key industry in both Mexico and Japan, so they thought it might foster some ideas on trade. The other option is heading out of the city to see some of the rice farms in the area.

Mateos never saw any actual fishermen, and from here he couldn't see any fish either. All he saw were rows of crates stacked on top of pallets, lifted by a team of forklifts. The lifts moved from one end of the warehouse near the docks towards the back of the markets, with fishmongers opening the crates as soon as they were put down.\n\nIt was an impressive display, Mateos had to admit. Even as he failed to stifle a yawn, the ingenuity and efficiency of the system before him was inspiring. His mind drifted to Mexico's own fisherman, and he wondered whether there might be something to learn from this.\n\n"Quite impressive!" Mateos said, after the translator finally finished explaining how the value of the fish is actually determined. "While our methods are not as advanced as yours, our fishermen are just as industrious. If relations do improve between our two countries, I hope someday soon we can see Mexican fish being delivered on some of these forklifts."\n\nOne of the hosts laughed.

It cooled further when he looked further along the valley and saw an area where the machines weren't working. Men and women were laboring on a patchwork of paddies separated from the rest using only manual tools. "What about them?" Mateos asked, pointing to the group of farmers.

Mateos waved to the cameras and gave them a brief smile, before turning to the Prime Minister and giving him a respectful bow — just as his advisors had taught him.\n\n"It's an honor to be a guest of such a distinguished nation, Prime Minister Ino. You have truly created something remarkable on these islands." Mateos then extended a hand towards the Prime Minister, who shook it firmly.\n\n"The honor is all mine, to be hosting the President of one of the most prosperous nations in the Americas." Ino replied coolly.\n\nThe two men allowed the press to snap a few more photos of them together before making their way into the office, finally free from the prying eyes of the public. Once Mateos was seated across from Ino, he dove right into the business at hand.\n\n"The last time I was here, we very narrowly avoided global annihilation. The Aleutian Crisis has opened my eyes to the dangers of nuclear war, and now my priority is to ensure these weapons do not proliferate further. My advisors forwarded you an agreement, a pledge not to station nuclear weapons in any Latin American state or help those states to develop their own. Are you willing to sign it?"\n\nIno regarded Mateos silently, his face still betraying nothing. It was no wonder that this man had managed to become one of the most powerful men in the world, given how difficult he was to read. He almost reminded Mateos of Ordaz. Finally, Ino leaned forward to give his reply."
MEX_Mateos.97.a:0 ""With regards to that pledge...""

MEX_Mateos.98.t:0 "Midnight Recedes"
MEX_Mateos.98.desc:0 ""...Yes, your terms are acceptable." Ino replied, his expression softening. "I would be happy to sign it."\n\nMateos brightened up immediately. "Thank you, Prime Minister. Your support will be a major boon to our non-proliferation efforts." He let out a contented sigh, proud to have made the whole of the Americas safer, but there was still more he needed from Ino.\n\nThe two men moved on to the next issue at hand, quickly finding common ground once again. After several more rounds of discussion, they finally hammered out all the specifics of a comprehensive agreement. Mateos leaned back into his chair as Ino moved to place the document off to the side, briefly considering whether he was about to overreach. Yet there would never be a more opportune time to try and secure his legacy.\n\n"Prime Minister, there's one more thing. I believe my advisors forwarded some information to your office regarding the upcoming Olympic Games. Several members of the Sphere have bids before the Olympic Committee, and while I have faith that your allies would be more than capable of putting on games that could outshine all those that came before, I also feel that now is the perfect opportunity for a rising nation, unaligned with the major powers of the world, to play host to the games. Mexico has the wealth, the recognition, and the historical neutrality to be such a nation."\n\nMateos looked Ino right in the eye. "In other words, I would like to ask you to support Mexico City's bid to be the host of the 1968 Olympic Games." Just as he finished, he felt his head become lighter as he anticipated the reply. Had he been too bold? Was he too quick to play up Mexico's strengths, and perhaps insulted the prestige of Japan and its allies? With bated breath, Mateos watched Ino's unreadable expression for any hint of his answer."

MEX_Mateos.99.desc:0 ""I believe we can come to an agreement on this," Ino replied.\n\nMateos felt lightheaded for the briefest of moments as he let himself breathe. There were still the details to discuss, but he had not overplayed his hand. Japan was willing to work with him. A series of back and forths followed, in which minor concessions were given by one party or the other, but all in all it felt as though the dialogue was consistently flowing towards the inevitable conclusion of agreement.\n\nAt last, the two shook hands on a deal: Japan would support Mexico City's bid and, in exchange, Mexico would support a Sphere member's bid for the next Olympics. Mateos wasted no time in expressing his support, and the two men discussed a few last minute topics before bidding farewell.\n\nAs Mateos left the Prime Minister's offices, the press cameras flashed their lights on him once more. He gave them a grin and a wave, just as he always did, but it was not for their sake. Not now. His legacy had been secured. Mexico City would host the next Olympic Games, and it would do so with the support of a global superpower. Mexico's place as a leader among non-aligned nations would be cemented, and its prosperity would be displayed for all the world to see.\n\nJust before he reached his car, he stopped and turned towards the press. Raising a hand up, the cacophony of shouted questions quieted as they all leaned their microphones forward to catch his next words.\n\n"The Prime Minister and I just had a very productive conversation. Mexico's relations with Japan, and the Sphere at large, remain strong. May our two nations continue to benefit from the prosperity that open trade has given us.""

And for him to live on a cattle ranch passed down from his ancestors who arrived back when it was indisputably part of Mexico. In another world perhaps it still would be, but López Mateos knew this man would have found his way to the top of whatever nation he was in.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson was certainly aiming to make his guest feel welcome, with the bands and dancers, the banners and the color guard, and of course the food. Chicken, pork, corn, biscuits, López Mateos knew visiting the LBJ ranch would entail a huge feast. But now, as they walked along a gravel road observing the cows in the distance, they could turn away from festivity and towards more pressing matters.\n\n"So it's the Chamizal again?" asked Johnson, scoffing. "El Paso wants to settle it. Texas wants to settle it. Hell, I wanted to settle it back in the fifties, but Ike wouldn't listen to me."\n\n"But now, things are changing," López Mateos said. "Latin America is growing ever more important in world affairs, and the Chamizal is becoming quite the sore spot. An example of American imperialism, as some may say, and the sole instance where the United States refused to abide by international arbitration. Now, I just need your help in getting a compromise passed through the senate."\n\n"And you want me to get Nixon on board? I'm not on good terms with him at the moment. Hell, Jack and his snot-nosed brother-"\n\n"Are on board," López Mateos assured.

He swallowed, before giving the Prime Minister a careful nod. "Of course, Prime Minister. I did not expect you to agree out of hand. What would you like to discuss?"\n\n"The last time Tokyo had a bid before the Olympic Committee, Mexico chose not to support us. Instead it gave half-hearted statements that expressed neither support nor opposition to our proposal."\n\n"Mexico had not yet fully emerged on to the world stage, Prime Minister. You must understand that as a minor nation, we are often subject to forces outside of our control. Especially pressure from our northern neighbor. There were other factors we had to consider-"\n\nIno raised his hand, stopping Mateos mid-sentence. "I quite understand, Your Excellency. Do not worry yourself. Japan remains keen on shining a light on the growing prosperity and power of our allies, but we are willing to allow sports to be sports and leave politics aside. While we will not be able to support Mexico City's bid to host the Olympic Games, we will not give any opposition to your bid. Would that be sufficient for you, Your Excellency?"\n\nHe let himself breathe a sigh of relief. It was better than nothing, even if his body still felt as though the energy had been sapped out of him. He reached a hand up over the desk for Ino to take, then gave his answer."

A wave of polite laughter washed over the group of politicians as their tour guide finished telling another small joke. Thanks to the closer relations between Mexico and the Co-Prosperity Sphere, President López Mateos and a number of PRI representatives had been invited to Indonesia so that they and President Sukarno could discuss a possible trade deal between their two nations. Mateos had yet to meet his Indonesian counterpart, that would come later. First, he was given a tour of all that the Island of Bali offered. Sights, sounds, and flavors he had not experienced before.\n\nMateos' tour guide was a short woman with a bright smile. At first, her lousy jokes and strained Spanish had irritated His Excellency, but the sincerity in which she told the jokes and the obvious love she had for her home were infectious enough that soon Mateos found himself genuinely laughing. He had surrounded himself with so many hard men that he almost failed to appreciate a fellow romantic. The Mexican delegation was shown many great sights on the island. Mateos saw large temples with layered towers. Geometric patterns and magnificent sculpted creatures adorned every walkway. Between each tourist destination, he saw the hard-working people of Bali in their farms and shops. It reminded him of his years helping the farmers and common folk of his homeland.\n\nThe delegation finally arrived at the newly constructed Bali Beach Hotel, where the official welcome would occur. Mateos looked onto the beautiful golden sand beach adjacent to the hotel and the cool ocean beyond it. If not for his stuffy suit and many responsibilities, Mateos would have loved to run straight into the rejuvenating water. But he couldn't. Instead, he must go to the hotel where he would no doubt meet the esteemed President Sukarno, and they would come to some sort of deal."

MEX_Mateos.106.desc:0 "As López Mateos listened to the Governor-General of Chōsen drone on, the pit in his stomach grew. His host had been very polite, but since his arrival in this city two things had become clear. Korea was once a proud, independent nation, and he was now standing on its corpse.\n\nHe kept thinking back to the Aztec Empire and its capital at Tenochtitlan. When the Spanish arrived they had laid siege to the city, slaughtered its inhabitants, leveled its buildings, drained its lake and built a colonial capital on its ruins.\n\nHere in Keijō, once known as Seoul, the Japanese had been more subtle. The old Gyeongbokgung Palace still stood, though most of it had been torn down, and the rest was obscured from view by the massive Government-General building Mateos was now standing in. Other palaces and historical sites had also been dismantled and repurposed, or "opened to the public" as his tour guides put it. Scenic parks and public squares were dominated by Shinto shrines and monuments to Japan's greatness.\n\nIt wasn't just the buildings that showed the scars of occupation. The city was crawling with Japanese settlers, tourists, bureaucrats and soldiers. The few actual Koreans he got to meet were all minor functionaries, low-level workers or servants. They played their assigned parts well, deferring to their bosses and replying to his questions in heavily accented Japanese.\n\nMateos couldn't take it anymore. Abruptly getting up, he made some excuse about not feeling well to the Governor-General and fled back to his hotel. He knew that all empires were built on oppression, and that he had come here to win over the Japanese. But he refused to spend another minute in Keijō, the tomb of a dead nation."

Looking back towards the port of Fuzan, he couldn't help but marvel at its enormous size. He had already toured the port facilities on foot earlier that morning, but the distance made it easier to see its true scale.\n\nIt was a thriving port city, with boats coming and going constantly. Out came a cargo ship with resources extracted from the continent, bound for the home islands. In came a passenger liner, filled with Japanese administrators and tourists. These docks linked Japan to the rest of her empire, and their operations were second to none.\n\n"What do you think, Your Excellency?" asked his tour guide, struggling to be heard over the roar of the boat engine.\n\n"It's excellent," Mateos replied. "A true modern marvel. Mexico could learn a thing or two from this as we look to expand our Pacific ports."\n\nThe tour guide sensed an opening and smiled. "You know, the firms that managed the most recent port expansions are still based here in the city."\n\n"Really? Do you think they'd be interested in partnering with Mexican firms for a project overseas?"\n\n"I don't see why not.

"I understand, Prime Minister," he replied swiftly, before the rising tide of pain began to envelop him.

Asking him if the meeting had been a success. Asking him, asking him, asking him.\n\nHe slammed the car door shut and ordered his driver to bring him back to the embassy.

Not only was it the flagship project of Mateos' new age of Infrastructure for Mexico but it was a key step on the nation's journey onto the world stage. Melchor Ocampo Port would be Mexico's gateway to the Pacific, a place where so much of the lucrative trade with the Sphere could be exploited.\n\nPresident Mateos slumped into a simple wooden chair in an empty apartment in an employee lodging building.

Mateos soaked in the silence, piecing together the long day he just had. When you are President, every day is a long day, but this one is especially so. Mateos liked to keep a close eye on his big projects and the Melchor Ocampo Port was the biggest one of all. This particular day he had traveled to the construction site to see it in person. His staffers had organized a full schedule of handshakes and warm greetings. Mateos toured down the port, meeting construction workers, union leaders, private contractors, and local officials. He enjoyed this type of work. It was easy, yet he knew that it meant a lot to the workers that he had shown up. Mateos had spent so many years as a politician that even he forgot what it was like to be starstruck. To see powerful men as something more than they actually were.

He listened to the chime of the clock, as it told him it was well past time to head home. But the telephone was silent."

MEX_Mateos.117.desc:0 "The past months had been a decathlon for President López Mateos, and the last two events had been particularly challenging. He and what felt like every diplomat and economist the PRI could muster had just wrapped up two hours-long meetings, separate of course, with the US and Japanese ambassadors and carefully selected members of each nation's business community.\n\nThe stated goal was to finance the construction of a port in Melchor Ocampo, a vast enterprise that required equally vast sums of dollars, yen, and pesos to pay for it all. But the potential rewards would be great indeed, so great that the president could recite the export and import figures. It helped to have them drilled into his head, twice. Drilled into his head, yes, that's what this headache felt like.\n\nBut nothing ever came free. López Mateos had promised preferential trade rights to Yanquis, offered favorable jurisdiction to Osakans. The port project was an immense sausage, whose benefits were being carved up and offered to as many foreigners as Mexicans. But its rich juices greased and lubricated the path to an even greater prize.\n\nThe Olympic host city vote was approaching. After so many concessions, after so many headaches, what was one more? The finish line was in sight."

"It seems like that grand trip of yours has had some" -he was on thin ice- "mixed results."\n\nLópez Mateos saw what was happening, but caved in. He'd actually been looking to complain about it for some time, and it was nice to hear some honesty for once. "You talking about the port, Governor? Yeah, I'm well aware."\n\nMadrazo knew his rivals were behind the trip, but acted oblivious anyhow. "Well, it seems whatever deals went down has gotten the populace a little anxious about foreign involvement. I just want the full picture of what happened, is all-\n\nLópez Mateos cut him off. "Well, Governor, if I were to pin it on one cause..." he looked around, deciding how much to give away. "...It would be poor planning. Too many bad deals that could have been avoided should different plans have been made." Getting the truth about the trip out to someone was a relief.\n\n"I see, Your Excellency, thank you. I'm sure it will all get sorted out in due time." The two smiled, and parted ways in agreement on the issue of foreign policy going forward."

"Those sellouts must have gotten to him." Ordaz and Salinas, he thought, gave away all the country's resources just for an ounce of popularity with the big man.\n\nAs he grounded himself in reality, however, Madrazo thought of López Mateos, and his ability to smooth-talk his way through politics and business like no other. Striking up all those deals without an ounce of opposition, all while bouncing between countries - a real statesman, right there.

MEX_Mateos.123.desc:0 "In the closing hours of his Excellency the President's office, one of Adolfo López Mateos' fleet of assistants and aides had placed a box with two lines of ribbon tied around it during a meeting with some fleeting state official. When the man had left and Mateos had finished reviewing the paperwork said man had given him, he unwrapped the box.\n\nIt was from Eva. The card inside simply said "Dear husband." The object accompanying it was a framed photograph of Mateos from his time as Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare. Mateos gave the photograph a good view: his face was less wrinkly, his hairline a good deal closer to his eyebrows than the back of his head. When he looked into the eyes of this man almost a decade younger than him, he saw ambition, ambition that carried him to the very chair that he sat in right now. He placed the photograph on his desk.\n\nIf he looked back, he was lost. He had known that the moment he raised his arm to swear the oath of office to the United Mexican States on December 1st, 1958. Yet the future evaded him. One more year of the presidency. He was proud of his work. And his countrymen were proud of him too, of the diligence Mateos had shown to them during his tenure. And, if you viewed it in a slightly skewed way, Mateos had saved the world.\n\nYet he still felt unsure, he felt it all slipping away. Why? An invisible, evil presence hid in his thoughts, a presence he wished he could confront and defeat. Mateos feared it, fearing that if he turned to see what he dreaded most, the only thing he would see would be his own eyes, his own face. That would not do.\n\nHe called an aide to bring coffee, and for a political advisor, whichever was closest. There was work to be done, old wounds to be sewn shut. Mexico awaited the breath of fresh air that was promised every six years on December 1st, yet they barely knew the name of the man that would replace his own, what that name represented and how it would change their lives. Mateos the President did not have much time left. He would be damned if, in a year from now, Mateos the man regretted that time being wasted."

The unpaved roads reminded him that despite being in the same nation, the people of Oaxaca lived an entirely different life than the people of Mexico City.\n\nLooking outside the tinted windows, the land and people of Oaxaca were entirely untouched by the Mexican Revolution, they lived in the same squalor as their parents and their parents before them. People carried carts via horsepower or by hand, with mules being more likely to occupy the roads than a car.\n\nDespite the rampant poverty that surrounded him, he thought to himself that it must have been much worse prior to his term. Fewer children were on the streets and more were now in school. With those children now having textbooks of their own rather than needing to share the same ripped books that have been passed down through the years. Some progress was being made. But not enough.\n\nLópez Mateos gripped the car seat, to help cushion him against all the jerking of the car. He made a mental note of what ought to be done to uplift the poor. The people in whose name the Revolution was carried out are now being neglected. Although he had put a dent in the dilapidation of the poorest states, there was more to be done by the end of his term and beyond to finish the job. In the middle of a thought, the car hit another pothole and jounced, forcing López Mateos' head to collide with the roof."

The irregular layout and tight streets of Guanajuato made travel by car a hindrance rather than a convenience, forcing the President to visit on foot. Snatching a bottle of water from an aide, he gulped it all whilst recomposing himself in the shade. Finally ready, López Mateos walked into school to greet the headmaster.\n\nThe headmaster guided López Mateos through the newly renovated school building. The elderly gentleman was anxious, he could handle inspector visits with ease. But accompanying the President was a level of pressure that was unprecedented to him. Desperate to give the best impression he led López Mateos to his star classroom. He opened the door, and every students immediately turned towards them.\n\n"Here, Your Excellency, is one of our most distinguished classes. These students I'm sure are destined for high places thanks to all your support," the headmaster said, beaming with pride.\n\nLópez slowly approached the desk of a student. What caught his eye was the textbook the young boy was reading, "History of the Mexican Revolution". Picking up the book, the President flicked through its pages. Rubbing the crisp clean pages between his fingers. It then occurred to him, this book is completely brand new, not a single torn page or scribble. López Mateos was taken aback, this was nothing like his youth studying in Mexico City.\n\nThe President continued his tour of schools, but no matter where, whether it be Jalisco, Sonora, or Nayarit, it was clear as day that every school has been transformed since the National Commission of Free Textbooks was established. A quiet pride filled López Mateos, that already his policies had altered the lives of the poorest for the better."

In front of Adolfo López Mateos there sat a map of the entire nation, and other more detailed maps of the neglected ruralities and cities of the United Mexican States. The leadership of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad filed in through the door opposite the President.\n\nThere was no preamble; the men knew what they were called in for. Without prompting, they sat down, and López Mateos immediately led with the thesis: "Gentlemen, with respect to electrical infrastructure, I want to make Juscelino Kubitschek seem like an agrarian reactionary when his efforts are compared to ours." As the CFE bigwigs processed his intentions, a steady stream of aides began to come and go, and he drew out lines in red pen across the maps of Mexico.\n\n"You seem to understand your duties, gentlemen. Good. We are going to make this nationalised electrical industry of ours useful. We will build power plants and transmission lines in all directions. We will make sure that the parts of the country that the Yanquis and Canadians didn't care about are at long last covered, as is their right." The officials opposite the President, many of whom he had handpicked or whose selection he had somehow vetted, nodded with gusto and set to work themselves.\n\nThe men left the National Palace, the lines and power plants went up. Yet well before the work took effect, the poor of Mexico observed a new sort of poster in the streets they called home. "Electricity now belongs to the Mexican people! It will be treated as such," the posters blared."

Man, I need the fuckin' money for my family. I can't go fucking around yet again, especially over a speech." Silence fell on the group as they shuffled their way towards the crowd standing before the small ramshackle stage made specially for this occasion.\n\n"Ladies and Gentlemen, your President, Adolfo López Mateos!"\n\nThe leader of the Mexican people, López Mateos, stepped on to the stage. He gave his signature grin to the crowd as they cheered his arrival. Most were enthusiastic, with only a spattering of subdued celebrations such as those of the railway workers. And yet, the energy that exploded at the start of the rally did not dissipate. As López Mateos spoke, talking about bringing prosperity to the Mexican worker through solidarity and economic security, the workers found themselves pulled along with the rest of the crowd as they allowed the President to guide them towards the shining future he envisioned.\n\n"All of us will one day look forward to a future where our wants are seen to, our needs looked after, and our social ills dispelled. And we may only see this future if we all do what is necessary and play our part in carrying out the ideals of the Mexican Revolution."\n\nAs López Mateos continued, the topic on the minds of the railway workers was not the strike that had been broken mere weeks ago.

The Mediterranean is brimming with resentment and envy just waiting to explode. Who knows what other disasters might fall across the world in the coming decades?\n\n"Through the last few decades, Mexico has followed a clear international doctrine: the Estrada Doctrine. Today, I reaffirm our commitment to these ideals. The world is a complex ever-changing landscape, and it is not our right to intervene in other nations' domestic policies simply because we disagree with them. Self-determination is the cornerstone of a peaceful world order, and I will continue to support this policy throughout the Americas and beyond."\n\n"In addition, I will bring these ideals of self-determination and non-intervention with me wherever I go. If other nations follow suit, then one day we may wake up to a world less ravaged by the disease of war." With a nod, Mateos indicated to those gathered that his speech was concluded, and the applause began. As they clapped, Mateos made his way off the stage, joined by Ordaz.\n\n"Planning any more tours abroad that I should know about, Your Excellency?"

Mateos' eyes flicked over to the clock hanging on the wall, and saw the small hand a hair's breadth away from the large ten. If it wasn't exactly right, if even a small part of it didn't work out-\n\n"Your Excellency, Baurraud is here to see you." The voice of his secretary cut through his thoughts and wrenched him back into reality.\n\n"Send him in."\n\nBaurraud entered and, upon seeing Mateos, smiled widely and reached out a hand. "Your Excellency, is there something I can do for you?"\n\nMateos returned the warm handshake, his nerves calming somewhat. "Yes, on a few matters. I would like you to begin work on setting up a meeting of as many Latin American nations as you can get on board."\n\n"That small? What is this meeting for, exactly? Trade talks?"\n\nBaurraud's face fell only slightly.\n\n"Denuclearization," Mateos answered. "This will be my seminal foreign policy achievement, Baurraud. I want to denuclearize Latin America, and I'm going to hold a conference to ensure we can keep this continent safe from that sort of armageddon."\n\nBaurraud did not reply instantly, letting Mateos' words hang in the air for a few moments as he considered the proposal. Finally, he answered, "Well, it's bold. And we'd probably get a few on board. We'd have to wrangle a few others... but it's daring enough to get their attention, at the very least.

He could see the empty table to the right of him, just out of the corner of his eye, where the Argentinean delegation should have been sitting. It had been too late to reorganize the venue by the time they had gotten word, so now the table stood as a memorial to Mateos' failure.\n\n"Something on your mind?" Mateos heard a voice ask, and when he glanced over he saw [BRA.GetLeader], the President of Brazil, standing beside him.\n\n"We all may have agreed to denuclearization, but if this ban doesn't extend into Argentina, I worry about its future. There ought to have been guarantees, but if we had those, then Colombia would have argued with Ecuador and Venezuela about what those sorts of guarantees would be, and then..." Mateos let out a sharp breath as a twinge of pain shot its way through his skull.\n\n"I think you worry too much. You've done a great thing here. We've all agreed on the broad principles of keeping nuclear weapons out of Latin America. Without you, the superpowers would have had free reign to strongarm any of us into allowing Latin America to become the playground of their weapons of mass destruction. I think that's something to celebrate, at the very least."\n\nWas that what he thought the agreement had meant? Mateos's heart slipped into his stomach. This whole thing had been to truly denuclearize the continent. It was not meant to just keep the superpowers out.

"The chief hasn't given the go-ahead." Why he hadn't, Omar couldn't say. He'd overheard the arguments between the chief and local landowners before, usually amounting to the chief talking about 'risks of creating a public disturbance' and local landowners arguing that the protesters were the public disturbance. Usually, the landowners won out. And this time would be no different.\n\nOmar's radio crackled to life, and once he heard the signal, he shouted, "Advance!" All of the officers gathered knew exactly what that meant. Equipped with batons and rifles, they marched forward and met the protestors head on. The two waves crashed into each other, but as always, the officers were stronger. Screams of pain filled the street as some scrambled to get away; the hammer of the law beat them into the pavement.\n\nAs Omar looked over the scene before him, the last of the protesters were either handcuffed or fled. He estimated that they had caught around 80% of them. Those were good numbers to report to the chief. One of his lieutenants approached him, his baton bloodied.\n\n"Are we bringing them all in for questioning, or a selection?"\n\n"We aren't questioning them," Omar replied. "New laws.

As the López Mateos administration trundled on, Alonso found he could apply for a job under the wing of the CTM, the trade-union confederation of Mexico. He had held a certain hope that things would be somewhat better, but the union's worthlessness made clear that that would never be the case.\n\nThere was no other avenue whereby workers could represent themselves to their bossses or the government—a textbook monopoly situation which enabled the CTM to behave just like a corporate monopoly. Conditions never improved, and if they worsened, the union took no responsibility. The union was so enamoured with red tape that it was difficult even to get a piece of CTM-letterhead paper for personal use, let alone to respond properly if things went wrong.\n\nWorse yet were the union bosses, all willing students of the great sell-out Fidel Velázquez at the top of the CTM, who acted essentially like a sort of middle management in overalls. They all drove nice cars without fail: Fords, GMs, even a few Toyotas and Fiats. They also all treated the factory bosses like their sworn brothers, sincerely fawning over them while they did likewise, right where every worker could see them. Charrismo, the tradition started by El Charro, a corrupt trade union leader in the 1940s who all but sold out his workers to the government and adhered to the Army's every dictate, was alive and well.\n\nSo much for the Concha Tu Madre, Alonso thought.

He paused as the applause rang out.\n\n"What have we accomplished in six years? Our nation is more prosperous than ever before. Millions of acres are now owned by the people that till them. Our electrical infrastructure, once controlled by foreign companies, is now in Mexican hands. Children across the nation receive textbooks free of charge. I feel tremendous pride in all these accomplishments, but they are not mine alone. It is thanks to you, the people, that I was able to achieve so much!"\n\nThe cheers began again, this time as a deafening roar. López Mateos braced himself for another migraine, but none came.

One would have expected that this would mean working conditions that respected the needs of the doctors and other medics working there. But the doctors could swear any number of oaths before God and man that that was never the case - and, what is worse, was becoming less and less so the more time passed.\n\nEvening came, then morning, yet no relief followed it. Supplies went missing at the worst possible times - some suture could be needed to save an injured mother's life and it would emerge that the materials had been sold off by some scavenger. Scalpels would be taken away for scrap and the new ones would take two weeks to arrive. Cleaning was sparse, reinforcements infrequent, and rest or vacation only a possibility when the doctors fell down unconscious.\n\nOne might think that there was no way it could get worse. But it did.\n\nHis hands shuddering, the director opened the directive from the Secretariat of Health and Assistance. He stammered out: "Due to economic s-situations beyond the c-control of the Secretariat of Health and Assistance, doctors and other staff at hospitals throughout the Republic cannot receive their r-regular pay bonuses at this time."\n\nThere was silence—"

As loud as Father Hidalgo the doctors' cries of rage sounded throughout the nation - and nowhere were they louder than in the Hospital 20 de Noviembre.\n\nPapers with dictates and threats from the Secretariat of Health and Assistance lay neglected on the table. Meanwhile, the medical professionals resolved to take decisive action of a sort not yet seen in the nation.\n\nA letter was sent to the director: "We, doctors and interns of the Hospital 20 de Noviembre, have determined as follows: that until such time as the payments that are due to us for our service in the cruel circumstances under which we work, we will work only in emergency medicine; we will not deal with regular services at all. We advise the leadership of the Hospital to focus their minds on the interests of their workers, in accordance with the tenets of the Institutional Revolution, and give us our due before the people of Mexico and the world."\n\nThe director, his hands once again shuddering, brought the demand to the hospital board.

Rather than terrorise the medical profession, it martyred the two-hundred and ten fired doctors in the eyes of their profession, and gave other doctors in the country new ideas to see to it that their demands for a workplace they could tolerate would come to fruition.\n\nTwo-hundred and six other doctors and medical interns decided to form a union, in the tradition of shop-floors across a thousand industries, to defend their interests. They consecrated it the Asociación Mexicana de Médicos Residentes e Internos, the Mexican Association of Resident Doctors and Interns, and wrote in the new AMMRI's charter that its intent would be to demand wide-reaching reforms to the state hospitals and the necessary reorganizations to the Secretariat of Health and Assistance to bring that about.\n\nThe response of the medical authorities was swift. Within two hours of the AMMRI's founding, the first two-hundred and six people to sign on were fired from their hospitals. Then there was silence...\n\n...for about fifteen minutes. One way or the other, news of the AMMRI's existence got out and doctors across the country began to follow their lead - and this time, with increasing sympathy from some hospital managements. Mass walkouts on a scale unheard of in Mexican medical history ensued. To its horror, the Mexican people began to learn about just what sort of hell their doctors were being put through.\n\nIt was at this time that the news reached the President at Los Pinos.

The new union of medical interns, formed outside the party's rigid corporatist structures, had nevertheless secured an audience with a representative of the President and the most powerful hospital official in the land. A deniable meeting, in a public place, by a single representative, but an audience nonetheless.\n\nLupita nodded to the duo, their suits worth more than her full wardrobe. The secretary's chin gave a barely perceptible dip in response. And then his mouth opened, "The strikes of your organization represent a clear threat to public order and public health.

Today was to be the greatest day of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz Bolaños's life.\n\n"People of Mexico! You have put your trust and faith in me, and in the institutions of the PRI; I promise you, you will not be disappointed by the results. I will uphold our constitution, as I have just sworn before all of you, a constitution which has served to empower you, the Mexican people, for the last four decades.

We must fight for the values of the Revolution each and every day, and I promise you we shall. Under my leadership, the ship shall be steady. To six more years of calm waters!"\n\nAround him, the crowd... clapped politely. He could see on their faces that they were not caught up in the moment like they were when López Mateos spoke. They were not whipped into a frenzy like when the radicals spoke. No. Most of them were simply calm, watching history be made. His history. The worry wormed its way back from the depths of his mind.

We could fall back upon the sensibilities of tradition and the familiar, or we can take the uncomfortable path and chart a new course in the coming years. That is precisely what we will do. We will unleash the forces of industry to bring Mexico into the future. We will stamp out the creatures of corruption that hold our country back. We will build on the legacies of my predecessors, President López Mateos and President Miguel Alemán. Together, we will build a modern Mexico."\n\nLooking out into the crowd, Salinas was not so pleased with the reception of his inaugural speech. The citizens seemed to have a muted reaction, perhaps not so excited about the 'uncomfortable' path he outlined in his speech. The PRI officials in attendance were displaying fake smiles on their faces, but behind their eyes Salinas could see worry and unease.

The road to get here was hard of course, but Carlos Madrazo was no stranger to working hard. The crowd of thousands and thousands of Mexicans eagerly anticipated to hear from their new president, and Madrazo was not going to let them down.\n\n"People of Mexico!" Madrazo exclaimed. "I am proud to tell you all that the Mexican Revolution continues stronger than ever! Before we go on any longer I must first thank my predecessor, President López Mateos.

I will target the disease of poverty at all of its many sources so that the good people of Mexico may live good lives!"\n\nAs Madrazo finished his speech he could hardly hear his own thoughts over the raucous and exhilarating cheers of the crowd before him. It warmed his heart to know that the common folk of Mexico trusted him to fight for them and their lives, however he also knew the work would be hard. After all, when Madrazo looked towards the PRI officials in the crowd they were not excited at all but rather they were quite worried.

Their spines cast a muted rainbow around Madrazo, who noted that many were written by Reyes Heroles himself.\n\nThe office beyond the hall was just as full of books, and far more full of photographs. A quick glance showed Reyes Heroles laughing with his fellow congressmen, speaking serenely at a rally, signing copies of his opus 'Mexican Liberalism', and playing with his two young sons.\n\nJesús bade Madrazo sit, but the candidate shook his head. "You may have guessed why I have come, Licenciado. To govern well, I will need skilled managers, popular politicians, and those with a deep commitment to reconnecting the PRI to the Mexican people and the values of the Revolution.

"I couldn't think of anyone else as suited for the role as you, Secretary. That reputation of yours precedes you."\n\nEcheverría demurred, feigning modesty, albeit knowing full well countless others had told tales of him; good, bad, yet all united in that the man about to take Ordaz's brief was a rising star, for better or for worse.

But we both love the party loyally, and we want to see it revitalized, put back to its true founding spirit. After all, are we not revolutionaries? Would the martyrs have bled for freedom if they had known their vision would be distorted into some corrupt Alemánismo?"\n\n"Very true, Licenciado. Sickening, always the common man who pays the price! The crowds we've seen today show a real desire for change.

Now that López Mateos had officially chosen him as successor, Ordaz had to resign the post of Secretary of the Interior.\n\nAs he packed up his office and prepared to leave, he reflected on his tenure. He had served López Mateos faithfully, guiding the country through many crises. It was here that his mistakes had nearly cost him the presidency, and through his work here he had won it back. Now he could rest easy, knowing the job would be in good hands.\n\nLuis Echeverría Álvarez entered quietly, a serious expression on his face. The young man who had been Ordaz's Under-Secretary was all business. Echeverría was dependable, always keeping a level head and doing whatever was required of him.\n\n"It is an honor to succeed you in this office." Echeverría said politely.\n\n"The honor is all mine, Luis. You've served me well and I know you'll continue to do so. Make yourself comfortable, I have a feeling the next president will keep you in this role."\n\nAfter Ordaz left the room Echeverría took his seat at the desk.

El Titán, however, quickly got to the point, as the days leading up to the inauguration had his schedule filled. "Del Rosal" -Ordaz cracked a rare, genuine smile- "I am offering you the position of Secretary of National Patrimony in my administration."\n\n"Under my administration, we could return this country to the stability promised by the Revolution and the party, and that is not possible without someone I can trust in charge of our prized energy sovereignty."

The people of Mexico will be well served with you at the helm." Echeverria readjusted his glasses as he spoke. Trying to look a little more in order than his mind was, Ordaz guessed. He could only imagine what sorts of reports the man had been reading only moments ago with rabble rousers and malcontents stirring up trouble left and right.\n\nOrdaz approached the desk as he spoke, "Thank you. It's an honor to serve in such a distinguished position. In the years ahead, I will need good, able men to help steer Mexico towards a prosperous future. In my time working alongside you, I've come to know no other man more qualified to help keep order and peace in our streets. I would like you to stay on as the Secretary of the Interior once I assume my office."\n\nEcheverria smiled. "It would be a privilege to serve in your administration, Your Excellency. You and I agree on quite a lot, especially when it comes to keeping order in our streets. I will continue to serve Mexico's best interests."\n\nThe newly elected President gave Echeverria a small smile. "Then I see no reason to further interrupt your work.

"All according to plan thus far, Emilio, though I believe it is your day that is about to get better, senator." Manautou acted curious to Ordaz's next words, though this day had been in the works for years, and he knew what came next.

His fingers curled against the arm of the chair, holding back a biting remark.\n\nBarragan was a notorious turncoat; there was no other way to put it. He had served with Pancho Villa for a time, before scuttling his way to defect to the Constitutionalists. He helped Álvaro Obregón overthrow the sitting president in 1920, before aligning with the leftist Henriquistas. He had tried to plan a coup in 1953, which went nowhere, and yet somehow the party chose to allow him back into the fold. A self-purported changed man, he was now a staunch opponent of the very men he had served only a decade ago. Untrustworthy, to be sure, but Ordaz could use it to his advantage.\n\nOrdaz sank back into his own chair, turning to stare at the fireplace crackling as the wood was eaten away by the flames.

Apologies mean nothing; results are what I care about.\n\n"Thirdly, if you need to break the law to get things done, do it. But don't tell me, and don't let me find out. Fourth, be careful what you tell me when I ask for reports. I do not need to be pampered with glowing reports. I do not bend to flattery easily. Be concise, be honest, and be competent.

He peered in the cab, looking for anything that might help find this guy. Nothing. He peeled back the tarp covering the bed.\n\nAnd found it full of hundreds of bags of yellow-white opium.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, he was on the phone with the Federal Judicial Police. About two hours later, the PJF were at the truck, snapping photos of the haul and pumping the gas station employees for info. About five hours later, they burst into the bar 'El Dorado' and handcuffed convicted small-time smuggler Ernesto 'El Grillo' Ibáñez.

Or to make the career of an ambitious commander of federal police. All depended on how you looked at it.\n\nThe key to the latter would be getting the prisoner to squeal on the whole damn operation. Put the big fish and all his lieutenants behind bars for years and years. And he had just the men to do it.\n\nRoberto Velázquez sat, back at a ninety degree angle and shoulders squared, focused squarely on his commander's next move.

He had killed before, Cristeros, and his eyes told that he could again.\n\nJosé María's young face, by contrast, was covered with his lunch. He dabbed his face lightly with a napkin, then resumed his attack on the beef. His easy smile and rotund features said he was someone to trust, to confide in. But every jab of the fork moved with absolute precision.\n\nCommander Martínez rested his hand on the door's handle. He was short on time - the governor wanted to break the news on the bust soon. If he didn't have his bigwigs in hand by then, they'd go to ground for sure. And because he needed El Grillo to talk fast, and talk eagerly, he said,"

It's for personal consumption," replied El Grillo, laying a much-injected arm upon the table. His grin revealed sharp, yellowed teeth.\n\n"Then you, personally, are going to rot in the darkest, most putrid hole I can find," said Martinez, flicking the lights off. All went black. A moment passed in silence, then another.

Enough full cells, and we won't have room for a small fry like you." The tiny flame illuminated the outline of the criminal's face, but not his sunken eyes.\n\nEl Grillo laughed.

Politicians? Seeing Roberto and José María's wary stares, Martínez growled, "No luck with him. Anything new here?"\n\nA quick look to their static array of evidence told him probably not. With a grim expression on his grim visage, Roberto replied, "Local police are asking townsfolk if they know anything more, but I wouldn't-."\n\nThe phone's ring cut him off.

If there was a threat to national security, it was found out and then stomped out by the DFS. Their info would be rock solid. Of course, getting bailed out would be a bad look, but far better than failing alone... Martinez replied, "Will need to clear with headquarters."\n\n"Understood. I'll call back tomorrow AM." As Martínez heard the line click, he gauged the others' reactions. José María's face was moving from shock to his trademark smile. Bets the cavalry are on their way, thought Martínez.

Martínez looked at the first friendly smile he'd seen for hours, and asked, "You have something Pérez?"\n\n"Found someone who does, a journalist writes a paper for Ojinaga and a few other towns around here. Simón's a bit of a kook, but he's got a good ear and knows everyone in the area.

He had no idea who this journalist was, but the PJF man was sure he lacked the years of experience, equipment, and sheer talent that would allow them to crack open this mysterious drug smuggling ring.\n\nPérez would listen with growing frustration for a few phrases, then unleash a fierce fusillade in defense of the journalist and local honor. Simón was a good man, he argued, and one who knew every inch of the border region.

In light of recent seizures of opium shipments in Chihuahua, Guzman proposed a campaign of intimidation and bribery to secure smuggling routes across the region. Hayashi agreed, and stated that he would deploy two-to-three additional Kenpeitai personnel to Chihuahua in support. These personnel would be alleged to be working for Japanese manufacturing and mining interests to avoid suspicion.\n\nGiven the presence of multiple foreign intelligence assets and the prospect of regional violence and loss of border control, this case is a matter of national security, and has thus moved fully under the purview of the DFS. Planned next steps are as follows:\n\n1. Monitor ethnic Japanese employees transferred to Chihuahua, identify potential agents and restrict their freedom of action.\n\n2.

To the north of a small town called Ojinaga, it passed a patch of nondescript scrubland marked only by a weatherbeaten Chevy and its lanky owner.\n\nSimón was a hurried man, his gaze flicking frantically between the scrawl of notes and questions covering his notepad and the dirt road to his south. The journalist's mouth alternated between cursing the PJF for not accompanying him here and himself for coming alone. Why was his source so damn late? Why had a gray van traveled back and forth and back again on what should have been an empty road to nowhere?\n\nAs his eyes made another flick, they caught a cloud of dust appearing in the distance. The glare of the sun made it hard to make out the vehicle, but it seemed to be slowing down. Not wanting to take any chances, Simón reached in his pocket for his keys. Nobody knew this area like he did - and if this wasn't his informant, he knew how to make a getaway.\n\nThe crack of a gun and the bullet through his chest ended that plan before it began. His body crumpled against the door of his car before sliding down onto the ground. Gasps would wrack his frame over the coming hours as his life ebbed away alone. The blood seeping from his wound would add a familiar river to Chihuahua's rocky soil."

Now Simón was dead and he was making the right call at last.\n\nThat agent from earlier, Arturo was his name, spoke. "Understood Martínez. Frankly, this case is getting too hot. You and your men need to stand down before anyone else gets killed. We'll move this case to national security, bring the resources needed to crack open this syndicate."\n\nMartínez was a proud man, one not given to turning over cases. But he was also a lawman. And he knew that this case was no longer his to solve. His best lead was filled with lead. Those two corrupt US border guards that had seemed so important, so important that he'd sent Simón to his death, well, they'd just skipped town. He had no way to find them in the vast expanse of El Norte.\n\nIn addition, his working relationship with the local police was shot. Upon learning of his friend's murder, Pérez had launched into a long tirade about the PJF's failures and stalked off. He was either scouring that same useless ground where the journalist had bled out or drinking away his sorrows in one of Ojinaga's bars. Martínez knew for a fact that his subordinates were doing the latter.\n\nThe commander pulled the receiver close to his mouth and paused for a moment. Then the words sprang forth, "Fine.

Roberto's eyes ceased their search for threats, instead boring down the only approach to their patch of scrubland, a short trail leading from the road. Commander Martínez had set down his notepad, he'd reviewed for long enough. Simón no longer paced nervously, perhaps the armed PJF contingent had finally reassured the journalist. Either his informant from the syndicate would show, and blow the case wide open, or all would remain still, and all would slip away.\n\nA third possibility had not occurred to Simón. That a distant gunshot would ring out, a bullet glancing off the hood of his Chevy half a meter to the left. That he would throw himself to the rocky ground but feel no pain, only the frantic desire to be anywhere else, to be swallowed by the earth. That he would haul himself forward with torn and bleeding arms, toward the sole safety his racing mind could find, toward the tire of his car. That Martínez's barked orders would be pierced by the sound of a second shot.\n\nSimón's hand reached the tire's rim a moment later, and with one final heave he hugged himself close to it. Who was firing? More importantly for his immediate survival, from where? A quick assessment of the PJF's shouts and movements suggested that they knew little more than he did.\n\nThe only shot remaining was from Roberto's gun, fired at a movement he swore he saw amongst the rocks at the mouth of the canyon. The PJF trained their weapons on the spot for thirty agonizing minutes, but saw no more. When Pérez arrived as backup at long last, they scoured the area but found no shells, no prints. And as darkness fell, so did any hope of finding their attacker."

MEX_Mateos.182.desc:0 "Mexico City [GetDateText]\n\nFederal Security Director\n\nOJINAGA, CHIHUAHUA - Five days ago, PJF officers Sebastián Martínez, Roberto Velázquez, and José María García attempted to meet with an alleged informant from an opium-smuggling syndicate operating in Chihuahua. The meeting was arranged by a local journalist, Simón López, who claimed to identify a man responsible for coordinating smuggling activity for the drug syndicate. As a result of unwarranted trust in this journalist and negligent fieldcraft, the PJF was lured into a trap by local forces of the Guadalajara Cartel, a Japan-linked trafficking organization.\n\nWhile no serious injuries were incurred, the PJF were unable to apprehend or even identify their attackers. Upon learning of the incident, DFS agents at the Chihuahua station used previous leads to identify them as two hired killers of the Guadalajara Cartel. Locating the two assassins in the town of Aldama outside Chihuahua City, the DFS engaged and killed the duo. In their possession was a Kenpeitai directive ordering them to eliminate threats to control over smuggling routes, as well as a suitcase containing yen.\n\nGiven the confirmation of the involvement of Japanese intelligence, this is a matter of national security and accordingly will be under the exclusive purview of the DFS. Agents of the Chihuahua station will begin clean-up operations immediately, including the seizure of known and suspected Cartel members and assets. Simón López has been detained as a potential collaborator of the Cartel. A thorough audit of the PJF officers involved is also recommended given their inability to prosecute the case."

The previous regionally-based system was maintained, but now some seats in the Chamber of Deputies were to be filled by parties in proportion to the votes they received. Astute readers might realize that two of the three parties to benefit were effectively controlled by the PRI, only existing to engage the far left in quixotic electoral ventures. Others might claim that the PAN, the only true opposition, would be in no position to challenge the PRI even should they receive the maximum of twenty seats provided for under the new rules.\n\nBut why listen to those shrill voices when millions of Mexicans go about their day, content that big block letters proclaim their democracy is fair and just?"

Within its depths and along its surface, the pieces of towns and villages floated by in bizarre peace: logs, paintings, bodies, and even whole homes ripped from their foundations. Grey clouds rolled in the sky, with a trickling rain reminding those under them that the flood was just the beginning.\n\nA few people looked out of windows barely perched above the water, desperately, fruitlessly holding back the tide. A few lay on the mountainside with nothing to their name but soaked clothes and the assurance of loss. Alongside the great stream were husks of buildings, many of their occupants long ago having fled, whether into the jungles or mountains or simply higher areas within the decimated village. The church atop the hill hung over the town as the only building unaltered. The villagers thanked God and the Virgin for that.\n\nBeyond that village, across mountains and forests, the great stream continued, expanded and thinned, and grew again. Many boats traveled along it, some intended vessels, others simply pieces of wood stitched together by the desperate. They occasionally floated by other destroyed towns and were joined by new refugees. Some headed east towards the foothills, with their drivers declaring they had connections in Mexico City. Others to the swamped Villahermosa, or other cities to beg amidst the ruins, beseeching long-departed politicians for succor.\n\nThe southeast is sinking, and Mexico City must raise it, lest other things besides water begin to saturate the heads of the region's people...

Shoddy wiring in a hastily-built control tower in San Luis Potosí had seen multiple flights circling for an hour before diverting to other airports - one had to make an emergency landing in a field for lack of fuel. Two small planes had collided in Tuxtla, killing all aboard.\n\nBut nothing had sunk in quite like the news that a jetliner, landing on an undersized, out-of-date runway in Guadalajara, had simply continued on into the terminal. Multiple gates were damaged, and many injured. The airport, the very one she would have flown from and returned to, had been a death trap!\n\nThey had shut it down, of course.

"Following our victory in the election, which has secured us another supermajority, the CCI's momentum is beginning to crash. There have been reports of infighting in the MLN, particularly those that were upset at the way that the CCI handled this election. Many are blaming General Cárdenas' leadership for the loss."\n\n"So you would conclude that they pose no more threat to us?" Mateos asked.\n\n"I would not be so bold as to declare that, Your Excellency. Rather than simply watching and hoping they fall apart, I would suggest a more active approach."\n\nMateos leaned back. "A more active approach?"\n\n"Splinters are poised to form, but splinters can reform into a new threat. Now is the time to act. With the DFS, we should arrest key members. In the press, we'll say the operation is being carried out to secure Mexico from the influence of radicals on the left. We'll tell them Bolsheviks have infiltrated the MLN."\n\n"In other words, we crush them while they're divided and weak, and we label it a security measure." Mateos nodded along as he spoke. "Clean and efficient. I like it. Give out the orders.""

"When are they going to announce their withdrawal?"\n\n"Tomorrow morning, they said," one of his secretaries, Tomás, replied. "It'll be circulated to all the major news outlets."\n\nCárdenas had to consciously close his mouth, but instead of having his jaw hanging open in shock, now his teeth were clenched tight as he grinded them together. Yet he could never keep that sort of fire burning for long. He sighed, and let himself fall back into his chair.\n\n"Would you like me to get you something to drink, General?"\n\nHe shook his head, glancing up at his secretary. "I'm fine, Tomás. Thank you."\n\nYet he didn't feel fine. Another party had withdrawn from the movement. That made it... what, three in one week? At this rate, there wouldn't be a party or a movement come December. With Ordaz poised to be the next president, the PRI would continue to chug along, unchallenged. That stagnant monstrosity which he had helped birth would further enrich itself off the backs of the Mexican people.\n\n"Tomás, did we accomplish anything at all?"\n\nHis secretary wasted no time in replying. "General, if you don't mind me saying, what matters is that we try. Because if you give up, then the Mexican people will too."\n\nThat was something to hold on to, at least. Cárdenas slowly nodded. The fight was not over. Not until the last of them had given up on a better future. While sorrow still gripped his heart, Cárdenas gave a smile."

There's no more discussion to be had; we're withdrawing from the movement." The line clicked dead. Cárdenas slowly lowered the phone before dropping it down onto the desk.\n\nOne of his secretaries, Tomás, must have overheard, as he edged his way into the office. "General, is there anything you need?"\n\n"Anything I need? For starters, I would have liked the PRI to have actually given a damn about the Mexican people. I would have liked them to have resisted that bastard Miguel Alemán's and his henchmen before they got their corrupt hands all over the party and twisted it to their own ends. I would have liked them to have been resisted by someone, anyone, who would have stopped them from transforming the party into a technocratic monstrosity."\n\n"With Salinas in charge, this country is going to become nothing more than a wasteland of capitalist exploitation. The Mexican people will be ground into the dirt and squeezed for all their worth while a new class of millionaires lounges in their manors and feasts on the corpse of Mexican prosperity!" By the end, Cárdenas was shouting as his secretary meekly listened.\n\n"What's the next step then, General?" Tomás finally asked, his voice wavering.\n\n"I do what I've always done.

Before Cárdenas could muster a reply, the line went dead. He held the phone against his cheek for a few moments, lost as to what to do next. Out in the street, some car honked its horn, rousing him from his stupor enough to put the phone down. He made his way over to the window and pushed aside the shades. Down below, cars were packed together as they waited impatiently for the light a few dozen meters ahead of them to turn green. And at this benign sight, Cárdenas felt himself calm.\n\nEven as the PRI continued to extend their reach into every facet of Mexican society, life went on. He wondered if those men and women driving their cars below had voted, and if they had, who they had voted for. More likely than not, they had voted for the PRI. And in doing so, had elected Madrazo as the man to lead the Mexican people through the rest of the decade.\n\nHe knew that Madrazo was a firm believer in his manifesto for the party, especially given his track record as Governor of Tabasco. Perhaps, even in the failure of the MLN, his legacy might still have some purpose left to play in Mexican politics. Cárdenas reached over to his desk and hit the button which summoned his secretary.\n\n"Yes, General?"

That had been the plan anyway.\n\nCárdenas himself decided to shadow the conference with a massive rally, setting it on the same date and time. This caused some confusion within the conference room.\n\nOver the din of shouting leftists, Carlos Madrazo brought his fist down on the oaken table. Rather than silencing the crowd, the pounding encouraged others to bicker louder. The only word that managed to pierce the escalating cacophony was a shouted "Tamaulipas!"\n\nMadrazo drew himself up, summoning the authority he had learned to muster in the rough-and-tumble thirties. "Is this what General Cárdenas would want?" he boomed, but the chaos surrounding him did not subside.\n\nA finger jabbed Madrazo's chest as the party member to his left began a mostly inaudible rant about the CTM.

We should be stressing the provision of cheap corn and grains so that every Mexican can have a full belly. Not to mention the need for deep reforms to the CNC itself..."\n\n"You understand the youth, and the youth understand you, Madrazo. I don't know how you do it, to be frank. Most prefer listening to that gringo rock and roll racket to hearing what we fought for in the Revolution. How come they listen to you?"\n\n"You spoke well of the e-ejidos, but the real issue is that we're not enforcing A-Article 123.

Madrazo had established himself as a successful governor, a regional leader, and a man of the left. But the latter was still too fragmented and fractious to influence López Mateos's decision on who was to succeed him.\n\nAnd so Madrazo would roar on, as the Revolution had.

But could he be the President Mexico needed?\n\nLópez Mateos sighed. In 1958, he would have chosen Ordaz to succeed him in a heartbeat. 1959 too. Every month of every year until that damn standoff in the Northern Pacific. Had Ordaz always been so foolish, so bull-headed and in hock to the US? Or had something broke in his old ally's mind?

He said to reassure himself.\n\nMateos felt at ease, with a heavy burden on his shoulders finally being lifted these past few days. No longer President his home quieted down, he could take life at his own pace. He hoped this meant fewer migraines.

It had all led up to this: the endless deal-brokering, diplomatic speak, and countless hours of jet-lag would all have been for nothing if his country did not receive the Olympic nomination this night.\n\nAs he walked down the halls of the Swiss hotel with his team donning the finest attire Mexico could offer, he eyed the bar on the way out in the lobby. "If things don't go the way we want tonight" -he points at the bottles of booze, turning to his aide- "I know where I'll be going."

You all have made it worth all the effort it took, and I thank you." A series of applause followed his statement, and Mateos was sure to give a pause to allow them to finish—and to give the press ample time to see it.\n\nBut he had other matters he had to attend to, and he gestured for Madrazo to step forward. The celebratory atmosphere of the reception calmed as they noticed the move, and Mateos kept his face as neutral as he could to hide the fear inching its way through him that he might be making the wrong move.

The only problem facing would be Salas's persistent clashes with Ortiz Mena...\n\n"Great. I'll leave you a list of matters you need to address and plan out while I'm campaigning in the election. Principally, an update to the Secretariat's work on optimal locations for industrial investments and the infrastructure we need to support them," Salinas instructed.\n\nThe Secretary of Hacienda and Public Credit chimed in, "I'll also assist you with your planning. If you need any additional help or advice, I'll make sure that everything continues business as usual."\n\nSalas shot Ortiz Mena a look of distrust, then turned back to Salinas, "This area of interest is my specialty. I should be able to start without any handholding." Ortiz Mena, who hadn't meant any offense, promptly spluttered, "Well certainly, but we'd need to catch you up on Raúl's exis-"\n\n"Please, gentlemen.

"The pleasure is all mine. I've been following your academic career for some time, and I was very impressed by your work as Assistant Secretary of Industry and Commerce."\n\nReleasing his grip, Salinas got right to the point. "I also know you to be an honest man, so I'd like to ask you a question: what are your thoughts on Mexico's relationship with the United States?"\n\nMargáin responded without hesitation. "The Americans have had our economy in a stranglehold since the days of the Porfiriato. We need to maintain our close friendship and economic ties with them, of course. Only a fool would try to break from them completely. But we should be trying to reduce our dependence on them as much as possible."\n\n"I couldn't agree more," Salinas said with a sly grin, "Nuance like that is exactly what I'm looking for in a Secretary of External Relations."\n\nMargáin's eyes widened.

At least, that is what Salinas kept telling himself as he stifled a yawn while del Rosal flipped the page to the next sheet of the itinerary.\n\nJust as del Rosal's finger traced over the top of the page, he said, "I was wondering, Licenciado, what my role might be in the coming administration?" Even as his finger went over each item on the page, his eyes glanced over to Salinas as he waited for an answer.\n\nSalinas' eyes still moved over the page as if he were reading, but instead he considered the question. He had hoped to have more time to consider a proper place for him, but now asked, he would have to propose something. So, he made his decision. "The Secretariat of National Defense," Salinas replied. "The military is in desperate need of modernization and professionalization, and I believe you are the man to do that. They must unequivocally be brought in line with the broader government."\n\nThere was a pause before del Rosal gave his reply. "Licenciado, I would agree in light of the recent embarrassments with Guatemala, but I feel I must warn you that the military will not take interference from a civilian such as yourself lying down. There will be discontent and pushback should you overstep."\n\nSalinas waved his hand in dismissal. "That is why you are there; you are trusted by the military, a general with combat experience and numerous commendations to ensure that all is run smoothly.

I'll admit it was tempting, but I think I should refuse. The way he schemed against you was just awful. I don't know if I can serve a man like that."\n\nA part of Ordaz wanted to agree and tell his friend to decline, but he knew there was too much at stake. Swallowing his pride, he replied: "Take the job."\n\n"What? Gustavo, are you serious?"\n\n"Completely. Salinas' clique isn't strong enough to lead alone, and in a divided government you can be a voice of moderation. We need to preserve stability wherever we can. That way we'll have less damage to undo when his sexenio comes to an end."\n\nManautou let out a deep breath. "I agree that Salinas should be restrained.

Collectively they had perhaps a quarter of the initiative of a single member of his team at Industry and Commerce. But he had heard of a man here who was different - who brought together the professionalism, boldness, and expertise Salinas was looking for.

Composed of thousands of doctors, including former hospital directors, AMM has declared a strike in solidarity with the illegal AMMRI union of medical students and interns.\n\nAMMRI has announced it will be joining the AMM. In my evaluation, while the interns are generally eager to collaborate with the doctors, their leadership appears wary of losing autonomy. Both organizations demand the rehiring of fired doctors and interns, increased pay, and have provided a list of hospital-specific demands - see attached.\n\nDFS personnel will continue to coordinate with CNOP medical bodies to identify and publicize AMM and AMMRI members. Various CTM unions, though not medical in nature, have also offered to support the resolution of this labor dispute through public and private pressure.\n\nNevertheless, the sudden loss of AMM's experienced medical personnel has greatly exacerbated the strain caused by AMMRI's strike. Both IMSS and ISSSTE hospitals are reporting extensive waitlists for all non-urgent treatments as well as an inability to perform discrete items of urgent care. The situation is expected to deteriorate further as backlogs build in the coming days.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nCaptain Luis de la Barreda Moreno"

They only had so much money to spend, and the American and Mexican companies were fighting bitterly over the spoils in hopes of coming out on top. And Ordaz and Madrazo had made clear in their insinuations with the business leaders as to whom they preferred.\n\nThe car at last pulled up along the driveway, and the two of them stepped out into the hot Mexican sun just as Mateos stepped out to greet them.\n\n"Welcome, Gentlemen.

As they did, Mateos continued, "They understand that we will be investing in the manufacturing sector in particular, correct?"\n\n"Your Excellency," Madrazo replied as Ordaz pursed his lips, "they understood, yes, but the American business leaders made clear that they wished for more investment than the Mexican business leaders, and the same was true for Mexican companies. If we were to do as the Americans want, then it would make us look like we are selling our country out for easy money."\n\n"And if we did as the Mexican business leaders want," Ordaz added, "we would be ignoring valuable investment which could reinvigorate our economy.

At last, it was Madrazo who broke through the silence.\n\n"Your Excellency," Madrazo began, "you've seen how I've handled my state as Governor. We started as one of the poorest regions of Mexico, just the same as many of our neighbors in the south, and ended up becoming one of the most prosperous. This did not happen naturally; we had to make it happen, and we did so through vigorous reforms.\n\n"We expanded social services and amenities, making grocery stores more available, modernizing our infrastructure, our hospitals, and our schools. We propelled the state into the modern decade and beyond, and I believe we can do this with Mexico at large. With the effects of Kabuki ravaging our industries, what we need is to take this model and apply it so that it may benefit all of Mexico."\n\nMateos stroked his chin, thinking hard. He could accept this proposal at face value. There needed to be changes made to prevent this sort of disaster from happening again. Yet the Old Guard would not accept these drastic changes without certain addendums, and Madrazo would be none too happy about having these addendums to his proposals. But his grand vision that he had, even if it was in part implemented, might be just what Mexico needed at this time.\n\n"I understand what you mean, Licenciado Madrazo.

"Your call mentioned discussing options for solving some of the worst effects of the Kabuki, is this correct?""\n\n"That is the general idea, Secretary. I am open to your opinions as always, if you are open to sharing them," Mateos answered.\n\n"As is your prerogative, Your Excellency. My opinion is that we should focus on keeping our party together at any costs, as it is the primary arm of caring for the interests of all of Mexico's people. We must get the people, and the party at large, to understand that if we fail in solving this crisis, then we all fail together. If any part of our structure begins to collapse, everything will come tumbling down."\n\n"That is all well and good, but we must make some concrete decisions to improve our situation. We cannot just wait it out."\n\n"And I am not suggesting words, Your Excellency," Ordaz curtly answered. "What I am suggesting is order. Our people demand stability, and that is what I am pushing for: stability in politics, as a rock for the troubles of the economy."\n\nMateos considered his words.

MEX_Mateos.239.desc:0 "López Mateos' lips met with the glass, indulging in the liquid fervor of victory; Mexican wine. But he was unable to swallow. Every second that stagnant puddle of wine remained in his mouth, introduced to it a rising sense of guilt. It became impossible to swallow, for López Mateos' throat had become swollen from mere thoughts.\n\nHe shook his head and slowly spit the wine out at a nearby sink. His eyes were drawn to the puddle of wine; a red splatter like blood. My presidency, López Mateos thought, was made up of massacred blood spat out. He could see their reflections in the wine - hundreds of innocents slain or wounded in the pursuit of 'peace' and 'prosperity'. He could see the vague bodies of all of the workers who had been crushed alongside the railway strikes. Another reflected faces was that of Ruben Jaramillo, a revolutionary that López Mateos sent his thugs after to execute.\n\nLópez Mateos was just like him. A revolutionary brigand, together with his late comrade Germán del Campo. The President back then, a part of the predecessor of the PRI... had sent federal agents after him and his comrade, who happened to support José Vasconcelos' candidacy. Germán was slain, just like Jaramillo, but López Mateos survived.\n\nLópez Mateos lowered himself over the sink, and prayed, in silence. I never wanted this, and neither would he have. Maybe, nobody has."

MEX_Mateos.240.desc:0 "Carrying a corpse, no matter how decorated it is on the outside, brings with it fleeting memories of a shattered pastime. Isidro Fabela was such a prolific man, able to accomplish so much in history, while López Mateos merely observed from the sidelines. But now here he is, carrying Fabela's coffin on his shoulders, with still so many questions left unanswered.\n\nDo I owe my career to this man? Of course I do, Mateos thinks. Fabela was his mentor, a shining brilliance which gave Mateos his first glance in Mexican politics. The legal avenue of politics, that is. With vigor, Fabela had earned himself various international and domestic political positions, once denouncing the moves of Germany. He left a legacy with a silent impact; his influences seen in many places, but perhaps no other person could idolize him like López Mateos did.\n\nEach step forward, echoed by funeral music, pierces into López Mateos' thoughts. He would like to think optimistically; could he surpass his mentor? Or perhaps, does the death of Isidro Fabela bring a colder meaning, with all of Mateos' dreams silently passing away? Indeed, it seems like the latter. The world gets emptier and colder with each old friend and comrade that falls, no matter how many new souls enter the political landscape.\n\nIsidro Fabela is lowered into his grave, and López Mateos thinks again, no longer respecting his fallen comrade, but selfishly. The world has surely grown cold. The number of 'allies' seems to dwindle and dwindle. Who is it, among his current friends, that would respect López Mateos so dearly as to carry his coffin?"

His Excellency, the President López Mateos, has just presented to the press an outline of all the goals he aims to achieve over the next three years of his government. His government will focus on steady and consistent growth across the whole of the economy, with particular focus on industrial growth and regions which offer new opportunities for the nation as a whole to share in our connections to the world."\n\n"He promises continued support of key social services which will further enhance the safety and security of the nation.

Additional new hospitals will be built in Mexico's rural areas, coupled with further reforms to childcare to help the mothers of our next generation."\n\n"Illiteracy has dropped markedly since the inauguration of His Excellency, and His Excellency vows to continue the fight to increase the mental fortitude of our youth with government-issued textbooks to transform the way that our children learn. This policy, coupled with land reform, will help lift hundreds of thousands out of poverty and energize our nation to new heights, as promised by His Excellency.

Ordaz was always a reliable right hand, and Mateos still needed his help.\n\n"Now," Mateos continued, "on to business..."\n\nOrdaz stood up, ready to present first as he always did.\n\n"...Secretary Mena, would you lead us off?"\n\nFor a moment Ordaz froze, surprise evident on his face, before ignominiously sitting back down. Ortiz Mena struggled not to laugh as he began his report on the economy. After he finished, the President asked another secretary to report, and then another, pointedly skipping Ordaz. A few looked towards Ordaz sympathetically as they stood, meanwhile Salinas reveled in his humiliation.\n\nAfter every other cabinet secretary had presented, Ordaz rose to give his report on internal security.

He had sped up and down the country, shaking hands in public and knuckling down the governors in private - his demands? No factionalism, no trouble, more taxes, more support. Most of them knew better, were receptive, acted agreeable, and so on, but that bastard, Leopoldo Sánchez Celis, was particularly greasy. He had vacillated, pretended not to know what he was talking about, even gave him those stupid looks. Fucking odious! Did he not know who he was? He was the goddamn President-\n\nCarlos A. Madrazo, Governor of Tabasco, swung through the door. "Forgive me, Your Excellency, is it a bad time?"\n\nLópez Mateos noticed that he had been deeply frowning. He looked at his reflection through the double-glazing and saw a cantankerous fool stare back. This was not like him. "No, no. Please, Licenciado. Grab a seat."\n\nMadrazo blew into a seat, and glared at the President's cigar, lazily clutched between his fingers; he frowned, subtly. "Are you satisfied with the tour?"\n\n"I did what I had to do. It's just not pleasant, is it?" López Mateos put it out. "The issue of the succession... People use it as an opportunity for their own ends."\n\n"You have my full support, Your Excellency. You know very well I have always been in your camp," Madrazo nodded, "if there's anything I can do, just say the word. I know what those fools from the old guard are like." He was right, after all.

"Governor, they complain that I do not pay them enough. I've heard tales that they are planning to stage some sort of revolt!" The land Don Calzada owned was officially ejidal, but was, in fact, a large-scale private farm that he controlled right from his compound. A consequence of the reforms of Miguel Alemán, whom Olivares had helped elect. He had spent many a night campaigning for Alemán in the beautiful state of Aguascalientes, after all.\n\n"Well, tell you what. I'll make use of some of the local police and we can try to sort this situation out. However..."\n\nThe Don seemed to deflate. "Please. Governor. I do not have any money."\n\nOlivares drank from his pinot noir and put on a snide laugh. "So you will not compensate them for their services? You're a smart man, don't give me that. Telephone my secretary in the morning and bring your chequebook."\n\nThe feeble vineyard owner was an easy racket; he had spiraled himself into such a debt that Olivares could ask anything of him. And who could he complain to? The Governor had built the roads, the schools, and the hospitals. He was the favourite son of Aguascalientes, and his word was law - at least unless the President said otherwise. As part of López Mateos' tour, Governor Olivares had promised his undying loyalty, but more importantly his money.

López Mateos had laid out his plans for the final two years of his term. Expansion of social programs, school construction to complement those textbooks, and a vast infrastructure splurge with the port at Melchor Ocampo as its centerpiece. All bold. All costly. And even more so if he wanted to build everything by 1968. Why '68?\n\nFinding the pesos to put behind Presidential plans was Mena's job.

And the day before that. It wasn't just that the article was in violation of the new press regulations in the state. No, what really made the article unprintable was the lack of paper. Last week, after a series of inflammatory pieces on the new regime in the state, the PRI stopped approving sales of paper to the printing house. Most of the workers had been sent home then. There were still journalists drafting articles and editors like Mateo to review them, but otherwise they were running a skeleton crew. The boss wasn't sure when they'd be back in operation and until then they had to cut costs.\n\nSomewhere outside his office, a phone rang. Mateo stepped out into the silent space and made his way between the rows of empty desks towards the sound. He had been pulling double duty as the boss's secretary the past few days. Not that there were many phone calls to take anymore. He lifted the handset to his mouth, and spoke. "This is the Diario del Guerrero. How can I help you?"\n\n"Hello."

Now, nearly a decade on, and things only seemed to have gotten worse. The government was dismissed for a second time, and soldiers manned checkpoints at every street corner. Not that it had done much to dissuade the group from organizing.\n\nEven after the marches last December, it was a simple matter to get people into the streets. It seemed like everyone knew someone who was harassed or beaten by soldiers for the crime of going about their day. And so they marched, and they waved signs, and they yelled. All the while packs of soldiers brandished rifles and watched them pass by. Occasionally other men would join them. Men with plain clothes and hateful eyes who tucked handguns into their waistbands and cursed and spat on the demonstrators. Anything to give them a reason to start shooting.\n\nCarlos had just passed by a group of the agitators when one of them picked up a rock off the street and threw it into the crowd.

She'd been so happy with her allotment that she'd enclosed a copy of the transfer slip with López Mateos' signature on it.

The diplomat, besieged by Tokyo's hostile questions and demands for the last 48 hours, gave the barest minimum of pleasantries before leaning back, weary eyes on the northerner.

The scant reception to greet him had glares that needed no translation. At the Mexican embassy, a frantic message from Secretary of External Relations Baurraud laid out Ordaz's borderline treasonous declaration to "justly and expediently resolve this crisis" and the barrage of bile unleashed by Tokyo in response. Baurraud and Secretary Salinas Lozano had managed to keep the Sphere in the talks, but only just, by calling in every favor of their respective networks.\n\nAnd so Mateos had arrived in this room, in this suit, for 28 hours of hell. The Americans' initial smugness was replaced with fury when he revealed that he could not, and would not, enforce Ordaz's terms on the Japanese. The ferocious accusations of Mexican duplicity only quieted with news of another near-miss off Kiska.\n\nFear became Mateos' thread as he weaved together a new agreement from these shambles. The release of Captain Asoh, a detailed plan for fleet withdrawals, and no Japanese apology for the spy plane overflight. Ordaz had ripped away any chance of an investigation into if and why the Americans had violated the demilitarization of the Aleutians, with Mateos only able to secure the thin compensation of a covert spy exchange favoring Japan in return.

Panting and dehydrated, he pondered if it was worth it. The money was good, but was it that good? He had come all this way, hundreds of miles and days... What was he thinking? Was his family – his newborn daughter – destined to be stuck in the cycle of poverty just as he had been for twenty years? Hell no.\n\nPressing forward into the mass of humanity lying in front of him, he focused in. He slithered sideways, finding crevices and holes in the almost liquid crowd.

Calcutta and Delhi were constantly at loggerheads, and he did not relish the constant soothing of egos, honeyed words, false pretences and tough negotiation of diplomacy.\n\nWhat troubled Paz more about Madrazo's offer was his own constant belief, espoused so often in writing, that intellectuals such as himself should distance themselves from politics. Keeping an objective perspective was important. But he could not sit by and endlessly critique power when he had the opportunity to use it to create the freer, fairer Mexico that had only existed in his fleeting dreams.\n\nHe picked up the telephone."

His cohort may not have been what he was expecting, but that didn't change what he needed to do.

Limousines deposited their illustrious passengers near the base of the Pyramid of the Sun before flicking off their headlights. Elderly feet ascended stone stairs in pairs.\n\nAt the platform where they halted, the first god unveiled himself with a click of removed sunglasses and a complaint about theatrics. Secretary of National Defense del Rosal. Momentarily he was joined by Regent Ordaz, who answered that this was a rare locale where DFS bugs were absent, followed by a coughing Secretary General Fidel Velázquez. Two progeny of that fallen god, Echeverría, summited after them: CNC head Augusto Gómez Villanueva and his new deputy Moya Palencia completed this circle of black suits.\n\nWhen Velázquez regained his breath, he pronounced, "The viper Salinas will only dig his fangs deeper if we let him. So we won't. He is to be ousted and replaced at the first opportunity." The circle nodded as one, so Velázquez continued, "We need to offer a clear alternative. I put myself forward to challenge him for the Presidency."\n\nHesitation rippled outward, and Villanueva outright shook his head. "Who can lead the CTM against that bastard if you're spending every moment chasing down governors and senators? Chumacero is wrecked now if he ever could have. Besides..." he tilted his head in the direction of those accursed steps.\n\nVelázquez scowled at the insolence, before adopting a wolfish grin, "You're right. I've served this party long enough to have made enemies. A fresh face like yours, Licenciado, would unite Salinas' many foes under one banner. Ours.""

Antonio Mena, eyes once more transfixed by the crystalline chandelier's quiet rotation, merely nodded.\n\nBetween chandelier's ethereal rays stretched a vast array of shadows, shifting and morphing... yes, Miguel would offer excellent advice. He had laid the foundation for Mexico's economic miracle, truly established relations with the Japanese, fended off the henriquistas, in the worst split the PRI had experienced... until now.\n\nBut he likewise was associated with the worst of the party's corruption. The corruption they had been fighting against, the shade descending down Salinas' oaken chair, threatening to swallow him up. To end-\n\n"Antonio, I see you're drifting off. No need to stay up further, that position was my only request. His Excellency and I will finish off this cabernet and then I'll likely retire myself," said Alemán, gently ushering Mena from his armchair. The financier murmured a quiet apology and stumbled out into the hallway.\n\nIn this darkness there were no chandelier lights, only Mena's head was spinning. He leaned against the penthouse door to steady himself. And through it leaked Alemán's forceful words, "-the conclusion, Raúl, that to secure the party and Mexico's future, additional finance is needed.

Calculated risk. But now Salinas had reached so high that he would not survive a fall. He lit up a cigar, and proffered two to his companions on the penthouse balcony. Wordlessly, Reyes Heroles accepted and Gutiérrez Barrios declined. A welcome silence after hours of discussing strategy.\n\nSalinas turned back to the sea - among the specks swimming in the surf, he could barely make out his sons Raúl and Carlos. If he lost... they would fall too. The Old Guard would break them as he had Echeverría or Chumacero. Harder perhaps, if only to torture their father.\n\nThe smoke left his lips to vanish in the blue sky above. That would be the fate of his project, his dream for Mexico in the conservatives' hands. Or would they capture it, twist it as they had Cárdenas' model? Paint their caricatures of his Revolution to stamp out the dreams of tomorrow's ambitious young men?\n\nSalinas stood, face a mask of calm, and pronounced that they had work to do.

We may, accordingly, expect no significant obstruction to the promulgation of the decree.\n\nWhen the decree will have taken its full effect, the National Revolutionary Militia will be a quasi-paramilitary organization. It will be permitted only a limited amount of weaponry but it will have intensive training in ideological indoctrination and unarmed as well as armed combat. Only the most devoted members of the party, loyal to Mexico and the Revolution, should be permitted any level of advancement in this nascent institution.\n\nThe National Revolutionary Militia will be answerable primarily to two deputies operating on behalf of the President, namely Licenciados Cárdenas and Echeverría. These two leaders will see to it that the Revolutionary Militia lives up to the expectations that President Madrazo has of it."

It was the mistake of Praxedes Giner Duran, formerly Governor, formerly General, now defendant, to think this era of backbiting and betrayal ended thirty years ago. Then, another General turned governor faced off against Mexico City, and got hit with the lash. Perhaps it was the ultimate irony that this story was taking place again - but his shootout with the federales would be denied, to take place instead in a courtroom in Chihuahua.\n\nThe charges? Murder, corruption, unlawful detention, criminal negligence - why not littering and speeding too? The crime? Failing to meet expectations. The expectations to have a safe and orderly state. The expectations to give into the complaints of squatters and anger the men that got the party where it was. To serve both his constituents and the angry demands from on high, by the sureño who probably never saw a ranch in his life. The sentence - and it would be a sentence, that's how things worked - would be an end to his political career and enough of a jail term to dissuade anyone from standing up to the President.\n\nBut as Giner Duran heard the commotion from the audience, he smiled. That wasn't quite true.\n\nSánchez Celis was in the audience. This was unexpected. And Luis Encinas Johnson, the Governor of Sonora! And entering right now - Governor of Durango Enrique Dupré Ashtrays? And there were more faces in the audience, ones he had seen before, ones he knew were with governors across the nation, or up north like him.\n\nThrough the television screen, Fidel Velázquez and many, many others made the same connections that Duran was making. They weren't here to see a man get what he deserved. They were there because that man could well be them. Because that man was all of them.\n\nBecause it really was the old days.

No, any bourgeoisie or even a reactionary can march in the name of progress if circumstances need them to. A man is not a revolutionary when he says things could be better. No, a man is a revolutionary when he advances the cause of liberation by taking action when he is marching with his comrades and confronts the forces of reaction head-on. None knew this better than the youth of the National Revolutionary Militia. The newly formed paramilitary organization was led by the bold and passionate. As tensions continued to rise across Mexico, they were determined to seek out and carve them out so that the Revolution could flourish.\n\nTonight, their hunt was more precise than usual now that they had received a tip on their target. He was an organizer for the Synarchists, religious fascists by any other name, and they pursued him with fists, jeers, and clubs until he fled into a small church to evade them. Any hesitation from the militiamen was quelled by their leader urging them onwards.\n\nInside, they found a man, shaking but defiant and silent. When they surrounded him, demanding to know about his friends in the UNS, he didn't make a sound. When they took turns hitting him in the chest and limbs, he only grit his teeth. When their leader screamed into his face for answers, his only response was to spit into his tormentor's face. For a moment, there was silence before the militia leader's face split in fury, and he reached into his pocket. Two gunshots echoed into the night, with only the painted faces of Christ and his Saints bearing witness. The roar of the bullets would pale compared to the furor their crime would unleash."

He floats along the current, metaphorically, as he listens to the radio speaking of the Duran trial and the hunt of the remaining rightwing and GPG guerrillas.\n\nWhat will the river ahead look like? Sure, Madrazo rose up to the challenges, was entrusted with the nation at large in the President's seat, and yet... The feint of a burning sensation spread on his knee before dissipating, each time he had risen up in the world, it had pushed him back down. He had risen up, has the hand already started to push him down, starting with this?\n\nWill it, this time, leave all of Mexico asunder? Push both him and the nation in the depths of despair, with no wave to bring them back up? Is that what the river has destined him to be; the President who doomed tens of millions to suffering? 'No, it would never be this cruel,' was the last thought Madrazo had before the whispers of fate translated through the radio.\n\nA murder. A murder of a synarchist in a church, the reports of Church backlash being told to him by the speaker. It's tormenting him. Just like 20 years ago, it reminds him of memories another 20 something years before the cell, before the- No. He was the President of the United Mexican States, Madrazo would not let the past paralyze him, he would not let 'fate' paralyze him.\n\nThe true Revolution would always be something that needs to be fought for. Madrazo would fight for the Revolution. He would fight, and he felt the burning red inside of him shift into dark blue as he repeated those words, he would fight, if it meant holding the weight of Mexico on his back thousands of years after his death it would be all worth it."

"Speed City," they called it.\n\nThere was certainly a bit of debate of who the fastest here was, but that honor was officially claimed by Tommie Smith, the World Record holder in the Men's 200 Meters. John Carlos, who sat nearby, had run it faster once, but was disqualified because of his shoes. And Lee Evans also had a rivalry with the two. But the man in the black beret who sat with them was never a sprinter, having focused instead on discus throwing and basketball before coming back to his old university as a teacher. And he had a message for all of them.\n\n"But what's going on here is going on at all the so-called integrated schools," said Harry Edwards.

Once more under the banner of a nation not her own, but the closest thing which existed to a free Czech nation. Whatever concerns Slovak authorities may have had concerning her nationality or relationship with the Germans were overshadowed by the three gold medals and the silver she had won in Tokyo. Now she set her eyes on an even greater performance, one which would be seen by the whole world, in full, vivid, colour.\n\nNaturally this would include the Germans, and their team. Once more, they would be seeking to prove their genetic superiority, and fill podiums with smiling Aryan girls and boys. Being upstaged by purported untermensch, especially those from nations which were not supposed to exist anymore, was not part of their plan. Which, thought Čáslavská, was quite unfortunate for them.

Perhaps the phrases 'track' and 'stands' were somewhat generous, particularly considering what awaited the successful athletes in Mexico, but still leagues beyond what had been possible even five years ago. Sure, they would be performing under the Olympic flag as the 'United Team' instead of anything more distinctly national, but Russia was returning to the world stage.\n\nThere had been all sorts of teething problems getting the whole affair set up. It had proven inordinately difficult to get the word out through the various statelets, to say nothing of the border into Moskowien. Transportation caused even greater difficulties. Political discussion had to be banned almost immediately in the training facilities, after several fights broke out on the first day. Whatever you thought of Marx or Lenin, Sobolev thought, Das Kapital contained very little insight on the triple jump, and State and Revolution was equally silent on issues of the shot put. But it was all coming together now.\n\nEven as they sweated for hours every day, Sobolev could see the hope and pride on the athletes' faces. The surrounding town seemed to have its spirits equally lifted, and it seemed not a day went by without one of the locals leaving baskets of food or other gifts for the prospective Olympians. Despite it all, something good, something wonderful even, was happening in this blighted and cursed land.

The pool will be the Olympic competition site for swimming, diving, and waterpolo, as well as the swimming trial of the modern pentathlon. The nearby Juan de la Barrera Olympic Gymnasium, the site of the volleyball competition, is expected to be completed soon.\n\nLike its neighbor, the pool's overhanging ceiling is supported by steel cables anchored in concrete piles and tensionally adjusted at the two extremes. The roof is of sheet metal covered with reinforced concrete whose weight is necessary to counter air pressure differentials. An enclosed area of more than three acres provided space for a regulation Olympic pool, a diving tank, and stands for 10,000 spectators. Automatic contact plates at the finish line register times for the swimming events, and underwater observation windows are placed along each end of the pool to televise and photograph the races. The diving tower has a three-metre springboard and 6.5 and 10-metre platforms. During training and competitions, a hydraulic elevator carries contestants to each level. A warm-up pool is located near the dressing rooms, which are equipped with rest tanks, steam baths and lavatories.\n\nDuring his tour of the facilities, President Salinas Lozano expressed his satisfaction with the state of the art facilities provided for the athletes and gave his earnest belief the competition held next month would exceed expectations. Also there on opening day was local Olympic hopeful, 17 year old swimmer Felipe Muñoz. "El Tibio," as his friends know him, grew up ten blocks from the current location of the pool and said he was excited his family could watch him compete here in the men's 200 meter breaststroke."

Meant to handle the threats to the games discreetly. You know, terrorists, radicals, hippies, that sort of thing. That's two thousand or so soldiers. And the navy has four thousand too for the boating events both here and at Acapulco. Add up the 900 or so medics and doctors we have working with the IMSS and that's quite the force we have on the games."\n\n"Goddamn, that's quite the army group we have here, General."\n\n"About three times more than the civilians working on the games," General Badillo Vizarra said, "and that includes the coaches and the edecanes.

Then, from the bottom rings radiated a series of curves and circles, connecting with each other as they moved outward. This compass exercise continued two lines out until they connected with another series of curves and circles from the top, forming the number "68."\n\nRamírez Vázquez thought it over for a second, then decided this was it. "I like it," he said. "Putting the rings in the numbers, it's modern, distinctive, this is definitely something." Then he saw a similarity. "This looks like something from a Huichol artist. Did you take inspiration from Nierika-style yarn paintings?"\n\n"Nier-..." began Wyman. "Actually, to tell the truth, Pete and I really had no ideas until just recently. I was just exploring the relation between the rings and the number with my compass."\n\nThey paused. "It's a bit too complicated, I think," said Wyman. "I could cut the lines from five to three total.

This was the recalling of his youthful career: hiding from the armed Cristeros, cursing them for their betrayal. Back then he hid, daring not to speak in fear and cowardice. Maybe his tendencies then - refusing to act - directly influenced this most recent insurgency.\n\nAll of this would have been avoided, surely, if his words were closely decorated enough to coerce the insurgents. But at last, violence crackled throughout Mexico; violence his hands failed to prevent.\n\nHe sniffled, and his heavy head met with sweaty palms. The pen, now discarded, rolled across the desk, mocking the dwindling confidence of López Mateos. The only response it seemed that he could muster was a single groan, but nothing that could be placed onto paper. He lifted his head, now staring outside of his window, his eyes lost in the neverending skies of the Mexican night. It was his fault."

MEX_Olympics.13.desc:0 "All seemed well for López Mateos. Despite the adversities that Mexico has faced in the past weeks, he can endure. Or, that is what he told himself. Something had lingered on for far too long, a pain so undefeatable. That dreaded migraine, a pain that has disturbed the posture of López Mateos' work ethic, has summoned itself again.\n\nA tender blade pierced through his skull, releasing thousands and thousands of dancing fireworks that numbed his frame. The pain - this invisible enemy, who hated López Mateos so dearly - seemed to retreat his eyelids into the rear of his head. His vision slipped, barely within the confines of his grip. Confused and dazed, with now a million creatures scurrying in front of his eyes, López Mateos ejected himself from his seat and sprang into the air.\n\nHis mouth opened for a breath, but his own lungs locked themselves in opposition. Suddenly, he would stagger forwards, saving himself from falling by clinging on the frame of his desk. He could not hear the pencils and the lamp crashing on the floor, nor could he hear himself gasp for assistance. He released words with no meaning, with no sense, and with no clarity. His head turned to the left, and saw a blurred crowd approaching.\n\nLópez Mateos bit his lip, and his body responded with a shivering wince. The speakers silenced, and the crowd disappeared. The light that the Lord had offered had begun to escape and sheathed; the diligent saber of López Mateos finally put to rest, as the world faded to black and the persisting screams finally ended."

He couldn't believe it. Some people deserve their fate - murderers and robbers - but him?\n\n"I suspect... that I shall perish soon, is that so?" López Mateos softly asked.\n\nThe doctor paused, then briefly nodded. He could not look his patient directly in the eyes, sympathizing with his pain.\n\nA wave of depression washed on the shores, and the sun retreated past the horizon. This was it - all the bounties of life, and its triumphs, discarded with a sour hand of cards.

With much hesitation, he spoke.\n\n"I fear... that you will not survive past the current decade."\n\nIt was like a sincere burst of thunder, launched directly at his chest. He had not the power to cry, but to appreciate the history of his life up to this point. Determined for the future, he lifted his hand and gave a slight smile.\n\n"Everything in my life up to this point has smiled to me," López Mateos responded,"

The world was a grimacing place, and López Mateos had been one of the few soothing hands to reach out to him. With the sun setting behind them, their hearts fell together, whispering. His last friend, and his last protection - destroyed.\n\n"Politics are rough, I am sure you are aware, and I fear that I must remove myself from that world."\n\nOrdaz responded, calmly, "I understand - I really do. Promise me... that you will regularly notify me of your condition as the days go on."\n\n"Of course, Ordaz. Of course."\n\nThey both smiled.

He dared not to berate the pallid figure, instead delivering a sharp glare. But López Mateos knew what this meant.\n\nAlready weak, López Mateos winced at Salinas' expression. "I apologize, and dearly I do - but I cannot continue in the tribulating realm of politics any longer."\n\nWith a sigh, Salinas closed his eyes and smiled. "Many underestimated your vigor that persisted up until this point... I respect your previous efforts, Mr. President."\n\nPerhaps this was for the best, Salinas thought, when López Mateos returned the smile. No doubt, the Olympian would certainly become an obstacle for Salinas' endeavors. While now traveling alone appears a little daunting, Salinas smirks a little in the name of confidence."

Of course I will work on the Olympic committee. I am hampered, not crippled."\n\nMadrazo returned the smile, and nodded. The old man would fight for his country until the bitter end. Despite their disagreements, Madrazo was inspired by López Mateos' volition, and looked up to him, as both an ally and president. "I am happy to hear that, Adolfo.

The last thing he needed was to be assailed by some rube trying to win political points. The Palacio Nacional itself was filled with the signs of people scrambling to manage the situation as one might expect, but there were only brief glimpses of the real chaos. The faint cacophony of telephones ringing was audible just about everywhere in the building, and he was almost knocked over multiple times by the many secretaries racing to relay some news to whoever. As he moved from place to place and spoke from person to person, he got the occasional glimpse of the storm he knew fine well was brewing within the PRI: A pair of men shiftily swapping messages, one of whom he was sure he recognised from Ortiz Mena's office. A secretary finding an envelope on their desk, turning pale and reading it in stunned silence, given some task Baurraud would rather not know about.\n\nThey were all moving now, Baurraud knew. The Japanese had fired the starting pistol without even realizing it and the factions within the PRI were swarming to secure their positions. It would be a bloody affair, but it would decide the next Sexenio - So, of course, everybody would be in on it. Talking to an aide about correspondence with Tokyo, Baurraud spied a person approaching from up the corridor that he knew for a fact was close to Madrazo.

In this brief period of economic turbulence, the health and wellbeing of our civil servants, especially those occupying such a lofty perch as the inside of the National Palace, is of great importance. Times such as these have often lead to panic and ill decision, causing undue damage to the body, which for those of our profession ripples outward to the body politic. This potentiality leads us to our present concern, of which we are writing thereof.\n\nIt is our understanding that your esteemed person is currently in possession of an unfinalized report concerning the effects of the Japanese economic downturn on the minerals sector, pending revision and submission to the office of the President. While perhaps correct in some purely material figures, the conclusions it reaches are short-sighted towards the long-term benefits of cooperation and integration within the Asian market. To leave this paper unaltered in the hands of the President would be to sign one's name on a short-sighted implication which may damn Mexican economic growth for the forseeable future. We would like to avoid implicating your good name in such a decision.\n\nSimilarly, we would like to avoid any unfortunate implications arising from a set of photographs taken on the 10th of February, 1963, which we have intercepted from an attempted blackmailer. You will find copies alongside this letter. Knowing your good character, we understand that you would never engage in extramarital relations or ingest restricted narcotic substances on the date specified. Nor would you do such a thing on September 5th of last year, March the 23rd of this year, or the previous Tuesday to the time of writing. The press, sadly, may not be as understanding.

The latest order of the day, as del Rosal had been informed through a multitude of in-person visits and phone calls, was that Salinas had to go. Initially, he hadn't planned to do anything - He might not like Salinas that much, but moving against Salinas was only going to piss off President López Mateos and encourage more of this factionalist squabbling. Of course, people kept coming from the groups against Salinas and complaining more and more, and the pressure was on him now to do something about it.\n\nWhere there was a problem, there was a solution. If the problem was Salinas, del Rosal figured it was worth looking at those who opposed him. Chief among them, of course, were Madrazo and Ordaz. Opposed individuals in the succession battle, maybe, but their camps were more alike than they were like Salinas. If those two could perhaps be united against Salinas... del Rosal picked up his phone's receiver again, preparing to dial a number.

But that did not lead Ordaz and Madrazo to completely, or even mostly, forget the very large gulf in opinion that sat between them.\n\nThe fact of the matter was that, fellow PRI grandees though they were, Madrazo and Díaz Ordaz disagreed fundamentally. Ordaz found Madrazo's idealism ridiculous on a good day, a sign of mental illness on a bad day. Madrazo on the other hand found Ordaz's ruthlessness to be at best excessive and at worst an outright betrayal of the Institutional Revolution.\n\nBut that gulf of opinion was not enough to cause them to fight in the presence of a common enemy - that of Salinas and his technocratic mumbo-jumbo.

All the while cutting the 'weaker' parts of the budget and rallying the party around it. Now, this was something he personally could get behind as well as many of the old members of the PRI. However, there was another option that while he may not like, might be necessary.\n\nSalinas, who was in the second camp, rallied his technocrats around him and was more radical in terms of how far he wanted to go. Restructuring the web of the Mexican economy itself, López Mateos wanted to dismiss it entirely, if not for the economists in his circle being in overwhelming support of the idea.

Fear reigned for a time, the Japanese were a fearsome superpower, who held great influence in Mexico and were clearly not averse to the idea of starting resistance movements against the government. Anger took over in a rapid coup, what right did they have to dominate Mexico so? They should be punished for their abuses of the nation's sovereignty! Finally, a cold hard, calculating feeling maneuvered to the head of his thoughts, and he sat at his desk and began to write.\n\nMadrazo and Ordaz were rarely seen entering the same building, let alone the same room. Yet, the wounded state of a mutual enemy ensured that the two would have to work hand in glove. Mateos studied them for a moment, as each eyed the other with flashes of contempt and anticipation.\n\n"Gentlemen, the situation with Japan has reached a point where a decision must be made. I have heard reports from the Tokyo stock exchange-" Mateos tapped a vanilla folder- "...and they aren't pleasing. It has become fairly obvious that Japanese corporations in Mexico are nearing insolvency. I have been advised of a number of different things. Some call for bailouts..." Madrazo and Ordaz both briefly smirked, for that certain "some" was one of the few people that earned their mutual contempt. "...others call for liquidation. I have chosen to take the more laissez-faire option: we let it be."\n\nOrdaz and Madrazo leaned in somewhat. Mateos was not known for deliberately taking a finger out of a pie. Mateos began pulling out folders, handing them to the men, each one bearing numerous telltale data points and explanations. . "If you read these, you will see the reasons why. If Japan wants to keep doing business here, they should tell their lobbyists to be less brazen, or at least never lobby for causes that hurt our administration," Mateos sneered self-satisfactorily. "Nevertheless, I am sure some will quibble about it, , and I know this will hurt many workers, but this is a necessary leveling of the playing field.

That and we'll be able to receive more income in taxes generated by the companies. Not to mention that it'll help our relations with our two neighbors up north." Ordaz looked up at his 'partner' from the sheet of papers he had been reviewing.\n\nMadrazo faced the man before trying to get his point across again. "And what I'm saying, Ordaz, is if we instead focused on the small people of Mexico. By that I mean the Ejidos, small businesses, and the slightly bigger medium ones, we'll be able to give all of that to our own people here in Mexico. Along with that, by emphasizing tourism we'll be able to bring capital from all around the world to here in Mexico, they'll even revitalize sectors of our economy if there's enough tourists and cash flowing around."\n\nLópez Mateos watched the two having their pseudo-dispute as he considered both of their suggestions on how to handle the exodus of the Japanese companies. Ordaz's plan would fill the vacuum left behind by the exodus so there would be no worry of stability, along with improving relations. On the other hand, Madrazo's 'keep it here' idea was something that could create a boon for the economy, given that it all pays back dividends and doesn't fail.\n\nNow it was the matter of choosing which one to go with."

As victims of the Japanese layoffs continued to pile up, concern began to grow over their ability to financially keep their heads above water. Madrazo and Ordaz had both agreed to the general framework of a potential solution, extending rent payments in an effort to take financial pressure off of Kabuki Effect victims. However, the devil was always in the details.\n\n"We cannot afford to take a weak position on this, Gustavo," Madrazo said, his voice filled with passion and confidence. "These workers are not going to be able to just easily pick themselves up and move on from this. They will need as much time and assistance as we can give them and more. If we fail them now they may never recover."\n\n"Carlos, I understand your position, I promise I truly do," Ordaz began. "However you must realize that the workers are not the only ones in peril here. If we are too generous now the business community will take further fright. If we cause further damage to their bottom lines their investments will dry up and these workers will have no employers to hire them."\n\nThe debate continued on and on, but both men knew the pressure they were under. They needed to act quickly, and a poor decision was far better than no decision. So, after a rigorous debate the details of the rent extension were finally agreed upon."

Tasked with creating said package, Madrazo and Ordaz were once again working into the early hours of the morning hashing out the details of the new policy initiative. Given the gulf between the two men's political demeanors this process was arduous to say the least.\n\n"I know what you are going to say Gustavo," Madrazo began. "We must be practical with this, we cannot afford to go too far. Well to hell with that! This is a real opportunity Gustavo! A chance to not only stave off the current crisis, but to better prepare the poor and the jobless for the hardships of the future! What we build should last, a fund that can become the backbone of the Mexican social safety net for years to come."\n\n"I do not think I have to remind you that you are not President Carlos," Ordaz retorted. "His Excellency has tasked us with providing aid to the current crisis, not reshaping the economy. The simple solution here is to send out stimulus checks to those most damaged by the current crisis. It'll buy us time to remedy this mess and it will help them not become a burden on their families and Mexican society as a whole."\n\nIn the end the President wanted the package finished as soon as possible to address the crisis, so the two men once again had to come to a hard decision."

His audience was three men, Díaz Ordaz, Ortiz Mena, and most importantly President López Mateos. While Ortiz Mena signaled approval and Ordaz maintained a stoic silence, the president looked quite displeased.\n\n"Secretary Salinas, I am following your logic but I do not think I understand your reasoning," the President said with a sigh. "What kind of signal do we send to the Japanese if we bail them out every time they fail us? How many years until this happens again? Could we not at least set harsher terms for these firms?"\n\nThe silence that followed the President's aggravated musings was deafening. As Salinas was about to speak up in defense of his plan he was cut off by the President's voice.

While I understand that our primary responsibility is to the people, it is for their sake that we must not only think about the present situation, but also about the future. Cutting taxes for them shows that despite the hardship we are still committed partners."\n\n"I see the wisdom in that," the President said. "I agree that easing the burden on these Japanese corporations is likely our best move, however we have other factors to consider. The party and the people would not be pleased. I have Secretary Ortiz Mena telling me that middle class tax cuts are a far safer way to stoke investment. Tell me, is this really worth deepening the anger within the party and the people?"\n\n"I understand how this policy will look on the outside. However, when a patient at a hospital is sick they often do not like the taste of their medicine. Yet, when they are healed they no longer cared what the medicine tasted like, only that they are better again. The same will hold true for the party and the people.

"I am merely suggesting that we analyze our budget for any frivolous spending or subsidies to free up some money to be spent saving our economy. Now I know the party will not like this, howev-"\n\n"The party will eat me alive for this, Raúl!" the President interrupted. "Not to mention the general populace will be furious! Their opinions aside, I will not stand for reckless budget cuts."\n\n"They do not need to be 'reckless', Your Excellency. I have had several staffers already highlight areas of spending where it will be felt the least. We need this money if we want to get out of this crisis."\n\nPresident López Mateos sat back in his chair with a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Send me a copy of these proposed cuts, if they are as frivolous as you present them I will allow for a temporary halt of funding. This will be short term though, Raúl, extremely short term.""

The crisis had exposed the rot within the PRI. What was supposed to be an organ of efficient political action on behalf of the Mexican people was really a factional nightmare. Competing interests within the party did not work together towards what goals they did share, but rather entrenched themselves in endless gridlock over the areas they disagreed on.\n\nHe thought himself lucky that he was able to cobble together any response to the Kabuki Effect. The party was more inflexible as ever, however the urgent nature of the crisis gave him the wiggle room he needed to get what he could done. He only now hoped that what he could get done would be the right solution to the crisis. The president's thoughts were interrupted when his eyesight fell to a newspaper sitting on his desk.\n\n"UNEMPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO RISE AS MASSES STRUGGLE TO GET BY"\n\nThis would not do. There was so much more work to be done but the president also knew his own physical limitations were catching up with him. The time would soon come where he could no longer be deemed fit to lead Mexico. The hard times were not over, and likely would not end before he could resign. It was time to decide on a successor, one that López Mateos could trust to continue the work."

MEX_Flavor.1.desc:0 "The unlikely combination of the Mexican Charro and the traditional Hollywood western wrapped up and delivered as an action-comedy has somehow proved to be a blockbuster in San Diego and Tijuana alike. A combination of the star powers of American tough-guy legend John Wayne and Mexican comedic superstar Cantinflas, "Ambos Amigos'' follows a series of train robberies in the Sonoran desert in the 1910s. While the shady American mining company affected by these robberies sends in a gunfighter (Wayne), the corrupt Mexican officials pass the buck to the bumbling local inspector (Cantinflas). After a series of hilarious collisions between the two, Wayne and Cantinflas team up to take down the bandits and the corrupt businessmen and politicians behind the attacks.\n\nCritical reception has been mostly positive to this tex-mex mix, playing off of the perceptions of Cantinflas being the underdog in this relationship. And for the most part he is often treated like a nuisance by Wayne, who often comes off as patronizing early in the movie. However, it's Cantinflas who turns this around, often playing the part of the comedic, yet noble underdog hero and putting his co-star in situations outside his comfort zone. While this mismash creates a competition between the two icons, it also makes the film mesmerizing watching the two play off one another's strengths, making what reviewers deem an instant classic for both countries.\n\nDomestically, however, the film has sparked much debate. While the film's main message seems to be about the shared history of the Americas and the border regions in particular, some have seen the film as a distinctly Mexican triumph. Others have raised controversy regarding the film's casting of John Wayne, who has said less than savory things regarding other races. Regardless of what some may say, this flick will certainly be discussed and debated, driving more viewers to the box office."

The lonely thing sat for hours, baking in the sun, adding to the heat already emanating from the extremely radioactive Cobalt-60 capsule.\n\nIts solitude would come to an end, however, when a 10-year-old boy stumbled across the capsule on his way home from school. The curiosity of the young boy overcame him, and for the next several days the capsule found its new home in the child's pockets. It found itself traveling with him to school, to football practice, and to the boy's closet. But on April 1st, the mother took the capsule from the boy, and soon enough, the capsule would find a more permanent residence - the kitchen spice cabinet.\n\nShrouded in darkness, the capsule became acquainted with the voices of the family. Conversations about school, work, and the mother's incoming third child could be heard at the dinner table every night. Three weeks after being placed in the cabinet, however, the conversation shifted to something new - the boy was sick, and it was only getting worse day after day.\n\nOn April 29th, the voice of the boy was absent for the first time, and sounds of sorrow came from the living room for weeks after the fact, soon turning into sounds of agony and desperation as the same symptoms soon befell the pregnant mom. The days passed once more, and on July 10th, the voice of the mother disappeared as well.\n\nOn July 22nd, the capsule was removed from its solitude, this time experiencing the familiar feeling of lead-coated gloves amidst the sounds of police sirens and investigators. It would meet its fate later that week at a disposal site, unaware of the suffering it wrought."

MEX_Flavor.3.desc:0 "To many of Mexico's rural peasantry and poor, Rubén Jaramillo is a living symbol of liberation, of freedom from the shackles of the ranchers and landlords and resistance to the despotism of the PRI, the last of the original Zapatistas. Joining the ranks of the Revolution at age 14, he has consistently fought for land reform in his home state his whole life, struggling to obtain the rights promised in the 1917 constitution.\n\nBut to those in the PRI and Mexican government, he is the constant thorn in the side of the presidency, carrying out multiple revolts in his home state of Morelos over the last two decades with a radicalized, belligerent band of loyalists known as the Jaramilistas. Despite receiving amnesty and concessions multiple times, he remains steadfast in the face of injustices against the working class, something that has painted a target on his back for an increasingly frustrated López Mateos and DFS.\n\nDespite this, the old revolutionary has re-emerged once more for International Workers' Day, presenting his "Last Manifesto" for all to see, damn the consequences.\n\nIn it, he denounces the government's efforts to suppress him, and details the coming years as a pivotal moment in the struggle for the working class of Mexico against the corrupt, ineffective PRI government - a government, he states, that has failed to fulfill the original promise of The Mexican Revolution. A rallying cry for the rural and working class alike, it is spreading like wildfire in newspapers and working class circles all throughout Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, behind closed doors, the army and DFS have decided that enough is enough, with an operation to kidnap and execute Jaramillo already in the works, a plan which would behead the Jaramilista movement before they could threaten Mexico ever again."

Jaramillo, his wife Epifania, and her three sons resist, but are quickly overpowered, soon finding themselves with their hands tied, blindfolded in the back of a van. After a long, grueling drive, the van arrives at the Xochicalco ruins.\n\nKnowing his fate is sealed, Jaramillo lunges at one of the guards, getting knocked unconscious instantly as his face meets the butt of a rifle. Epifania attempts the same, letting out an agonizing cry as she is thrown to the stones.\n\n"You bitch! Get your hands off my moth-" the son's wishes are cut short by gunfire, and he collapses to the ground. As he wails, the laughing officers force fistfuls of dirt into his mouth, until the son whimpers his last breath. Impatient, the officers finish off the family with bullets to the skull, marking the end of Rubén Jaramillo.\n\nMiraculously, his daughter slipped through the raid, and with word spreading of the massacre, everyone from PAN to the communists are demanding justice. With the government ignoring the pleas however, Jaramillo's name has become a rallying cry of the masses, joining the ranks of Guzman and Zapata in the pantheon of the working class, his message of revolution resonating with ever more dismayed workers, for the PRI has failed the Revolution."

Little did he fathom that upon facing the sprawling metropolis, where the avenues recklessly extended into the break of dawn and its inhabitants beheld a world through an altered lens unlike that of the Ejido, he would encounter a veritable inferno, a relentless maelstrom of toil and suffering that exceeded even his most harrowing nightmares.\n\nBitter and disillusioned, trading one torment for another, he sought solace within the squalid shantytowns that encircled the city's industrial districts. It resembled a wretched cavern, a breeding ground for mold and a watery haven for vermin and other loathsome creatures. And yet, it demanded half of his still-meager earnings, and sometimes even more if he failed to produce a week's worth of labor. He had borne witness to wretchedness before, true, starvation had stalked the streets of Concepción and its Ejidos, but he had never fathomed that within the city's confines, injuries would be callously disregarded, and those maimed by the grinding machinery of the factory would be left to wither and decay, swiftly replaced by the next wave of deceived souls clamoring for employment. And to compound the misery, no one dared to rise up and confront this grievous injustice. At least, that was his initial belief.\n\nOne fateful morning, as if blessed by an otherworldly gust, a mysterious pamphlet smacked him square in the face while he trudged toward the factory. What did its words reveal? His reading skills were wanting, but its message resonated through his very being. It clamored for justice on behalf of those enslaved in the assembly lines, beseeching the workers to resist the suffocating yoke. But how does one defy the insidious tyranny imposed by unrelenting need? How does one resist the allure of sustenance, even if it exacts a cruel toll on one's integrity?

Tomorrow awaited his return to the relentless grind, for his brief interlude had not severed the chains of toil and suffering that bound him. The factory, the sole provider of sustenance, kept his bread on the table, or rather, the only dry spot on the quarter's floor.\n\nAs he embarked on his journey towards the heroic city of Veracruz, Wilfrido delved into the meaning behind the enigmatic letters—CTM. The knowledgeable few labeled them an acronym, denoting the Confederación de Trabajadores de México—the politicians' term for such an organization was a trade union, an instrument for organizing labor and seeking justice. The very notion filled him with a glimmer of hope, fueling dreams of transforming the factory's bleak reality. He longed to escape the haunting sights of mutilated workers and emaciated souls collapsing upon the factory grounds. This time, he was determined not to be disillusioned the way he was when he learned that the perils of the Ejido persisted even within the city's confines. But deep within, a flicker of intuition assured him that this time, failure would not be his fate.\n\nHe wandered through the streets until his eyes beheld the three letters he sought, emblazoned alongside the ominous yet inspiring emblem of the organization. Stepping through the door, he was greeted by a haze of smoke and bustling secretaries whose hands danced with enviable swiftness across typewriters and scattered papers. In an ideal world, he would have known how to navigate such situations, but that was not his reality. Before long, he found himself inundated with a barrage of questions regarding wage freezing and signing papers, his name appearing repeatedly upon the parchment like a mantra of determination.\n\nEmerging from the overwhelming yet strangely invigorating tangle of syndical bureaucracy, he was entrusted with a mission—to rally his fellow workers back at the Mexico City factory.

Following their indications, he arrived to a secluded building, not further than a twenty minute stroll from the factory, such a place, despite its crummy and run down aspect, beckoned hope in Wilfrido's mind, however, when he crossed the doors, he didn't find himself confronted with the ecstatic rhythm of productive secretaries and organizers, but instead, with the soft melody of a guitar playing through an old radio and some men sharing expensive spirits.\n\n"Please, join us," they invited Wilfrido, dragging him closer and having the man seat among them, he explained, or at least tried to explain in numerous occasions that he came to discuss the what-to-dos in order to pull the workers out of the miserable state of the factory line, however, he was quietly interrupted or discretely pulled away from that line of conversation.\n\nOnce midnight came and he left, disillusionment began to build up.

The weight of his own wage slashed by a quarter, a consequence of this calamity, crushed his spirit further. His heart, once hopeful, now festered with frustration and seething hatred.\n\nThe voices of those men he had encountered in Veracruz resonated through the radio, promising action against the arbitrary wage cuts. They made grand promises, time and time again, but as the days slipped away like sand through his fingers, disbelief enveloped him. They had deceived him, cruelly playing a grotesque joke on him and all those who toiled ceaselessly in places like the factory he begrudgingly called his own. Now, ravaged by hunger and desperate need, he couldn't help but ponder the bribe he had accepted. The memories of the Ejido haunted him—Concepción may have been a wretched place, but at least there, words held some semblance of worth. He wanted to weep and repent the day he had ventured into this heartless city, but tears could not undo the past. Regardless of his sorrow, he had to forge ahead, by any means necessary.\n\nThe allure of an escape through suicide taunted him, but he refused to damn his soul to the depths of hell. He chose to endure, vowing never again to fall prey to deception. And so, the first step towards liberation was to incinerate the membership card those men from Veracruz had bestowed upon him—the emblem of the CTM, a haunting reminder of his personal failure. Crushing the remnants of that emblematic betrayal, he rose from his knees.

An aging radio, standing like a precious relic upon his table, provided a fleeting connection to the outside world, but the news of the day, the succession of López Mateos, held little allure for him. Experience had taught him to expect disappointment from such administrative changes, breeding only false hope.\n\nHowever, whispers of a designated successor ignited an inexplicable tremor within his weary soul. Carlos Alberto Madrazo, a name once inconsequential, stirred unease within him. Belonging to the very party that callously disregarded the suffering of him and his fellow workers, Madrazo's name had merely blended into the cacophony of those who held power without compassion. Six months ago, however, the man's name began to saturate the streets. Wilfrido, compelled by an insatiable hunger for knowledge, delved into the depths of Madrazo's character. Perhaps there was more to this man than met the eye, but would it be enough to bring about change? Uncertainty gnawed at his soul, mingling with the peculiar surge of anticipation that now coursed through his veins.\n\nThe countdown to Madrazo's inauguration drew nearer, intensifying the tangle of emotions within Wilfrido's being. If the rumors proved true, if the flicker of hope could ignite into a blazing fire of restless action, this could be the elusive golden opportunity he had relentlessly pursued. Perhaps he could rise to preside over his own trade union and fight for his fellows at the factory.\n\nAnd so, as the day slipped away, Wilfrido dared to dream, to envision a future where he could be the harbinger of change, a solitary figure of resilience standing firm against the waves of injustice. The winds of destiny whispered their secrets, and in that moment, hope and determination entwined, propelling him towards a destiny yet to unfold."

MEX_Flavor.14.desc:0 ""Javier! Get over here. We were wondering when you were going to finally show up." Andrés, one of Javier's former co-workers, waved him over to one of the corner tables of the bar. "I haven't seen you since the factory shut down! How have you been?" Andrés' cheeks were as red as the fluorescent light that hung outside the entrance to the bar, and he swayed between two more of Javier's coworkers who were equally as drunk.\n\n"I've been trying to find ways to keep myself busy," Javier said as sincerely as he could. What he really meant was that he had done very little beyond begging for work where there was none. "I heard from Roberto that a few of you were getting together, and thought I'd join. Think one of you can pass me the whiskey?"\n\nAndrés was more than happy to oblige, pouring Javier his own glass before sliding the cloudy brown liquid across the table. Javier took no time at all to down it, letting it burn his throat on the way down. After a few more shots, intercut with some light conversation reminiscing about their work at the Mitsubishi factory, Javier's head was finally swimming as all thought of his woes were washed away.\n\n"Hey Javier... I heard from a friend of a friend that, if you're looking for some quick cash, someone's paying big money to anyone who joins some sort of protest in Mexico City that's starting soon. As long as you're waving some sign or shouting anti-PRI slogans, you'll get the cash. What do you think?"\n\nAs suspicious as that sounded, Javier needed the money and he needed it soon. His landlord had given him only a few more weeks to make up the money for rent, and he barely had enough saved as it was for food. This might just be what he needed to keep himself on his feet until he found stable work."

Men and women were pressed in against one another, and the faces that Javier could see were contorted in fury. He felt one man behind him screaming with such anger that spit was hitting the back of his neck, mixing with the sweat trickling down. The sun beat down hard. There was only one thing hotter than the humid air that choked them: the anger of the protestors themselves.\n\nJavier had no time to question things once he was caught up in the crowd. It was not until the crowd reached the checkpoint that he began to regret ever becoming a part of this. There were DFS mixed in with the police, and as soon as they got to the checkpoint, all hell broke loose. The batons came out, slamming into the first row of protestors. At first, the fury of the men and women around Javier held the tide against the DFS and police, but after a few had rifle butts slammed into them, knocking them to the ground bloodied, protesters began to scatter.\n\nAnd when the way opened for them to shove their way into the veins of the crowd, there was nothing to stop them. Violence swept over them like a wave, and Javier was frozen in place even as they came nearer and nearer. His legs felt stuck to the pavement, his breath caught in his throat until the baton of a policeman slammed into his chest and sent him hurtling onto the ground. More blows came, a cascade of them slamming into his arms, legs, chest, and anywhere else a boot or baton could reach.\n\nIf he didn't get away now, he would be arrested or worse. Life finally returned to his legs and, as if by providence itself, the policeman beating him was hit in the head by a rock from a nearby protestor. His attention diverted, Javier scrambled to his feet and dashed for the nearest alleyway. He did not look back."

He finally stepped aside, letting another of the protestors try in vain to receive their pay from this mysterious benefactor. Whoever he was, he might as well have been Satan himself for all Javier cared. Because of him, his body ached from four dozen bruises scattered across his body. His ribs throbbed, and it still hurt to even walk.\n\nHe had nowhere else to go. Mexico City was still reeling from the riots, and he'd be hard pressed to find work here besides. He knew there were some opportunities up north, but that meant leaving the only home he'd ever known. He had worked at that Mitsubishi factory for almost a decade. He supposed he could find work in a maquiladora up north. At the very least, he knew enough that he could be an asset.\n\nHe also knew of those who moved to the United States to work for a few years, saving up enough cash to start a better life when returning home to Mexico. He'd also heard that the work the Americans put you through was backbreaking, whether it was a plantation in Texas or California.\n\nThe supposed party of the Revolution... what a joke, Javier thought. Before, he had protested against them simply because it might get him paid. And yet now he could feel a small fire burning inside him, the fire he had seen blazing through those protestors. He would flee Mexico City, his home, so that he might scrape by, but he would never trust in the PRI again."

The air crackled with tension as pieces of paper, like a blizzard of white, adorned the doors of the revered Cathedral of the Assumption. This hallowed sanctuary, once the seat of Anahuac's congress, now bore witness to a befitting manifesto.\n\nThe message etched upon those sheets of paper reverberated with an urgency that stirred the very soul of Chilpancingo. It was a rallying cry, a desperate plea for the people of Guerrero, nay, for the entire state, to awaken from their slumber of oppression and terror. The ominous shadow cast by the relentless armed forces, who had callously trampled upon the innocent and quashed the spirit of the citizens, could no longer be ignored. Inequality, a venomous scourge that had left them destitute, must be confronted head-on.\n\nThe manifesto blazed with righteous indignation, igniting a fiery passion within the hearts of all who read it. It served as a stark reminder of their proud and rich history—a history intertwined with the legendary deeds of Eleodoro Castillo and Los Galeana, a history that spans a century and began with the visionary Patricio Juan Álvarez. It called upon the people to draw strength and inspiration from their glorious past and rekindle the flickering flame of Revolution that now teetered perilously in the hands of those who once championed the cause—the very party that had proudly carried the mantle of Revolution.\n\nWord of this scandalous revelation spread like wildfire, drawing scores of people to the sacred haven of the cathedral—some scandalized, others discreetly curious. The message was clear, its resonance undeniable. And for the first time, the call to action echoed through the hearts of the people, reverberating with a newfound determination that would shape the future of the State."

This Estate was where the children of a nation gripped by German oppressors found solace, far from their lost homeland.\n\nInside the estate's walls, a rustic aura permeated the lives of the original migrants and their families. They tended the land, embracing their communal center gifted two decades prior. Children frolicked and elders reflected, their thoughts wandering to lives sacrificed on the journey to Santa Rosa, their little paradise.\n\nAmong them was Valentina, a young woman in her twenties, her formative years entwined with survivors and scant memories of Poland, of her parents. As she wandered the labyrinthine corridors of the estate, faded recollections resurfaced, imbuing each corner with nostalgia. Every inch whispered tales of resilience—of men, women, and children acquainted solely with destitution. They endured the clutches of the Nazi Empire, only to be cast like livestock into the Siberian tundra by the Soviets.\n\nYet, life emerged resilient from adversity. They stood now, beneath León's sun, embracing newfound opportunities, defying fate's decree. They had survived the horrors inflicted upon Poland, carving a place for themselves beyond the oppressive yoke of conquerors who sowed devastation and despair.\n\nIn their hearts surged an unyielding spirit, an anthem of survival. In their eyes gleamed determination, shedding the shackles of desolation. As the sun bathed the city in golden hues, the children of the Santa Rosa Estate danced upon the ruins of the past, their footsteps weaving a symphony of hope. Melancholy and bittersweetness intertwined in every stride, an ode to resilience within a nation reborn, their little Poland."

Amidst the fleeting respites that the day granted, he summoned the attention of his fellow workers, standing resolute outside the factory's confines, beckoning them to join forces. While his efforts often seemed futile, his unwavering determination to disrupt the stagnant waters and rock the foundations of the factory did not go unnoticed. Unfortunately, the recognition he yearned for arrived from an unexpected source — the very individuals who held power within the hierarchical structure. They wasted no time in seizing him as he exited the factory.\n\n"Mr. Vargas, may we talk briefly?" a man donning a gray suit that reminded him tacitly of one of the silhouettes present at that rendezvous with the local directory met him at the exit gates of the facility.\n\n"Yes," Wilfrido answered a bit meekly, answering more to the suit than to the man who wore it.\n\n"You see Mr. Vargas, you are an exceptional worker, and a very productive one I must say, and we'd like to keep you here at the factory..." the man answered, letting his last words dangle as he cautiously slid a hand behind Wilfrido's shoulders.\n\n"However, in order to do that, the administration would like to make some... changes, regarding the way you have expressed your discomfort with our schedule policies." Those words were the first worrying sign, the prospect of not being able to earn some sustenance worried him severely. He could only gulp, after all, words hadn't been his front, he stammered and began to sweat, perhaps also trying to convey some anger as he was being cornered by an overpowering force like the factory's leadership.\n\n"But worry not," the man continued, his tongue being the vessel of an ominous proposal "We can offer you some compensation in exchange of your silence," he said, slowly moving from Wilfrido's side and facing him again, extending his hand to seal the devious pact, a hand that Wilfrido couldn't shake before finding himself fleeing in a frantic run. He was going to be targeted now, he knew, perhaps he could, if anything, try to be more discreet if necessary, he thought... but he couldn't surrender just yet, what would the men at Veracruz think of him if he did?"

Some coughed, others rubbed their calloused hands together, and yet more wondered how much they were being given to stand here instead of work. At the very least, some thought, it was a break from the dark depths where only dust, sweat, and stone ruled.\n\nIn Sonora, farmers were made to watch a rally of their own. As a respite from the hard labor beneath the sweltering desert sun of northern Mexico, they were made to listen to a local party leader give a speech about the sacred values of the PRI and its institutions.

He expelled the Yaqui from their rightful land, murdering those who opposed him. Cárdenas would create a government department for the indigenous peoples.

Yet somehow El Tren Del Infierno (also known internationally as Runaway Train or Bōsō kikan-sha) has managed to bust blocks in Kanto, Chihuahua, and California.\n\nBased on a real event, Runaway Train is an action thriller focusing on an out of control locomotive. Manny (Henry Fonda) and Buck (Peter Falk) are two escaped prisoners who freighthop on board a train in the American southwest in a bid for freedom. Along the way, the train engineer dies of a heart attack, and the engine's brakes give way. Manny and Buck must traverse the train and stop the locomotive while also avoiding their sadistic prison warden hell-bent on recapturing them.\n\nSurprisingly this film comes from writer and director Akira Kurosawa, more well known in the Sphere for his Japanese historical dramas. Working with longtime writing partners Hideo Oguni and Ryuzo Kikushima, Kurosawa's film has surprised many critics by being set in the modern day United States, and also his second film in full color. It is widely believed, though not confirmed, that Mexico was chosen as a middle ground to avoid sanctions and utilize top tier talent like Oscar nominees Fonda and Falk. Rumors that Japanese financers are behind the Mexican production company also lend credibility to these claims.\n\nThis film hasn't been entirely uncontroversial, however. Some in the United States have protested the film as being some sort of Japanese propaganda, while in the east some prefectures have banned the film as too western for an East Asian audience. However, critics on both sides of the ocean have been mostly positive focusing on the adrenaline fueled premise, stunning action scenes, and star presence of Fonda and Falk. It seems the legendary director has finally crossed over into the west, and bridged a gap as wide as the Pacific ocean."

Vulgate, of course. As the Editorial's staff scribbled and typed away, the sound of right hands touching the Vulgate and intoing oaths sworn in a murmur repeated.

That sly bastard sees the suffering of this "Kabuki effect" as an opportunity for his own political gain." President López Mateos pesters his staffer. The escalating situation in San Luis Potosí would make sure his final years would see no shortage of action.\n\n"What the hell does he even want?" Upon skimming the reports and news articles however, the main demand made by Nava rang loud and clear - nothing short of a complete overturn of the 1961 San Luis Potosí Governor election.\n\nGlancing up from the files, the frustrated president leans back into his chair, pinching his nose. Just like Jaramillo, Nava had previously been negotiated with in years prior, already having been released from prison in '61 after the public demanded as such.\n\n"We release the bastard, and our repayment is a demand to overturn the election? Bullshit." The charismatic presence López Mateos had built up and his perceived reputation of leniency were beginning to rear its ugly side effects, the president thought to himself. He turns to his staffer."

The thirsty president makes his way to the man running the place, annoyed at the predicament.\n\n"I know things are hard with the Japanese goods lately, but what of the cola on aisle 5?"\n\nThe owner responded. "Supply chain issues from the distributor in San Luis Potosí, something to do with road blockages going on up there."\n\nLópez Mateos shook his head in disappointment, and begins to reach for his wallet before something caught both their ears. As if waiting to be mentioned, the radio playing the news in the shop goes on about a massive protest underway in San Luis Potosí, led by none other than Salvador Nava.\n\n"...reports of sit-ins by students in government buildings have arrived today, who are allegedly accompanied by disgruntled PRI officials. This is in addition to the earlier street protests by the synarchists and rail unions earlier in the week that have brought the state grinding to a..."\n\nLópez Mateos tosses the pesos onto the counter, storming out towards his car on the street corner in anger. How did this information even make it past the press restrictions to national radio?

Pleased to see his government working together for once, the aging president's cadence is unbroken. Gesturing to a new face at the table, the president introduces the well-known firebrand of Tabasco Carlos Madrazo. "At Ordaz's insistence, we have brought in Licenciado Madrazo, who will hopefully spearhead any diplomatic approach with Nava."\n\nMany in the room, including Salinas, look visibly skeptical at the thought of a diplomatic approach. After all, had that not been taken two years prior when he was released from prison?\n\n"However" - the president cut off any potential opposition - "this will be done in tandem with Ordaz leading police suppression efforts of Nava's movement. With enough pressure and an open hand, we should be able to quell this nonsense movement with ease." The small tension in the room is released, and work on the details begins.\n\nThe meeting mostly goes off without a hitch, with respective Secretaries giving their concerns for the plan. From the potential popular repercussions of suppressing the movement, to the probable economic slowdowns that would be caused by transport interruptions in San Luis Potosí during the crackdown, most of the concerns had been mitigated by the end of the meeting, and most seemed pleased.\n\nSalinas lies in the corner of the table however, with his cold gaze directed towards Ordaz and Madrazo.

Nava is threatening to shut down all rail lines in the region with his union goons!" He gets up and walks over to the phone on the other side of the room. "The negotiations can come later, I'm calling the police there now and giving them the order."\n\n"Wait, Ordaz." Madrazo follows him "You have this all backwards. Whatever you tell them, keep it light for now. If we crack down now, the people will go wild." Madrazo gestures out the window towards the city. "However, if you let me negotiate first, the people will see an attempt at dialogue and reason. Let's try to avoid bloodshed for now, shall we?"\n\nOrdaz puts the phone down, thinking about his colleagues' line of reasoning. As much as he would love to rid the problem child in its infancy, the government was already on thin ice with the Kabuki crisis as is. He reluctantly agrees.\n\n"Alright, diplomacy first then."

The governor sits down, and presents his offer.\n\n"Nava, as I'm sure you expected, we cannot simply overturn an election like this and oust a sitting governor. The precedent that would be set would simply be untenable for the long-term stability of our country and the Revolution." Nava sits quietly, knowing Madrazo didn't just come to give him nothing.\n\n"However." Madrazo is given a manila folder, handing it across the table to him. "We can promise the integrity of future elections through initiatives such as an electoral anti-corruption agency and specialized watchdogs, if you step down."\n\nAs he glanced through the mockups, Nava already spots many holes in the offer-Lack of true independence, misplaced funding, overreach-this was a mostly token, worthless policy.

In their hands lie paperwork and DFS intelligence reports, and all were being directed by a single man.\n\nThe sound of Ordaz yelling over the chatter and shouting orders could be heard across the street, only broken when handed a piece of paper, stopping to read it. The well-oiled machine sought to get on top of the protests the next day. They would find out where, when, and how, all before the sun even peeked over the mountains.\n\nAs the night ended and day began, a parking lot west of downtown became the assembly point for what would be a march, undertaken by union men and students alike. Seemingly unopposed for the first 30 minutes, the protestors were shadowed by undercover officers, who relayed positions back to Ordaz's office. As soon as the protests began moving however, Ordaz radioed the police captain.\n\n"You are clear to move in."\n\nWithin minutes, the entire lot was surrounded by a wall of police, who proceeded to kettle the protestors into a corner against a neighboring commercial complex. Unable to move, and mostly unarmed, the vast majority were arrested without a fight. After Ordaz received the news, he retired to his hotel room to rest, though only for a couple hours."

MEX_Nava.16.desc:0 "The protests in San Luis Potosí maintain a thin veil of unity under the banner of Nava, mostly rallying behind his vague demands of "anti-corruption" and "election fraud". Composed of a fragile coalition, they are a patchwork of groups bursting at the seams with varying interests, something Salinas seeks to exploit. On the left, you have socialists, unions, and students, some disgruntled PRI traitors, and on the right, there are clergymen and even synarchists. It is the latter two that Salinas has been focusing his magic on.\n\nA well-connected Catholic of Norteño descent, Salinas takes advantage of his numerous contacts within the Church, seeking out old friends and clergy of San Luis Potosí that support Nava. Despite being a top PRI official, he uses his Church rapport to get in contact with the local PAN party in the area as well, as well as more unsavory folk such as the various synarchist shock groups in the area. Making use of his extensive network of middlemen and loyal bureaucrats, a bribe here and a favor there, Salinas siphons state funds to these groups all without a trace, agitating them, disproportionately empowering their voices and demands among Nava's malleable coalition. Should all go to plan, the face of the movement will be that of Nava, and God.\n\nHaving the Catholics wielding substantial influence may seem counterintuitive - it could fracture Nava's coalition and make Madrazo and Ordaz's job much easier. Though Nava is an amateur at politics, he is no fool, and Salinas knows this. He knows that Nava would not excise the most fervent of his alliance, an action that would surely kill its momentum at the movement's most critical juncture. Salinas, however, benefits immensely from this arrangement. The Church absolutely despises Ordaz and Madrazo, especially since one of them has an especially shaky past with the Church, and would hate to see Nava reach any kind of agreement with the two.\n\nThis, ideally, would make a settlement next to impossible."

Mostly those working in the governor's office, though resignations were spreading through the state's health system, education system, and even police force, crippling the state government and bringing it to a standstill. After a quick knock on the already open door to the room, Governor Madrazo walks in with a report in his hands, dropping it on the table while bearing an expression just as confused as Ordaz's.\n\n"Apparently, rumors have been going around stating we 'won't be backing the local PRI', and that we will 'concede to all of Nava's demands', despite us not even reaching an agreement with the man yet."\n\nConfused and angry, the two ponder how this "rumor" could have even gotten out like this. Their hands are already full, and they lack the resources to pursue an internal investigation while simultaneously dealing with the protests - there simply isn't enough time.

Home, San Luis Potosí, would be occupied by the military for three more months.\n\nTwo miles away in the national palace, Díaz Ordaz meets with President López Mateos in his office, and a coffee is shared between the two as the morning sunlight peers through the window.\n\n"Impressive, the way you handled that, Ordaz. While it is a shame Madrazo fell through in the talks, you and the DFS seem to have made quick work of Nava after all. And about that bastard Salinas, huh?" Both men shook their heads. The president continued. "The amount of corrupt schemes that man has gotten himself into. I think it's about time we reel him in, you think?"\n\nOrdaz takes a sip of his coffee, and reflects on his exploits with the DFS. Useful sons of bitches, those agents are. "Agreed, he did seem a little... uncooperative throughout this whole mess." he responds, then gazes out the window."

Gathering at the assembly point in the northern side of the city, the mob of people began marching towards the Capitol grounds wieldings signs and flags, their booming chants echoing through the alleys, overpowering the rain.\n\n"Power to the People! Reject Corruption! Overturn the theft of '61!" Upon hearing their cries, many in the city trickled in to join the march, resonating with the anger against the PRI, and the protest quickly swelled from a couple thousand at most into the tens of thousands. The cops showed up hours later, but it was too little too late, and the situation quickly devolved into a riot that was impossible to control, the police woefully under equipped to handle them.\n\nMeanwhile, the president's office had entered into a little riot of its own, with president Mateos entering a rare frenzy, shouting at Ordaz and Madrazo like they were his disobedient children.\n\n"How the hell did you guys let Nava and his goons go from a thorn in our side to that!" Mateos gestured out the window overlooking the city, pointing to the cops and barricades surrounding the National Palace. "This was supposed to be an easy PR win for us, Jesus Christ."\n\nOrdaz and Madrazo did not have much to say for themselves, aside from the usual talk of getting it all under control again and finger pointing at eachother. Salinas sat beside them, pretending to be concerned, though deep down he knew he practically had the succession secured now that his delicate preparations finally paid off. After the meeting, he picked up the phone for one last call, delivering the final nail into their coffin."

The president let himself wallow for a short minute, but work needed to be done. "You seem to be competent." Salinas' eyes perked up. "What do you suggest?"\n\n"I'm very glad you asked, Your Excellency." The Secretary slid over some papers containing a list of names. "While the DFS are beginning preliminary operations to contain the riots already, here is the list of names they have compiled surrounding the protest. PAN leaders, union organizers. Even the whereabouts of Nava himself. If we let this nonsense outside continue any longer, we put the Revolution at risk. We must take action" -Salinas looks outside-"now."\n\nLópez Mateos thinks for a moment-partially wondering what the Secretary of Industry and Commerce is doing with all this information-though agrees. "You are right. I'll give the call."\n\nBy sunrise, the location of Salvador Nava had been tracked to a parked bus on the outskirts of the city. After a quick arrest with little opposition, the man found himself in the Palacio de Lecumberri, in a dark cell with a DFS agent. Though he would spend only a few weeks in the complex, the Salvador Nava that came out was not the same man as before.\n\n"Without their leader," Salinas tells López Mateos in a call some days after, "it seems the movement has disintegrated."

As the day had progressed, the chants of protest became silenced block by block, occasionally replaced by the crackle of police gunfire and sirens. By the evening not a soul was in the streets - Ordaz's curfew had gone into effect.\n\nAs the party headquarters lacked much-needed air conditioning, Madrazo decided to crack open the second-story window of the office he and Ordaz had been staying in during Nava's protests. The cool mountain air wafted into the room, washing the smells of the city onto the Governor's face, along with the faint scent of cigarette smoke. The disgusting aroma did nothing to quell his anxiety, and he quickly closed it.\n\n"I can't shake the feeling, Ordaz" -the secretary looks up from his lamp-lit report he was typing- "that we jumped the gun. Just a few more rounds of negotiations, maybe." Madrazo leaned against the wall next to the window, eyes darting around the now dead city.\n\n"Are you suggesting we made the wrong call, Governor Madrazo?"\n\n"No." Madrazo may have been an idealist, though even he knew when tough calls had to be made. "I just wish things could have gone smoother with Nava."\n\nOrdaz shrugged indifferently at the thought, finishing his report on the typewriter and tearing off the fresh page, with the title of the report to the president giving off a much different tone than the office he resided in."

But as he signaled a turn, the black Chevrolet behind him did the same. And the Secretary doubted they were stopping for the ambience.\n\nSalinas tried to slouch lower in his seat, gauging if he could make a quick U-turn and a getaway. But the Chevy stopped short, with Velázquez himself emerging from the driver's seat. He stood motionless under the baking sun until Salinas clambered out and joined him. The norteño asked, "Come here often?" with a chuckle.\n\n"The owner is deaf as a post, and there won't be any other clientele."

With his donkey-like face—though Nava wisely kept that comparison to himself—all Ordaz could be bothered to do was threaten permanent expulsion from the Party in the absence of total compliance with his demands.\n\nStaying calm, Nava kept his own counsel and considered Ordaz's rudely-phrased demands. He was then spirited away by another group of flunkies to the other side of the city; by the time Nava had made it to the next restaurant it was evening.\n\nMadrazo was Nava's host. After the initial greetings, Madrazo asked, "How are you doing?" then waited for Nava's response, saying nothing more. Nava sipped his water and resisted the urge to pinch himself.

Just spit out how things are going. Then tell me what it is that you're worried about."\n\nSquelching his incredulity, Nava did as Madrazo said; Madrazo in turn heard him out.

All around the long-haired student, other fellow-minded youth echoed his statement with gusto. These students were a diverse collection of the left-wing community. Communists, the PCM, MLN, and other student protest groups. Across the campus square, a group of equally young partisans marched with signs and chants that expressed the ideological opposite of their leftist counterparts. Despite their differences, both groups gathered for the same reason. The unpopular interim governor Faustino Ortega had recently installed a new dean. One who lacked the tact, experience, skill, or philosophy that the student population desired. The young men and women of Puebla simply wanted to be heard and Ortega out of power. They just happened to disagree on everything else.\n\n"Look at them, Raul. See how they invoke fascism to get their point across." On the right side of the picket line, a short-haired student complained to his friend. A wooden crucifix hung heavy around his neck as he gripped his placard like a bat. "They don't know the first thing about fascism. If it were up to those communists, they would erase everything that makes our nation great, all for their immoral laziness."\n\nAs the two groups churned in their ideology fervor, the sun beat down on the open square. A silent line of police watched on, sure in their power. The politically powerless students shouted and marched through the day. However, new orders arrived from the governor. All disruptions were to be removed from campus. When the sun went down, the line of police smashed against the undisciplined students. The two groups mixed and clashed under the weight of the law. Shouting and jeering, became shoving, then the first strike. The silent Raul took his friend's placard and shattered it over the head of another protester.

As an experienced military man and a politician, he could guess why he had been personally called into the President's office.

Castillo had spent enough time in the PRI's bureaucratic machine to know that the party should always support itself, even if he personally thought that everything Ortega was doing was wrong.\n\n"And if you were in his position? You can speak honestly with me, General." Mateos placed down his drink and gestured for Castillo to sit down. "You see, the party has lost faith in Ortega's ability to govern, and therefore, he has lost the privilege of appointing his successor. The choice is now up to me."\n\n"If I may be frank, sir." Castillo sat but retained his unwavering posture. "I believe that a more direct approach is required for these subversives.

Drafted by Castillo's administration and approved by the PRI, the law was ratified without much debate. The next day, the new pasteurization law was announced far from the front page of every local newspaper. The new law stipulated that all milk sold in the state must be pasteurized first. On the surface, it was a common sense law that guarantees the health and safety of milk drinkers.\n\nUnderstandably, it was the dairy farmers who discovered the problem first. Some immediately, others after a couple of days. The only plant in the state capable of pasteurizing a large quantity of milk is owned by the Governor and his allies. Word spread, and outrage followed. It seemed that the whole milk industry left their farms and ranches to protest the new law.

Then came the Cardenista CCI to drum up tens of thousands of protestors, summoning everyone in their ranks and bringing out each individual who hated Nava Castillo out of their homes. Even the neighboring state of Tlaxcala joined in the madness, as residents rose against their own Pasteurization Act.\n\nSociety has essentially broken the hourglass of development, halting anything resembling it with fists clenched on high.

Each and every single one of them united in One Great March to repeal the law to the State Congress.\n\nAt the eleventh hour the streets were reclaimed by peace and law, the march crushed and the protestors dealt with.

There, they would stay firm on the shoreline.\n\nEach room, each building, each section was fought for with the will of righteousness. Diego hurled his right fist towards the officer. Contact. The baton from his peer hurling down like lightning and- BOOM!\n\nThe fire trucks lept, becoming the true embodiment of their name as the sight of their carcasses halted the baton. A yell came from a different direction, non-students, as their stream splashed against the wave of officers. He could see the ball thrown by the non-students, grenades, as they wreaked havoc with each boom. In turn, the officers ditched their batons and went for their weaponry, and in desperation the Tsunami crashed into the flood wall once more.\n\nEncircled, a pocket of officers retreated into the Carolina Administration building and fought just as the students did, but the wall finally crumbled at the full weight of the movement. Their prize, Colonel Dominguez along with a handful of police officers captured. Hundreds of his peers were arrested, dozens injured or killed, and they were pushed back from what a quick glimpse of the window told him. Now, from protesting, he was a hostage-taker."
 MEX_Puebla.8.a: "Those in the building knew their duty and steeled themselves for their mission."

 MEX_Puebla.9.t: "Step Aside, Ordaz"
 MEX_Puebla.9.desc: "Mateos had high hopes for Ordaz in the past, of course some of it has eroded due to his actions, losing his endorsement for President, but he was still capable of some things. So, when he sent Ordaz to handle the AUP situation, Mateos was woefully surprised at the inadequate handling that did not seem even related to the hard-working nature of Ordaz.\n\nA discussion with Ordaz cleared the clouds, the man was preparing for the transition of power and wasn't capable of juggling both major tasks without neglecting one or the other. So, it forced the hand of Mateos to assign someone else to take up the mantle of the crisis upon him.\n\nUndersecretary Echeverría was the answer, the military approach had clearly failed, with the capture of Colonel Dominguez, and what was needed was something forceful but also subtle.\n\nA mix of the DFS and a proper hostage negotiation in the favor of the administration were two things he trusted Echeverría with, along with his promise of bringing the Colonel back alive. His death was something that Mateos could ill-afford."
 MEX_Puebla.9.a: "He won't let the President down, will he?"

 MEX_Puebla.10.t: "The Man Who Can"
 MEX_Puebla.10.desc: "With orders from both Mateos and Ordaz, Undersecretary Echeverría has been sent out to deal with the AUP protest which had quickly devolved to a glorified hostage situation for Colonel Domínguez.\n\nThe previous approach had failed miserably, so using the military was out of the question. All hope now rides on Echeverría and the DFS to settle this matter efficiently, with as few concessions as possible, and quickly, for each day that passes causes the situation to deteriorate.\n\nWith Ordaz giving his outspoken support as president-elect almost immediately after sending Echeverría out, it won't be long until he proves his hostage-negotiation skills and brings back the Colonel from the hands of rioters. Domínguez cannot be allowed to die, at any cost."
 MEX_Puebla.10.a: "He wouldn't disappoint the President, right?"

 MEX_Puebla.11.t: "Counterplay"
 MEX_Puebla.11.desc: "It has been said that one should never allow a good crisis to go to waste, and few familiar with Luis Echeverría are surprised by his acting on such instinct. Quickly arriving in Puebla, the undersecretary wasted no time rallying counter-protest groups alongside Governor Castillo, who spearheaded the public response, allying with the Board of Morality and most of the Puebla state government.\n\nAcross Puebla's streets, far-right counter-protestors are taking to the streets, backed by conservative and business-friendly groups, and numerous reports of violent clashes taking place between them and their opposition among the striking workers and students. For now, the boots on the ground are various locals, but the movement is beginning to see support from the municipal government and state-wide PRI leadership.\n\nCaution is advised; while the counter-protestors may be helpful to us, they are ill-disciplined, and the situation remains delicate. Public support is good; mob violence is not."
 MEX_Puebla.11.a: "Let's hope Echeverría knows what he's doing."

 MEX_Puebla.12.t: "Unwilling"
 MEX_Puebla.12.desc: "In a neutral structure sat envoys of the hostage-takers, the protestors still holding up in the Carolina Administration building, and in front of them sat the federal negotiator; Echeverría.\n\nTheir overall behavior, the water slightly sloshing in the cup from someone's leg bouncing under the table, before trying to be subtle as they gulped down their cup's contents could only be described as cagey.\n\n"Water's been cut off-" One of the envoys spoke up after finishing his cup. "There's more government men coming through, we've seen them through the windows so don't even try to deny it."\n\n"Relax." Echeverría straightened himself in his chair. "I promise that the Federal Government only wishes for the best interest of everyone involved in this... situation."\n\nThe three envoys didn't buy it, he could tell. They would resist too much to be effectively negotiated with, at least at this stage. He could maybe slip a few men into the movement, make it tear itself apart and gain leverage.\n\nOr Echeverría could stall the negotiations, at least until the counter-protestors could be assembled, both gaining leverage and ending the hostage situation if he pulled it off. The choice was his."
 MEX_Puebla.12.a: "Break this resolve from the Inside."
 MEX_Puebla.12.b: "Crack the shell open from the Outside."

 MEX_Puebla.13.t: "The Better Part of Valor"
 MEX_Puebla.13.desc: "Echeverría wasn't sure what he was expecting. The student envoys sent to negotiate were hardly fit to speak in public, let alone make demands, and, hot-headed children they were, their demands were ludicrous. However, his disdain did not change the fact they were still dangerous radicals holding hostages. An outright assault was out of the question, but there was more than one way to break a strike, and two strategies began to form in his mind.\n\nThe first was to weaken their support base, the dairy farmers. The size of the movement would work against it; infiltrating its ranks would be easy for the DFS. From there, it was merely a matter of whispering the right words to the right ears and convincing members to negotiate individually with the government. Shed of the masses for protection, the students would be vulnerable.\n\nAlternatively, there was the option to cripple the student movement from within; convince the less committed and ideological that their situation was hopeless, and turn them against the rest. Once the hostage takers were suitably divided and disorganized, infiltrating the Carolina building would be more than feasible. Clasping his fingers together and closing his eyes, he weighed the risks and possibilities before deciding."
 MEX_Puebla.13.a: "Without the farmers, the students will crumble."
 MEX_Puebla.13.b: "Let's see how united these Marxist brats really are."

 MEX_Puebla.14.t: "Infection"
 MEX_Puebla.14.desc: "Each protester marched onwards; Down with the act! Down with Castillo! Each day brought more dairy farmers to the streets, more men to muster against the boot of the corrupt overlord. Each march was made up mostly of these same farmers, stop the farmers, and you stop the anarchy that plagued the same streets they marched. It would be more than enough to cause the students to cower back into their universities, and the hostages would be safe.\n\nEcheverría knows that this is the way to go; to slip in DFS agents amidst the dairy farmers and effectively steer them towards the government, away from the streets. It wouldn't be at all difficult to do so, the movement was overflowing with them already, who would suspect a few more?\n\nHe knows the agents will do well; convincing the farmers to negotiate separately from the students is the only difficulty they'll encounter, but after that it would only be the work of time remaining."
 MEX_Puebla.14.a: "The cancer implanted, all it must do is spread."

 MEX_Puebla.15.t: "Skin"
 MEX_Puebla.15.desc: "Amnesty.\n\nA spell of sorts, once uttered, the rejections fell mute, and finally their brains started to think. The leaders who would pull out of their protests, the leaders that would stop casting anarchy with each riot, would earn the sacred second chance, as if they had done nothing wrong all this time.\n\nEach leader who agreed to stop aiding the 'insurgents' caused a domino effect within that Puebla chamber they congregated in. With one more faction capitulating, rage from all different types of groups who were also in attendance. Cowardice was the usual cry, if one leader accepted the deal, why shouldn't they save their own skins as well?\n\nA grin inwardly spread for Echeverría, less than half an hour later the negotiation was hammered out between the leadership and Government, and that was that."
 MEX_Puebla.15.a: "Once spread, cancer drains the energy of cells, leaving them to die of their own accord."

 MEX_Puebla.16.t: "Give Them an Inch"
 MEX_Puebla.16.desc: "A headache, Echeverría understood now why each time it had plagued His Excellency he had to compose himself and grab a glass of water. Apparently, the dairy farmers had developed a conscience where they thought to demand more than he had already given them, that their social power was working.\n\nHe had already gone so far that he couldn't turn back, and now they're demanding something to ensure their socioeconomic well-being. Just one more step, and he could finally put an end to this madness, but which way to go?\n\nHe could be mild, while less appealing at the moment for the farmers, and release the political prisoners of the movement. This would be easy to do, and much easier to convince PRI leadership to do.\n\nOr he could clear up the issues of the movement itself, by offering to repeal the Pasteurization Act. Their protests would halt almost immediately after, but Governor Castillo would be infuriated.\n\nOne more step. One more step would be all that was needed to stop this whole mess."
 MEX_Puebla.16.a: "Give them the mile; repeal the Pasteurization Act."
 MEX_Puebla.16.b: "Release the prisoners, it will be enough."

 MEX_Puebla.17.t: "The Cauterisation of De-Pasteurisation"
 MEX_Puebla.17.desc: "The "recommendation" issued by Echeverría to repeal the pasteurisation law was rapidly converted into a bill. Then it ran into trouble.\n\nMany of the state congressmen supported the measure for a variety of reasons, forming an unsteady coalition. But Governor Nava Castillo and the local military leadership—many of whom were Castillo's former colleagues—ferociously opposed it, spitting nails and hurling diatribes against it at every chance they got.\n\nThe result was one of the closest approximations of democracy ever experienced in Mexico since the manifestation of Mexico as a concept. There was genuine, sincere debate in the state legislature, relatively honest competition (and honest distribution of brown and in some interesting cases red envelopes). This held up Echeverría's project long enough for a death knell to sound.\n\nEcheverría heard said funeral bells in a tinny recording of the President being asked about the proposed bill in an unrelated interview. López Mateos did not spend an instant even thinking about it, as Echeverría might have hoped he'd have done. No, he simply made his views clear: "The very suggestion is ridiculous. It amounts to a retrogression to pre-revolutionary norms of substandard food in order to please reactionary farmers. If I was in that congress, I would vote no a thousand times over."\n\nLópez Mateos' words in fact amounted to a thousand no votes. Since the Mexican state was based on the principles of the Institutional Revolution, no one dared to challenge the head of the state and Party once he had made his opinion clear.\n\nThus the bill failed."
 MEX_Puebla.17.a: "Nought's had, all's spent..."

 MEX_Puebla.18.t: "Wrath"
 MEX_Puebla.18.desc: "How did this happen? It should've never gotten here, and Mateos shouldn't have opposed the pasteurization repeal yet it had and he had. All the Undersecretary's plans had come crashing down. 'Now what?' was the thought that dominated Echeverría's mind. The farmers realized he couldn't actually deliver on the promises and now they're back on the protest track, so he's back at square one.\n\nActually, they're even angrier if their numbers and how many officers were injured during their last 'protest' say anything. This was it. Genuinely. He had expended his resources and now there was nothing left but to act.\n\nIf he gets the Special Commandos to clear the building quickly enough he can still salvage this, as long as they get to the Colonel it'll all be fine. It'll all be fine."
 MEX_Puebla.18.a: "It'll all be fine."

 MEX_Puebla.19.t: "The Deluge"
 MEX_Puebla.19.desc: "The briefing had made it seem so easy. The students were poorly armed, disorganized, and unprepared, and they would crumble minutes into a real fight. Emmanuel and his fellow commandos were better equipped and better trained. All they had to do was hit hard, move fast, and get to the hostages before someone did something stupid. It was supposed to be perfect; maybe that's why it never could have worked.\n\nThe protestors had seen it coming, probably before Emmanuel did. It would explain all the barricades, the ambushes, and the firefights. Ducking behind a corner while someone took potshots at him, he wondered when they figured out what was happening; was it when the negotiations first began to stall or when they fell apart? The screams across the Carolina building were almost loud enough to drown out the gunfire, but he knew his enemy was out of ammo when the bullets stopped flying past him. When he swung out past the corner, his iron sights fixed on a trembling boy, who couldn't have been older than seventeen, holding a depleted pistol. A short burst of fire sent the kid to the ground.\n\nAnother scream joined in the building's chorus; a young woman emerged from an open doorway and crawled toward the boy, and desperately placed her hands on his wounds. She did not notice Emmanuel's approach until he stood over her and put a boot on the discarded pistol. For a moment, their eyes locked before she turned away and kept trying, hopelessly, to stem the boy's blood loss. Emannuel's adrenaline faded into a frigid numbness, and as the blood pooled around him, he could only just barely register the voices coming from his radio."
 MEX_Puebla.19.a: "Colonel and hostages located. Deceased."
 MEX_Puebla.19.tt:0 "§RThe bloodshed at Carolina is but a prelude.§!"

 MEX_Puebla.20.t: "Murphy's Curse"
 MEX_Puebla.20.desc: "It could only go downwards after the tragedy that befell us. The pressure was enough to make diamonds as it pressed down on Governor Castillo, or rather, former Governor. As of this morning, at nine AM, Castillo, who had realized that all he has managed to do is turn the situation into a tornado of misery, announced his resignation publicly.\n\nIt stemmed the tide, the protests that were specifically against him died down rapidly. But nothing could save Echeverría from the utter embarrassment he suffered from the fiasco, Mateos, Ordaz, the PRI itself would be heavily disappointed.\n\nHe salvaged what he could, ordering one last crackdown and an expansion in pasteurization to appease the few that were still on the fence. At the bedrock minimum, the crisis was finally over, and the experience gained from this venture could be used in other avenues in the future."
 MEX_Puebla.20.a: "All learn from mistakes, except those who fell to them."

 MEX_Puebla.21.t: "It Was Just Misunderstood"
 MEX_Puebla.21.desc: "Another part in winning over the dairy farmers is to actually deal with the problems that caused them to flood the streets. Echeverría came to a realization shortly after. It wasn't that the Pasteurization Act was bad but that the conditions surrounding it were.\n\nThey were protesting because of corruption, of a monopoly choking out competition and the small dairy farmers along with it. To rectify this, funds would be utilized to establish new pasteurization plants, owned collectively by the farmers instead of Castillo.\n\nEcheverría isn't naive - he knows this will cause Castillo to lash out, along with those who were profiting from the monopoly in the first place. Let them try when the results will speak for themselves, when the Colonel and the rest of the hostages thank the government for their intervention."
 MEX_Puebla.21.a: "Plus, Echeverría thought, he wasn't weak enough to be cowered by his enemies."

 MEX_Puebla.22.t: "A Strongly Worded Letter"
 MEX_Puebla.22.desc: "Dear Undersecretary Luis Echeverría Álvarez,\n\nDuring the Revolution, it was common for groups to splinter due to minor differences among them, fueling the chaos of the time. It was common, some forty years ago, for ally to backstab ally, for the cycle of violence to continue as the crisis inside Mexico deepened. It was near omni-present during that era.\n\nForty years later, you have looked back into those dark days and decided to bring with you that very dagger. You have not only caused me undue stress, you have hampered the ability of the PRI to regulate the economy of Puebla. You, who are on the side of the PRI, listened to the rioters and rowdy agitators, giving them power. Power they will surely utilize.\n\nI am already in contact with other governors, who abhor this most recent action to destabilize Mexico, and other members of the Party who feel the same way. This is your personal recommendation to halt funding for the new pasteurization plants, to stop this misstep from having disastrous aftereffects.\n\nSincerely,"
 MEX_Puebla.22.a: "Governor Antonio Nava Castillo"

 MEX_Puebla.23.t: "Fizzle"
 MEX_Puebla.23.desc: "It was negligible at first, just the margin of error for how many would show up at the next protest. It was negligible again the next day, but in a week half of the farmers rallying returned back to their posts. Order breached against the surface tension, gasping its first breath ever since the beginning of the crisis. The fractures became more apparent, and more people returned back home as officers prowled the streets once more.\n\nIn Carolina, the pinch was felt. The protests stopped and the soldiers drew closer, the Carolina Administration Building defenses were bound to fall, forcing those inside to come to the table. Their hopelessness dominated the meeting, extracting the bare minimum of starting anew in exchange for the hostages. The deal was finished at midnight and they did not dare to look back.\n\nThe sun licked the horizon as the plane lifted off towards Cuba. Those who escaped looked through the windows, their homeland fleeting as it clashed against the shores of neutral water. The flames in their hearts forever extinguished..."
 MEX_Puebla.23.a: "...As they flew into the rising sun."

 MEX_Puebla.24.t: "Little Victories"
 MEX_Puebla.24.desc: "On paper, the end of the Carolina Hostage Crisis was a significant victory for the ambitious and clever Secretary Echeverría. After all, did he not end months of turmoil, save the lives of several hostages, and restore order to Puebla? Of course!\n\nBut at what cost? As further investigation into the handling of the crisis continues, it becomes clear that numerous missteps and setbacks were made, and each one reflects poorly on Puebla's "savior." Although the man still retains the benefit of the doubt on some matters, on account of the mountain of troubles he had to resolve, his handling of Governor Castillo is not one of them.\n\nIf there could have been a loser in the wake of the Carolina Crisis, few would dispute that Governor Novo Castillo was it. Left humiliated by the crisis and repeatedly undermined by Echeverría in public during its chaos, the now-former governor resigned shortly after the crisis ended. The fallout of his downfall has left many among Puebla's business and state interests against the federal government, an outcome that benefits no one. All in all, Echeverría will be under heavy scrutiny for years to come."
 MEX_Puebla.24.a: "At least it's over."

 MEX_Puebla.25.t: "Heat Trap"
 MEX_Puebla.25.desc: "The Carolina administration building was hot even late into the night. Some combination of construction and controlled heating left the building a sauna despite the relatively cool air surrounding it. Outside, the situation was heating up just as much. The police circled the entrenched students as the situation at AUP escalated with each passing hour. Hostages and students alike were crammed into the many small rooms. This building wasn't built for a siege, but few were. It was a loose net; Echeverría's agents could easily infiltrate.\n\n"You got a light?" One student protestor was trying his best to catch a breeze out of a stiff window when another approached him. He pulled a box of cigarettes out of his clean shirt's pocket. Only two cigarettes were left in the package.n\n"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," the sweating man said sardonically as he lit both cigarettes. He drew a hot cloud; the longer he held out, the hotter he became. He released it out the window before speaking again. "Thanks, friend. Say I don't recognize you."\n\n"We've probably passed each other a million times by now. I'm Esteban," the generous man responded coolly. "I've been walking the same circuit over and over again. No point, I say. What the hell are we supposed to do against armored police? Nice shoes, by the way."\n\n"Thanks." The shoes were nice, trendy, and expensive compared to the other man's black tactical shoes. "I understand what you mean. But we're sweating it out here for a reason, right?"\n\n"I guess." Esteban rubbed his short hair and tossed his finished cigarette out the window where the embers could smolder into nothing. "All I'm saying is that I could climb out that window and be home listening to the radio in bed in an hour.""
 MEX_Puebla.25.a: ""Well when you put it that way...""

 MEX_Puebla.27.t: "Did You Hear?"
 MEX_Puebla.27.desc: ""Did you hear?" One student whispered to another when all the others were turned away. "Did you hear about Juan? He had his leg broken when it all went sideways. A cop just slammed it with his baton and dragged him away like some butchered animal."\n\n"Did you hear?" a young woman asks her friends in the bathroom of the embattled administrative building. The government forces cut off the water a long time ago, so there was no point in hiding behind stalls. "Did you hear about the negotiations? There was a setback, and the police are preparing to strike."\n\nDid you hear?" A man, older than most of the protesters, flagged down a new colleague. He took him to a quiet corner. He wanted to avoid the stares of his comrades, not for secrecy but because of shame. They were strong, they were committed. He just wanted to go home. "Esteban, did you hear? People are saying that the government is going to send spies to infiltrate the movement. What are we supposed to do?"\n\nEsteban wrapped his arm around the shoulders of the panicking man. Little did he know that he was absolutely right. Echeverría had already sent spies into the building. They had already integrated with the radicals. In fact, Esteban was one such government agent. He jostled the man's shoulder "My friend...""
 MEX_Puebla.27.a: ""Don't believe everything that you hear.""

 MEX_Puebla.28.t: "How Tight a Knot"
 MEX_Puebla.28.desc: "In the mobile headquarters of the AUP hostage situation response team, Echeverría was stuck between a suit and a uniform. The situation within the Carolina administration building had slowly progressed in the government's favor but not fast enough. As the student morale lowered, police forces and the army tightened the boundary around the protestors and their hostages. The perimeter had not been perfect, as there was plenty of space for the less fanatical protestors to disperse or flee. Government forces crept outside the windows of the student bastion, just close enough for the besieged to see them.\n\n"We can't just let these radicals escape." The uniform urged. The local army commander was gripping the flimsy table tightly. If he held onto the splintering wood hard enough, he might have burst a blood vessel. Across campus, other small pockets of resistance had already been neutralized on his urging. "They have shown their weakness already. We have to double down. Those subversives know they are doomed; we just have to tighten the noose until they run out of air. No more buffer zone. We occupy the campus and surround the building properly!"\n\n"We must focus on saving the hostages, sir. That is how this crisis ends." The suit responded. A habitual campaigner, Echeverría's other advisor only cared about the next day's headlines. He loosened the tie around his neck, dabbing any residual sweat. "Their numbers are already thinning. If we give them just enough space, then the knot will untie on its own. Establish a path of least resistance, and they will surrender in droves. With such leverage, we can still settle this peacefully."\n\n"Damn it, then who will be left to be arrested." The commander almost pounded the table before Echeverría shot him a dirty look. He adjusted his tight uniform before proceeding again. "What I mean, sir, is that punishment must be met out. But the choice is up to you, sir.""
 MEX_Puebla.28.a: "There will be plenty of punishment when the time comes. For now, give the protestors space."

 MEX_Puebla.30.t: "Encirclement"
 MEX_Puebla.30.desc: ""We've been forced back. Those jackbooted bastards were too much for us to resist."\n\nSo spoke the least wounded of the protestors that had, until very recently, been outside of the Carolina campus. By now the mood inside was not conducive to the success of the movement for whom it served as a headquarters. The leaders were clear-eyed about what was to come next. "We know they're going to push another attack. Get themselves a second success to crown their first two victories. It doesn't help that we're short on supplies."\n\n"So what'd you have us do?"\n\n"Send out another group of negotiators. We'll try a Hail Mary tactic, try to get us some more supplies while we think about what comes next."\n\nThe negotiators went out. Meanwhile a dispute began to break out between two camps of people—leftist student activists versus those who were merely out to protest infringements on university autonomy and the increasing military control over Puebla. It all started when one leader argued, "Look here. It's all futile, with those soldiers outside. Aren't we better off just giving in?"\n\nAnother leader's fist slammed on the table. "No, you fucking traitors! Surrender to them? What, so we can all get thrown in prison? No, we need to keep on resisting—we should get supplies! Nothing else!"\n\nTold of the ongoing dispute in a command post not far from the perimeter, Echeverría smirked."
 MEX_Puebla.30.a: "The noose tightens."

 MEX_Puebla.31.t: "Release"
 MEX_Puebla.31.desc: "Tensions heightened. Pulses quickened. The protestors could no longer tell what was real and what was fake. When a DFS agent entered the Carolina building under the pretense of delivering supplies, he met with no resistance. The people manning the gate were too busy shooting angry looks at each other to question his identity.\n\nThe agent unloaded the supplies. They were genuine articles—no poison or "special" substances this time—but that was not why the man was present. No, he was looking for the sort of people that were most on edge and could cause the most problems if further set off.\n\nHe was all things to all men. To one protestor, he spoke of brutalization of the man's comrades outside; to another, he spoke of Echeverría promising lenient treatment. To one leader he told horror stories about synarchists joining the government forces; to another, he said that socialist revolutionaries were waiting to help the protestors breaking out.\n\nUnsubtle lies of this nature would've gotten the DFS man shot dead in a more competent environment, but he knew his marks. With how confused and nearly riotous the people here were, anything at all was believable. As he left, he heard shouting.\n\nFive hours later, Echeverría himself shook the agent's hand, clapped him on the back, and told him what had happened. The tensions the agent had set off had escalated into an all-out brawl. The military forces waiting outside then swept in, arrested the protesters, and liberated the hostages."

At this time, the military has no plans of advancing any further into the campus and is satisfied to hold the line where it is.\n\nThere remained the possibility that sympathizers, such as friendly smugglers, might attempt to intrude upon the grounds of the University in order to provide supplies or other reinforcement to the protestors. Were this to continue unabated, then the blockade might become useless and the protestors may be emboldened to engage in full-on violent treason against the Mexican state.\n\nIn order to forestall this possibility, the Army detachment maintained a small corridor clear of all obstructions between the "Carolina" administrative building and the protestors.

He had been informed of what was going on in Puebla, and he did not like what he was seeing in Echeverría's plans.\n\n"Licenciado, the methods that were previously proposed, these negotiation tactics and suggested provocations, they are inopportune. During my tenure as president there has been more than enough bloodshed and suffering, and though it was necessary for us to do as we did that does not mean I either do not regret it or would acquiesce to yet more of it. I hope you understand that."\n\nEcheverría nodded. "Very well, then, Your Excellency—permit me to go over the new plans, then. Why don't we have you visit them? We can capitalise on their increasing weakness, maybe collapse their will to fight."\n\n"Me, Licenciado? I am not opposed, not at all really. It helps with the migraine, haranguing people like that. But are we sure it is wise?"\n\n"Yes, Your Excellency. We could send you in to meet with the protestors and the staff. Tour the campus, leverage your charm to put pressure on the students to see sense and surrender."\n\nLópez Mateos sighed and finished his last cup of coffee. The President massaged his temples, then made a decision."

The army had to sweep in to rescue the President.\n\nThe result was a manifestation of violence that went down in the history books. As the protestors continued to scream against the PRI and the Mexican government, cursing out nine degrees of López Mateos' kindred, the army entered recklessly into the administrative building to free both president and hostages.\n\nScreams of pain and shouts of confusion ruled the scenario that unfolded. The result was a President paralyzed by migraines for the next thirty-six hours and a hallway painted red with blood from deceased protestors, soldiers, and hostages.\n\nAdolfo López Mateos never discussed Puebla again."

The hostages were out by sundown.\n\n"Those students involved in protests, they can put themselves to use helping Fidel Castro's government in Cuba. Be a better place for them to engage in revolutions than in an autonomous university here in Mexico, won't it?"\n\nHearing that remark, Echeverría smirked. "Yes, that'll be brilliant." All that was left was working that out with Havana—child's play compared to suppressing a full-on riot at a university.\n\nThe President's motorcade, including in it a bus with the hostages being returned to their families elsewhere in Mexico, left Puebla to cheers and shouts of approval.\n\nUntil his death, Adolfo López Mateos regarded the success of Puebla as one of his greatest works, even if compared against the countless other successes of his life."

Were he to do such a thing, the PR consequences of the resulting public bloodbath that would result would outweigh any law and order benefit that it could bring about.\n\nEcheverría moved soundlessly, pacing back and forth in his office as his mind whirled with possible strategies. If he... yes, that could be sound.\n\n"If I stall negotiations long enough, that could be useful. Get further support for the Government's side of things. Get more of these counter-protestors to surround Carolina while our forces entrench and reinforce themselves."\n\nA smirk crossed his face.\n\n"Yes, that would be very good, wouldn't it?

 MEX_Puebla.39.desc: ""Go on then! Get on with it! We've a rabble to rouse, get it?"\n\nWeapons and knives clattered on the ground of a changeroom commandeered by the Mexican military. Civilian clothes were pulled out of suitcases and duffel bags, to replace uniforms taken off and folded up with military precision.\n\nThe disguised soldiers put away their weapons and were given blunt instruments. Some received brooms, others broken-off pieces of wood, and a few were given hammers. Whatever blunt object could be found was pressed into the hands of a soldier.\n\nThey did not board the usual military truck. Instead they boarded taxis and cars and drove them as close to the counter-protests outside of the Carolina Building as they could get. Ditching their usual military discipline, they limbered up and charged into the counter-protests.\n\nTheir mission was simple—to create chaos, inciting violence and create a riot to the best of their ability. Making as much noise as possible, they riled up their "fellows" while provoking the students opposite them to the best of their ability.\n\nAs the sun lowered in the sky, violence increased. The soldiers were able to protect themselves; meanwhile, protestors and counter-protestors were less fortunate. It all played out as the plan envisioned."

The people that complained to that effect would usually have food shoved at them.\n\n"Chin up, at least someone was able to smuggle us food and water. We won't starve." The original speaker would chew on the food and be satiated, but would rarely feel any better. The mood was somber, and the negotiations were yielding nothing. A conclusion was at last reached.\n\n"It's time, then," the protestors said. "Write out the next demand and send it to Echeverría. Here's hoping it actually works." So they wrote:\n\n"We are dissatisfied with the behavior of Licenciado Luís Echeverría Álvarez. Whereas we have made every effort to constructively discuss the issues at hand with him, he constantly demands new permits and new consultations despite being in the upper echelons of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. We require new assurances. We therefore demand that the President or President-elect come to the campus to speak to us on national television."\n\nThe letter was folded up and given to the usual couriers.

 MEX_Puebla.41.desc: ""This—this is not a good idea. Not at all," Echeverría murmured, looking at the letter containing the latest demands from the protestors. He stared out the window, contemplating branches shaking slightly under a wind, and felt a slight kinship with them.\n\n"My, how I am sick of these little nuisances. It's all so tiresome, dealing with them. Meanwhile the whole area surrounding the Carolina Building is in chaos. But..."\n\nEcheverría trailed off, realizing the lack of other compelling choices. The observation he had made earlier about brute-force crackdowns and entering the grounds with the army ordered to fire at will being a PR nightmare and generally useless was still true.\n\n"Perhaps we need to move things along quicker. I could ask the President over. His Excellency could leverage his popularity. Or we could ask the President-elect to go in for it, to build his own image and strengthen rapport with the student population. Equally, I and Governor Castillo could just go in ourselves." Echeverría pinched his brow and sighed. "This isn't easy. I can see arguments on both sides for all of these."\n\nAt last, after pacing back and forth in the office for what must have been the thirtieth time that evening, Echeverría reached a conclusion."

 MEX_Puebla.42.desc: ""I knew it, God damn it, I knew it! I knew it was a bad idea." Were Echeverría more emotive than he actually was, this would be the sort of thing he would be saying.\n\nRight now as the President of the United Mexican States was beleaguered at the BUAP, a more volatile version of Echeverría might have hurt his hand slamming the table in his anger and worry. Instead, he remained on the radio with López Mateos and his security detail. "Your Excellency! Please inform me on what is going on over there."\n\n"It's abject chaos, Echeverría! Those national Catholics or whoever the hell they are, the counter-protestors, they've turned hostile and are now rioting across the entire campus! The security detail is telling me that some of them are even armed, though gunfire is still limited. I tell you, it's madness over here!"\n\nEcheverría shook a little. He should've known better than to have soldiers be sent in to rile those clericalists up.\n\n"What do you conclude, Your Excellency? What should we do?"\n\nThe sigh in response was clearly audible, even over the crackling radio. "I can't risk this, Echeverría. I need to get out of here. Agh, my head is killing me!"\n\nBowing his head in defeat and resisting the urge to sigh, Echeverría agreed."

It did not work.\n\nAs had been the case throughout his life, people found Ordaz unprepossessing. He wasn't even able to talk to too many protesters but the few that did mocked him. Some jeered at his looks, making comparisons to farm animals. The voice of one particularly imaginative protester hiding behind a hallway corner—the coward—insinuated that even Hirohito looked better than him.\n\nOthers called him a fascist, a gringo-lover, and a reactionary. Years later, when all was said and done, Ordaz would laugh about being called a German puppet, a Japanese puppet, and an American puppet by successive protesters. But all the while\n\n"chaos umpire sat,\n   and by decision more embroiled the fray\no'er which he reigned;"\n\nand Ordaz's paranoia grew.

It did not work.\n\nAnyone at all else might have been able to pull it off. Perhaps Echeverría on his own might also have been fine. But the both of them only attracted contempt from the protestors, hearing fifteen different variants of "fuck off", "resign", and "go to hell" within about three minutes.\n\nWhen Castillo attempted to speak, things got worse. The protesters began to hurl stones, bottles, and brickbats, which led the counter-protesters to engage with the exact same thrown back at them. Needless to say, the result was a riot that ran the risk of catching the government delegation in its crossfire. As the DFS, police, and armed forces formed a third faction in the nascent brawl, Echeverría and Castillo had no choice but to retreat immediately.\n\n"God damn it, Echeverría, what have we done?"

If there had been scorn, Echeverría might have started to shout; if, worse yet, there had been pity, he might have thrown something.\n\nAs well he might have.

MEX_GPG.1.t:0 "Report on Continuing GPG Mobilization"
MEX_GPG.1.desc:0 "DIRECCIÓN FEDERAL DE SEGURIDAD\nISSUE: Organization of GPG in Northwest Chihuahua\nTO: Commander Gutiérrez Barrios\nYesterday, a group of soldiers from the Fifth Military Zone who were on patrol in the municipality of Madera were ambushed by paramilitaries believed to be from the Grupo Popular Guerrillero (GPG). Despite light casualties of three wounded, a considerable amount of equipment was stolen from them, including weaponry and a radio.\n\nWhile it has been known for several months the group was leaning in a more militaristic direction, this attack has marked a worrying change in tactics for the organization. Previously, the terrorists had contented themselves with small scale robberies and attacks on landowners and prominent locals. However, since leader Arturo Gámiz García declared he would cease non-violent activity to bring about a socialist state, the GPG has transformed itself from a paramilitary wing into a guerilla army, recruiting followers and arming them. A source indicates some of their elements have begun taking to the Sierra Tarahumara to train and hide weapons.\n\nThe local authorities are already worried about this trend, fearing the GPG could begin targeting officials on the state and federal level soon. My team and I share their concerns. It is my informed belief that allowing the GPG to continue down this path could turn them into a real threat judging from recent experiences with Cuban and Paraguayan guerrillas, as they could destabilize the region severely and threaten order. We have already begun several operations with the aim of infiltrating, gathering intelligence,and eventually breaking apart the organization in the near future.\n\nVery respectfully,\nThe Internal Security Director in Chihuahua\nCaptain Marco Arenas."

MEX_GPG.2.desc:0 "Arturo Gámiz trudged up the dusty mountain path towards his new home. Neither train nor bus came anywhere close to the small village of Mineral de Dolores, nestled in the arid mountains of Chihuahua. By now, he had spent several days, first with his brother, then alone, hiking through ill-maintained dirt roads, stopping to rest in the tiny settlements which dotted his path, if he chanced to come upon them.\n\nIf they were anything like his destination, it was not an encouraging sight. Small fields of maize and wheat encircled shacks of rotting wood and thatch, held together with the occasional piece of rusted sheet metal. Even the churches were run-down, with stained walls and cracked roofs. The people were pleased to welcome a passing schoolteacher into their homes, but not until they learned that was what Arturo was. All the villages expected a different kind of outsider to come knocking. One they were none too pleased to meet.\n\nIt was around noon as the pines and warbling of birds gave way to the chalky brown clearing in which Dolores was nestled. It appeared very much a repeat of all the previous settlements, barring the relatively large schoolhouse, which provided accommodation for teachers as well as classroom space. A weatherbeaten old man leaned against a post near the village's entrance sign, moving forward as he saw Arturo approach.\n\n"Don't see a lot of youngsters coming through here," he said. "Mostly they just pack up and leave for Madera or Juarez. I guess you're the new teacher. Mr. Gámiz, was it?" He outstretched his hand.\n\n"That's me," said Arturo. "I hope to be staying here for a while."\n\n"I hope you do too.""

"But the country was ruined, so we couldn't pay them."\n\n"Well done, Carlito! Can anyone name another-"\n\n"Just like us, then. We can't pay them either." The voice came from Raúl, normally a very quiet student. Arturo stopped. When he came to Dolores, all the villages expected someone else. A debt collector, perhaps?\n\n"Hold on a second? Who's 'them'?"\n\n"The men from outside. Maybe you haven't seen them yet. We don't owe them money, but they say we do. Sometimes they beat people. Papa says they want to build a mine here, but can't until we all leave."\n\nOh. So that was who all the nearby villages expected when Arturo was passing through. Not good. Not good at all. But perhaps something to rally around. "Well, that's certainly a problem. But, consider this. Some of you may have read ahead. Can anyone tell me who won the war between Mexico and France?"\n\n"We did," said Angelina.\n\nArturo smiled. "Damn right we did." Then he stopped."

MEX_GPG.4.desc:0 "The golden glow of dawn's light steadily fought against an overwhelming darkness over the Sierra Madre Occidental, casting reflections of heaven's vast wealth over the mountains below. In Dolores, however, the only gold was that generated by solar reflection, and there was almost no wealth to speak of. Under Dolores, however, was possibly a very different question. Yet, the excavation of this potential wealth was antithetical to the continued existence of the village, whose lands were gifted to it in perpetuity. But there were ways of dealing with that.\n\nÁngel and his compatriots approached the barren heap of dirt, the third such town in his week. In a sense he considered himself a travelling salesman. For ore, lumber, cattle, whatever else his clients required, Ángel could, with time, acquire them some prime real estate, free of people, free of problems. An unresolved mystery among thousands in Banrural's books, perhaps, but not one anyone would care to look too thoroughly at. In places where people already lived so close to the edge, little effort would be required to send them packing to someplace more useful, never to return.\n\nAs such, he and his men were rather surprised to find a large crowd standing in front of the village entrance. Those in the rear held banners, stating "General Union of Mexican Workers and Peasants" as well as a handful of trite slogans. Those in the front, however, screaming curses at Ángel's men, held hatchets, hammers and other improvised weapons. He had a shotgun, but only a couple of shells. More for intimidation than a serious fight. He raised it anyway, but they did not back down. After a while, he gave a look to his men, and they backed away slowly.

Three of them, all for just one cow. And in the big cattle farms, there are thousands of cows."\n\n"But why? I can't see my brother anymore because the government said there was no land for him, so he had to move to Juarez. He didn't need three hectares. Why are cows more important than him?"\n\n"They're not, don't ever say that! Nothing is more important than the welfare of ordinary people. It's just that we don't make the government's friends as much money, so they all want us working in factories or in the big company farms."\n\nThe voice of another student came in. "But, Mr. Gámiz, why are we here? They want to build a mine over Dolores, not a cow farm. Wasn't this meant to be a field trip about the Revolution? Why have we walked three days to help out your brother?"\n\n"Pedro!" snapped Arturo. "This is all about the Revolution! This is where the country lay before the Revolution, before the land reform. During the Porfiriato, the backs of the Mexican people were broken, their lands stolen, all to please the industrialists and the Americans. And only through the peasants and workers banding together to oppose them did we gain any kind of respite. So we're not just here to help my brother. We're here to create solidarity, and that is your lesson. This is what was necessary to end the tyranny of yesterday, and what is necessary to stop it today.

A map stood before him, marking out the places where the state government had given the UGOCM to march, the places in which it would march and sit in anyway, and multiple routes towards the train station that would take his delegation back to the closer town of Madera. Road and place names swam around his brain, threatening to spill out. It hadn't helped that after the planning stage had ended, the group's sobriety had been going rapidly downhill.\n\nThe assembled union delegates had devolved into off-key singing of Spanish Civil War songs and a slurred argument over whether Chihuahua did or did not have the worst soccer players in the country, when Jacobo Gámiz walked in, holding a letter.\n\n"Did you hear the news?" he asked, having to repeat himself a couple times over the drunken revelry.\n\n"No, what news?"\n\n"The president's coming to Chihuahua, and he's agreed to meet with us. We might actually get some kind of agreement!"\n\nArturo snorted. "Jacobo, even I'm not that drunk."\n\n"No, look!" He passed over the letter, and sure enough, it had a date, a time, signature, the presidential seal, everything. Travelling Mateos was travelling here, it seems. Maybe something could be worked out.

Oh boy, did he listen. In his finely tailored suit, he looked at them in their overalls, and listened. He kept touching his head strangely, and seemed exhausted. Of pretending, perhaps. But he listened. He even promised to look thoroughly into the matter. And then the meeting was over.\n\nBut his time in the state capital was not. The main group was just opposite the Government Palace, and would continue to voice their demands for a few more hours. Other groups were camped inside the state offices of Banrural, across from City Hall, and in the regional headquarters of various agronomic concerns. He doubted they would be mollified by His Excellency's proclamation to the insolent masses. To disperse now would be what the government wanted, the pressure needed to be maintained-\n\nJust as he emerged from the palace into the searing heat of the Chihuahua sun, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find himself face to face with a trio of police officers, one already brandishing handcuffs, and another saying something about 'unlawful assembly'. He couldn't help but laugh."

Hundreds, mostly students, had been arrested that day in Chihuahua City. They'd been cut loose a couple days later, none the worse for wear. Well, mostly. Bastard thing still stung.\n\nIf any lesson was to be learned from all this, it was that any pretense of the government's commitment to the people, if it ever existed, was dead and gone. 'Left within the constitution', López Mateos' great promise of change, had revealed itself for what it was. A handful of textbooks, nationalised electricity that didn't reach Dolores, in exchange for disappearances, the deprivation of the land from those who worked it, and a baton to the face. He knew the revolutionary potential of the PRI had long been spent, but he had hoped the peasants of Chihuahua might be able to wring just a little more out of it.\n\nNo more. The Mexican Revolution had always been a halfway step, a compromise earned in blood, of which decades of false peace had wrung out gallons more. A true revolution, one final bloodletting, structured along class lines, was needed. The people of Chihuahua, the people of Mexico, would beg for concessions no longer. They would rip power from the PRIistas' gnarled claws, and create a society for workers and peasants to thrive.\n\nOf course, the organization to pursue such lofty goals would need a name. After a while, and a good deal of arguing, the now-revolutionaries were able to decide what friends and enemies alike would call them."

The figures wore dark masks, barely distinct against the cloak of conifers, blackened by the night. How long had it been now, since he was dragged off the lonely serrano path into the forest?\n\nAnother fist. "Tell us who you work for, and you may live!" called one of Ángel's assailants.\n\n"Fuck you!"\n\n"Wrong answer." A foot slammed between his legs, sending Ángel to his knees. He spat on the ground.\n\n"How much time can you stay here, commie? Army's looking for you, and when they find you, you're fucking dead!" A chorus of laughter rang around the trees.\n\n"Oh no, are you gonna send your big brother after us, too? We don't have time for this. Alfonso, get the hammer."\n\n"Okay-okay, I'll talk! A bunch of guys pay me! Mostly local landowners, Hernández, Jiménez, others. Also some guys from the cities, I meet them in Madera, I don't know their names-"\n\n"Right, that's enough. Nearest village is a few hours walk from here, so you've got quite the crawl ahead of you. I guess you'll just have to hope they're in a forgiving mood. Now, Alfonso, kindly smash this fucker's knees in."\n\n"B-but I told you what you wanted!""

"You'd think they'd at least send someone to scout ahead."\n\n"I guess that's beyond the kind of person dumb and luckless enough to get drafted," said Jacobo. "By the Virgin, even Jiménez's guys put up a better fight than this, and they had a handful of shells between them."\n\n"Well, I guess even haciendas must pay better than our noble Armed Forces. Could probably spare the poor bastards a couple more bullets, though."\n\n"Ah, but that's where you're wrong, silly Jacobito. Didn't you hear? The hacienda system was disbanded decades ago by our wise and benevolent governing institutions. Since then, our poor, starving landlords have barely been able to afford food, let alone ammo for their hired guns!" Both brothers laughed.\n\n"Still, the Boy Heroes over there are carrying some pretty fancy equipment. If only the men were worth the guns they carry. Now, what are we going to do with them?"\n\n"Blindfold them and cut them loose, I guess." said Arturo. "They're more useful to us as a public embarrassment than they are dead. Don't want to attract too much heat too soon. Especially since our capabilities have just expanded greatly. Soon, it'll be time for a little more... ambition.""

"I get that youthful enthusiasm's only going to get us so far, but all it's going to take is him disappearing over a couple hills, and then we'll have a whole platoon up our ass."\n\n"Look, the Mexico City cadre said this guy was legit," said Arturo. "And if they trust him, I trust him. Besides, he's not in the Army anymore. Dishonorable discharge or something like that. In any case, who else is going to pay them?"\n\n"We're paying him? I thought we didn't have access to UGOCM funds anymore."\n\n"Mexico City are."\n\n"Damn, tuition must be cheaper than I thought," grinned Salvador. "Maybe I should change my ways, get an education, make something of myself. Really clean up my act, you know?"\n\n"You'd need a mop and bucket for that, I reckon," said Arturo. "Anyway, are we in agreement for taking this guy on? We don't get access to former Army captains every day. And half our recruits can't figure out which end of the gun bullets come from."\n\nSalvador sighed. "I guess so, but this doesn't sit right with me.""

MEX_GPG.12.desc:0 "Arturo wished he still had access to a blackboard as the cadre huddled around the plans. How were the children of Dolores doing, anyway? One less caudillo, but one less teacher, too. He hoped the sacrifice would be worth it. But worrying about it was pointless now. He'd made his choice, and now was the time to act upon it.\n\n"Comrades, gentlemen," he began. "I can't say it hasn't been fun playing at being Chucho el Roto these past few months, but the time has come for greater deeds. The army may be deployed against us, but little word has spread outside the hills of the Sierra Madre. How can we emulate the successes of the 26th of July Movement if we have no 26th of July of our own? Fortunately, we have found the perfect target for such an operation. In seven days time, the barracks of Madera shall be our own Moncada, and the Sierra Madre shall soon be our Sierra Mastre!"\n\nSome of the guerrillas cheered, but many others remained silent. "But comrade, how are we going to fight a whole garrison? The state's already crawling with soldiers as is. And sure, Moncada was a propaganda victory eventually, but Castro failed to take the barracks, and sixty rebels died. More than the amount of people we have in total."\n\nArturo smiled. "I was hoping you'd ask me that. You see, Castro's mistake was that he started the peasants' war after the raid, where we have done the reverse. As our army friends are a little too busy looking for us to guard their own turf, a little birdie has told me they only have a skeleton crew left inside. Them, and a ton of useful weapons and equipment. Don't worry, comrade, I am not sending us off to die. Now, who's with me?""

MEX_GPG.13.desc:0 "The sun burned through Arturo's eyes as he lay staring into the dawn's sunlight. Compared to the stings and aches in the rest of his inert body, however, it may as well have been a light tingle. Flashes of memory, so close yet so distant, flew through his mind. The decision to attack. The overwhelming cacophony of automatic gunfire. The awful realization that the other two columns were nowhere to be found. The pain. The pain. Oh God, the pain.\n\nThe wisps of smoke and dust still traced an impression of the scene of the battle, if it could be called such a thing. Blackened holes peppered the chalky brown of the mountainside, accented by a coat of fresh crimson. Maybe they'd taken some of the soldiers with them. Maybe. Whatever they'd done here, it would have to be enough. Untold numbers would die in the worker's struggle. Arturo had always known that. No good sending others off to die if you're not willing to do so yourself. Certainly no use in complaining now.\n\nFrom the sounds of soldiers dragging off wounded survivors, Arturo supposed he could only be glad to know the end was coming soon. All the pains he felt now were random, undirected, unlike what awaited those unlucky enough to live. It was all left to those who escaped and those left behind now. He was glad his brother was among the latter. As for his own efforts, it seemed he was no Castro. Whatever infamy this attack generated would have to be enough. As he drifted away from a world of exploitation and lies, away from his surviving comrades, away from the children of Dolores, to the great mystery beyond, he could only hope his efforts were enough."

MEX_GPG.14.desc:0 ""Nobody's coming, Jacóbo," called a voice from across the room. "There's no use in staring out there all day." Jacóbo wondered what use there was in anything else, but he stepped away from the blinds all the same. It was true, nobody was coming. He'd seen enough to be certain of that. Still, he couldn't afford to mope around. He had to move forward. Arturo would want that.\n\nTime had moved as a blur since the massacre. The army had dragged the mutilated bodies through the streets of Madera. More missing, hopefully escaped or dead. Protests broke out in some cities, to be put down, like they always were. The ever-present stench of failure clung to his soul like a vice. His brother was dead, and nothing had been gained. Nothing save for an image of martyrdom.\n\nSomehow, someway, he would have to make it count. But nothing would be coming soon. He'd seen the transformations outside his Chihuahua City window. Waves of protestors, waves of police, some knocking, some hiding, all passed now. Now, an endless mill of people, being eased day by day into the pot. He had to stop it, he had to bring this grinding wheel to a halt. But how?\n\nThe people left were a skeleton crew even by the standards of immediately after the massacre. Most had fled down south, away from where they expected the military and DFS to find them. But Jacóbo and a few remained in the north. Until something major came along to change his mind, the struggle would continue. It wasn't like he could go back to being a teacher now, after all."

MEX_GPG.16.desc: ""Cuba's revolution will be our military model," Arturo Gámiz said, an authoritative teacher with a dog-eared copy of Guervara's 'Guerilla Warfare' as his only textbook. The weather-beaten cabin that was now his schoolhouse was filled with beaten students and bitter peasants. All had learned the harsh lessons of caudillo-controlled Chihuahua.\n\n"We will break into columns, small, disciplined groups that can attack oppressors and vanish before the state's forces arrive in bulk. We evade them in the Sierra until it is time to strike, demonstrating their impotence and that resistance can succeed. By breaking caciques, we free peasants from oppression in the short-term, and build their support and readiness for the true Revolution. Any questions?"\n\nA young veteran, new to the group, stood, introduced himself with a blunt, "Salvador Gaytán" and then continued, "I'd like to volunteer to lead one of these columns. My question is: 'What's our first objective?'"\n\nGámiz gave Gaytán a long, hard look, neither flinching or looking away. Arturo nodded, "The great estates of the Ibarra family are at a boiling point. With a small push, the peasants that labor on their lands would revolt against daily humiliations and countless massacres. That would give a column an opportunity to attack the infrastructure that sustains the Ibarra apparatus. Will you take that opportunity?""
MEX_GPG.16.a: ""Gladly," said Gaytán."

MEX_GPG.17.t: "Hit and Sprint"
MEX_GPG.17.desc: "Salvador Gaytán stayed for only a moment. Just long enough to feel the rush of hot air on his skin, hear the crack of the dynamite. The bridge crumbled into the ravine only in the corner of his eye, because the satchel of explosives was on his back and his legs were pumping down the gravel path.\n\nCharging downhill, he could see the fruits of his sabotage, of Gámiz's propaganda. Thousands of peasants burning Ibarra fields, looting their opulent manors. Good. If his cell could blow one more bridge...\n\nThump, thump, thump, thump went the sound of his legs pounding, uphill now. Panting as he drew closer to the next target. His comrades should already be there. He should have already been there. And then he heard the cracks of rifle fire. And the shouts. And the screams.\n\nTwo Ibarra trucks across the unblown bridge - one in front with a flat tire. Good thinking. Four GPG men who had bought him that time were lying dead, bone fragments and blood smeared across the dirt. Pablo Gómez behind a tree, safe. Where were the others?\n\nWith the loudest battlecry his winded lungs could muster, Salvador threw himself behind a rock. Came up, shot. One thug at the front bumper dropped. Fired again, another yelped, ran. Third time, a bald goon punched through the chest.\n\nAs he crouched to reload, he heard the squeal of the rear truck being thrown into reverse. The Ibarras' men were shouting, hopping aboard or fleeing into the woods. Salvador shot three more times at vanishing assailants, at murderers of peasants and friends. Then as his head cleared and the remainder of his cell emerged from the trees, he stood, got the sticks of dynamite from his satchel, and got back to work."

MEX_GPG.18.t: "Vengeance"
MEX_GPG.18.desc: "The scars on Rafael's arm, weaving between the goosebumps, had not been those of a coward. Rafael had challenged El Oso to a knife fight, and won. Had cracked plenty of peasant skulls - the Ibarra family did not hire weaklings. Had been ready to shoot as many as needed when Carlos had pulled up outside the bar and told him and Pelón the Ibarra estate was burning.\n\nNow he, Carlos, and eight others were stumbling through the dark woods, jumping at every owl's hoot and broken twig. There was a safehouse on the other side, a hilltop Ibarra residence with a high stone wall and a radio station. Plan was to call for help, then hold there until they got the numbers to break up the rioting peasants. To get payback for Pelón.\n\nAs Rafael's feet started up the slope to the safehouse, his mind went to Pelón's final moments. They roar across the bridge in a truck, peasants taking haphazard shots on them. But these peasants did not run when you shot one. Peasants that cried out, "Captain!" as one dived out of nowhere, pumping lead into Pelón and some other tio. Who were those peasants?\n\nRafael could smell smoke. His tired feet quickened, then broke into a jog. As he crested the hill, breaking the treeline, he could see the flicker of flames engulfing the safehouse. To his left, Carlos shouted something, and Rafael reached for his gun.\n\nWho the hell were these peasants?"
MEX_GPG.18.a: "Salvador Gaytán and the Grupo Popular Guerrillero answered with three bullets to his chest."

MEX_GPG.19.t: "The Che of Chihuahua"
MEX_GPG.19.desc: "In the dancing campfire light, Arturo Gámiz marveled at what Salvador Gaytán's column had become. Teachers' soft hands had grown ridges of calluses, those of peasants' held rifles with the same familiarity they had once handled hoes. A layer of thick dust was their uniform. The faces underneath, glad as they were to see their Grupo Popular Guerrillero comrades after months fighting the Ibarra caudillos, were composed of taut, hard lines. The faces of Revolutionaries.\n\nThey were welcomed with all the fervor and festivities the other GPG cells could muster: backslaps and embraces; hearty helpings of hare, chiles, and beans; and plenty of pulque and tequila. After the first round of cheers and drinks, Arturo managed to pull Salvador aside to a quiet - well, less noisy - corner, motioning to Pablo Gómez and his own brother Jacobo to join them under a mesquite.\n\nArturo smiled, as a teacher to a star pupil, "First, I want to congratulate you. You have struck more blows for the working people of Chihuahua in several months than were dealt in the past thirty years. Secondly, I wanted to ask for your recommendation. From a combat perspective, where should the next blow fall?"\n\nSalvador ripped off a chunk of tortilla, twiddling it between his forefinger and thumb before responding, "We have the guerillas now. And countless more would join us if they could. Don't have the guns to arm them, or enough ammo for even a tenth of Ibarra's goons. Cebadilla police station is the place we can get both." He took a bite.\n\nArturo took a breath. Police would be a step up from Ibarra's typical scum. But if he couldn't trust his foremost commander, wasn't capable of Che's boldness... "You'll avoid a direct firefight? Go in at night?"\n\nGaytán grinned."

Many newcomers have joined us, and Cebadilla's police have, ahem, generously donated their weaponry to the cause of socialist Revolution." Arturo Gámiz's words were met with nervous chuckles and a jackal's howl from across the Durango border.\n\nJacobo stepped forward beside his brother, "But our successes have roused the enemy from their stupor. The Ibarra family have called for the aid of their caudillo compadres, Roberto Jiménez and Emilio Rascon, brutes and oppressors both. They also managed to bring in the 67th Infantry Battalion. We're enough of a threat now that the federales are after us."\n\nAmidst the resulting whispers, Captain Salvador Gaytán stood up, "I've served with the military. And you lot are more than their match. They're well-armed, sure, but the troops aren't allowed to have minds of their own. Otherwise they'd realize what shit they're fighting for. You all can think, have to think - so here's our plan, we attack both groups while they're separated and wandering in the desert. Think you can take them?"\n\nVoices began to call out terrain where such traps could be set, tactics to lure the caudillos or military forces forward without their counterpart. Salvador nodded along for a time before leaving the rest to Arturo and Jacobo. He sought out María, lurking near the fringes of the camp. She nodded as he led her out into the twilight of the desert.\n\n"I need you to take a message back to Cebadilla. Pay my brother a visit, and tell him to get ready. If he won't listen, tell him his career's already over after we hit the police station."\n\nShe laughed as that jackal howled again, "It was over the moment you joined the true Revolution.""

MEX_GPG.21.desc: "The barricade stank of sweat. Sweat of rural police, sweat of townspeople, of the ruffians and thugs the caciques had hired, of the two mighty landowners themselves, Emilio Rascon and Florentino Ibarra. But in this noonday sun, none were sweating more than Salomón, mayor of this small town in Chihuahua as he clambered atop the pile of furniture. María Martínez, pistol in hand, managed to join him. A hundred eyes, ninety glassy with hunger, rested on the duo.\n\n"Cebadilla has always been a poor place, but these days have seen us sink to new depths of desperation. The Grupo Popular Guerrillero have defeated the 67th Infantry Battalion and now sit on the only road out of town. You may ask what hope we have of victory..." Mayor Salomón's voice quavered for a moment.\n\nBut then the voice of Salomón Gaytán rang out true and firm, "But a victory far greater lies within our grasp! Citizens of Cebadilla, the GPG are not our enemy - these men are, the ones who have feasted as you starved, who robbed you, who beat you for years! You who have sworn to protect this town, turn your arms on those who ravage it, not those who have come to save it!"\n\nFifty minds, dulled with exhaustion, whirred. But the hands that moved first were those of María, who loosed a bullet into the arm of Emilio Rascon, shouting, "¡Viva la Revolución!"\n\nAt that signal, all hell broke loose. The GPG columns, led by Salvador Gaytán, began charging toward Cebadilla, firing into the air and whooping. Salomón and María dived for cover as rural police and townsfolk turned on the numerous henchmen of the caudillos. Ibarra turned to flee but was tackled to the ground by an officer. For a moment, blood flowed freely."

MEX_GPG.22.t: "Finishing the Job"
MEX_GPG.22.desc: "The fires of the socialist Revolution provided a fitting backdrop for the trial, thought Arturo Gámiz. The vast plumes of smoke erupting from the Jiménez liquor distillery and manor were joined by countless smaller streams as peasants burned the sheets of debt the caciques had forced on them. After the last caudillo of Cebadilla and his cornered men had surrendered to Salvador Gaytán's column, the peasants had surged straight for those supposed records. Those lies.\n\nThe bounty of the Jiménez cellar endowed the proceedings with a carnivalesque atmosphere - GPG members would take turns swigging tequila and keeping guns trained at the caudillos and their disarmed goons. Rural police turned Revolutionaries would hurl abuse at Ibarra and Rascon between bites of carne asada. A tipsy Jacobo was struggling to contain a broad grin behind the stern mask of Revolutionary justice.\n\n"Emilio Rascon!" barked Mayor Salomón Gaytán, "You are hereby charged with robbery, kidnapping, assault, of the killing of Pepé Martínez, and of exploitation of the good people of Cebadilla. What say the people to these charges?" A resounding cry went up and Arturo nodded. "Convicted, and sentenced to death by firing squad."\n\nJesus Fernández and Pablo Gómez led a shaking Rascon, still clutching his wounded arm, to the side of the distillery. María and an assortment of his former tenants trailed eagerly behind, holding a clutch of borrowed firearms. The ragtag fusillade that followed almost eclipsed Salomón's shout: "

Soon, they would mock him no more.\n\n"It is easy to send soldiers to die, just like you did during your 'Revolution'." Blotches of dark blood sprouted like blackberries amidst the gray, gray dirt of Las Moras. The 52nd Infantry Battalion was scattering after Jacobo lured them into an ambush by Arturo Gámiz and the bulk of the column. But this blood wasn't the soldiers'. It was Jaime's. It was Tomás'. It was María's.\n\n"What is difficult, Governor, is to take up arms..." The boom of the shotgun sounded again. Its companion echoed a second later. First, the flimsy barn wall of Las Aguilas ranch was ripped through, and then Wilfredo was, centimeters away from Salvador Gaytán's left shoulder. The shotguns remained silent thereafter, hit by Pablo Gómez's men from behind the farmhouse. But after a few, wretched gasps, silence claimed Wilfredo as well.\n\n"Come to the Sierra..." The mountains were cool that night. The campfire was quieter, sparser. Arturo, Jacobo, and their comrades drank to two more victories for the GPG, for the socialist Revolution, for the working people of Mexico. But the mezcal tasted like blood in their mouths."

Spraying shrapnel and splinters through their bodies, into Fernández's side. The wound burned with pain as his arms rose in surrender.\n\nThe pliers. The grinning DFS man held them up to Fernández's face. Asked where the other columns were. Ripped off a fingernail. Asked where Arturo Gámiz was. Rip.\n\nThe hammer. Displayed to Fernández in loving detail. Slammed down on his smallest toe as bone became powder. Where was Gámiz. Slam. Where was Gaytán. Slam.\n\nThe rope.

The governors would complain, of course, but Echeverría would shrug it off as always.\n\nIt just so happened that news of GPG activity in Chihuahua had resurfaced, with Governor Giner Durán being unable to suppress the insurgency inside his own state. It was like a gift, just for him, and the last thing he needed to do was present his findings to His Excellency and he'd get his needed approval.\n\nAlas, Madrazo wasn't content with just the reports and news clippings.

He took a step back, threw up a sloppy salute, and cried, "To the heroes of Mexico's socialist Revolution!"\n\nHis brother Arturo laughed, but Salvador Gaytán had no time for such games. "Pigs took most of the guns and ammo with them," he grumbled. But even Gaytán grinned when he heard another round of cheers outside. "But since we liberated the town without firing a shot, I suppose we're still coming out ahead."\n\n"Certainly in terms of recruits!" said Jacobo, before planting a noisy kiss on Madrazo's painted lips. "For every farmer the caciques hang, we gain ten guerillas and a hundred sympathizers."\n\nArturo pounded a paperweight on the chief's old desk. After receiving his comrades' startled eyes, he began, "And that's why it's time to think bigger. Our columns can raid town after town, but they're growing so large that we can scarcely feed them when we convene. Chihuahua is poised to erupt. We need to fan out to its corners, organize, prepare, and rally its people for the mass uprising that will topple this broken government.

While that was being dealt with, the new governor utilized the violence of the caciques during the immediate transition that preceded his appointment to discredit them. The worst offenders were thrown into prison, and the rest quickly learned to quiet down as well.\n\nNow, a docket of progressive legislation was being swiftly worked on with the help of various officials, land reforms making up the core of the upcoming proposals, all to be revealed on September 24th.\n\n"Governor."

A pale shadow to trick us into laying down our arms when at last we have the bastards in our sights! No. We strike first, and give Mexico the socialist Revolution it truly deserves!"\n\nArturo's chest was heaving, and for a moment all he heard was his ragged breath. Then the receiver crackled to life with Gaytán's weary voice, "You're right, Arturo. But there's just no way we'll be ready by the 24th.

Advancing toward the darkened barracks of Madera, where moments before, soldiers had lain sleeping.\n\nThe outnumbered battalion now scrambled, some for their weapons, others for cover. Two desperate privates raised their hands in surrender and charged out the front gate. Orders barked and rifles hefted, but the weak starlight could not hide that they were surrounded.\n\nThen, as at Agua Prieta, the burst of a spotlight made all the difference. A train, rounding the bend, illuminated the ragged farmers by the track. Its piercing whistle cut through their cries. And when its horn ceased, the first sound to arise was "the army is coming!" The second was a rain of gunfire from the base on the panicked peasants. For the few who did not break and run, it became a slaughtering ground.\n\nArturo could see the light, hear the whistle and the gunshots, but he did not stop his charge. How could he? His GPG companions were by his side, Jacobo and Gaytán's rebellions to his north and south, liberation within his grasp. He breached the barracks' gate, and fired and fired and fired again. Troops dropped to sodden ground. As his comrades swept into the barracks, hacking and shooting, Arturo cried, "For the Revolution!"\n\nAnd so did the lieutenant marshaling forces by the command post. The one whose outstretched finger guided the first shot to Arturo's stomach, and the second to his temple.\n\nThe schoolteacher's eyes would not see his proud movement flee into the Sierra.

They parted their circle as he approached, mustachioed Daniel blinking back tears as he handed him a weathered copy of the Herald.\n\n"Army Holds Madera, GPG Leader Killed"\n\nHe didn't read beyond the headline, just excused himself and walked to the nearest cabin. As soon as the door closed, he crumpled to the floor, face awash with tears and throat choking with each gasp.\n\nArturo had been invincible, the Che Chihuahua needed. The revolutionary Mexico needed. The brother Jacobo needed. How could he be taken from them when so many worthless cowards still walked the earth?\n\nJacobo sat, sobbing into his sleeve, as time drifted by. He almost wished- no. No. Gámiz wiped his face, and, clutching the door frame, managed to pull himself back up. The teacher of Dolores was dead, but the teacher of Mexico's true revolutionaries would live forever.\n\nCheeks red and puffy from weeping, Jacobo walked back outside with his head held high. In a hoarse voice, he said, "We have lost dear comrades and brothers, but, dear comrades and brothers, we have not lost. I will fight for the Revolution that Arturo foresaw, that he fought for, until my dying day. May we live to see the inevitable victory of Mexico's working people over their oppressors.

So I had the DFS do some routine surveillance, and this is what they recorded." He pressed the play button.\n\n". . . a Goddamn abomination," came the voice of Governor Duran.

It was covered in photos, mostly candid shots taken from a distance, of Japanese agents and their contacts within the Mexican government. Red strings connected them together, revealing the web spun by America's adversary in its own backyard. The FBI was here to monitor and contain this infiltration, a task it had been entrusted with since the Second World War.\n\nImpressive as the image board was, it was not Winston's greatest accomplishment. The FBI bureau chief was far more proud of the intelligence network he'd been able to assemble. A network reaching to the highest levels of the Mexican government, his baby - LITEMPO.\n\nOver drinks, over envelopes and occasionally briefcases of pesos, Winston had ascended step-by-step up the ranks of Mexico's bureaucracy and security services. When Washington asked a question, he got an answer. When the Mexican government moved, he knew exactly where it was going. And when President Nixon wanted Mateos' mediation proposal quashed, Winston fed Ordaz whatever he needed to hear to make that happen.\n\nYet what should have been his crowning achievement was proving to be a double-edged sword. López Mateos was furious at the FBI for humiliating him on the world stage. Important contacts were suddenly reluctant to pass on information, and the mood in government was growing more hostile to the United States.\n\nWinston's gaze fell upon a specific photo - Major Onodera, the highest-ranking Japanese intelligence officer in the country. Japan's network of informants was small at the moment, yet if given the opportunity they could spread across Mexico, perhaps even into the United States. The political situation was incredibly volatile, but throwing his weight around now would only anger the Mexicans further. All he could do was watch, wait, rebuild his network..."

The trees provided shade in abundance, and Winston had visited the museums and zoo with his son and wife on occasion. Crowds of people milled about, with enough tourists interspersed that the American's presence did not draw any particular attention.\n\nHis eyes came to rest on a younger man, standing, as expected, along the banks of the lake. LITEMPO-1 did not see him approach, instead gazing out over the rowboats in the direction of Los Pinos.\n\nAfter a brief scan told Winston that neither of them were being watched, the FBI chief took a position at LITEMPO-1's side. "Family doing alright?" he asked in fair Spanish.\n\n"We've been better," the man replied, clearly annoyed. "My uncle's in a bit of a bind. That 'tip' you gave him proved to be a load of nonsense, and now that his boss is back in town he's in a whole heap of trouble."\n\nWinston handed over an envelope bulging with pesos, at least three times the usual amount.

He approached wordlessly, and proffered a fat envelope of pesos.\n\nLITEMPO-1 gave a barely perceptible nod and thrust the money into his coat.

It was movie night.\n\nAntonio's stupor was undisturbed by the blare of Mexican accents coming from the romantic comedy. Nor by the chatter of the others, regime insiders whose growing doubts found escape in this oasis, one of the few in the Dominican Republic. These movie nights had been going for a while, volume rising as the whispers turned from gripes to treason. Trujillo had not measured the caliber of foe he made when he publicly shamed Díaz for the general's merciful treatment of Cuban prisoners-of-war.\n\nAnother sip of rum entered Antonio's mouth, clouded his mind. The pang of the ulcers faded. The look of shame on his wife's face after he staggered home from another night of whores faded. The disdain of his best friend El Turco, friend no more, for doing nothing faded. For doing nothing.\n\nFor Antonio had done nothing when they framed Tavito as a murderer and a suicide to cover up the regime's crimes. Antonio had done nothing when they brought him, alone, before Trujillo. Nothing when the Generalissimo's high-pitched voice said he had no role in Tavito's death. Nothing when he had every chance to clasp the Jefe's neck in his hands and choke-\n\nAntonio felt a hand on his shoulder, and turned.

Second Lieutenant García had proposed to her, his love, prepared to have her wit and slender form with him till his dying day.\n\nAnd then, that morning, he had been summoned to an audience with El Jefe. Told, under Trujillo's fearsome gaze, that Luisa's brother was a communist and that he would need to find another woman. Shuddering, he had agreed and filed out.\n\nBefore his tears could pour as heavily as the rain outside, Amado had been whisked away to the headquarters of the Military Intelligence Service, or SIM. There Colonel Johnny Abbes, that bloated toad of a secret police chief, toasted him with whiskey and let him know of his early promotion "for loyalty and service to El Jefe".\n\nBut there was one final test, appropriate for members of El Jefe's personal guard. One Colonel Abbes was driving him toward, piggish eyes fixed on the winding road. To kill a traitor with his own hands, without trembling.\n\nAnd so, the jeep slowed to a halt beside a rocky cliff, and Abbes gestured to get out. From the back, guards pulled a gagged and shoeless young man out and threw him to his knees, facing the black sky and sea. The world slowed. Amado could shoot the guards and - no. Abbes would just kill him and the prisoner. And so, at the Colonel's order, Amado drew his gun, stepped forward, and put a bullet in the back of the traitor's head without trembling.\n\nThe guards threw the body to the sharks, and Abbes took the lieutenant to celebrate his promotion with drinks and whores.

Such had been the appropriate measures when he expected the black Volkswagens of Ciudad Trujillo's caliés to arrive any moment at the Ready-Mix factory.\n\nBut the regime's caliés had not come. And so Tony stepped out of his office, mind brimming with questions. His accomplices in the assassination plot had been seized - they had helped him smuggle dynamite out of the quarries he managed for Trujillo's family. Were they holding out under torture? The young men and women from the June 14th meetings he went to had been arrested. Had they simply forgotten Tony, a quiet man who kept to the back? Now the material evidence of his support for the movement was hidden deep in the quarries, but could he ever be safe again?\n\nNot so long as Trujillo lived. And so, once the semblance of his normal life resumed, once the safety clicked back on and his wife and daughter returned to Ciudad Trujillo, Tony drove to the house of Salvador Estrella Sadhalá, El Turco to his many friends, and confessed everything.\n\nAnd just as Tony had hoped of his best friend, El Turco answered,"

And those sins paled in comparison to the one he had told Father Fortín, the reason why he was here tonight.\n\nThose doubts did not disperse but deepened as he was ushered inside. To calm his nerves as he ascended the stairs to the nuncio's office, he recited the words of the Pastoral Letter under his breath, "Each human being possesses a heritage of prior and higher laws that no state can impede." The letter had called for freedom of speech and press, an end to the anonymous denunciations that poured from El Caribe and relief to the suffering of the many Dominicans whose family members had been arrested in the recent crackdown. It had sparked pride in Salvador to know that the full Church had unified behind the priests who had been surreptitiously aiding the opposition for so long. But the Church had paid a heavy price, as regime slander poured out of the radio and thugs broke into its masses.\n\nThe wizened nuncio greeted him with a smile, and beckoned him to a chair. Softly closing the heavy door, Monsignor Zanini spoke, his soothing tone and Italian accent as an angel's to Salvador's ears, "Father Fortín tells me you are bearing a heavy burden.

MEX_Trujillo_Conspiracy.9.desc:0 "Years in service to Trujillo and knowing the man on a personal level after marrying El Chivo's niece had taught General José René "Pupo" Román Fernandez, Secretary of the Republic's Armed Forces, that the aging tyrant was a man of rigid schedule and habit. It also taught him that any break from this routine should be cause for fear, especially if you were working to bring him down like Román was.\n\nWhich is why when the old man, during his traditional walk across the Malecón of Ciudad Trujillo, suddenly stopped and asked his "beloved" nephew-in-law to take a drive with him, Pupo could feel his blood turn to ice. He wanted to scream, run, hide, fight, but even now, El Jefe's presence, his authority, was too much. The General entered the luxurious car and silently drove with the Goat to what he was sure would be his grave.\n\nInstead, the road took them near to San Isidro Air Force Base, one of the homes of the Generalissimo's proud and beloved air force, before stopping close to a small lake of sewage near the base, the smell nauseating even from in the car. After stepping out of the car with him, Trujillo guided him closer and closer to the waste-filled water before telling him to step inside of it, near the pipe spewing it out. Pupo did so silently.\n\nAfter stepping inside and feeling all the filth wash and splash onto his once pristine uniform, Pupo's face twisted in a mix of nausea and humiliation. The tyrant seemed to be doing all he could not laugh, sneering at his Pupo, lecturing his general on the importance of appearances, downdressing him for the filth seeping into his uniform, and for letting it get so close to his beloved airfield, his eyes betraying the excitement he felt from the power he held over Pupo. And not just him, but an arrangement of officers, who were forced to watch the affair with barely disguised discomfort, unwilling to look away. Pupo knew he was not dying that day, but it did nothing to quell the rage and hatred in his heart. He held onto a single thought."

MEX_Trujillo_Conspiracy.10.desc:0 ""The Goat should have been here by now," snarled Tony Imbert. He sat, both hands behind the wheel of the Biscayne, staring intently along the road to San Cristobal. Twenty minutes and not a single pair of headlights had passed since he last spoke, saying that exact phrase. And as before, a perfectly still Amado replied from the backseat that Trujillo was coming.\n\nFrom the passenger side, Antonio de la Maza lit up a cigarette, "Give it a rest Tony. Modesto Díaz told us he'd be here." And from his perch, de la Maza would have the first shot on him.\n\nDisturbed from sleep, or perhaps from prayer, Salvador answered, "Díaz? He's practically at the center of the government! How -"\n\n"Don't get all high-and-mighty Turco, we've all collaborated," de la Maza cut him off. As an awkward, angry silence lingered, he ashed his cigarette and said, "Imagine how much worse it is for Pedro Livio. Waiting out there alone in that fucking Oldsmobile for hours in the off chance we miss a damn baby blue Toyota."\n\nThat Toyopet Crown cruised on. An aged man slept fitfully in the backseat. He had not needed to sleep so much before, before this war. Before Castro and filthy Communists, the Yanquis and the damn Mexicans started sinking this land back into the chaos and poverty he had raised it from. He felt so old. But the school girl waiting at San Cristobal would make him feel young again, oh yes. He had chosen well tonight, an official's nubile daughter...\n\nHis reveries were disturbed by the blasts of a horn and numerous shouts. Drunken hooligans? No. Old instincts sent his hand to his revolver."

Their motors howled into the night before a fourth fusillade sent the Toyota careening off the road. Imbert hit the brakes and spun hard left in pursuit of their prey.\n\nThe assassins came to a halt on a hillside field, the ravaged Toyota illuminated by high beams mere meters away. Hands clasped shotguns as they rushed out of the car. A burst of automatic fire - from Trujillo? No, his driver. Scattering, they took cover. Bullet holes sprouted across the Chevy, shattered glass spraying. Amado peered around the sedan's front, but pulled back clutching his bleeding knee.\n\nGeneralísimo Rafael Trujillo, Benefactor of the Nation, El Jefe, The Goat, staggered into the light. His shoulder was spattered with blood, but the grip on his revolver was firm. He leaned against the Toyopet, searching for a target. Until Pedro Livio's faded Oldsmobile roared up from behind, a momentary distraction for the dictator and his driver. Tony's Browning boomed and Trujillo's most loyal servant fell, swallowed by darkness.\n\nAntonio de la Maza slid from behind the Biscayne, leveling his own shotgun at Tavito's murderer. Suppressing fire rang out from behind Antonio but the only response was a pained cry from distant Pedro Livio. The dictator's revolver swung to fire on de la Maza, but Antonio shot first. Trujillo's gun hit the ground along with three of his fingers.\n\nThe Goat fell, gasping, as his foes crept to surround him. His remaining hand on the Crown, he sought to haul himself up once more. To affix them with his stare, the one that had held them in check, that held the Republic mesmerized for thirty years.\n\nBut it would no more. For Tavito, for Luisa, for the June 14th, for the Church, four triggers clicked."

After hours, car headlights illuminate him through his window, breaking him from his dark stupor. He exits for the moment of enlightenment. On his drive now sits an idle Chevy Biscayne. Its occupants, Tony Imbert, Antonio de la Maza, and Amadito, are as silent as the night they cut through. Imbert glanced into his rearview mirror and jutted a thumb to the backseat. What Román was looking for is there. He opened the door with trembling hands. Robbed of his glorious raiment and covered in nothing but a bloodstained sheet was the ravaged body of Trujillo. Román stared transfixed at what was once a man. His hands relaxed on the door handle as his face warmed. All the thoughts and fears associated with Trujillo flushed away as the spell of control and submission the dictator held over Román was broken.\n\n"Jobs not done." A second car had pulled into the scene. El Turco in an Oldsmobile. He, too, has a man in his back seat, close to death but not quite there. Pedro Livio has been laid in the back seat, slowly leaking blood from bullet wounds. "What do we do about him? He got caught in some friendly fire."\n\n"Work it out." Román hands El Turco a hastily jotted list of phone numbers to his DFS and FBI connections. "His life is in your hands. If you'll excuse me, I have a coup to launch."\n\nPupo Román returns to his home with a renewed sense of purpose. Any lingering doubts or fears he may have still harbored were gone. He spent the rest of the night hunched over his house phone, fingers growing numb from the incessant dialing and his voice hoarse from the numerous commands declared. The military was to be mobilized, and the family of Trujillo and his brothers were to be arrested. Only after that would Román be able to rest."

More silent still than a home should be after the day's affairs since even the soft sounds of slumber are missing. The silence was broken by the arrival of two cars and five desperate men. Tony Imbert, Amadito, and Antonio de la Maza stepped out of a Chevy Biscayne and waited for a warm reception that wouldn't be coming. In the trunk of the car lay the ravaged corpse of Trujillo. They waited in the darkness of the front garden for a while, each man afraid to utter what they all knew was true. Román wouldn't be coming. The plan, backed by the US, Mexico, and Cuba, was for Román to launch the joint civil-military coup against the regime once shown the body of the dictator. The chaos of the Legion's invasion had granted them a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But that opportunity was fleeting fast. El Turco pulled up in an Oldsmobile as de la Maza raucously pounded on the door. In the backseat, Pedro Livio desperately clung to his life. He faded in and out of consciousness from his gunshot wounds.\n\n"Pupo has to be at General Staff headquarters," said Amadito.\n\n"Román blew his shot by disappearing." Antonio de la Maza angrily turned away from the beaten door. "We need to storm the National Palace now. There, we can announce Trujillo's death from a position of power."\n\n"That'll never work. We aren't the ones to make such a declaration." Salvador declared from the Oldsmobile. "Besides, I don't think Livio will last much longer like this. He needs medical attention." Tony Imbert didn't suggest anything; he merely let the silence well up inside him and fuel his agitation. It was all disintegrating so close to the end. Despite their anger, the men finally agreed on a plan. De la Maza would go to General Juan Tomás Díaz's house to see what the military situation was, while the others would take Pedro to the International Clinic."

It didn't startle him anymore to hear shots in the capital. He had more pressing concerns. Román resumed his pacing. It started yesterday morning. He could barely stop himself now, even to drink or eat.\n\nHe yanked out the chair from his desk and forced himself to sit. His foot tapped an arrhythmic staccato beat. He reached for a pen. He could draft more orders. It was all that was left for him. Sending his own people to the grave for "aiding in the legion's assassination of the martyred Generalissimo." His guilt could not be buried, even under a mountain of corpses. The time to act had come and gone, and he had failed to play his role.\n\nThe only relief the day offered was the absence of a meeting with Abbes or Trujillo's brothers, Petán and Blackie. He couldn't stop the words from pouring out of his mouth when they spoke to him. As if the slightest moment of silence would reveal his guilt. He hadn't implicated himself. Not yet. But he could tell they grew more suspicious of him with every passing hour. Román set the pen down.\n\nBalaguer watched from the hall as the general stood and returned to his restless march in front of the windows. It was a pathetic way to spend his last hours as a free man. Balaguer turned and gave a nod to his compliment of tan-shirted soldiers. They emerged from the office only seconds later, leading Román out at gunpoint."

It wouldn't take much more to get what he needed.\n\nAmadito clutched his pistol and glanced out the window. The SIM had found him at his aunt's house, halfway to Legion territory. They had awoken him before dawn, with demands of his surrender. Amadito aimed his gun at the commander and fired. He watched the man drop before a deluge of lead tore through the wall, killing him instantly.\n\nDe la Maza and General Díaz exchanged a glance in the backseat of the taxi. Any chance for them to evade the squadron of SIM cars trailing them had passed. They would be disappointing the Legion once again, it seemed. The least they could do was spare their cabbie. Antonio told the man to let them out here, then lead the way out, handgun first. He fired a few shots in the direction of the lead car before a bullet struck him in the thigh. Christ, that was a lot of blood. De la Maza collapsed on the asphalt, Díaz close behind. At least, thought Antonio, I got the bastard. I didn't forget what he did to you, Tavito. See you soon, brother.\n\nSalvador knelt in the dark pews of the cathedral, praying. Today he begged for forgiveness. For the slightest chance that his wife and children would be spared.

Salvador squeezed his eyes shut in preparation for the beating. It never came.\n\nSalvador opened his eyes. "No! Let him go, you bastards!" Lying on the floor of his cell, sobbing, was his brother, Guarionex. "He was innocent! Please! I was working with the FBI, The DFS, I admit it! Just let him go!" But the SIM men ignored his pleas. A flurry of fists and hobnailed boots fell on Guarionex. After a time, the beating stopped, and he was quiet and still. Salvador was sobbing as they dragged him away.\n\nThe minutes turned to long hours. The door opened again. Another visitor. It was his father, in his shining general's regalia. His glare softened for just a second on seeing his son, but it returned quickly as he launched into a furious rant. How, he demanded, could Salvador betray his nation and the man who had given them everything? Salvador closed his eyes, and gave a silent prayer to the Madonna.\n\nTime passed again. Days? Weeks? Only God knew. More visitors. This time it was Abbes and Trujillo's son, Ramfis. The dictator's son held a leather whip in his hand. They wasted no time with the pretense of interrogation.

MEX_Trujillo_Conspiracy.34.desc:0 "In a sweltering basement of an FBI safehouse disguised as an unprofitable workshop in a hidden street in Ciudad Trujillo, four men watch their ally grapple with the closeness of death. In the chaos of change, Pedro Livio had been shot, but such martyrdom was not inevitable. A call was shouted along the quietest of channels, and a local Dominican doctor was ushered to the FBI safehouse by DFS operatives. His operating table was arranged as sterilely as secrecy allowed. The doctor, a consummate professional, asked no questions beyond his station. All he asked was where the bullets had struck and how long ago before beginning his operation. Tony Imbert, Antonio de la Maza, and Salvador watch anxiously from a distance. With bated breath, they watch two operating tables, one the size of a man and the other an entire island. The intertwined fates of a man and a nation. They have faith that they will both pull through.\n\nIn another room, Amadito listened intently to the news murmuring from a tinny radio. The sounds were difficult to decipher, but he didn't want to interrupt the operation. He hoped that all of their work would be worth it. It was out of their hands now.\n\n"Tonight...happy to announce... death of... new civil-military led government."\n\n"Ah," Amadito stifled a shout for joy before shouting at the others. "Get in here! News of the coup! The Trujillista order has fallen!"\n\nThe men, lost in their sudden relief, all piled into the adjoining room and began to celebrate. A couple of bottles of tequila squirreled away for such a hopeful moment were opened and poured greedily. All the previous stress of coups and waiting was wiped away, but the light of a bright future remained. The doctor took off his gloves and wiped his hands clean. His own patient stable, he couldn't help but share in the smiles."

It was so fucking easy-"\n\n"There is more than enough blame to go around, Antonio," Salvador kept his voice level, but his grip on the Ace in his right hand tightened. His friends' cards were not so lucky, neglected and strewn around the table, interspersed with finished beers.\n\n"Y-you're telling me that Pupo Román hasn't bent over backwards to give those sons of bitches everything they c-could want. They want Bukharin in the National Palace, is what!"\n\nAmado García shifted uncomfortably, but the hitherto silent Tony Imbert answered, "You know what June 14th meant to me. You know what the Mirabal sisters meant to all of us. I'm not going to stay quiet, to do nothing as their dream-" Amado and El Turco tried to cut in but Tony's voice boomed louder, "is perverted! By communist scum!"\n\nThe group was at their feet now, fingers in faces, beer bottles and a kitchen chair knocked back to the floor. But their shouts and snarls were in turn surpassed by the roar of a passing jet.\n\nThe returning malice was no match for the rumble of armored vehicles driving down the street. The radio was flicked on, the grim announcement of martial law soon dwarfed by the sound of frantic footfalls as they scrambled to reach their families, to arm themselves, to get out of Santo Domingo.\n\nTo an empty, silent kitchen, the voice of Ramfis Trujillo called the nation to arms once more."

MEX_News.1.desc: "President López Mateos, in an extraordinary feat of diplomacy, has averted war in the Pacific. US and Japanese fleets had gathered in the seas near the remote Aleutian Islands after a Japanese spy plane was forced down and the pilot captured. With warning shots being exchanged only days before, both superpowers are now gradually withdrawing from the region under the auspices of a deal negotiated by Mateos.\n\nThis success reflects the strength of both Mateos' personal reputation in the rival powers, and that of Mexico, whose responsible foreign policy has established it as an invaluable, neutral arbiter in a chaotic world.\n\nToday, our country and all humanity owe President Mateos thanks."
MEX_News.1.a: "He saved us all."

In a statement, Secretary Ordaz asked that citizens remain calm and avoid spreading sensationalistic rumors.

In any subsequent legislative elections, minority parties winning at least 2.5% of the national vote will be awarded five seats automatically, receiving five seats more for each additional 0.5% of the vote they receive - up to a total of twenty seats.\n\nThis landmark piece of legislation has given new representation to the diverse voices of our country, and is a powerful symbol of our government's commitment to Mexico and her democracy."

MEX_News.4.desc: "Today the newly formed Mexican Association of Resident and Internal Doctors, or AMMRI, announced that medical interns and students will go on strike nationwide. This move comes after numerous public revelations about the poor working conditions doctors regularly face. The President has taken no official action, though he acknowledged some of the union's grievances are legitimate.\n\nThe strike has dealt a major blow to the Mexican healthcare system. Citizens with serious conditions and those of advanced age, including veterans of the Revolution, fear they will not receive treatment. Some have accused the strikers of criminal social dissolution, while the National Confederation of Popular Organizations alleges that AMMRI is an illegal union with no right to organize."

Despite the death of the terrorist leader Arturo Gámiz in the attack, the GPG has reorganized and threatens other local garrisons. As families of the deceased and all Mexico cry out for justice, a joint military and DFS operation, personally led by Director Gutiérrez Barrios, is poised to end this Bolshevik threat.\n\nWhile citizens can be assured their government will protect them and national security, questions are being raised regarding the fitness of Secretary of the Interior Licenciado Echeverría, who did not foresee or prevent the massacre."

Without evidence, Nava claims that he won the 1961 gubernatorial election and demands the illegal removal of the sitting governor for supposed electoral fraud.\n\nBased on their seditious slander and violence, many of Nava's collaborators have been charged with the crime of social dissolution by state prosecutors. While federal authorities take the necessary steps to restore order, His Excellency President Adolfo López Mateos has also magnanimously initiated negotiations with Nava to settle the matter peacefully.

#meeting the committe description It's been a long year for López Mateos. After countless diplomatic victories and concessions, the man is due a break, but he has one more critical task to perform: he must travel to Switzerland, stand before the Olympic Committee, and make the case for hosting the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico. The crux of his argument will be the sheer importance this event would have for Mexico on the world stage: not only would it lend his country immense prestige, but it would also legitimize it as a world power punching above its weight level. International business would increase and new relationships could be forged with other countries. In hosting the Olympic games, Mexico would make its mark on the 20th century.

He seeks to be remembered, to chisel his legacy into the endless cliff face of human existence, a legacy that can stand the test of time for generations to come in Mexico.\n\nThe achievements of the energy nationalization and the massive expansion of the automotive industry are monumental, though Mateos must not let up in his old age, lest his desire to cement himself as one of the greats fall short. Poverty, land distribution, Mexico's place on the world stage; all issues that must be tackled to fulfill Mateos' dream to become great."

Through joint events, directed press coverage, and leaks of flattering biographical details, the Mexican people will come to know and love El Tapado. His vision will be packaged in appealing morsels, and his qualifications drilled into every mind. When July 5th arrives, every citizen will know the foremost name on their ballot.

But perhaps the strictures of party were too tight and perhaps the man too flawed for so monumental a task. Necessary or not, Mexico's great hope leaves a trail of corpses behind him.\n\nBut that will not, cannot be his sole legacy. In this last year, López Mateos will couple social reform with efforts to soften the PRI's heavy hand. Political prisoners who no longer pose a threat will walk free. Enemies will be co-opted rather than crushed. Perhaps that will be enough to exchange a black hat for a white one on this last ride."

With the weight of the party's National Executive Committee, or CEN, and his personal reprimands, he will make clear that the infighting that characterized the succession process is no longer acceptable. The PRI must unite - corporations, militancy, governors, Alemanistas and Cardenistas, all behind the Tapado. There will be no splits, there will be no dissension.

It comprised various measures, including free textbooks, free lunches, the construction of new schools - particularly in remote areas, expanding the number of teachers and increasing their pay. These measures, if successful, would radically change the composition of Mexico's workforce and help with the country's modernization.\n\nThe plan has now entered its fourth year, and the President wants to see its fruits.

Still, there is much that needs to be done, especially as Mexicans feel the full force of the Kabuki effect. The government has recognized this, and consensus has arisen around the need to grant additional funding to these programs.

So, as the saying goes, if it isn't broken then why fix it?\n\nSticking to our guns is without a doubt our best path forward, ensuring that things continue optimally and that those who stand to gain from our land reforms may actually participate in the necessary markets in order to do so.

It seems as though we are stuck in a loop where modern agriculture is barely a dream.\n\nWe can't allow that to stand any longer, of course. Training new engineers, procuring modern equipment, we will need to grab the issue by the horns and do what we need to do in order to get back on our feet.

MEX_a_sudden_performance_desc:0 "The Yasuda Crisis in Japan has crossed the Pacific Ocean and hit our shores. Labelled 'The Kabuki Effect' by many, the economic downturn is already noticeable - though nowhere near as bad as the Japanese have it, we have been spared from depression, at least in the short term. There is now ample opportunity for the Mexican economy to change and adapt with a new slate to build upon.\n\nThe prospective successors of President López Mateos seek to prove themselves and apply their vision of the country. Already Ordaz, Madrazo and Salinas have eyed up this opportunity. They will be tested, and whoever succeeds may determine the next holder of the presidency and ultimately, the fate of the nation."
MEX_a_sudden_performance_tt:0 "The true effects of §RKabuki§! have been revealed..."
MEX_rallying_the_party:0 "Rallying the Party"
MEX_rallying_the_party_desc:0 "Ordaz and Madrazo have developed a mutual understanding between them. Despite representing largely different wings of the Party, the establishment and the Cardenista wing, respectively, the two men have come to see Salinas as their biggest threat.\n\nSalinas seeks to tarnish the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. His technocratic vision does not represent the people, and the mass privatization that would result would surrender control of the country to Japanese business interests and Salinas' cronies. The two men must put aside their differences for now. If they are to stop Salinas' race for the presidency, they will start now by addressing the current crises and garnering public and party support before Salinas can."
MEX_rallying_the_party_tt:0 "§KWe will focus on cutting our losses and helping those in need.§!"
MEX_lower_interest_rates:0 "Lower Interest Rates"
MEX_lower_interest_rates_desc:0 "It's an economic orthodoxy that nearly everyone agrees with. In these times of financial trouble, interest rates must be lowered to ease the burden borne by debtors, many of whom are on the brink of insolvency. With the weight of crushing debts lightened, they will have a chance to regain their financial footing.\n\nSimultaneously, borrowing will appear a much more desirable option to investors, and the more significant investment that will result will help grow the country out of the pit it is in. Some disagreement exists within the Party to the extent of the rate cuts, but the situation is urgent, and action is needed now."
MEX_cutting_the_rope_loose:0 "Cutting the Rope Loose"
MEX_cutting_the_rope_loose_desc:0 "The Japanese corporations that have established a significant footprint in Mexico are currently reeling from the ripple effects of the turmoil that is engulfing their homeland. The severity of the situation is such that most of them are facing the grim prospect of going under, unless they receive substantial aid from the state.\n\nOrdaz and Madrazo are quite content with this fact. The money that could bail them out would be much more valuable in helping out Mexico directly, and the loss of some Japanese influence will be something to celebrate for many. Madrazo will appreciate the weakening of Japanese imperialism, while Ordaz will find it much easier to approach the Americans without the restraint of Japanese interests."
MEX_filling_out_the_bottom:0 "Filling Out the Bottom"
MEX_filling_out_the_bottom_desc:0 "Mexico's industrialists, within and even outside of the PRI, are influential and will likely be uncooperative with our plans to relieve our nation's lower classes. However, the Yasuda crisis has allowed us to sidestep their usual concerns; since Japan's companies are in freefall, we can cut subsidies and shift the funds toward solvent companies. Our poorest will receive relief, and our richest will lose nothing; everyone walks away a winner!"
MEX_plugging_the_gaps:0 "Plugging the Gaps"
MEX_plugging_the_gaps_desc:0 "Despite the distrust many felt towards the Japanese corporations, they were still large employers of Mexican workers. Their absence has already been felt, with many workers now left unemployed and desperate for new jobs. The administration and Party agree there is a necessity to fill this hole, though Madrazo and Ordaz as usual, disagree on how.\n\nOrdaz wishes to invite American corporations to take the place of the Japanese and give Mexico closer ties to the American government, now unbound from the threat imposed by Japanese economic influence.\n\nAt the same time, Madrazo wants to keep things local, seeing an opportunity to grow local Mexican businesses while also deepening ties to the rest of Latin America by inviting some of their companies. Whatever the case, both sides agree that either option is undoubtedly an improvement from the Japanese. "
MEX_extend_rent_payments:0 "Extend Rent Payments"
MEX_extend_rent_payments_desc:0 "The government has taken a decisive step to alleviate the financial burden on those affected by the current crisis by deferring rent payments. This move will afford those suffering from the economic fallout some much-needed breathing space to regain their financial stability. It's a measure that, at least in the short term, is largely agreed upon within the Party, however this consensus breaks down when the question is asked about how long this moratorium should extend into the future.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it's Madrazo and the Cardenistas that seek to keep the policy in place for as long as possible to ensure that most renters have recovered, while the more pragmatic followers of Ordaz are concerned about the costs and impacts on landowners that a prolonged period of less rent revenue will bring. Ultimately, the success of either option will depend on how well it navigates this fine line between economic relief for renters and safeguarding the property market."
MEX_emergency_relief_package:0 "Emergency Relief Package"
MEX_emergency_relief_package_desc:0 "While freezing rents and lowering interest rates have helped mitigate the current economic crisis, there's broad consensus within the Party that these measures alone are not sufficient and that direct stimulus is required to bolster the economy and provide immediate relief to ordinary Mexicans.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the specifics of how this direct aid should be implemented, a clear divide emerges. The majority favor the straightforward approach of distributing checks directly to individuals, providing an immediate financial injection to those affected by the crisis.\n\nIn contrast, a significant faction led by Madrazo advocates for a more comprehensive approach. They view this crisis as an opportunity to initiate structural reforms to Mexico's social services. Their goal is not only to provide immediate relief but also to establish a robust support system for citizens, both in times of crisis and during periods of relative stability. Their perspective emphasizes long-term improvements, aiming to transform this moment of crisis into an opportunity for enduring societal change."
MEX_the_tabasco_solution:0 "The Tabasco Solution"
MEX_the_tabasco_solution_desc:0 "While many of our governors flail about their provinces salvaging what remains in the wake of the crisis, one has stood out for the remarkable recovery of his state: Carlos Madrazo of Tabasco.\n\nDubbed the "Tabasco approach," his popular recovery strategy has earned the attention of millions, and his influence in the left wing of the party is remarkable. Bringing him on to help nationwide seems to be a matter of if, not when, lest we let "Kabuki" get the best of us."
MEX_intertwine_interests:0 "Intertwine Interests"
MEX_intertwine_interests_desc:0 "It's a sad fact that empathy in times of crisis is not always guaranteed. As the Kabuki Effect ripples across our economy, we must take steps to ensure that all of Mexico comes together to resolve the situation. Everyone must be connected and in cooperation across the country, and they must know a basic fact about this crisis: §Rif we fail, everyone fails.§!"
MEX_the_technocratic_counter:0 "The Technocratic Counter"
MEX_the_technocratic_counter_desc:0 "For too many years, the Cardenistas have been dominant over the Party, and their continued dominance has led to stagnation. They have failed to maintain economic stability in the country, instead focusing on ineffective populist policies that will damage Mexico in the long run. Therefore they need to be sidelined if the Party is to take the necessary steps to save the country from economic ruin.\n\nOnly the technocrats and industrialists, under the guidance of Salinas, dare to do what is needed. While it will not be popular, it will be necessary for the growth of the Mexican economy and the recovery from this crisis. We must tread lightly as the rest of the Party, the populace and the President will be watching and scrutinizing every one of our moves. If the actions taken are too drastic, any chance of necessary reform may be squandered."
MEX_the_technocratic_counter_tt:0 "§VWe will focus on maintaining economic confidence and growth.§!"
MEX_bailout_effort:0 "Bailout Effort"
MEX_bailout_effort_tt:0 "This focus unlocks new £mex_industrialists_texticon §wIndustrialist§! decisions!"
MEX_bailout_effort_desc:0 "The situation will worsen further if struggling corporations are not bailed out. Many Mexicans rely on the jobs provided by these companies, and if they were to fail, it would take crucial time for other companies to take their place. Our growth would be hindered if many of these corporations were to fail. Now more than ever, they are needed to escape the economic crisis.\n\nThe Party hesitates to support this move. Many would much prefer aid to go directly to the people rather than the corporations. What they fail to consider is that even more aid would be required if thousands were left unemployed, while fewer people employed would mean less tax revenue. We'd likely be able to handle this criticism from just the Party regarding the policy, but now the President has made his voice heard and is uncomfortable with a plain bailout. It is unfortunate, but giving some token concessions will be necessary to win him and the Party over."
MEX_drop_fiscal_burden:0 "Drop Fiscal Burden"
MEX_drop_fiscal_burden_desc:0 "One of the primary reasons for Mexico's unimpressive growth is the massive restraints placed on corporations by the state. Governments of the past and most in the Party think they can regulate and tax their way to prosperity, which is simply untrue. Companies need to prosper and grow if the country is to. To end this period of stagnation, the burden on these companies should be eased. Tax rates will be lowered, unionism restricted, and regulations squashed.\n\nThis policy may be one of our most controversial within the Party. Many Cardenistas will be mortified at the thought of deregulation, and many others will be unhappy at the lower tax revenue. All invalid concerns, we will all be far wealthier in the long term if businesses are able to succeed. "
MEX_drop_fiscal_burden_tt:0 "§RThis will not be popular with the party.§!"
MEX_the_head_without_the_body:0 "A Head With No Body"
MEX_the_head_without_the_body_desc:0 "Mexico's trade unions are a vital partner in restoring macroeconomic and political stability. The laboring classes are in the firm grasp of CTM General Secretary Fidel Velázquez, necessitating some... personal outreach. But bureaucrats, professionals, and our industrialist allies answer to the CNOP, that amorphous and ineffectual corporatist blob.\n\nWhile CNOP's leadership is supportive of Salinas, they will need new muscle to keep their sprawling membership in line. Secretary Salinas will arrange for relief funding to flow directly through the organization, with the least squeaky wheels getting the proverbial grease. The kuruko stagehands must remain silent for our grand Kabuki performance."
MEX_the_fangs_of_the_tiger:0 "A Weapon With No Handle"
MEX_the_fangs_of_the_tiger_desc:0 "Gustavo Díaz Ordaz is not a man frequently accused of weakness. Of softness. But our President's will and El Titán's own plotting have shackled him to Governor Madrazo's negotiations with Nava. The DFS, the PRI's sharpest weapon, chafes against their Secretary's restraints, hungering to put down the traitorous wretch wreaking havoc in San Luis Potosí.\n\nSalinas may not yet hold the handle of such a powerful tool. But he can arrange to meet with ambitious DFS captains, Gutiérrez and de la Barreda among them, on anodyne matters like Kabuki-inspired industrial action and protecting Japanese investors. And with a few promises, and many pesos, he may be able to loosen the Tiger's leash."
MEX_fastening_our_seatbelts:0 "Fastening Our Seatbelts"
MEX_fastening_our_seatbelts_desc:0 "The country is in a troubling time, and ordinary people have had to make cuts to their budget to make do. The government should not be immune from doing the same. While some within the Party demand continuous sugar hits, the reality is that this short-term pain can be used to make the country more prosperous in the future. Many ineffective and wasteful programs can be slashed, while the truly necessary functions of the government are safeguarded.\n\nThe Party will, of course, scream bloody murder in response. There is even some opposition brewing among the Keynesians within the our technocratic wing. This dissension will, unfortunately, make it difficult to take full advantage of this opportunity, but we must try."
MEX_fastening_our_seatbelts_tt:0 "§RThe effects of this measure are hard to predict, and factions aside from the Industrialists will have problems with this. Is this the correct measure?§!"
MEX_all_or_nothing:0 "All or Nothing"
MEX_all_or_nothing_desc:0 "After enduring considerable struggle and the inevitable give-and-take of political negotiation, our plans have finally come to fruition. It was an arduous journey; certain factions within the Party proved resistant, questioning the necessity of our proposed actions at every step. Sacrifices were indeed made to fuel the recovery, but as we move forward, the obfuscating mist of the Kabuki Effect begins to lift, revealing the fruits of our labor.\n\nThe decisions made and actions undertaken in recent months promise to leave a long-lasting mark on Mexico's future. The economic landscape of our nation stands to be transformed, impacted by the measures we've implemented. Furthermore, these developments have also shifted the internal dynamics of our Party, redistributing the balance of power. As we step into this new era, we do so knowing that our actions today will shape the Mexico of tomorrow."

There is still much to be done before we can pry official confirmation but perhaps, in time, we can expect to see Japanese support for our Olympic bid in 1968. Salinas' ability to get us an even-sided deal has helped - wrangling those diplomats isn't light work. He has proved he has the mettle for statecraft."

He has done this for decades, in fact, but it is steady, dull and unremarkable work. He has not done enough to secure Japanese support for our Olympic Games bid. All we have is a promise from Prime Minister Ino Hiroya that Japan, and the rest of the sphere, will "keep an open mind" when it comes to the nomination. Salinas has done his job admirably, and this is certainly better than nothing, but I had expected more than the bare minimum."

Salinas is normally competent, so I expected a cordial response from Ino Hiroya, but whatever he has done has made the Prime Minister treat me with near animosity. What was meant to be a one-day trip in Japan has turned into a week-long headache having to fix this mess: something that Salinas was entrusted to do, not me."

 ## ASSORTED LAWS ##
 MEX_IMP_law: "£GFX_mex_article27_texticon §BMexican Petroleum Institute§!"
 MEX_IMP_law_desc: "§FThe £GFX_mex_article27_texticon §BMexican Petroleum Institute§! (§BIMP§!) represents the great potential of technological investment in §KMexico§!. Since the nationalization and reorganization of the foreign oil industry under the Pemex umbrella in 1938, petroleum has dominated the §KMexican§! economy and is a significant source of revenue for the government. §BIMP§! was created to support this endeavor and modernize the §KMexican§! economy. The £GFX_mex_article27_texticon §BMexican Petroleum Institute§! conducts cutting-edge research and development into all branches of petroleum: exploration, extraction, transportation, refinement, and use. The §BInstitute§! seeks to train researchers, support them scientifically, and share their findings with the §KMexican§! petroleum industry.§!"

 MEX_current_constitution_law: "£GFX_mex_1917_constitution_texticon §KConstitution of 1917§!"
 MEX_current_constitution_law_desc: "§FThe ruling legal document of §ORevolutionary§! §KMexico§!. Created by the constitutionalist government of §qVenustiano Carranza§!. Designed to appeal to the people of §KMexico§! through far reaching reforms. One of the most §Eprogressive§! of its time, especially in its approach to agrarian issues, socialist means of production, and ownership. Also enshrines a great number of §Mpolitical freedoms§! including freedom of speech. Has been upheld and emplaced as the pinnacle of the §ORevolution§! ever since. However, successive governments have considered £GFX_mex_1917_constitution_texticon §Kthese articles§! as guidelines, not a binding legal document. Despite plenty of lip service, many presidents change or ignore it when convenient.§!"

 MEX_estrada_doctrine_law: "£GFX_mex_estrada_doctrine_texticon §lThe Estrada Doctrine§!"
 MEX_estrada_doctrine_law_desc: "§FThe founding principle of §KMexican§! foreign policy, the beliefs of Foreign Secretary §lGenaro Estrada Félix§! have been the lodestar of the nation. This doctrine expressed a distaste for the two issues that plagued §KMexico§! - nonrecognition and intervention. Supporting the sovereignty of other nations and rejecting intervention into their internal affairs have thus been the two main points of this £GFX_mex_estrada_doctrine_texticon §lphilosophy§!. And it has led to §KMexico§! being seen as an unbiased and neutral nation in the world at large. However, recent governments have favored an interpretation that says £UKR_reichskommissariat §rfascism§! is a fundamental threat to these principles and thus should be actively opposed.§!"

 MEX_article_130_law: "£GFX_mex_church_state_separation_texticon §OChurch-State Separation§!\n§YArt. 130§!"
 MEX_article_130_law_desc: "§FThis Article restricts the activities of §Ypriests§! in §KMexico§! - political and otherwise. Deemed necessary by revolutionaries long unhappy with §Yclerical influence§!. However, prior strict enforcement of this article led to large civil unrest, uprisings, and international condemnation - the §YCristero Wars§!. As such, by agreement with the £GFX_mex_church_state_separation_texticon §YChurch§! under the §OCárdenas§! and §mCamacho§! administrations, many provisions have not been enforced since 1938. They are still respected by the £GFX_mex_church_state_separation_texticon §YChurch§! and £GFX_mex_pri_texticon §Kgovernment§!, despite often being brought up as a sore spot in the history of the nation.§!"

 MEX_article_27_law: "£GFX_mex_article27_texticon §VNationalization of Oil and Electricity§!\n§YArt. 27§!"
 MEX_article_27_law_desc: "§FEstablishes the resources of the §Knation§! as the property of the §Knation§! and not of the individual person or corporation. Thus grants the state exclusive powers of monopolization. Implemented in response to foreign companies who harvested §KMexican§! resources with impunity, it is regarded as one of the most effective legal mechanisms to assert §KMexican§! sovereignty. Famously exercised in 1938 by President §OCárdenas§! to §Vexpropriate the oil industry§!, and recently modified by President §ELópez Mateos§! to facilitate the £GFX_mex_article27_texticon §Vnationalization of electricity.§!§!"

 MEX_penal_article_145_law: "£GFX_mex_social_dissolution_texticon §jLaw of Social Dissolution§!\n§YPenal Art. 145§!"
 MEX_penal_article_145_law_desc: "§FEstablishes £GFX_mex_social_dissolution_texticon §jSocial Dissolution§! - inciting unrest - as a criminal offense. Born of the fear of the rising tide of £UKR_reichskommissariat §rEuropean fascism§!, this §jlaw§! has been used since 1941 to clamp down on all enemies of the public, foreign and domestic. Exceptionally broad, covering all acts of speech and works of writing of a political nature. This §jAct§! has thus been used by the £GFX_mex_pri_texticon §nP§!§WR§!§xI§! to clamp down on any dissent the government deems dangerous or troublesome. Especially useful against the £mex_dw_pdlp_texticon §Xfar left§! and £mex_dw_uns_texticon §rfar right§!.§!"

 MEX_the_corporatist_system_law_desc: "§FThe £GFX_mex_corporatist_system_texticon §jcorporatist system§! in §KMexico§! was established in 1937 during the presidency of §OGeneral Lázaro Cárdenas del Río§!. Forming the §nP§!§WR§!§xM§!, Party of the Mexican Revolution, later to become the modern £GFX_mex_pri_texticon §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!, as a representative of the people through internal politicking between various interest groups, the £GFX_mex_corporatist_system_texticon §jcorporatist mechanism§! divides Mexican society into three sectors: i) the £mex_workers_texticon §xworkers§!, represented by the §xCTM (Confederation of Mexican Workers)§!; ii) the £mex_peasantry_texticon §rpeasants§!, represented by the §rCNC (National Peasant Confederation)§!; iii) the §wpopular§! §Qsector§!, a poorly-defined concept best represented as every profession other than £mex_peasantry_texticon §rpeasants§! and £mex_workers_texticon §xworkers§!, represented by the §wCN§!§QOP§! (§wConfederation of§! §QNational Popular Organizations§!).\n\nThe §xCTM§!, §rCNC§!, and §wCN§!§QOP§! were formed by merging together the disunited and chaotic labour scene in post-§ORevolution§! §KMexico§!. Today, these three §jcorporations§! represent every single union in §KMexico§!. As such, though the actual level of representation is very much subject to debate, they represent millions of members. Contrary to how leviathan-like the bureaucracy of these three bodies seems, the £GFX_mex_corporatist_system_texticon §jcorporatist system§! is a well-oiled machine. Those dual contradictory qualities make it crucial to continued £GFX_mex_pri_texticon §nP§!§WR§!§xI§! rule over the §KUnited Mexican States.§!"
