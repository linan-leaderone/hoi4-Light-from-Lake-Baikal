# Characters
 MAD_Pierre_Boisson: "Pierre Boisson"
 POLITICS_PIERRE_BOISSON_DESC: "Pierre Boisson is a man haunted by failure. After serving - and losing a leg - in the First World War, Boisson overcame his loss to quickly shoot up the ranks in various colonial administrations in French Africa, from Brazzaville to Dakar. Yet the Second World War would shatter the rising star's dreams.\n\nFacing the onslaught of the Nazi war machine, Boisson swore fealty to the eagle; whether it was to "defend the Empire" as he claimed, or to escape being swallowed whole, only he may know. Regardless of his motivations, his new career would be marked by constant reshuffling from West Africa to Equatorial Africa and back again until the general strikes of 1948 in Conakry and Dakar forced his hand. Boisson's violent crackdown was the spark that blew the remnants of the French Empire on continental Africa to smithereens. For this sin, the suited men in Paris relegated him to the Einheitspakt's isolated frontier: Madagascar.\n\nNow, Boisson sits as guardian of an island that is as much his prison as it is for the Malagasy he rules over. While order is kept by the garrison from Germania, all parties are aware to whom their true loyalties lie. Amidst crescendoing tensions with the natives and stewing in a sea of his own failures, Boisson can only hope that when - not if - the seams of Madagascar burst open, he will not be swallowed whole by his mistakes."

 MAD_Gilles_Andriamahazo: "Gilles Andriamahazo"
 POLITICS_GILLES_ANDRIAMAHAZO_DESC: "This is not Gilles Andriamahazo's first war, not at all. Years ago, when the French empire that had once conquered Madagascar fell over like a wet blanket under the pressure of the German Reich, he was an officer in the French Army. But that commission was ended perforce; Andriamahazo was no fool, to expect that things would improve now that the Free French had been supplanted by a lot of Pétainists and their German puppet masters. Indeed, he was right—and he cursed high and low that his predictions were so accurate.\n\nThe French cowards fled to Paris or their walled compounds in Tananarive, and the colonial government deteriorated into the very model of inefficiency. Outside the French palaces, Hitlerites did to Madagascar what they are doing in Europe: lording it over the people, and engaging in random acts of violence to sate their degenerate urges. It made sense; they had come to Madagascar for a port, and were yet to profit from being away from their frigid hellhole of a home.\n\nHow much longer could the Malagasy people tolerate this? After the first failed revolt in 1947, there came a rise in nationalist sentiment all through the 1950s. The new decade dawned and saw Andriamahazo appointed head of the local police—and, eventually, leader of the independence movement and the bearer of the hope of the Malagasy people.\n\nTherefore, with the souls of the old monarchs of Madagascar as their witnesses, General Gilles Andriamahazo and the Malagasy people have resolved: either Madagasikara in its fullness shall become Tsiazombazaha, or it will become the grave of all its people."

 MAD_Norbert_Zafimahova: "Norbert Zafimahova"
 POLITICS_NORBERT_ZAFIMAHOVA_DESC: "More than anyone else, Norbert Zafimahova understands the core cultural, political, and social alliance that underpins PADESM. After all, he was there on the day it was forged. After two decades of struggle, the time has come to see that agreement through.\n\nWith PADESM now controlling Madagascar, Zafimahova's presidency is in some ways a caretaker role - whatever president comes out of the upcoming elections will certainly have a much more effective mandate. Yet in another sense, it is a chance to define what the Republic of Madagascar is, in a manner that is only possible now that the war has ended.\n\nZafimahova has a clear definition in his mind. His Madagascar is an ethnically pluralist state, an anti-colonialist state, and a democratic and a socialist state, the same core ideals imagined when PADESM first came to be. In all those years spent fighting, losing, regrouping, visions of that Madagascar swirled through Zafimahova's mind. Now, as he sits in the presidency, that nation is already forming around him."
 POLITICS_NORBERT_ZAFIMAHOVA_PSD_DESC: "More than anyone else, Norbert Zafimahova understands the core cultural, political, and social alliance that underpins PADESM. After all, he was there on the day it was forged. After nearly three decades of struggle, the time has come to see that agreement through.\n\nAlas, that agreement can no longer be satisfied by the party that created it. Under Tsiranana, PADESM has been stripped of the revolutionary core that defined it. Now, PADESM merely persists to please benefactors, to rebuild economic sectors and forge ties with foreign allies. Yet wasn't PADESM about more than mere stability, mere safety?\n\nZafimahova has had to return with a new party, forged out of fellow PADESM socialists who could not stand seeing their party turn into mere machinery. He returns to the presidency ready to fight for his Madagascar, democratic, equitable, prosperous, and just. No matter what his former party attempts, no matter who tries to shoot him down, Zafimahova will never turn his back on the agreement he made. He will see it through."

 MAD_Governing_Council: "Governing Council of Madagascar"
 POLITICS_GOVERNING_COUNCIL_DESC: "If you ask three randomly selected members of the Governing Council of Madagascar about any topic at all—politics, economics, religion, you name it—they will inevitably start arguing. What else would you expect, when the present situation has shoved together the TAFAMA nationalists, the PADESM democrats, and the AKFM socialists into a single faction?\n\nBut those three functionaries will quickly gain control of themselves and stop arguing. They will glare at you, shouting, "What in God's name are you doing distracting us, while the European scum are still here trying to put their boots back on our necks? Focus on the important question!" That important question is the one thing that makes Malagasy socialists, conservatives, and liberal democrats tolerate each other—the freedom of their nation.\n\nYes, there are disagreements. There always will be. TAFAMA men look at the AKFM and see the failures of Bukharin and the follies of Moumié retreaded without a hint of irony or historical literacy. AKFM cadres look at their nationalist opposite numbers and complain that the last time people like TAFAMA ruled the country was a violent mess and the Europeans were able to occupy it. The PADESM are dismissed by their allies as too limp-wristed and tolerant of socialism or of conservatism; they in turn condemn what they perceive as the damaging radicalism of both extremes, fearing dogmatic chaos and further conflict after liberation.\n\nSuch divergences of course lead to instability. However, that instability, in the eyes of any member of the Governing Council, is a trifle compared to the misery the Germans and their French slave-dogs have brought on this island. There are to be no treasonous cries of 'better dead than red' or 'death to the reactionaries' or 'down with the extremists'—nay, only a free Madagascar, or an island made into a mausoleum for its people who died free."

 MAD_Philibert_Tsiranana: "Philibert Tsiranana"
 POLITICS_PHILIBERT_TSIRANANA_DESC: "Within the leading ranks of PADESM, Philibert Tsiranana is best defined by his pragmatism. His leading role within PADESM is no surprise, but did not come naturally - he worked his way up from a Tsimihety teacher to a minor politician, and from a minor politician to a president. But make no mistake, Tsiranana sees a great purpose in all his plans. Madagascar can be improved, enshrined, and Tsiranana knows he is the man to do it.\n\nTo some extent, he sees socialism as a tool to do so - perhaps socialism is the one tool all Malagasy thinkers share. Yet as he looks at a Madagascar in ruins, he knows his nation needs more than ideals to get by. Madagascar needs simpler, concrete things - infrastructure, investment, trading partners, and cultural harmony. Not radical machinations, but a slowly improving normalcy.\n\nTsiranana imagines himself as something of a teacher - if not a typical visionary, then certainly a politician to emulate, beckoning a political order that will long outlast his own term. As the economy booms, as peace and stability return to his stormy island, President Tsiranana is certain the nation can see his vision."
 POLITICS_PHILIBERT_TSIRANANA_STAG_DESC: "Just a few years ago, Madagascar seemed as if it was in a burgeoning democracy. Liberated from the tyranny of French and German colonialism, it had blossomed into a proper republic, under president Philibert Tsiranana.\n\nFor Philibert Tsiranana, it does not feel as if much has changed in the years since. The opposition has always been a bother, but to crush them would be immoral, damaging to the machine the President has made. Instead, he has simply isolated them, left them clutching their few mayors while the PADESM gathers enough cultural and political allies to always remain in control.\n\nAnd so the systems remain, even as the outcomes fade away. The coming elections will be won by the PADESM. It is a reality all in Madagascar must come to accept, from the struggling communists to the prosperous investors.\n\nPerhaps in some far-off future the people of Madagascar will change their tune and cast off their president, their party, perhaps even their systems. Until then, they will be left watching as Tsiranana perfects an economy that was meant to be theirs."

 MAD_Gisele_Rabesahala: "Gisèle Rabesahala"
 POLITICS_GISELE_RABESAHALA_DESC: "At first, Gisèle Rabesahala seems almost impossible - in a patriarchal, colonialist age, Rabesahala is both a woman and a Communist. In both ways, she is revolutionary.\n\nRabesahala's communist beliefs developed from her union ties, when she began working with the PCF. Yet to sum up the full extent of her pre-independence work would be impossible - it ran through every space, labor to assistance to legal representation, always fighting for the common good. Before there was an AKFM, Gisèle Rabesahala was her own communist party.\n\nWhen the party finally formed, Rabesahala was chosen as secretary, a role she has held since. Now leading the nation, Rabesahala has begun enforcing a communist line, taking from her former PCF allies and even the little-known Joseph Stalin to create a new society. Rabesahala has been strident about enforcing a leftist orthodoxy, from her own party to the culture itself.\n\nYes, Secretary Rabesahala is radical, far more than some in her party. But who can deny her the right to guide the revolution? She has fought for progress longer than any other."

 MAD_Monja_Jaona: "Monja Jaona"
 POLITICS_MONJA_JAONA_DESC: "Monja Jaona never quite made sense as a member of the TAFAMA party. In truth, the man has never managed to fit into the boxes of Malagasy politics, as his strident and idiosyncratic vision leaves him without a clear community to stand on. Yet there is one reason that all respect him, even as he refuses to stand within their bounds: his endless capacity to fight.\n\nWho else can claim to have joined the uprising of 1947 and survived, even as fascist Frenchmen and Germans killed every African they could capture? When that uprising failed, Jaona simply created a new party to continue his fight, eventually merging it with the wider TAFAMA movement. Only now, after two decades of protest, has Jaona finally entered civilian politics proper.\n\nWith TAFAMA gone, Jaona has used a coalition of impoverished and minority Malagasy to become Madagascar's president. Back with the MONIMA party, Jaona preaches a vaguely leftist vision of independence and anti-colonialism, helped by Japan's military umbrella. The French will have no station on this island. After all this time, Madagascar will at last be for the Malagasy."
 POLITICS_MONJA_JAONA_DESC_PADSEM: "It seems a miracle that Monja Jaona has managed to ascend to lead the Republic of Madagascar. A former TAFAMA leader, he seems a relic of a past era, outspoken and anti-colonial in ways that the PADESM and PSD never are. Yet this is precisely why the Malagasy need him now more than ever. Someone must remind them who this republic stands for.\n\nWho else can claim to have joined the uprising of 1947 and survived, even as fascist Frenchmen and Germans killed every African they could capture? When that uprising failed, Jaona simply created a new party to continue his fight, eventually merging it with the wider TAFAMA movement. And when TAFAMA collapsed, only Jaona - with his Antandroy ethnicity and powerful skills at organization - managed to revive his party to fight once more.\n\nIn the last few years, Jaona has been forced to watch PADESM unravel that anti-colonial spirit, allowing the French and other foreigners to worm their way back into society. But with a revived MONIMA and a nation of disgruntled and impoverished Malagasy behind him, President Jaono is certain that this great injustice can be reversed. Madagascar will at last be for the Malagasy."

 MAD_Jacques_Rabemananjara: "Jacques Rabemananjara"
 POLITICS_JACQUES_RABEMANANJARA_DESC: "Jacques Rabemananjara is a forefather of the independence movement in Madagascar. In a better world, he might have simply remained a poet, a thinker, and an organizer. But with the colony of a fascist state, Rabemananjara could do nothing less than fight.\n\nAs a founder of both the TAFAMA movement and of the MRDM before it, Rabemananjara has always supplied the democratically minded, idealist edge to the TAFAMA movement. Yet his vision of democracy was still far different to PADESM. Rabemananjara would never bow to the French. His republic would forge a nation as well as a state, a united Malagasy people ready to uplift their nation.\n\nNow, with TAFAMA scattered, Rabemananjara has managed to unify his long-standing coalition and take control of the state. The task that will follow is a great reversal of history, overturning decades of colonialism with only a scattered party and the Japanese behind him. Yet with ideas as sharp as his own, President Rabemananjara feels he has all he needs."

 MAD_Gabriel_Ramanantsoa: "Gabriel Ramanantsoa"
 POLITICS_GABRIEL_RAMANANTSOA_DESC: "If one glances at his record, Ramanantsoa looks much more like a TAFAMA officer than the coastal, left-leaning pluralists that have defined the PADESM era. An unaligned military officer of Merina origin, his ascension from leading general to the presidency was unexpected by most pundits. He is, in essence, everything Raseta and his predecessors were not.\n\nWhat has changed? Nothing, in truth. Ramanantsoa's ascent reveals a simple reality about his government, about PADESM, about all the ink and blood spilled on these shores. They were mere stepping stones towards a political project to which the Malagasy had no control. When Raseta broke from that project, all else fell away, closed down like a failing corporate division.\n\nSo do not bother attempting to ascertain Ramanantsoa's values, beliefs, or convictions - you have already seen what happens to convictions in Madagascar. He will give the Americans the OFN membership they require. All else is empty gestures."

 MAD_Central_Committee: "Central Committee"
 POLITICS_CENTRAL_COMMITTEE_DESC: "A red dawn arrives in Madagascar. The AFKM now controls the constitutional convention in Antananarivo, while their opposition waits in prison or in exile. Now, it is their turn to decide what a truly free Madagascar requires. All within the central committee are certain that they will create a socialist, largely isolated state. It is a matter of specifics now - specifics that will define a nation.\n\nThe party's heterodox thinking is in many ways a product of its creation. Homegrown in a hostile colony, the AFKM never had the years of exile that allowed its rival parties to hone a party line. Instead, it has always cast a wide net, seeking all those who are willing to fight for the people and not foreign interests. Now, as the time comes to formalize the nature of the state, this loose arrangement must sadly be dismantled.\n\nBut do not mistake this disunity for a lack of spirit or discipline. The party is unlikely to crack in the coming days - whatever choice is made, the vast majority of leadership is sure to obey it. What matters is this - even for those in the party, none know what form this new, people's Madagascar might take."
 POLITICS_CENTRAL_COMMITTEE_AREMA_DESC: "In a better world, there would be no need for AREMA. Liberation had been promised to all of the Malagasy - a war was fought to make it so. Yet the true liberators, the AKFM, were sidelined, and the nation sold off once more. Now, AREMA claims there will be true liberation - a decade overdue.\n\nYet AREMA itself is a somewhat mysterious entity. While it traces its roots and leadership to the AKFM, its rise has been precipitous, launched to power by supposed referendum after months of protest made it clear to the military that the previous government was unsalvageable. How has it managed to so immediately convince the nation?\n\nUltimately, it comes down to one man: Didier Ratsiraka. AREMA is his creation, and it has been built with his connections and his vision. His party has clear discipline, a highly-enforced party line mixing the nationalism and Marxism of the old AKFM in an intentional and potent combination. Read his pamphlets, see his posters, and you will understand how his party rose to power. Ratsiraka had the vision his opponents always lacked."

 MAD_Charles_Ravoajanahary: "Charles Ravoajanahary"
 POLITICS_CHARLES_RAVOAJANAHARY_DESC: "Charles Ravoajanahary is in many ways the AKFM's teacher. Once a student of history, he is well versed in the history of revolution in Madagascar, and his writings have helped inspire many of those in his party to understand why and how they fight. Now, he enters a new age of history - one defined by governance.\n\nAs the founder of the AKFM, Ravoajanahary easily managed to become the consensus figure for party support. Now, it is up to him to define the party line - yet his own values are eclectic, defined not by some foreign text but by decade after decade of local insurrections. His models are not Lenin or Bukharin but Ralaimongo and Ravelojaona.\n\nAnd so, Ravoajanahary does not look to a European model of socialism - it would not fit his nation. Instead, he looks to African thinkers with African modes of socialism. Closely connected with Cameroonian Pan-Africanism, Ravoajanahary's new ideology is uniquely tuned to Malagasy realities. His people are defined by revolution - it is up to them to create something truly revolutionary."

 MAD_Didier_Ratsiraka: "Didier Ratsiraka"
 POLITICS_DIDIER_RATSIRAKA_DESC: "Compared to other leading members of his party, Didier Ratsiraka appears moderate, even cynical. The Red Admiral did not spend his youth working with the PCF - he spent it as a naval policeman, catching revolutionaries instead of saving them. Yet read his Red Book, hear his speeches, and you will understand. His revolution is many things - pragmatic, targeted, even possibly misguided - but cynical it is not.\n\nRatsiraka mutinied, like so many others, in the later years of French rule, when it gradually slid into German control. In time, seeing PADESM and TAFAMA become attached to foreign powers, he moved to the AKFM, where his intense nationalist beliefs became matched with an acceptance of socialist values. From then on, his attempts at control were tied to his dreams of leftist revolution.\n\nDidier Ratsiraka has become a representative of the new, disillusioned partisan, radically nationalist and deeply disappointed with the other revolutionary parties. His socialism does not come from a place of deep idealism, but of acceptance. To Ratsiraka, no other revolution could be enough for Madagascar"

 MAD_Richard_Ratsimandrava: "Richard Ratsimandrava"
 POLITICS_RICHARD_RATSIMANDRAVA_DESC: "Within the web of pro-Sphere Malagasy, Richard Ratsimandrava represents the thin end of the wedge. He is a Merina, but not a chauvinist; he is a former mutineer, but keenly politically minded. In his mind, such traits provide him the moderation to unite the nation.\n\nSuch traits filter into his politics. Rather than promising a hopeful democracy or a powerful dictatorship, Ratsimandrava imagines something between the two, a structured, ordered republic built around a powerful president and his party. It is a vision organized around the fokon'olona, one he perfected while a minister in TAFAMA.\n\nNow rising to the presidency following the collapse of TAFAMA, Ratsimandrava hopes to reforge the alliance under his new party, and his new model of leadership. If it fails, Ratsimandrava will likely end up just another dictator-in-waiting, forced to crush his own republic. If it succeeds, Ratsimandrava will have built the consensus he needs to make Madagascar a developed and powerful member within the wider Sphere alliance."

 MAD_Joseph_Raseta: "Joseph Raseta"
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_RASETA_DESC: "Joseph Raseta is an old soul, so old as to have seen the fall of the Imerina Kingdom with his own eyes, and watch the sixty years of colonialist oppression that followed. In that time, he has joined with the VVS, with the AFKM, in an eternal struggle for freedom. In his waning years, he at last has the chance to give Madagascar the independence it always deserved.\n\nSome in his nation may call the Americans liberators, but they are from the same cloth as all imperialists, ugly at their core. Towns may now have ballot boxes, but their walls are covered in PADESM posters, their farms sold to foreign companies. The election was intended as mere fanfare, blaring notes announcing America's newest colony.\n\nLuckily, the whims of a nation have not proven so easy to delude. The people instead voted Raseta into power. His Madagascar is a socialist, nationalist state, forged out of those many struggles for freedom which had Raseta on the front lines. His Madagascar is for the people, not for foreign plantations and military bases. Madagascar's flag will fly high, and unfettered by any who might wish to stop it."

# Nat Spirits
 MAD_last_french_colony: "Last French Colony"
 MAD_last_french_colony_desc: "At the start of the century, the French controlled one of the largest colonial empires in the world, subjugating some 69 million people and 4.8 million square miles in the name of République française.\n\nIn the aftermath of the War, France's once-robust system of colonial exploitation and extraction has become a ghost of itself. Reduced to Madagascar, the French colonial empire is corrupt, ineffectual, and unprofitable. Its administrators hide away in Paris or decaying, walled compounds in Tananarive while German soldiers, acting on behalf of the French regime, mete out random acts of violence against locals. Even as politicians use their lordship over Madagascar to demonstrate their status as a great power, it remains unclear how long this shambling system can endure."

 MAD_military_commission_for_madagascar: "Military Commission for Madagascar"
 MAD_military_commission_for_madagascar_desc: "It is no secret that 'French Madagascar' only exists within an ignored legal framework and in the minds of the most foolish Frenchman. The Reich, in reality, fires all of the shots, with the old colonial administration being just window dressing. The Reich exerts its power through two organizations, the Militärkommission Madagaskar and the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten. The former leads and organizes Germany's military presence on the island, while the latter assists the French administration in day-to-day governance. Over time they have taken a more prominent role in the running of the colony, leading to France's influence slipping further. Germany runs Madagascar in all but name, and time will tell if even this will remain the case."

 MAD_disloyal_gendarmerie: "Disloyal Gendarmerie"
 MAD_disloyal_gendarmerie_desc: "France's 'rule' over Madagascar is more sympathetic to the natives than the Germans would prefer it to be. Many native collaborators help police the island, a relic from the days of the French Republic, and the necessity for more men to keep order. The MvM has increasingly been performing duties these collaborators otherwise would, which has created much tension between German troops and Natives. The anti-colonial sentiment is simmering as more natives are pushed out of their second-class status. If this lid is to be blown off, it could spell the end of the colony."

 MAD_secret_societies: "Secret Societies"
 MAD_secret_societies_desc: "Government infrastructure and plantations have seen an increase in attacks from nationalist secret societies over several years, diluting the already tiny amount of profit to be made from the colony. Outside of the areas of French control, the rest of the country is a wild west, where any group of natives could be plotting to pillage the colony or outright destroy it. These security breaches have only further fueled the MvM's influence within Madagascar, and it's becoming increasingly likely that these forces will soon directly clash."

 MAD_tsiazombazaha: "Tsiazombazaha"
 MAD_tsiazombazaha_desc: ""That which is inaccessible to Europeans". The word is apt for Madagascar's state today, though there isn't much left that fits. Seven decades of colonial oppression has sliced through all which the Malagasy have held dear, stealing resources from the ground and shipping it off to distant lands for profit that will never touch the land that bore it to begin with. Yet, though the physical island has been pillaged, the will of her people to break free of its miserable state has never - and will never - be extinguished.\n\nIt flared in the initial invasions of the late 1800's, when dogged resistance in the face of an insurmountable force stymied French efforts for years. It flared again in the post-war chaos where independence groups rose in force against their weakened colonial administrators. Now, once again, the Malagasy people rise to overthrow their oppressors and reclaim the free Madagascar which they have dreamed of for so long."

 MAD_neverending_supply_crisis: "Never-Ending Supply Crisis"
 MAD_neverending_supply_crisis_desc: "The geography of Madagascar and the shoddy state of its infrastructure does logistics networks no good at all. With a spine of mountains and highlands slicing across the island's length and forcing most supply lines into valleys and passes, the threat of ambushes and raiding is everpresent in times of conflict. Additionally, the poorly-maintained roads often devolve into muddy pools of slurry under excessive use, and the rail infrastructure is laughably out of date.\n\nAll this is hard enough without the added strain of our supplies coming from foreign sources across the sea. If we wish to sustain our campaign, we will have to effectively raid our better-armed opponents for what they have, lest we wither on the vine without their involuntary help."

Only when working together and pooling their limited resources can they truly have an opportunity to free their homeland and drive the colonizers out into the ocean.\n\nThis is an arrangement that's easier said than done. Frankly, there will always be tension between the groups, and that will lead to problems for as long as this faction holds. For now, though, the presence of the Germans binds these disparate groups together. What happens when that binding is cut will be left for the future to decide.§!"

 MDG_generalburo: "Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten"
 MDG_generalburo_desc: "Governing in all but name under the French Administration, the GfMA has finally done away with that facade altogether. In response to the rising threat of native takeover, such pleasantries were disposed of, corners needed to be cut, and now the Reich can eliminate the nationalist threat for good. The GfMA leads not through negotiation or appeasement but through force. The rights of natives have declined, with the only concern of the Reich's being that of enriching themselves as much as possible before their hold over the island becomes untenable - Creating a far more horrid situation in the process."

 MDG_neverending_supply_crisis: "Never-Ending Supply Crisis"
 MDG_neverending_supply_crisis_desc: "Madagascar's geography makes a reliable supply chain across the island impossible, and the native rebels occupying the countryside further exacerbate this problem. Transport between the pockets of German control often yields a shipment lost before it ever reaches its destination. Any expansion inland or any reliable resource extraction has been made impossible, and those back in Germany are losing faith in the colony's usefulness. Without this issue being dealt with, the Reich could pull its support altogether!"

Outside of the areas of French control, the rest of the country is a wild west, where any group of natives could be plotting to pillage the colony or outright destroy it. These security breaches have only further fueled the MvM's influence within Madagascar, and it's becoming increasingly likely that these forces will soon directly crash."

The highland passes have never been particularly close to the coastal cities, but now they have been plunged into an unsteady anarchy - a mass of villages waiting for order of some sort to be restored. It lies in the hands of this conflict's sides to take these positions while they have the chance, lest their rivals take them first."

 POLITICS_EMIL_MAURICE_DESC: "Amidst the wreckage of Tuléar and the flames engulfing Madagascar, Emil Maurice wonders where it all went wrong.\n\nClose friend to the Führer himself, Maurice had a relatively good life before the war. Having served in the SA during the Kampfzeit before being made #2 of the SS and promoted to Hitler's permanent chauffeur, it came as a shock when his Jewish heritage was revealed, and despite his quick proclamation as an honorary Aryan, by the time the Reich's shadow had fallen across all Europe, few wished to keep such a man in Germania. In order to keep Hitler's ear clean of any wormed tongues, the "royal advisor" was kicked upstairs to oversee the French-owned territory of Madagascar under the vestige of the "Militärkommission von Madagaskar"— a position no man wanted.\n\nMaurice's fears were all but confirmed upon touching down in Tananarive, as his apathy grew in equal volume to the protests against colonial rule. Now, facing total revolution, the chickens of indifference have come home to roost, and with the MvM as the last line of defense for the European order on the island, the thoughts running through Maurice's head have become a single cry: "How do I get out of this alive?""

 MDG_Erhard_Milch: "Erhard Milch"
 POLITICS_ERHARD_MILCH_DESC: "One of the primary architects of the Luftwaffe, Field Marshal Erhard Milch, now finds himself as the de facto leader of the German military forces on the island of Madagascar, a remarkable fall from grace for a man once seen as one of Reichsmarshall Göring's closest supporters. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Milch was made the State Secretary for the Reich Ministry of Aviation, overseeing the development of new aircraft for the nascent Luftwaffe before being bestowed the office of Inspector-General of the Luftwaffe in 1939.\n\nDuring the War, Milch added the position of Generalluftzeugmeister to his litany of offices following the suicide of Ernst Udet in November 1941, placing him in charge of the Luftwaffe's aircraft production and logistics, and was further nominated to the newly established Central Planning Board by Göring in April 1942. Serving alongside Albert Speer for the duration of the body's existence, Milch saw success in increasing Germany's total aircraft output, albeit with some sacrifices in quality, and continued to hold his positions with little to no issue for the remainder of the 1940s and early 1950s. Conflict, however, emerged between him and the Reichsmarshall with the stagnation of the Luftwaffe as a force in the mid-1950s, and would culminate in Göring stripping him of his offices, with him only remaining in the Luftwaffe due to his wartime connections with Albert Speer, who, as a personal confidant of Hitler, managed to convince the Führer to retain Milch as a Field Marshal, albeit with no assignments or duties.\n\nNot wanting his former subordinate to cozy up with any rival political factions in an attempt to oust or outmaneuver him, Göring would manage to secure Milch's assignment to the semi-important post as the head of the Militärkommission von Madagaskar, where he would be primarily responsible for the organization and maintenance of the Luftwaffe's nuclear bombers in the Indian Ocean. To some, this position would seem a little too powerful for a disgraced Field Marshal, but nonetheless, it did its job in keeping Milch away from Germany.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Malagasy Revolt seeing the GfMA assume total control over the vestigial colonial government, Milch was left as the highest-ranking military official on the island, in charge of coordinating the response to rebellion under the nominal control of the weak-willed Emil Maurice, who himself would be placed under de facto house-arrest following the death of Adolf Hitler. Now, as the revolt proceeds into a new phase, Milch seeks to deliver one more victory for the Reich so that he can return from his virtual exile in good standing with the government and hopefully retire to live out his remaining days in peace."

Following the apathetic tenure of Emil Maurice as governor, the two arms of the Reich in Madagascar asserted control over the island. The German civilian administration linked hands with the German garrison to form the larger Paktkommission, charged with the governance of allied territory in Madagascar.\n\nThe Paktkommission is currently a pseudo-diarchy, with a loosely-defined council at its head. One arm, the Militärkommission von Madagaskar, is the former German garrison turned into a conquering army, securing territory for the Paktkommission. Its other arm is the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten, responsible for German civilian administration of the island, organising supplies and overseeing public works - in this time of war, that means foxholes, fortifications and mass graves.\n\nAt present, there is no leader of the Paktkommission, an issue which its council is attempting to resolve. While an early frontrunner in Erhard Milch has emerged, his ascension has yet to be confirmed by the Reich, currently drowning in conflict. Still, the Paktkommission knows what it needs to do: establish German control over the entire land. A blood-gorged thresher whirls across Madagascar, awaiting a new driver."

The Kriegsmarine had caught on to the flow of weapons and supplies coming to Madagascar and was intent on putting a stop to it. An iron curtain had surrounded his island, but fortunately for Beriziky, this curtain had holes.\n\nAfter a few hours the German ship was a safe distance away and Beriziky set sail yet again. His small fishing boat, The Painted Lemur couldn't carry much, but what it could fit in its hold was far more valuable than the tuna he was catching before the uprising. Its small size was to the Lemur's advantage, though. In the age of radar and aircraft, few objects above the surface could truly escape notice, a fact the Germans were all too aware of. The ships they sent out were meant to instill fear into smugglers, but they hardly had enough to patrol the whole coastline. Thus blockade running became a game of patience and speed which Beriziky and the Lemur had plenty of.\n\nIn fact Beriziky almost wanted to thank the Germans, for without their constant presence Beriziky's shadowy clients and doubly shadowy suppliers would not be him a quarter as well as what he was receiving now.

The night sky was lit up by fireworks, and all around them was a triumphant cheer. Come tomorrow, they would fight to maintain influence over this island; but on this night, in the warm glow of victory, they shared beers together and swapped stories of their countries. Their eyes turned to the street, where a jubilant nation held the new national flag high.\n\n"Good for them," said Whitney, hand on his stubbled face.\n\n"Hmm," murmured Meguro, taking a sip of his beer, "good for them."\n\nHours ago, the final German base surrendered. Its garrison was disarmed, and its men were lucky that they were being shoved onto ships bound for Ostafrika. At a conference on the steps of the Rova in Tananarive, representatives from PADESM and TAFAMA declared Madagascar to be a sovereign, independent republic to the joy and relief of a once-devastated nation. In front of them now lay the long road to recovery, one that the Malagasy people would gladly walk.\n\nWhen the festivities die down, they will not suffer a hangover. They will rise with the sun and work with a light heart and an indomitable will. There is much work to be done - cities have half-collapsed in the fighting, farms have been pillaged to feed army after army - but they shall endeavour to rebuild their country.

The PADESM representative stood mere meters from Albert Razafy's position distracted by the cheering crowd of recently liberated Malagasy, hypnotized by the euphoria of victory. One shot from his looted Mauser and the crowd would be covered in the magistrate's brains. He and his comrades had planned this moment to the last detail, this farcical constitutional congress must be stopped lest US power cement itself in Madagascar forever. And yet, despite his hate for PADESM and its imperialist masters in Washington, he could not bring himself to pull the trigger.\n\nIt was not because of the representative's speech, with its vague promises of democracy and liberty, no it was the people. Razafy had fought all these years for one reason and one reason alone, to see his people free from the Franco-German boot. And while the people had been swayed by the bribes and honeyed words of the capitalist west, he could not deny these were free men, with easy smiles and a joy in their eyes that had been absent from the country for decades. Was that enough? For some in TAFAMA it would never be enough, radicals and militants still urged for the fight to continue until the imperialists were cast into the sea, damning their own party to fragmentation.\n\nUntil a few moments ago Rafazy held this same position, but now it seemed so petty and selfish to try and deny his people their hard-earned peace over mere political disagreement. He suddenly understood the TAFAMA members who had abandoned their bunkers and come to the convention to try and work with PADESM, to build a new country, even if in doing so they fractured the party just as much as radicals.\n\nRafazy wasn't sure where he stood now, but he did know he could not kill this man.

 MAD_vic.105.desc: "In the great banquet hall that housed Madagascar's constitutional convention, delegates paced and murmured, schemed and horse-traded, shouted and argued over the future direction of their country. The hall is abuzz with the nervous energy of a once-colonised people debating their newly-won destinies.\n\nIt is TAFAMA that won the day; their delegates argued for their clauses and won their votes to implement their articles in what would ultimately be their constitution. "The sovereign Malagasy People," it began, "convinced of the necessity of the Malagasy society to recover its originality, its authenticity and its Malagasy character..." On it went, this declaration of sovereign rule. It is a nationalist constitution, a proclamation of a society which eschewed its colonial roots in favour of a uniquely Malagasy character.\n\nTAFAMA's opposition had no direct objection to this - what perturbed them more were the provisions and articles in the constitution supporting a strong executive, and what they believed was a heavy-handed approach to decolonisation. Having attempted to institute a federal government similar to their American backers, PADESM simply did not have the support necessary to implement this. Reluctantly they signed to maintain peace in the nation, some aware they were signing their own political death warrants.\n\nThose PADESM delegates who refused to sign attempted to contest the result. They tried to take the floor and demand recounts, revisions and reassessments. To this, the TAFAMA delegates smiled and looked at the hastily-assembled judges, the first of them sworn in by allied officials minutes after the constitution was signed. The articles affirming the new Republic's commitment to anti-colonialism are clear: PADESM—the big tent painted blue, white and red—is recognised as a colonial organisation and banned from Malagasy politics.

Who else but the man who lit the fires that burned away the old colonial order could be trusted to lead the nation into the future? Such was the thoughts that propelled Gilles Andriamahazo to the office of the presidency, an office he gladly occupied.\n\nMost Malagasy heard him on the radio, proclaiming a new era for them and their nation. They stopped work, huddled around radio sets, tuned into government stations and heard their new president speak of a great many promises: democracy, justice, security—and, above all, sovereignty. Never again, Andriamahazo proclaimed, would Madagascar fall under a foreign yoke.\n\nThe next day, President Andriamahazo opened the inaugural plenary meeting of the National Assembly, the new parliament of Madagascar. The first order of business in this esteemed hall was to repay an old friend for the kindness they bestowed Madagascar in its struggle for independence. A motion was passed commending the Co-Prosperity Sphere for their commitment to the African anti-colonial struggle, and the next day President Andriamahazo sent an official diplomatic cable asking for a meeting with a Japanese diplomat.

Evenly matched, the factions could not reach the clear majority needed to guarantee victory. This only led to more arguments, within and without. In a short time, the entire interim government was paralysed by bickering.\n\nThey bickered so much that they didn't notice the crowd outside until it was too late.\n\nOne day, after the patience of the Malagasy had run out, a wave of bodies stormed into the convention hall. They bore guns and shields, beating back security and corralling every delegate into the convention hall. Then a man - they hadn't seen him before, likely an emissary of a more prominent figure - stood on stage declared this constitutional convention null and void. TAFAMA and PADESM delegates were brought out of the hall in chains as AKFM took their place, heirs to the gridlock.\n\nSome are bold enough to call it a Third Malagasy Uprising, though the revolutionaries who now occupy Tananarive prefer to call it the end of the second—the moment when the people cut through the internecine debating of an incipient bourgeoisie and took command of their own destinies."

 MAD_vic.108.desc: "Just a few years of the 20th century has been more than enough for much of the world, so it is hard to imagine what it looked like millions of years ago. As dinosaurs began to rule the earth over a hundred and thirty five millions of years ago, the supercontinent of Gondwana broke apart as an enormous Eastern section split and drifted northwards. A geologically short fifty seven million years later, as the King of the Tyrant Lizards and the three horned Triceratops battled for the earth, that section split again. The larger section would later crash into the continent of Asia, creating some of the highest mountains on earth and forming a peninsula with an equally sizable impact on the human race. As for the other piece, it sat in blissful environmental solitude. But then came man.\n\nThe plains burned, the animals scattered, and the jungle was brought low as the ire and technological might of man was brought on itself and the islands. Some felt the island was destroyed beyond all usefulness with the husks of trees and ruined farms abounding. But they forgot what force ruled this island long before the so-called "Great" and "Super" powers.\n\nIt would be useless to mention the particular species of animal that poked around the wreckage of what mankind had wrought. Madagascar is home to thousands of species that are as unique to it as any other one of them. Hundreds of bird species flew over the battlefields and rested in the ash. The chameleons climbed through the vehicles, imitating the ash and steel surroundings. The cat-like fossa searched for prey in the trenches and foxholes. And hanging off the guns and cannons were the lemurs, the primates who had long mastered these islands.\n\nSoon the Flora would follow the parade of Fauna. Grassland in the central highlands, rainforest in the east, and deciduous forest in the west would reclaim their battered homelands. Everywhere would sprout the flowering plants, most notably the vast variety of orchids. And eventually this land would again grow the baobab and Traveler's Palm that the island was so known for.\n\nThe soldiers would fade away, the wreckage rust into the dirt, but the island would go on. Soon this environmental catastrophe would be put away for good, and the unique environment of Madagascar would continue as it always had."

 MAD_vic.109.t: "Beloved Land of the Forefathers"
 MAD_vic.109.desc: "It is a human condition to assume the people in a geographic area share similar traits, practices, and beliefs. This is more correct in small areas, but less so when talking about larger areas, especially if one does not know much of the area in question. Thus it is tempting to assume, as does Long Island, Hawaii, or Kyushu, so does the second largest island nation on earth. However, this misconception about Madagascar often hinders efforts to understand the land.\n\nFor starters, the people of Madagascar are not entirely "African" despite being lumped in with the continent. Archeology has found much of the original settlers of the landmass were ocean goers from Borneo, while the Southeast African Bantu peoples only began to settle and intermingle with the population later on. Despite largely blending with one another, there still remain some particular differences based on geographic location. Generally the inhabitants can be split into two groups, with the coastal population having much more African ancestry than the highlanders.\n\nWhen the Arab and European traders arrived, these coastal kingdoms grew rich and powerful. One of them, the Merina, would conquer the island in the early 1800s, uniting it for the first time. Of course, even the later attempts at modernizing the country couldn't save it from the French deciding to colonize it later that century. While the nation often suffered colonial turmoil, the plantation system, and forced labor, much of the pre-colonial government was fit into the colonial structure, and the addition of French schools created opportunities for those willing to work alongside the motherland.\n\nSo, today Madagascar carries that legacy in many ways. The Marina, those who once ruled the island, are very nationalist and anti-colonialist, and make up the center of TAFAMA. PADESM, on the other hand, is the home to the Francophile intellectuals and northern coast peoples who have a more rosy view of the colonial period. This important distinction goes to show not every political fight is cooked up by the superpowers of the world."

Exhausted, tired, they trudge away, not even bothering to see their handiwork as a jet plane takes to the sky on its test run before it is accepted into the IJA air force. The body that casts the shadow over the workers contains Titanium, the turbines that roar into their ears built from Cobalt alloys. Both of which come from Madagascar."

 MAD_vic.112.desc: "TOP SECRET [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nSUBJECT: THERMIDOR; Progress of the Coup d'Etat in Antananarivo\n\n1. As of 1100 Antananarivo time today, General Ramanantsoa telephoned Colonel McCloseky, MACM J-3, stating that the general staff was with him at Antananarivo Air Base and that a coup was underway. Soon after, reports were received that coup forces had taken control of key installations, such as the defense ministry, central police, and radio station. Coup forces appear to be principally armoured and airborne elements.\n...\n4. General Ramanantsoa called President Raseta again at 1645 Antananarivo time to demand his resignation, but Raseta hung up without further comment. Ramanantsoa was reported to have given orders to bomb the residence...\n\n5. Coup troops began attacking Ambohitsorohitra Palace and expect to take control at 1800 Antananarivo time... General Ramanantsoa was reported to have given Raseta one last chance to surrender before being "blasted from this earth." At 1800 hours multiple explosions were heard in the vicinity of the palace.\n\n6. Earlier in the afternoon, Raseta called Ambassador Ferguson at 1630 hours, asking about the American position... Ferguson told Raseta that he heard the coup leaders had offered Raseta safe passage out of the country and asked Raseta. Raseta's only comment was that he was the President and he had his duty to the people.\n...\n10. Careful planning by the coup group is further indicated by reports elsewhere that shows the military appears to be in charge; at Toamasina leaflets signed by General Ramanantsoa have already been distributed proclaiming the new government and its commitment to freedom and democratic rule."

Thereafter, siege was laid against Antananarivo Air Base and government forces began requesting the surrender of General Ramanantsoa and his forces. At around the same time there were reports that Ramanantsoa was preparing to announce his immediate surrender, but there has been no firm developments on this point as of yet. There was also a broadcast from the presidential palace denouncing "western powers."\n...\n6. Troop movements reported around Antananarivo indicate that most major combat units adjacent to the capital are supporting the government... elements previously identified as being loyal to Ramanantsoa have been confined to barracks.\n...\n8. President Raseta has indicated his intention to further align his government with Japan. Prominent pro-American opposition figures have been imprisoned or placed under house arrest.

 MAD_vic.2.desc: "Erhard Milch typically did not venture this far west, urged by his advisors and bodyguards to remain on the east coast, where they had greater control. But after their great victory, he told them all that he should take a tour of the island, meet the new garrisons and convince them that he would not rule with his predecessor's weak heart.\n\nSo his driver took him west, to the coastal city of Tuléar, where Milch witnessed the fruits of his labours. The city had been suppressed, the docks seized and a new Kriegsmarine base was in construction. Naval power projection along the East African coast would be secured. Milch took a tour, rattled off some bullshit about the Aryan spirit, and left the marines a little more secure in their victory. He paid no attention to the Malagasy workers building that base, pushing their bodies beyond their capacity to meet the Germans' brutal expectations, subjected to abuse after abuse by their overseers.\n\nAs they crossed into Boulevard Lyautey, he saw how they were broadcasting that victory to the natives: a hotel on the corner reappropriated as a temporary garrison headquarters was festooned with the hanging bodies of dead militants. His aide told them that they were new: AKFM, apparently, who tried to bomb the hotel. Milch smiled.\n\nThe Germans know that the natives will never put down their arms. Milch thinks that's fine by him: anti-partisan operations have been the bread and butter of the Heer since the end of the Second World War, and his boys will always need the practice. What matters is that this cursed island and the rest of the world know who is Madagaskar's new master."

 MAD_vic.200.t: "Through Blood and Sweat"
 MAD_vic.200.desc: "German propaganda has long touted the ideal overman as a self- reliant soldier and farmer bound to the soil by his race and blood, but the pinnacle of this in real life is not to be found in the Germanic homelands or the eastern territories but with the poor Malagasy vanilla farmer. Reserving a small plot of second-best land for himself, he has to work hard for his crop, which is only purchased by one company for a low price. When he does get his money, he has no bank, so he has to choose between sleeping in his house with a knife to keep his pay, or in the field with a knife to save his crop.\n\nThe vanilla plantations don't have such problems. They are watched over by armed men who make sure the natives are not able to rob the valuable beans. And to make sure this threat doesn't come from outside or within. Or that the workers are only taking as much time as they should to delicately hand fertilize the plant. These mercenaries do not take kindly to those who slack around or damage too much of the crop. Every pitiful wage these workers get must be fairly earned.\n\nThis valuable spice is loaded onto trucks and sent to the ports of Madagascar. In a few days time these same beans will arrive in the ports of Europe. Some will go to the traditional market of France. But others will go to the master of Europe. There the beans will fetch a hefty sum for the barons of the industry, as every family that can afford it thinks themselves lucky they can afford a tropical delicacy. And they find themselves in a struggle for favoritism with the chemical manufacturers who want to spread cheaper vanillin to the Deutsches Volk.\n\nThe argument over if the stolen fruits of Malagasy or Polish labor are the most National Socialist encapsulates the economic situation of the colony. For the Einheitspakt is indeed united, as the serf farmer and slave miner and captive worker suffers the same regardless of location or race."

He had been sleepwalking through the German victory, not wishing to pull his head out from the covers and witness the last humiliation suffered by the French empire.\n\nArmand Annet paused, reading through the agreement. Milch frowned, but Annet ignored him. He'd been doing Germany's bidding for years, and it ought to have purchased him a little bit more of Milch's time. The agreement outlined the ceding of Madagaskar to the Greater German Reich: French colonial forces would be disarmed or folded into auxiliary forces of the Heer and administration of the colony would now fall under the Reich's appointed governor, currently impatiently tapping his foot at this moment. He signed it and passed it along.\n\nWhen he received the agreement, Léon Cayla took one look at the other three names who had signed it. The Old Quatuor had tried their best, but what could a colony do without a metropole supporting it? He supposed that was what de Gaulle, the old bastard, was learning. Still, they had tried their best, but they were powerless in the face of German influence. Nothing to be done about it, all he had to do was put his name next to Annet's, Nouailhetas' and-\n\n"Where is Boisson?" he asked.\n\n"Oh, he's already signed the agreement." He pointed to the paper, which bore a signature they all knew wasn't his. "If you'd please, Mr. Cayla." Cayla grimaced, and put pen to paper. What remained of his strength poured out in the ink as he put his name to this declaration of surrender."

 MAD.601.desc: "Panzers rolled down the streets of Tamatave, soldiers marched down the alleyways and opened fire on anyone vaguely threatening. The German garrison mobilised to lock down the city, to hold the people in their homes and shoot anyone who dared to question them. You might think that there were still militants here, but no, look closer at the uniforms of the men who open fire on the Germans: tirailleurs, bearing the flag of France.\n\nDespite the German victory, France still maintained extensive ties in Madagascar. Its administration was still staffed by the French, it was French capital that dominated the economic landscape of the island. Thanks to the efforts of the Old Quatour, the venerable French statesmen who had kept their influence strong during the Second Malagasy Uprising, Madagascar's old masters held the reins of the state firm.\n\nWhat the Germans were doing was nothing short of illegal, a blatant violation of the Treaty of Vichy, but it didn't seem like anyone would care. The Germans would fabricate some documents, falsify some sedition, and the rest of the world would shrug its shoulders and consider it an internal matter. Tanks opened fire on the French administration building, artillery shells raining down on the last bastion of French control. The Old Quatour took this moment in the chaos to flee. They made it as far as the parking lot, where an armed convoy was waiting to spirit them away to the airport, when a tank broke through the gates and fired a shell at their truck. The explosion knocked them on their feet, and when they rose they heard German voices through the smoke.\n\n"Gentlemen," said Erhard Milch, emerging from that smoke, flanked by German soldiers pointing their guns at what remained of the Old Quatour. "I have a letter for you." He held in his hands a declaration of surrender, of ceding Madagaskar to the Reich. "Sign it, and we can put this ugliness behind us.""

He stood underneath the great neoclassical buildings of the new city, the enduring columns supporting simple, honest designs, stripped of decadent ornamentation, and felt a strange sadness overcome him. He was home, for the first time in a long time - but each step he walked filled him with a greater sorrow, knowing that he would soon have to leave, and that he might never return again. When Milch walked, he felt the weight of age on his joints, his limbs. He wondered how long he had left in him, and what state he would leave Madagaskar when he went.\n\nStill, in his twilight years, Erhard Milch was given one last hurrah. Germany welcomed him with a return befitting a hero: a parade through the Brandenburg Gate, a round of flattering media coverage in the Reich's state media, culminating in a speech given by [GER.GetLeader] himself in the Volkshalle, celebrating Milch's virtues and victories in foreign lands.\n\nWith German control secured on the island, the Führer bestowed upon the old marshal a great honour: the first Reichkommissar of Madagaskar. Milch took the platform, and addressed the thousands before him. Germany had given him a script, but he didn't mind reciting it. He accepted whatever had to be done to secure this reward. At the end, [GER.GetLeader] gave him a symbol of office, and offered his hand.\n\nAnd as Milch accepted his hand, [GER.GetLeader] pulled him close and whispered: "There's eyes on you and your island. We still remember all the questions about your blood. Don't fuck this up, or I'll reopen them myself.""

The black blood of the modern economy rises in price and scarcity with the coming of the Oil Crisis. No matter how much it thirsts, Madagascar is simply too poor to afford the ever-increasing price.\n\nFor a country that has only recently emerged from the long shadow of colonialism, the Oil Crisis was a catastrophe to its fragile economy. Along with the price of oil, the price of basic goods rises—in some lucky parts of the country, it is only threefold; in others, it would be cheaper to steal a loaf of bread and spend the next few months in jail than to pay at the price set by the terrified merchant. Runaway inflation, curtailed economic growth, hoarding of necessities and luxuries alike; these are the new horrors which have come to visit the new Republic.\n\nAnd in the streets of Madagascar's cities, unrest brews against the current government. The promises between the people and their new government have been broken. There's no security or justice anymore, only famine and hardship. Once, it was inflicted by foreign oppressors. Now, even in their hardwon independence, they suffer the same problems."

The OFN had been their ally in the reclamation of the island from French and German tyranny, and now it was time to repay the favour. The National Assembly passes appeal after appeal for assistance, and in private conversations in the American assembly, Madagascar offers to cut away pieces of itself for survival. Military bases, radar stations, foreign investment with generous tax and regulation exemptions; whatever the Americans wanted, as long as Madagascar could survive.\n\nThe American embassy already had a wish-list, like a child at Christmas, but they were conscious of their limits. In truth, they felt like Madagascar was turning into a black hole, a giant pile of money to which the Oil Crisis took a match. Maybe smothering the fire with even more money might extinguish it. Maybe they'll just let it burn itself out; it won't consume the entire country, right? After much deliberation in the fortified compound of the American embassy, a cable requesting assistance was sent to the State Department. Their reply was succinct, clear and quick:"

Though aware that they are not part of the pan-Asian experiment, they appeal to those fundamental principles for support. In more private conversations, Madagascar starts to offer more involvement in the Sphere: more military bases, more foreign investment, more naval outposts for Japan to project power in Africa. Anything to save them from collapse.\n\nThe Japanese embassy received yet another message from the Madagascar government, and their ambassador finally decided to act. Until now, events in Asia have kept the Home Islands' attention confined to that continent. Africa barely got a second glance. But with protests increasing and shortages continuing, he could no longer stay silent on the matter. If they do not act now, they risk losing the entire island.

 MAD.403.t: "Madagascar's AREMA Problem"
 MAD.403.desc: "In northern Madagascar, in a little town called Ankerika, local government agents were forcibly removed from their posts. Farmers with rifles and local labourers in a revolutionary frenzy stormed the town hall, driving everyone associated with the government out of the building and sending them on trucks bound for nearby Antsohihy. Their property was confiscated, their hoards were distributed, their land was seized—all for a people that the national government had failed to protect during this Oil Crisis. One brash young revolutionary had given the mayor a little bell and placard to wear around his neck on the march to Antsohihy: "I BETRAYED THE PEOPLE AND HAVE BEEN PUNISHED BY THE VANGUARDS OF THE REVOLUTION."\n\nAREMA, the Vanguard of the Malagasy Revolution, was a growing thorn in the side of the new Republic: a communist insurgency arising in the excessive want of modern Madagascar. The conservatives, liberals and social democrats that comprised the National Assembly had all passed resolutions and statements denouncing their revolts and their efforts to turn the weekly protests against the government towards revolution, but this did not slow their momentum. Rural revolts against landowners and their protectors in the police continued, and though the reaction could be swift and decisive, stopping one revolt led to two more later on.\n\nIn a smoke-filled consulate room, debates rage on. Have they given too much support? Too little? A panicked message was sent back home, asking for direction, and in the dead of night, someone in the consulate received a reply:"

 MAD.404.t: "Ending The Madagascar Crisis"
 MAD.404.desc: "For what did the Malagasy people protest? You could point to their slogans, their placards. They wanted justice, security, freedom—but really, all they wanted was bread. This all started because of the Oil Crisis, when the young republic's economy cratered, and all it took for the protests and the revolts to disperse was to bring that economy back.\n\nWhen foreign aid came in shipping containers, the government knew how to distribute it. They favoured strongholds of government control, letting the AREMA revolts starve while their own survived the famine. Where the militants scattered, government trucks bearing food and money replaced them. Slowly, but almost inexorably, the economy stabilised, inflation decreased, and growth resumed. The famines abated with the return of cheap fertiliser and hands to till the soil; as if by some miracle, some of the early harvests were greater than expected.\n\nAs for the loftier promises, the ones in the slogans and on the placards, those too were implemented. The government had no choice in the matter: feeding the people could delay future protests, but it was going to take serious political reforms to disperse them entirely. Local protest leaders and organisers met with government officials to hash out a kind of peace agreement, seeking rights for the people that they could never have otherwise secured. There was only one non-negotiable condition the organisers had with the government: the talks had to be held in their native Malagasy, and not the aristocratic French that so often dominated the halls of the National Assembly. The politicians agreed."

 MAD.405.t: "The Suppression of Madagascar"
 MAD.405.desc: "The protest in Tananarive began, as it always did, from Analakely Market. It was just off-centre, but it was always a bustling location—and with the economic downturn of the Oil Crisis, there was little business to disrupt.\n\nThis time, however, they didn't get far. Police in riot gear stopped the protest at the roundabout around Lac Behoririka. They locked down the four connecting roads with trucks and shields, penned the protesters in like cattle. Their anger had been threatening to overflow for weeks, and this quick containment seemed to be the perfect pressure cooker for popular anger to explode. Shouting turned into throwing garbage towards the cops, which turned into throwing bricks against their shields, finally turning into an attempt by some foolhardy protesters to break through the police cordon.\n\nThen, as the cops beat their batons against the shields and closed in, the protesters came to a collective, horrified realisation: the writing on the front of those shields was neither Malagasy nor French.\n\nSo ended the troubles of Madagascar, here and in cities all over the island. Police forces in every major city used their new tools to hold down the protesters, until they tired out and dispersed. Malagasy soldiers held foreign arms to suppress local revolts. AREMA militants, still using hand-me-down weapons from the French and German garrisons, were powerless against modern weaponry held by an army trained by a superpower. The revolution ended before it could begin, and though in time the economic woes of the Oil Crisis would abate, the Malagasy people would not forget this period of bloodshed."
 MAD.405.a: "But as far as the rest of the world was concerned, the crisis was over."

 MAD.406.t: "The Rotaka"
 MAD.406.desc: "There were two major fronts to the protests in Madagascar: the students in the cities, agitating for political change and ridding their institutions of colonial interference, past and present; and the farmers in the rural regions, demanding financial assistance to save their farms before all the arable land went fallow. Combining the two was a general that saw many people join one or the other—whether or not they were personally attached to their causes, they were starving, and they wanted their voices to be heard.\n\nWho could say if the government had tried their best? Despite their claims that the rest of the world had abandoned them, all the people could see were politicians making excuses. As the protests grew into riots and revolts, as the Malagasy government failed to respond to the crises effectively, a new power was emerging in these protests. AREMA, who had already done well for themselves in organising revolts in the mountains, made inroads in the city protests, turning the conversation away from bread and peace and towards revolution.\n\nToliara was where the government overplayed its hand. There was a little farmer's protest, a few hundred labourers holding signs and marching down the main road. The government ordered it suppressed, and the police responded with exaggerated force. A dozen were killed, dozens more injured. Popular anger exploded. It all ended with the burning of the Hotel de Ville city hall, when the government realised that the rebellion could not be stopped. They had mounted some resistance, but the police were overwhelmed—and some, in a reflection of the second Malagasy Uprising, had joined the protesters. The more prominent politicians and bureaucrats fled to foreign shores, and AREMA was swept in on a wave of revolutionary fervor."

Vanilla, coffee, cloves; rosewood, ebony, mahogany. All their luxuries, once sold to the metropole, were rotting in storehouses. Now there was also talk of a famine on the horizon, of some illness ravaging the island's zebu ranches, of fertiliser shortages harming this year's harvest.\n\nThe report from the GfMA was clear: nobody was buying anything Madagaskar had to offer, and nobody was coming to sell what Madagaskar needed. Fuel costs alone made the trip unprofitable; who would be willing to spend precious oil travelling to a backwater like Madagaskar? Milch buried his wrinkled face in his hands, nails digging into the top of his brow. The morning sun snuck through the gaps in his blinds like a thief, painfully reminding the Reichskommissar that it was still early in the day, and a thousand other crises could join the ones on his desk.\n\nThe natives could starve for all Milch cared, but it was the garrison that weighed heaviest on his mind. Already there were rumblings of dissatisfaction, the same that propelled him into power. He had tried to suppress them with honeyed words and petty bribes as much as possible, but that had already been a substantial cost when they had a revenue. Once the stockpiles ran out, once the garrison realised that there were no bullets or rations coming to Madagaskar any time soon, how would their frustrations manifest?\n\nTo say nothing of what the natives would do when they found out. Milch shuddered, pushed the report off the table as if it were casting a hex on him. He stood up and poured himself something stiff to calm his nerves, but after three glasses of the stuff he was no less frazzled."

Outside they could hear the chanting of Malagasy workers on strike, protesting an already-cruel regime turning to greater cruelties to maintain their position. He watched it from his third-floor office.\n\n"We've doubled patrols and guards around the palace, Reichskommissar," said an aide from the MvM who Milch thought had such promise once. "They won't break through our shields." Milch looked outside to confirm this. Though the military police held them back, the rage on the streets was a fire they could not seem to extinguish. One of the natives grabbed a rock and threw it at a shielded riot cop; it plinked against the metal harmlessly, but the police used it as cause to move in, advancing on the protesters and lashing out with their clubs.\n\nThe scene did not warm Milch's heart; he knew they would be back, and likely in greater numbers. He turned to his aides and held up a report. "And what's this I'm hearing about these native attacks? You assured me that the majority of resistance would be kept to little skirmishes," slamming the report down on his desk, his voice reaching a roar, "and now I'm hearing about an entire supply convoy stolen by these fucking rebels!"\n\n"The Oil Crisis... has them in a stir." The GfMA man spoke up, his wheezing and pausing grating Milch's nerves. "And with supplies... delayed, we are finding it difficult to... respond."\n\nMilch sat down at his desk, steepled his fingers and brought his head down in thought. "Supplies delayed" was a hell of a way to describe their position. The last supplies they received from Germania was months ago.

Abandon this island to the dogs?" Oh, how he wished he could do that, were it not for his pride.\n\n"Not all of it... We just... need to..." The man from the GfMA coughed into a handkerchief, folding it quickly so they did not see the blood. "We need to... consolidate.

"We'll let the men run rampant, take what they need and put down these revolts along the way!"\n\n"You want to pillage the entire island?"

In the cities, the streets were quiet - not out of fear, but because there weren't many people left to fill them. Once-bustling markets were emptied, with only a few stalls open, hollow-eyed merchants mumbling their way through the day's offerings. Soldiers walked through the streets to maintain order in a broken land.\n\nSuch was the price of Erhard Milch's victory. The German administration was staggered when they finalised the report and saw, in plain terms, the cost of maintaining power in RK Madagaskar. Estimates claimed it would take a decade, perhaps longer, for Madagaskar to return to pre-Oil Crisis levels, even with heavy investment. There were rumours of Germania's deep displeasure, with some high-profile bureaucrats even suggesting that it might have been better to lose the limb than leave it gangrenous.\n\nWhen confronted, Reichskommissar Erhard Milch tried to keep a positive attitude. "Well, with all those dead natives, this land will be easier to Germanise." But in the dead of night, when he locks himself in his office or his home, he feels crushed under the weight of his pyrrhic victory.

The man from GfMA could not contribute, for he was dead, strung up by those militants at the entrance to the Rova. Maybe it didn't matter. They were all the same to Erhard Milch, the same terrible mass he had been trying to put a collar around for years. He had failed, and now the natives were breaking free of the chains that had bound them since the Franco-Hova War.\n\nBut first, they broke down the door. In the darkness of the panic room, Milch could not make out the faces in front of him - only the dull gleam of their rifle barrels under a harsh emergency light. He was going to die here, and the RK was going to fall. A split second stretched out into an eternity. In the face of death, Milch realised he had only one thing left: to determine the words that he would leave this earth with, even if nobody would bother recording it. What was there to be said? Some final, cruel remark? A parting "Sieg Heil?" His mouth opened at the same time as the militants pulled the trigger."

 MAD.506.t: "Madagascar Lives"
 MAD.506.desc: "Tracer fire streaked the night sky of Diego-Suárez as Kriesgmarine troops landed on the northern peninsula. Boats crashed against the beaches as marines poured out from their holding pens, barking orders, storming the beach, and being cut down by local machine-gun fire. Cannons boomed as they delivered payload after payload against fortified positions. All the Germans knew how to do was to deliver a quick and forceful response, as they had learned in the years of their occupation. All you had to do was weather the sturm und drang.\n\nThe objective was to capture Andrakaka Airport, and use it as a base of operations from which they could take Diego-Suárez. But the three hundred marines had not expected such resistance out of, in their commander's words, "mere natives." They were pinned down on the beach, bunkering in their transport vessels, huddling in metal foxholes as they failed to capture more than a few inches of coastline.\n\nTwo hours of fighting was all it took for the Germans to retreat. Boats provided covering fire as surviving marines scurried back to their boats. Some tried suicidal advances, but their only reward was a swift death - it's only bravery if it succeeds, otherwise it's stupidity. If there was anything they learned that day, it was this lesson, paid for with the blood of young and stupid soldiers.\n\nBack on shore, the mood was ecstatic for a moment, until the first bombardment struck Diego-Suárez. Perhaps they should have expected the Germans to be sore losers. Soldiers rallied to the defense of the people, evacuating them and attempting counterfire with their own artillery pieces, scavenged remnants of the garrison. Even so, with all the damage the city sustained, the Malagasy people emerged from the ruins in high spirits. After decades of colonial oppression, they had regained their land and their destinies, and this successful defense ensured that it would all remain theirs."

 MAD_GER.1.t: "Overview of French Madagascar"
 MAD_GER.1.desc: "FOR DISSEMINATION TO RELEVANT PERSONNEL\n\nAN OVERVIEW ON FRENCH MADAGASCAR\n\nBRIEF HISTORY: The last remaining colony of the French Empire is one that is a colony in name only. Ever since the unsuccessful uprising by partisan groups supported by the United States and Empire of Japan in 1946, French influence has continued to fade as the German Reich acquired de facto control of the island in exchange for supporting the official colonial government.\n\nTHE GENERALBÜRO FÜR MADAGASSISCHE ANGELEGENHEITEN (GfMA): This office was formed as the principal civilian agency which manages Madagascar's civil affairs, oversees supplies, request public works development, and works with the French government.\n\nTHE MILITÄRKOMMISSION VON MADAGASKAR (MvM): Commanded by Emil Maurice, the MvM is responsible for overseeing the German security forces and maintaining naval bases used by the Kriegsmarine. They are responsible for managing security and operational matters for the island.\n\nTHE FRENCH ADMINISTRATION: While the French remain officially in control of the island, it is solely due to the support of the German Reich. While the French conduct administrative state functions, all final decisionmaking is managed by the GfMA and MvM.\n\nSTRATEGIC IMPORTANCE: The island of Madagascar serves as our largest link to the Indian Ocean, and is essential for German power projection in the region. Beyond this military significance, Madagascar does not have any additional economic value or exports of note.\n\nEND REPORT"
 MAD_GER.1.a: " A relic of a different era, with perhaps some use left."

 MAD_GER.2.t: "Security Concerns in Madagascar"
 MAD_GER.2.desc: "FOR IMMEDIATE DISSEMINATION AND ACTION\n\nCONCERNING SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY WITHIN MADAGASCAR\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: There are now confirmed reports of significant unrest and discontent throughout Madagascar. These reports are most prominent among the Malagasy plantation workers, which the GfMA has verified after investigating several claims. There have been numerous reports of strikes, sabotage, and in some cases attempted assassinations of plantation owners or German and French officials.\n\nThese concerning developments reflect a growing trend of violence and civil disobedience within the Malagasy population, independent of social class or position, almost certainly supported, if not spearheaded by Malagasy partisan groups. Lower-income individuals or workers have been more prone to engage in direct action and open defiance, while the Malagasy gendarmerie are engaging in more widespread civil disobedience - a nonetheless unprecedented show of defiance.\n\nThe MvM is struggling to handle the growing number of these incidents, and the French administrators have failed to present a solution to the growing discontent. Limited manpower, growing opposition, and inability of security forces to stem these incidents has emboldened more of the native population to engage in dissident or disruptive behavior.\n\nIt is clear that if action is not taken soon, the civil authority of the French will collapse completely, and force the GfMA to take full control of the colony. The potential for open large-scale conflict between MvM soldiers and Malagasy partisan groups will continue to grow should the situation continue to deteriorate. Support from Germania is requested to address this situation, and ensure our ability to maintain order in Madagascar."

 MAD_GER.3.t: "The Battle of Tananarive"
 MAD_GER.3.desc: "The Gendarmerie station on Lalana Karija fell silent; the eighty-three staff, predominantly Malagasy, that made up this district showed up for work, but locked themselves in the precinct. Blinds shuttered, gates locked, no uniforms emerged from that building. Immediately, the suspicions of the French were roused, and the Minister for the Gendarmerie sent an aide to investigate. He, too, walked into the building and did not emerge. When the colonial governor's aide requested assistance from the station on Lalana Dok, he was met only with silence. A second aide was told only to pass by and report back; the front gate was locked, the vehicles had been pulled into their garage, and not a soul seemed to stir in the building. Such was the mood of every other Gendarmerie precinct in Tananarive that day - stillness, silence, sedition.\n\nWhat little patience the French had for the local police after the Massacre on Rue de Rigny had finally evaporated. Tirailleurs were mobilised and sent to the Gendarmerie stations of the city, supplanted by forces from the German garrison itching for a fight, with one order: come out and do your jobs, or we'll drag you out by force. Then the shooting began. The gendarmes only had Berthier carbines and other hand-me-downs from the Second World War, but they fought fiercely, and they knew the city better than the tirailleurs and their German masters. Across the city, gendarmes and civilian sympathisers held running gun battles with colonial forces, barricading streets with sandbags and police vans, slowly approaching the nerve centre of the French colony.\n\nAnd from Tananarive, the fires of rebellion spread outward. The bravery of local police began to inspire others, activating militants and rebels that were once driven into the mountains, swelling their ranks with the dispossessed and the downtrodden. Even if the Europeans put down the gendarme's mutiny here, it's too late: the fire's already lit, and it's starting to burn down the oppressors of Madagascar."

He cursed under his breath, he drank to try to suppress his shaking hands, he even tried screaming into a pillow. None of it dampened the fire blazing through his nerves. Outside he could hear the sirens and the amplified orders of his men—his men!—who had taken their own initiative in seizing the island. It was that bastard Milch, it had to be! Sure, Maurice took his time with the response to the French colony's incompetence, he had to! They all knew he couldn't make a move without Germania's say-so. Couldn't they see how dangerous this was?\n\nMaurice flung himself into his couch in frustration, tried screaming into the pillow again and could barely get out a choked whimper. An hour ago, he received a telex from the Foreign Affairs Ministry. He was to expect a call very soon from Germania. Honestly, why they bothered to make him wait was beyond Maurice; just give him the dignity of being shot, instead of stuffing him into this limbo. The lights in his office seemed harsh, and Maurice kept the pillow over his head to protect himself from their punishing glow.\n\nThe phone rang. Primal fear seized Maurice, keeping him pinned to the couch. It rang once, twice, and then a greater fear jolted Maurice up from the couch and onto the receiver. "Maurice," he spat.\n\n"Militärkommissar," came a pleasant, if detached voice. "The Führer is concerned with recent developments in Madagaskar. He has agreed to... forgive your haste, so long as it yields a positive return."\n\nLucky man, thought Maurice. Lucky, lucky man. He nodded, caught some confidence again, and reassured the Foreign Ministry man that all was in hand. Order would be restored, and a more sensible government would take over the incompetent French administration. When he put down the phone, he trembled with excited nerves in his chair."

 MAD_GER.5.desc: "...swayed in the saline breeze, stripped of dignity, hanging from a tree branch behind the Hotel Melville. His body displayed many wounds. The scars were signs of war service; his age suggested Moskowien. The welts and abrasions were post-mortem, the result of local children pelting the dead oppressor with rocks. The final wound was the rope fastened tight around his neck, framed by panicked scratch marks. Two Malagasy detectives from the Gendarmerie completed their tour around the crime scene, assessing the body, interviewing witnesses, and found only a headache.\n\n"So, one dead Kraut," said the detective from the station on Boulevard Tintingue, "found swinging west of the Pangalanes at two in the morning. The witnesses report no altercations, no shouting. Shit, maybe he killed himself if it was that quiet."\n\n"No, whoever did it wanted to make a statement." The other detective from the station on Route de Melville drew a cigarette from his pocket, offered another to his partner, who waved him off. "They stripped him naked, marched him to the back and lynched him. Had to have been outnumbered." He took a drag, adding another cloud to the overcast sky.\n\n"And yet, nobody heard anything." The detective from Tintingue looked through his notebook. "There's another problem: the German garrison. If we don't give them someone soon, they're liable to string up the entire town in retaliation."\n\n"Well," said the detective from de Melville, "let's go find someone to pin this on before the Germans do." They drove away, leaving patrolmen to handle the scene. In spite of his gallows humour, the corpse weighed heavy on the detectives' minds. This was some kind of ill-considered revenge for everything the Germans put them through. The police had a few days to find them - five at most - and if they could not produce a suspect in time the garrison would be unleashed."
 MAD_GER.5.a: "Like flies to ointment, their consciences stuck to it."

 MAD_GER.6.t: "Cleaning Out the Rooms"
 MAD_GER.6.desc: ""Stop, Gendarmerie!" came the cry of the detective from the station on Boulevard Tintingue. He found the Germans drunk and high, snatching natives off the street. Whether or not they were involved with their commander's death seemed irrelevant; it was only an excuse to pull the trigger. They had lined up and taken five lives, and were poised to take five hundred more until the detective from Tintingue arrived.\n\nThe detective from the station on Route de Melville heard the exchange of gunfire and sprinted around the corner. Tintingue was pinned down, German soldiers firing into the street. They had not slept in days, spending every waking hour in desperate search for the men who killed the garrison commander, but the garrison's wrath had come early.\n\nDe Melville emerged from the back, flanking the Germans loosely focused on his partner. He opened fire, hitting one of them in the back, who slumped over in a confused heap. His comrades shouted something in German, and the bigger of the surviving duo whipped his body around and let off a burst of fire towards the detective.\n\nTintingue saw him go down, didn't know if he'd been wounded or killed. He roared, stuck his arm out of cover and fired. A lucky shot snapped another German's head back, and he too collapsed on the gravel. The survivor panicked and kept pulling the trigger on an empty magazine. Tintingue, also dry, rushed the survivor and tackled him to the ground. It was foolish - the stronger German overpowered him, and only one final bullet from de Melville saved Tintingue from a knife to the heart.\n\nThe Massacre on Rue de Rigny saw a furious German garrison demanding the detectives' heads. The Gendarmerie had no response: the men had vanished, the killers were still out there, and the Massacre had only solidified the hatred that drove the locals to string up a garrison commander on a tree. This wasn't going to end here."

 MAD_GER.7.desc: "Captain Wertheim pursed his lips as he stood on the deck of his ship while several ships in his fleet patrolled along the Madagascar coast. His binoculars were out, and he peered everywhere for a sign of anything suspicious. Back and forth his gaze swept, and nothing.\n\nHe was not optimistic about their likelihood of catching anyone today.\n\nThe good news was that there were only a few places one would expect goods or weapons to be smuggled into - but German eyes were not everywhere, and the flotilla at his command was simply not large enough to cover the entire coast. Germany had sent him under the assumption that he only needed to cover the obvious ports of entry - which he could have immediately pointed out the slight problem with that assumption.\n\nFor that assigned purpose, he had enough ships to successfully blockade the island, which was his mandate - Germany didn't want anyone reaching Madagascar. With that said, if any alternative routes were found or ports were built, coverage was going to be more difficult. Hence the regular patrols he'd instituted, just to make sure that there was a proactive effort to find smugglers or others who would interfere.\n\nHe had communicated this back to Germania, and his superiors in the Kriegsmarine, but the answer had been rather stark, if expected. He was to make do with what he'd been given. They were unwilling or unable to supply him with any more ships. It was unfortunate, but Wertheim would have to manage.\n\nHopefully, the garrison made sure that things didn't get worse on the island - and Japan or the United States didn't get any bright ideas to try and exploit the situation. If they did? Well, it would be his duty to stop them."

It was this death that shattered Maurice's will. He had always felt a special connection with the deceased Führer, one that had persisted long into his exile in Madagaskar. He was once his driver, bodyguard, and a fellow fighter in the Putsch. Hitler had washed the alter kämpfer's blood clean by bestowing upon him the honour of Aryanship, protecting him from Himmler, that damned traitor who usurped the SS that Maurice himself started.\n\nAnd now that he was gone, Maurice could do nothing as his enemies besieged the Rova. As another Malagasy Rebellion raged around him, Maurice's head was hung low. He didn't hear another usurper enter his office.\n\n"Emil Maurice," said Erhard Milch, Luger drawn and aimed, flanked by MvM and GfMA representatives. He couldn't contain that grin, years of frustrated ambition finally fulfilled. "By order of the Militärkommission von Madagaskar, you are hereby stripped of your command and placed into our custody."\n\n"But I am the Militärkommission." It wasn't a forceful declaration - it was a whisper, an echo of a stronger man. Maurice's eyes didn't move from the letter Adolf sent him all those years ago, urging him not to lose hope, to lead as an Aryan should in a land that needed strong Aryans to tame it.\n\n"Get up," Milch said. He grabbed Maurice by the wrist. When there was no reaction, his grin reversed. "I said get up!" He wrenched Maurice up, heard a disgusting little sob out of the former Militärkommissar.\n\n"Take this fucking Jew away," he hissed, shoving him into the custody of two German soldiers."

"Our forces are organised, engaged now in counterinsurgency. Native unrest has grown since the failure of the French colonial administration. Militants under various banners - AREMA, TAFAMA - are attacking critical outposts, with armaments ranging from rifles looted from armouries to imported weapons. At least one fighter we captured possessed a rifle of Chinese origin, and we have unconfirmed reports of American rifles in active use."\n\n"Apes flinging their shit everywhere," Milch said. "and the rest of the world's feeding them laxatives. What else?"\n\nThen came the GfMA man, whom Milch thought was a nebbish little creature. "With the recent... troubles in Germania... supplies are strained. We have enough to survive a... few months worth of fighting, but it's the labour pool that... concerns us. All our men are... tied up in fighting."\n\n"Well then, gentlemen, let's kill two birds with one stone." He placed his palms on the table, as if he were about to launch himself up. "Start corralling the natives into industrial facilities and have them working round the clock. Every native ought to be building bridges or repairing rifles. Get the French to look after them, if they can be trusted. Treat any indolence or inattentiveness from either group as treason and act accordingly.""

Then the ill-conceived uprising and brutal crackdown of 1946. The PADESM were then scattered to the wind. Rakotos' current lodgings would have seemed unfathomable to him and his comrades only fifteen years ago, forced to cram into a dilapidated hotel room in Johannesburg struggling to pay for food and awaiting news from their new CIA patrons. It was there that they had their last heated communication with their rivals in TEFAMA, radicals and Merina-chauvanists who thought that throwing out the civilization the French had brought was somehow equivalent to liberation. The two parties went different ways, with PADESM seeking refuge with the last gasp of French independence in West Africa now led by Philibert Tsiranana, while their opponents sold their souls to the devils in Tokyo.\n\nTen years they spent in Abidjan debating the trifles of future politics while Madagascar rotted. Then everything changed a year ago when he was chosen by Tsiranana to assist the OFN in planning the liberation of the newly strategically important island. Rakoto wasn't even sure he wanted this, he knew almost nobody back on the island no matter what he told the analysts and frankly he liked life in the of the free, being free of worry and free of want.

It wasn't as if they cared about his politics. As much as the agents had tried to hammer home that he and PADESM were to be prophets of democracy bringing liberty to a dark land, the reality is his men did not really care. They hated the slavery imposed by the French and the brutality of the Germans, but otherwise they seemed apathetic about concepts of governance and politics, no matter how much Rakoto had tried to educate them. This did not bode well for any future government, assuming they would even gain independence in the first place. Did they even like him? No, to them, he was nothing more than a jumped up northerner and a wannabe Frenchman, equal parts condescending and dull. The reality is these were his men regardless of the differences, not because of ideology, culture, or comradery, but because of bribes.

Despite everything they had done for the liberation of Madagascar, there was a certain hollowness to their promises. When he was a recent convert to the revolutionary cause the Japanese claims of solidarity and liberation went down as smoothly as honey, but after five years in Calcutta on the edges of their anti-imperialist Empire it was hard to buy into their propaganda. Yet no matter how sour their words tasted Rafazy was forced to eat it up because without the Japanese TAFAMA would not exist.\n\nAs much a Rafazy wished a revolution could survive on the fervor of the people alone, the people's soldiers needed bullets, a lot of bullets. In the wake of the failed insurrection against the French in 1947 the former MDRM rebels were fractured and starving. A loose formation of ex-soldiers, professional revolutionaries, and opportunistic adventurers united only by a desire for the death of their oppressors was nursed back to health by Japanese advisors and guns. The Madagascar Independence Army or TAFAMA they were called. Since '47 their movement had slowly grown in the shadow of the French colony's house of cards, fighting small battles and building their strength. There were others to be sure, fat liberals suckling wine in French West Africa and more recently a group of disorganized and bloodthirsty communists hiding in the jungles, but only TAFAMA truly carried the torch of the MDRM.\n\nThe time for war was closing in. Even in his bunker in the highlands of central Madagascar, home of the noble Merina people who formed the backbone of TAFAMA, he could see the French regime was failing. The German garrison was getting anxious at the growing body count, the native police force was in everyone's pocket but the French, and Paris seemed farther away with each passing hour.

But as the translator began to speak once more, Maurice learned all he needed to know."

 MAD_GER.10.desc: "It took several hours for the guards to finally report Maurice's disappearance. Instead, they wasted their last hours pointing figures over who might have helped the "half-jew", meaningless in the face of clear mismanagement from all sides. By the morning, their embarrassed report came only with a basic timeline.\n\nIt must have happened like this: Emil Maurice had been placed under house arrest in a large home near Toliara, hoping to isolate the figure and deny him foreign capture or escape. At 04:00, he snuck out through his window and escaped on foot, at which point he stole a small vessel and departed towards unknown waters. It was a deeply desperate plan, the exact sort of effort which the guards should have easily stopped. Maurice's whereabouts were unknown.\n\nMilch, predictably, reacted poorly to the news. After arresting all guards at the site, he called Germania, whose reaction was decidedly more muted. It was quickly deduced that Maurice had to have escaped to [SAF.GetNameDef], and given his inept mode of escape, he likely did so without established American ties. Instead, he'd need to build an escape plan while in South Africa, a territory which German intelligence could certainly reach.\n\nIn other words, there was a span of several months in which Maurice would be in foreign territory, likely poorly defended, and generally conspicuous. Provided his location was discovered, his disposal would easily follow."

 MAD_Maurice.1.desc: "Former Reichskommisar Emil Maurice rested easily for the first time in what had felt like months, reclining on his chair. The turbulence lightly rattled the plane as it zoomed across the Atlantic. Some would be troubled by this, but given the quality of some Malagasy planes, Maurice could tolerate a degree of instability.\n\nHe idly scanned the guide to major American cities, musing where he would make his home upon landfall. The south would be nice, albeit more rural and isolated than Maurice would like. The northeast could serve well, and the population density would allow him to get lost within the teeming masses. Then again, it could allow any would-be assailants the same advantage.\n\nMaurice grunted, shutting the book. Whilst it was a comfort to know that he had escaped from the chaos that was slowly engulfing Madagascar, the American help would only remain for so long. There would always be a chance he could be caught with his trousers down, and if that happened, he would be dead. Would house arrest truly provide him enough protection to ensure this never happened?\n\nThe two suited men sitting across from Maurice watched him impassively. They had met him at the airport, and had wordlessly watched him since. Maurice had avoided conversation with them beyond the most necessary of formalities. "Ahem," he said, clearing his throat. They looked at him. "Excuse me, gentlemen. Forgive me for my curiosity, but where is it that I am to spend my days?""

 MAD_Maurice.2.desc: "The Mexican sun beat down upon Emil Maurice's head. His vision was bleary - the cloth he had wrapped around his head only gave slight protection to his head, and whilst he was used to the Malagasy sun, he was usually able to retreat to an air conditioned office near the end of the day. Here, he had no such luxury.\n\nPart of the former Reichskommisar regretted abandoning the truck he had used to cross the border, but it would have been no use anyway. The border patrol knew its license plate anyway, and he could not afford to be caught. Whether it be the Germans or the Americans, any official record of him may as well be a death certificate.\n\nHis life in California was akin to that of a caged bird - he was given the most basic of amenities and kept under twenty-four hour surveillance. There was not a waking moment in which Maurice was not being watched, and it was driving him mad. Eventually, when one of his handlers wasn't paying attention, he made his escape.\n\nAnd yet, this great escape did not come without cost. After driving like a madman for several days and limping through the desert without rest, he was physically drained. Maurice idly wondered whether there would be any civilisation nearby. He knew that if he made it to one of the major cities, he could seek asylum somewhere. Perhaps then he could feel even remotely safe"

Where was he? He was- he was walking in Mazatlán, walking along Camarón Sábalo Avenue when- it was all a jumble, flashes of lights and sounds without coherency that crashed into this moment like a car against a brick wall.\n\n"Mr. Maurice," said a harried and impatient man. "Thank you for being here."\n\n"W-where am I? Wait- are you an American? A-are you an American, please tell me-"\n\n"Yes, Mr. Maurice." Seated in front of him, the man placed his steepled hands on the table. "But you're not in America. You passed through a few countries, but this container," waving to Maurice's claustrophobic surroundings, "is internationally recognised as the sovereign territory of Cuba." The sweep of the man's hand stopped at a little flag on the table. "You are now in Cuba."\n\n"For the love of God, I'll tell you what you want, I- I'm sorry I ran, I'm sorry, please, just-"\n\n"Please, don't make this harder than it has to be." The man's weary frown did not waver. "Outside this container are some Cubans who will step in if we do not hear the full truth. They are very nasty. They use things like drills and hammers that Americans do not use."\n\n"I'll tell the truth, oh God, I'll tell you anything you need to know." Maurice's ego streamed out through his tear ducts and ran down his nose. "Just please don't hurt me, please, please."\n\nThe man in front of him was too tired to show pity."

 MAD_Maurice.31.desc: "Emil Maurice seldom went walking in Mazatlán. Compelled by circumstance to remain indoors as much as possible, he was normally content to stay indoors and read, or brush up on his Spanish, or write another page in the life story he might one day sell. But he could not stay locked up in his room forever. When the mood struck him, Maurice donned sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat, and left his apartment to walk the streets as an ordinary man.\n\nCrawling behind him, a pair of buzz-cut CIA agents in a nondescript beige van ran through the gameplan in their heads. Driver cuts him off at the corner of Camichin and Abedul, passenger exits and grabs Maurice, driver opens the side door and throws Maurice and himself inside. Out and in within ten seconds. They wouldn't let him flee again.\n\nMaurice approached the corner of Camichin and Abedul, stopping briefly to look through the gate of a small family home. A father and son were working on a car, and it reminded him of his former trade as a watchmaker. Perhaps he would use this exile to pick up the craft again. Along the way he caught a faint reflection of himself in a window, and for a moment he stared at it, unsure what to make of the man before him.\n\nThe agents saw Maurice turn back to the corner. The driver floored it, clearing the three-way and jerking the steering wheel right, sharply turning against oncoming traffic. They could barely choke out the first syllable of a panicked curse before a car slammed into the front of their van.\n\nMaurice heard a screeching, then saw a sudden collision. A car had crashed into the front of a speeding van, a clash of metal which tore apart glass and flesh. The car's driver stumbled out, bleeding but mobile. The two men in the van were not so lucky. He was startled, seeing one of them half-through the windshield, but he could not risk lingering near the scene. What if someone was watching him?"

 MAD_Maurice.4.desc: "South Africa was a formidably peaceful place, especially in such a secluded countryside locale. Then again, Emil Maurice was not expecting to be placed in an urban hovel half a block from the German consulate. Further, armed protection from a trio of the CIA's top men reassured him deeply of his safety, and gave his desert villa an air of tense relaxation.\n\nEmil had been busy scribbling away in his notebook as to the nature of the fascinating turns his life had taken; by no means a series of choices to feel pride in, it still inspired a certain satisfaction in Emil to have backstabbed the Reich and lived to tell the tale. It was that moment when the unmistakable rattle of gunfire unleashed against all sides of the building.\n\nEmil immediately dropped to his stomach and started crawling to his panic room as he heard only one stream of gunfire respond against the intruders. The window which had been letting in the arid sun into Emil's shelter fell and shattered on the ground, sending fragments skittering against him. The front door was kicked in.\n\nReaching up for the panic room's door, a gunshot slammed into his hand which reached for the handle. Emil screamed- the pain rippled through him, his body going slack against the metal, desperately trying to pull on the door's handle. The approaching assassin pulled Emil off the door and threw him into the closest easy chair, Emil's face cringing at the pain spreading from his hand. He could see the invader clearly now, a German in tactical gear, a look certainly denoting him as a man from the Abwehr. Emil knew he was doomed. The soldier reached into his pocket and pulled out a photograph. With a single nod, he dropped his rifle, letting it hang around his chest by its sling, and yanked out his handgun. Emil Maurice closed his eyes, waiting for death, then felt a flurry of pain blossom from his chest. In his last moments, slumped in his easy chair, Emil looked up at his killer and began to beg for forgiveness."

Jäger did very much enjoy the South African heat, irritating as it could be with its pervasive flies and mosquitoes, though he would have preferred it on the beach with a cool drink, as opposed to on a shantytown rooftop, scanning the sky. Jäger's team's objective was to assassinate the traitorous German, Emil Maurice, and up until now, things had been going off without a hitch. The USA had apparently facilitated the flight with a military plane, and Jäger was due to receive a call over the radio identifying which plane was to be his target. Of course, he was not the only agent there, his two men downstairs posing as Boers and thus staying above suspicion, at least to a point. Another passenger plane flew overhead, and Jäger rechecked his equipment. As he tended to the AA device's folding legs, a scattered volley of gunfire struck around Jäger's feet. Falling to his stomach, Jäger swung his head around looking for the source of the gunfire. The only building taller than their own was right next to them, a few floors above; Jäger unholstered his handgun and began firing into the air above him. To his surprise, a shape blotted out the sun above and cracked onto the bricks right next to him. Below him, Jäger heard his men open fire on some unseen enemy, now certainly counterterrorist units.\n\n"Jäger! Jäger! Do you copy?! The next plane's the target! The next plane has the target!" The operator screamed over the radio sitting on the crate not a few feet from Jäger. An explosion rocked the street below, and Jäger stepped over the fallen South African to the radio.\n\n"Copy, Rasthaus, solid copy." Jäger yelled. In the distance, over the sound of the rifle fire attacking and pistol fire retaliating, the heavier jet engine of a military jet roared overhead. Another volley of gunfire struck the rooftop, slamming into his legs, as Jäger pointed the Flut B skywards and fired."

 MAD_Maurice.5.desc: "Emil Maurice was starting to truly appreciate Mazatlán. From his apartment on Camarón Sábalo Avenue, he could stare out onto the western beach, the islands de Venados and de Pájaros and the Pacific Ocean that lay beyond them. He always ensured that he was at his apartment by sunset, so he could watch the sea glitter and sun fall below the horizon. This was easy to do for a man who would have been Mexico's most wanted, if they knew he was there. He rarely left his apartment, preferring the company of books and television, even tinkering with a memoir of his time as Adolf Hitler's driver, founding member of the SS and as the scapegoat for German incompetence on Madagascar.\n\nHe had survived, and was destined to live the rest of his life in relative peace. No matter what the rest of the world said about Emil Maurice, he found some measure of inner peace that would see him through from now until the end. With a glass of tequila in his hand, Maurice saw the sunset and smiled. It was a beautiful end to the day.\n\nThe assassin who put a .308 round through his skull wished he could have done it up close. He would have loved to hold the knife up to Maurice's throat and watch him piss himself in fear. A traitor to the Reich, a traitor of this magnitude - and, in the assassin's own words when he was given the contract, "a Jew commanding honest Aryans" - deserved a more painful fate. Instead, Maurice died content, never hearing the bullet that killed him, suffering only a fraction of a second's confusion until Germany's revenge ripped through his brain. From a rooftop a hundred metres away, the assassin pulled back his rifle and scoffed. Hundreds had died under his watch in worse conditions."

Trapped in his apartment, risking exposure and arrest every time he went out for groceries, he wished he could have washed up somewhere rural, isolated. Instead, he found himself hiding in a bustling tourist trap. He was stuck inside, busy numbing his mind with television in foreign tongues and books in which he held no interest. He thought about a memoir, a way to clear his name from the whole world's accusations, but beyond a few self-pitying pages he never got far in it.\n\nThe only solace he had was at the end of each day. His new apartment overlooked the Pacific Ocean, and he always made time to watch the sun go down each day. Maurice stood there, glass of tequila in hand, observing this daily descent. The rest of the world might have nothing else for him, but at least he had the sunset-\n\n'Heil Hitler!' came a cry from behind. Maurice spun around to see an ordinary man in a cheap suit charging towards him. In a panic he threw his glass directly into his face - glass shattered and cut his face open; tequila splashed over his eyes, blinding the assassin. The gun in his hand fired wildly off course, and instinct saw Maurice try to grab him as the assassin kept barreling towards him in a stampede. Momentum pushed both of them off the balcony, screaming as they twisted in the air and fell to the earth.\n\nWhen he woke up, Emil Maurice was in a hospital bed. The low, routine march of his heartbeat was all he could hear. A nurse came by, then a doctor. They had informed him he had been very lucky: surviving a four storey drop with nothing but a few broken ribs and legs. He might never walk properly again, but he was not pulverised like the other man. The police came by later to ask what happened, and it was fortunate that they had no idea who he was. They received hollow answers; someone else gave them, while Maurice simply stared outside the window and listened to his heartbeat beep low and calm."

A founding member of the SS, disgraced after a disastrous term as governor of Madagascar, fleeing American protection and failing to secure safety in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Speculation was rampant. Tabloids reported his presence and activities wherever the faintest rumours were found: a settler in a German colony along the Chilean coast, a shoemaker in rural Italy, a degenerate gambler and opium addict in the card houses of Makao.\n\nThis frustrated the intelligence agencies of the world, who continued to spare a little effort into tracking down the former Militärkommissar. At this point, it was out of wounded pride more than any interest they had in what he knew: Emil Maurice had no information worth this expense, but he had already evaded the grasps of all three superpowers, and it was now a point of honour to locate him. But after Mexico, every trail they walked was a dead end. Their attempts lasted only a few months after [GetMonth] [GetYear], and then they independently decided to consider it a cold case, condemning their mistakes to the dustiest corners of their archives.\n\nEmil Maurice was now destined for the pages of untold mysteries and 'weird history.' It was a thrilling few months, but in a few years the whole sad affair would only be treated as fodder for conspiracy theories. The man himself would never be found again. Wherever he had gone - Russia, Australia, the bottom of the Atlantic - the rest of the world could no longer follow him. Perhaps that was for the best.

Alongside this, there have been reports of various native uprisings, most aligning under the umbrella of the "Governing Council."\n\nLatest news indicate that the colonial authorities have been intensely fighting for control over the various urban centers across the island, with the Council both bidding favor from Japan and also finding support through private backers with ties to Free France.
