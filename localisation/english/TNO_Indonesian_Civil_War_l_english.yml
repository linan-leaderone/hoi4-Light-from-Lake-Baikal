POLITICS_SUKARNO_ICW_DESC: "Stuck in Djakarta, surrounded by loyalists and sycophants, for they are all he has left, and with the country at the mercy of the fires of war: such a situation is undoubtedly not what Sukarno would have wanted, but it is nonetheless the one he's in. One positive, however, is that the cruel conflict Indonesia found itself in allowed the President to discover where his erstwhile allies' loyalties really lied.\n\nMohammed Hatta, whom he once considered a friend, proved himself to be nothing more than a puppet of various power-hungry generals. Whatever his reasons for that may be, however, it was too late to turn back: that cosmopolitan turncoat had finally shown his real colors, and his last days would be spent in a prison cell, never to see the highs to which the nation he betrayed would soar. At least, that's the mantra the President plays to himself over and over again, to put the broken memories to sleep if only for a moment.\n\nAs the situation looks more dire than ever, however, many, even among the President's closest advisors, wonder if his wide-reaching ambitions are still within grasp. Some would leave it to time to tell; Sukarno, however, knows that such pleasantries are meaningless, for only Indonesia shall recognize its leader."
POLITICS_SUKARNO_POSTWAR_DESC: "Disloyalty has been cast to the dustbin of history, and both cosmopolitan and military turncoats have found their rightful place at the bottom of unmarked graves. War has been chased off the coasts, and the Equatorial Emerald shines again. Sukarno has won, and so has Indonesia.\n\nThe question of the costs at which such a triumph was achieved shall be left to the historians, for the President's ambitions have waited long enough. Traitors shall be punished, and centralization shall be imposed, for petty regionalism has caused enough suffering. Indonesia shall attain its rightful place on the world stage, for the so-called "great" powers have toyed with it long enough. To put it simply, compromise has shown its limits, and its biggest proponents have been outed as the traitors they were.\n\nThe President, now more popular than ever with the masses with his fearlessness, has shown that there is nothing that can stop the unyielding force of Indonesian sovereignty. For Bung Karno has shown his spirit - his Gelora - one to light up the nation forevermore."
POLITICS_ZULKIFLI_LUBIS_DVR_DESC: "Zulkifli Lubis is a Dutch-trained military intelligence man, and the leader of the military technocracy in the Republic of Indonesia. Or at least that was what he was, until he reached an agreement with the Sumatran rebels to rise up against Sukarno's government.\n\nHaving joined Free Indonesia through a CIA-brokered agreement, Lubis' Siliwangi Division rose in revolt in Western Java, right next to Sukarno's HQ of Djakarta, and faced down a larger force. Surrounded by quantity, Lubis' quality-focussed military programs faced their ultimate test. The Siliwangi model was enough at least to secure the survival of Lubis and his men, but not to bring about an end to the War—and the passage of time only infuriated Lubis more and more.\n\nClearly, Hatta's lot had failed, and it was time for Lubis to make a play. Reneging on his deal with the Free Indonesians, Lubis began the process of returning peace to Indonesia his own way—by force, guile, and an unholy alliance with Suharto. Already some success has been seen; Sukarno has been deposed, and Lubis' own allies are taking control of the Indonesian government in Djakarta. All that remains for Lubis is to consolidate power."
POLITICS_ZULKIFLI_LUBIS_POSTWAR_DESC: "Had Zulkifli Lubis been told in 1955 that there would be a civil war in Indonesia in the next decade, that it would take so long a time that the original factions of the war would fall apart due to a lack of credibility, and that he, Lubis, would have to assume the duty of picking up the pieces that Hatta and Sukarno smashed all over the floor, the then-colonel would have spat all his coffee out.\n\nYet that was what Lubis had to experience. The war had dragged on too long; the nation was nearly unrecognisable, and the separatists and other subversives were gaining credibility. Hatta and Sukarno had to be done away with, especially as the latter's men pushed back against their removal from the halls of power in Djakarta. Now Lubis is firmly in control, and sits in Djakarta as the new President.\n\nZulkifli Lubis' task will be onerous, but his plans are clear: to define a new political order independent of talk of decentralisation and without preserving the legacy of Sukarno, and sculpt Indonesia's future with his own hands and his alone. The last decade has proven very clearly that no one else can be trusted with the responsibility."
POLITICS_SUHARTO_DVR_DESC: "General Suharto was a junior member of the influential PETA, the Java-dominated military clique. Initially stationed in the neutral special region of Jogjakarta, the chaos of the war has seen Suharto seize power - first in Jogjakarta, and then in Djakarta itself following a paroxysm of violence blamed on leftist agitators.\n\nSuharto claims to be apolitical, far above any of the petty political squabbles that other members of his clique consistently find themselves in. It is true that he initially wielded little political influence, especially when compared to his high rank. But many suspect that this stance is simply a front to divert attention, that Suharto is much more ambitious than he would have you believe.\n\nWith Free Indonesia facing a similar division of their own under General Zulkifli Lubis, the Indonesian Civil War has entered a new and more bloody stage. Seeing the current situation, the two generals - one in Free Indonesia, one in Jogjakarta - are, in their own way, preparing to end the war themselves."
POLITICS_SUHARTO_POSTWAR_DESC: "Indonesia is once again whole. One man stands alone at the head of it all - President Suharto.\n\nAfter the chaos from the emergence of 'socialists' emerged across an increasingly war-weary Indonesia, a state of emergency was declared. Suharto was made leader of the government, and he has made it clear that he will do whatever it takes to stabilize Indonesia - all in the name of national unity.\n\nSuharto's ambitions were well-known, and it seems that they have finally come to fruition. Hatta's rebel movement has collapsed from within after Zulkifli Lubis' departure. Lubis himself is in the administration. With his rivals out of the way, the path is open for Suharto to claim Sukarno's legacy as his own - to continue Indonesia's struggle in his own way."
POLITICS_ABDUL_HARRIS_NASUTION_DVRDEF_DESC: "To anyone closely following the Indonesian War, or otherwise familiar with the military history of the young Indonesian nation, the name of General Abdul Haris Nasution is very well-known. Nasution, a Dutch-trained military technocrat opposed to Sukarno's politicisation of the military, was a veteran of the Indonesian independence struggle, and later on of Hatta's rebellion against Sukarno's government.\n\nThat would have been the upper limit of Nasution's biography had Sukarno not been toppled by Suharto in Djakarta. The resulting chaos and purges of leftists did not just remove Sukarno's men and get rid of socialist influence—it cut the legs out from underneath Free Indonesia overnight, causing the rebellion to dissolve and Hatta to flee the country.\n\nNot Nasution, however. He remained behind, leading the resistance against Suharto's New Order—and somehow or another threw him down by force of arms. Now he is President of Indonesia, and his duty is clear; the nation will not be safe until every sign of Suharto is rooted out of the Indonesian Archipelago."
POLITICS_BAMBANG_SOEPENO_DVRDEF_DESC: "Revenge is all that matters to General Bambang Supeno, after all that has happened to Indonesia and to his distant kinsman Sukarno.\n\nThis was not always the case. Supeno tolerated the rampant factionalism of pre-civil war Indonesia in the hope that, at the end of the day, Sukarno would see reason and elevate the spirit of the Indonesian people. But that was not even close to how it played out. Sukarno was thrown out by a putsch led by a rebel and an opportunist, handing the Indonesian nation over to the enthrallment of radicals and leftists—and then those two bastards had the gall to blame him, Supeno, for the avoidable chaos that resulted!\n\nNo wonder, then, that Supeno went to ground with the various right-wing resistance groups that remained after being framed in such a fashion. Leading these soldiers, he threw President Lubis out by force—and now, the new President has his own ideas about how to finally end Indonesia's era of chaos.\n\nIt is a terrible shame for Supeno's opponents, then, that all of these ideas involve violence."

POLITICS_SUNGKONO_DESC: "Having taken charge of a territory wracked with guerrilla activity, general Sungkono faces a difficult situation. Difficult not only because of the guerrillas' inflexibility, but also because of the local governor's very own, with governor Wongsonegoro's corporatist and enthusiastically pro-Japanese views not endearing him to the local populace. Such is the price of loyalty, it seems.\n\nCut off from Java, and with not much more than the common soldier's bravery to fight off the guerrillas and pacify the masses, the general has plenty of work to do: His biggest ally is undoubtedly the navy, but naval artillery can only do so much against the ABDR's repeated offensives, and a navy, as fierce and enthusiastic as it may be, can't win a war by itself. All in all, Sungkono is but a piece in the great game for Indonesia's soul, and he knows it all too well.\n\nIf all the common soldier has is his bravery, however, then the general shall lead by example. After all, who else can his men rely on, when Sukarno is so far away?"

After all, it's only a matter of time, right?\n\nWith the Permesta's shadow looming menacingly from the north, and Islamic guerrillas causing their fair share of trouble, the Emergency Authority's pro-Sukarno's position is fragile, and albeit the situation has stabilized, most notably thanks to Permesta officer Jusuf's crucial defection, there's not much the governor can do but wait.\n\nHow much longer, however, can Makassar hold? And how much longer shall Sukarno take to save Indonesia? Day after day, as the devastation further engulfs the country, the governor wonders, and finds no answer; for what else can he do?"
POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_JUSUF_DESC: "Once upon a time, Mohammad Jusuf was a general affiliated with the Permesta movement in Sulawesi. It was all very well and good when the movement was merely a peaceful assembly of military officers and whatnot attempting to prevent Sulawesi withering on the vine for lack of supply while being cut off from the halls of power.\n\nBut the chaos of the Indonesian War did more than any amount of Sukarno-aligned agitprop would have to shake his allegiances. Within a short period of time, it was clear to Muhammad Jusuf that he could tolerate no more; accordingly, he defected to the central government and served as the military chief of the South Sulawesi Emergency Authority until the fall of Makassar.\n\nMakassar is lost and the whole region is in chaos. Andi Pangerang is missing, probably in rebel hands. All Muhammad Jusuf can do now, aside from questioning just where he went wrong, is lead the government remnants on Sulawesi and try his damndest to hold out in the few outlying towns and hamlets he still controls. It will not be easy, and Jusuf wishes he could get out of it by now, but what choice does he have? He made his own bed, and shall now lie in it."

How long, they ask, before Japanese support finally arrives?\n\nDespite all his military talent, Lubis does not know. And despite the might of his forces, he is well aware that the falcon cannot withstand the storm: as such, he can only make the best of a bad situation, and hope that the Emperor's supplies will arrive as soon as possible.\n\nWhenever they do, however, the PRIM's days are numbered."

POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_HATTA_ICW_DESC: "Whether Mohammad Hatta was kidnapped or whether he joined the PRIM of his own free will shall be a riddle left to the ages, but what remains now is that he now stands as the face of Free Indonesia, both inside the archipelago and abroad. And yet, how did that come upon?\n\nOnce a trusted ally, friend, and confidant of Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta now stands as the President's greatest foe. No matter what anyone may claim, however, there was no other way. As soon as Sukarno's quest for national greatness turned into a vehicle for his personal prestige, someone had to rise up to protect what justice and fairness Indonesia had left ; and who else but Hatta could have done that?\n\nHatta's Free Indonesia Government, however, still carries the baggage of the machine gun. The influential Giyugun clique, deep in the Sumatran jungle, forms the backbone of the movement through military councils, and Hatta's dreams of a free republic will necessarily have to be achieved with their backing.\n\nHatta can only hope they will allow it."
POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_HATTA_POSTWAR_DESC: "The war has been won, and Sukarno's name has been relegated to one of history's many prospective tyrants. Celebrations abound in the cities and in the countryside, and for the first time in what feels like forever, Indonesia is once again free.\n\nIs that really the case, though?\n\nMohammad Hatta, behind the widespread euphoria, sees many of his erstwhile allies hungrily eyeing the Merdeka Palace, as the newly-invigorated republic's stability still hangs on a thread. After all, wartime allies are only valid as the conflict draws on, and ideological rivalries have a nasty habit of surging at the most inconvenient times: this, Hatta knows all too well.\n\nNow, each and every one of the President's steps will have to be very careful ones, or else his grand vision of a democratic Indonesia shall fade away like dust in the wind. While he is no stranger to political intrigue, the very stakes of this "silent conflict", as some of his close advisors have taken to calling it, force Hatta to take it to the next level.\n\nWhat does winning the war matter, if you end up losing the world?"

But twenty years of Sukarnoite rule led to an increasing loss of Sumatran autonomy and military supply in favour of the PETA officers in Djakarta. It also forced the Giyugun colonels to rely more and more on side-deals with India, Australia, and America for the abundant local copra and rubber, leveraging their position next to the Indian Ocean to their advantage.\n\nAhmad Husein came up with the very idea of using Hatta as Free Indonesia's figurehead. When Sukarno declared martial law, Husein entered into a deal with the military technocrats, the Special Forces rebels in Siliwangi, and the Permesta. With CIA backing and by exploiting Sutan Sjahrir's hatred for Sukarno, Hatta would be kidnapped and made into the leader of a new Indonesia.\n\nIt was done, and now Husein moves to the next task: that of fighting on until Sukarno is no more.

After all, he had been shouting into a void for years about the need to professionalise and train the Indonesian armed forces to a higher standard than the mere politicised entity they were from the outset. Though that failed, Lubis takes comfort in the fact that he and General Abdul Haris Nasution were at least able to lead a proper military formation themselves—the Siliwangi Division, one of the few divisions in the military formed according to Lubis and Nasution's model.\n\nBut now such matters are mere foibles compared to the task that Lubis faces. Having joined the rebels through a CIA-brokered agreement, the Siliwangi Division has risen in revolt in Western Java, right next to the capital of Djakarta and surrounded on all sides by Sukarno's forces.

POLITICS_VENTJE_SUMUAL_DESC: "When the Japanese helped Sukarno set up a free government, soldiers like Ventje Sumual eagerly looked forward to a new, Dutch-free era for the Indonesian islands. That dream persisted for about a decade, until 1953, when Sukarno centralised power upon himself and allowed the Japanese to attain economic dominance over Indonesia.\n\nThe response to that in North Sulawesi was the Permesta—Perjuangan Alam Semesta, or Universal Struggle—movement which fought to obtain a fairer distribution of materials and an end to Sukarno's Java-centred government shutting them out of power. At first this struggle was peaceful, until Sukarno declared martial law; then Permesta, seeing no peaceful way out of the long-brewing conflict, joined the Sumatran rebellion in open revolt as part of the Free Indonesian movement.\n\nVentje and Permesta are not secessionists by any means; their desire is not the destruction of Indonesia but its fundamental reform and the shaking-off of the Japanese yoke. This makes them an ideal route for the Americans and Australians to interfere by—but they do well to beware of Ventje's prickliness in their dealings with him."

These men and their supporters form the South Sulawesi Guerrilla Unit, an Islamist organization opposed to the Djakarta government and its hangers-on on Sulawesi.\n\nAs Sukarno's government collapsed, the SSGU took the opportunity to attempt a violent takeover in Makassar, the main city of Sulawesi—only to be driven back over time as the South Sulawesi Emergency Authority, Sukarno's local catspaw, reconsolidated its position. Despite this setback, Muzakkar's movement represents the second main Free Indonesian grouping fighting in Sulawesi; however, lacking the Papuan or OFN resources that Permesta has access too, they are in a far more perilous state.\n\nThat problem has made Muzakkar's dream—that of an Islamic state with socialist elements in Indonesia, free of Dutch, Japanese, Javanese, or American influence—become more and more of a back-burner matter as the conflict over Sulawesi increasingly resembles a struggle for mere survival. The only immediate relief Muzakkar can find right now, aside from the protection of Allah, is the fact that Sukarno's Makassar puppets are just as desperate as he is."

Had Sukarno held on to power, that would have been Bereueh's permanent undoing after the war ended. Bereueh's insistence on the correctness of preserving the Syariat Islam above all else was anathema to Sukarno, who was too preoccupied with 'preserving power' and 'not dividing the nation while he centralised it'. Foolish, godless notions, of course.\n\nIn the end, Sukarno's folly caught up to him. The Free Indonesian Uprising provided Beureu'eh the opportunity he needed to restore divinely-ordained order to Aceh.

He was, after all, a member of the previous landed elite that once owned everything the Dutch didn't own on the island of Java. His aristocratic background helped him get an education at the then-prestigious University of Leiden, which should have theoretically been another contraindication. But in the end all that was no impediment to Sjarifuddin's eventual socialist awakening, which inspired him to serve as a left-wing journalist for years in pre-war Indonesia.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Sjarifuddin fought against the Japanese; obviously, when that war ended in a Japanese victory, he was persona non grata ever since. But that was not enough to bring Sjarifuddin down; rather than capitulate, he continued to mobilise support in Java right under Sukarno's nose. The chaos of Sukarno's martial law, combined with the Free Indonesian revolt, gave Sjarifuddinthe perfect opportunity to carve out a socialist power-base in Central Java—and he will take that opportunity with both hands."

Though educated in the West, Hamengkubuwono's position was always to position himself as a native of Java first; this served him in good stead both under the Japanese and Sukarno's post-Japanese government. The Sultan is a canny man. When he was young, he thumbed his nose at the Dutch East Indies government and defied the local governors to their faces. When the Japanese occupied Indonesia he defied them too, and when they left he willingly defied even Sukarno himself.\n\nNow Indonesia burns, and Jogjakarta has exercised its unique privileges and identity to stay out of the fighting as much as possible.

TT_ICW_Common.200.t: "Rumblings"
TT_ICW_Common.200.desc: "What was Indonesia, after years of war?\n\nWhere once there stood cities of brick and mortar, there now stood gutted ruins, inhabited by corpses and gutted by flames. Where the jungle once harbored innocent dangers for the initiated, it now hosted innumerable malign perils: a man could step over a tripwire and dodge punji sticks, only to come eye-to-eye with a bounding mine.\n\nA child could become both an orphan and a murderer in a day; parents would bury their sons and daughters one week, and send dozens of others to early graves the next. The Japanese would kill you because they thought you ungrateful; the Americans would kill you because they thought you a slave.\n\nTo those an ocean away, Indonesia existed as a grotesque marionette in a puppet play on a global scale. It would dance and twist to the tune of foreign masters, until the sinews of its people snapped and the body of its land cracked into a lifeless husk to be discarded.\n\nAnd - in the darked halls of power in Djakarta and in rebel councils across the burning archipelago - there were many who were not content to see their country and people gutted by the butcher of history."
TT_ICW_Common.200.a: "The war marches towards its conclusion.\nOne way or the other."

#Duumvirate Lubis-aligned - army radicals killed generals, Sukarno calling emergency
TT_ICW_Common.201.t: "Denouement"
TT_ICW_Common.201.desc: "The day began to the crisp report of gunshots near the Presidential Palace, leaving onlookers bewildered as soldiers donning the uniform of the Presidential Guard abandoned their posts to murder their superiors, before being gunned down in turn.\n\nBy mid-morning, the coroners had proclaimed the death of six high-ranking generals in the Indonesian Armed Forces - their report the only fact apparent amongst a storm of rumors swirling throughout Djakarta. The word on the street, or at least from the censored newspapers and radio stations: the nationalists within the government, dissatisfied with an approach to the rebels that was still too lenient for their tastes, had taken the initiative to remove their rivals.\n\nBy afternoon, many expected a push from the rebels to capitalize on the confusion in Sukarno's government, but no such push came. Rumors of disarray abounded, and Mohammad Hatta made no appearance to dispel the confusion. He could not be found at all.\n\nBy evening, the call went out from the Presidential Palace - that Sukarno was declaring yet another emergency, summoning his most loyal generals and ministers in the face of conspiracy. But one name amongst them - Zulkifli Lubis, a Free Indonesian general - simply threw more fuel on the fire.\n\nAnd by the time the word of Hatta's capture - and subsequent pardon, by the benevolence of Sukarno in the name of saving the Indonesian nation - was announced, nobody knew quite what to think anymore.\n\nThen the shooting began again."

The word on the street, or at least from the censored newspapers and radio stations: the leftists and the radicals had turned to mass terror to stage an uprising.\n\nBy afternoon, the city was filled with reports of just such an uprising across Java. All work ceased as citizens rushed home to board up their windows and procure essentials ahead of the rebel advance that had to come, though nobody could say if it was coming in an hour, in a day, or if it was already underway.\n\nBy evening, fear fed upon itself. 'Watch brigades' took to the streets alongside the Army's search teams dispatched by General Suharto, looking for any traitors amongst the populace - and meting out justice of their own design. Civil order had disappeared by midnight, prompting a call from the Presidential Palace - of Sukarno summoning his most loyal generals and ministers in the face of anarchy.\n\nAnd when afterwards, the Free Indonesian government announced that the violence had spread to Sumatra, necessitating an urgent ceasefire, the killings reached a fever pitch."

If you were lucky, you'd still be breathing air a minute later.\n\nIf you weren't, then you were stuck with whatever you had in your lungs, as the oxygen in the air would combust or be displaced by styrene vapors. If you were lucky, you might pass out and die, insensate.\n\nBut heat - the roaring flames unleashed by napalm, igniting buildings and bone alike - would make that difficult. Anyone would want to scream as they felt their skin burst and blacken to expose the cooking flesh inside. But if they did, they might roast from the inside out - or choke on noxious fumes.\n\nNo, all the residents of a Sumatran village - militarily worthless until an arbitrary shift in the line of contact - could do was to hold their breath and run. Run away from streets ablaze and scorched alleyways, towards colder and cleaner air in the wooded outskirts.\n\nThey discovered, as they streamed out of their hellish prison in a bloodied, mangled line, that sufficient ventilation brought them relief."

TT_ICW_Common.301.desc: "Queuing at the security checkpoints scattered throughout the cities was an hours-long affair, to such an extent that the Indonesians in the line wondered if anyone was being let through at all. The line snaked forward in minute increments, giving observers enough time to observe their surroundings.\n\nThey all saw the sergeant take a double, then triple take at a couple crossing the threshold of the checkpoint, before yelling at them to halt and raise their hands. Several soldiers whipped towards the couple, raising their rifles as the two shakily obeyed; another soldier told everyone to step back, shouting 'suicide vest' over the disgruntled groans of the crowd.\n\nThe man was roughly patted down, his every appendage squeezed and manhandled, before he was thrust to the ground and held at gunpoint. The woman was offered no more delicacy, though she was offered the decency of an 'inspection' inside the checkpoint booth. The crowd pretended not to hear her crying in humiliation.\n\n"Tell us where you came from!" The sergeant's fist smacked into the detained man's face with a sickening crunch.\n\n"Tell us who you live with!" A rifle butt slammed into the man's stomach, doubling him over.\n\n"Tell us everything." The crowd seethed as two soldiers grabbed the man by his armpits, dragging him into a waiting van, the wailing woman beside him. They watched as the van sped away into the distance, behind the lowered bayonets of the checkpoint guards."

TT_ICW_Common.302.desc: "The crowd had already been gathering for several hours outside the police station by the time the foreign colonel arrived, the police straining to hold their cordon as the officer hurried inside.\n\nEveryone knew what had happened. The city - far behind the front - and its bars and clubs had been terrorized by a foreigner, one who took offense at every perceived slight - or sometimes, at nothing at all. Drunkenness was the excuse used at first, as all the foreign soldiers and sailors were wont to be - but when a pattern emerged, some doubted that the culprit even needed a sip before wailing on his target du jour.\n\nToday, they had found him bloodied behind a dumpster, mounted upon a blackened and bruised heap that had long since ceased moving. He had sent five more men to the hospital as they tried to restrain him, before the police had arrived and whisked him away.\n\nThe mob demanded justice. How many of their men and women had been sent to the hospital on account of this monster? But the police held them back - not because they wanted to, but because the police commandant had been told in no uncertain terms that there were 'superceding circumstances.'\n\nThe crowd roared in fury as the foreign colonel emerged from the building, with the brute following behind, a psychotic smirk plastered on his face. They pushed against the police line as the foreigners clambered into the waiting car, screaming as it retreated into the distance.\n\nJustice wore a uniform in Indonesia - except for those in another uniform entirely."
TT_ICW_Common.302.a: "Just one outrage amongst many."

TT_ICW_Common.303.t: "Blue on Blue"
TT_ICW_Common.303.desc: "The soldier was a quiet one, everyone said. Didn't talk with others much, never told anyone where he was from or why he'd joined the army. Not that anyone asked - all anyone cared about now in Indonesia, especially the foreign advisors, was that you could pick up a gun, point it, and pull a trigger.\n\nHe was good at that, everyone agreed. Good enough to earn himself a clap on the back and free drinks at the pub - from the advisors, they were the only ones with enough money for that. He drank at first, enough to put out an elephant - earning himself two day's punishment detail.\n\nLater, he didn't touch alcohol at all. The advisors were happy; they told him that he'd gotten used to the killing, just like them. When you could enjoy the full use of your senses, even after watching a montage of death and gore, then you knew you were 'normal' again.\n\nEvery morning, the soldiers would listen to a readout of the changes along the line of contact. Mostly, it was localized to their specific sector, but every so often a faraway city's capture or destruction would be mentioned. A reminder, the officers said, of what they were fighting for.\n\nIt had been a day as normal as any other as the soldiers filed out, leaving the foreign advisors to discuss the day's objectives - before the soldier in question blew their brains out with his service rifle, painting the tent red before adding his own blood to the mix."

USA_INS.1.t: "The Indonesian Conundrum"
USA_INS.1.desc: "Chef Henry Haller prepared a set of club sandwiches to go out. Deli fare wasn't his specialty, but there was a major meeting going on upstairs on short notice, and he didn't really have time to prepare a more sumptuous meal. "Just a minute!" he called out in his well-known Swiss accent to the butler. "We are still getting the side salad ready." He took a breath. "What is even going on in the Oval Office?"\n\n"Indonesia, Henry," said butler Eugene Allen. "Defense, State, CIA, they're all down there."\n\n"That thing with the pilot and the Australian boat?" Allen nodded. "So we've finally had enough of them, haven't we?"\n\n"Maybe, but it's just another disaster to throw onto the pile. Africa is a mess, we're stuck there, and now we have another war on the horizon in a far off place. I don't see getting into it being very popular."\n\n"So, if that is the situation, then I guess we stay out of it." Haller took a completed bowl of salad and started dishing out the portions. "There are too many wars, we cannot win all of them, and we cannot get into all of them either."\n\n"That's what the President is concerned about, but the secretaries are telling him otherwise." Allen loaded the plates onto his tray. "I was in there, they were saying the Austrailians for one thing - they aren't going to be happy with a no. They want to see that Sukarno fella out about as much as we wanted to see Hüttig dead. And they are saying the United States simply can't leave it all up to them, or the Japanese take the entire region."\n\nHaller was silent as he finished dishing out the last portions. "All right Allen, I think you should tell me what the President decides.""
USA_INS.1.a: "Turn up the heat."
USA_INS.1.b: "Let it sit."

USA_INS.2.t: "Freedom in Indonesia"
USA_INS.2.desc: "The cheers of happy White House staff members could be heard from below, as Chef Haller prepared the celebratory meal. Nasi goreng with fried egg, prawn crackers, and pickles. Ikan bakar grilled fish. Sayur asem vegetable soup. Steamed rice in banana leaf. Not exactly the typical fare he imagined himself would be cooking in the United States, and certainly it had a few recipes he had never heard of before the war began. But this preparation would not go to waste. This was the celebration, all those long nights, stresses, and setbacks, all of that had come to an end.\n\n"That's another one Henry!" Allen shouted as he came in. "We beat the Japanese, Sukarno, all those goons! I haven't seen this place so happy since Eisenhower was re-elected."\n\n"And I suppose the city is excited as well?"\n\n"I called Helene and everyone on the block is excited. Most of them know someone in the service, and they're coming back. They can argue if it was right or wrong, but we won and it's over."\n\n"Perhaps," Haller said as he tasted the Sayur asem. "But they say Hatta may stay in the Sphere at the end of all this. Is it really true? Was it all worth it?"\n\n"Hatta may enter the Sphere, but it will be on his terms, not Tokyo's. And there are quite a few people behind him who know who got them there." He picked up the tray. "The diner can decide what he wants, but the kitchen cooks it how the chef likes it."\n\n"Quite right, Mister Allen," Haller smiled."
USA_INS.2.a: "Serve with a side of Sambal."

USA_INS.3.t: "The Smell of Failure"
USA_INS.3.desc: "There had been days when Eugene Allen hated this job. The dissonance of watching men of his skin color fight and die for their rights when he was tasked with pretending everything was normal to the elite of the United States. When Kennedy died, he took on the reception for the funeral. And today was going to be one of those days, as he looked at the somber faces of soldiers, diplomats, Australian dignitaries, and assorted staff of the White House as they looked at the TV screen.\n\nIt was CBS News. Footage showing the Huey helicopters departing the Indonesian archipelago, pulling out the last OFN troops as the world closed in. Shots of government tanks rolling into the cities once held by the Free Indonesians. Crowds of refugees, people who once had been loyal to the cause begging to get the hell out at the airfield, clutching at the wheels of aircraft and crowding aboard the C-130s. And here they were, on the other side of the world, watching it all fall apart as Allen served light alcoholic drinks from his tray.\n\nEugene hated this surreal fantasy world, but when he got home, he knew it would be worse. He knew the people on his block had sons abroad in the service. Some were on those last flights out. Some of those would never leave, or were already in Arlington. They were disgusted with it all, and they would translate that disgust to him. One of the good ones, an Uncle Tom, a house negro, someone far away from this world of pain they were forced to live in.\n\nThe free world had failed, its blood, bombs, and bonds coming to naught. The people in this room had failed to defeat the Sphere at a tremendous cost. And Eugene had to worry about looking his son in the eyes and saying - yes, this was the greatest country on earth - and having nothing sincere to back it up."
USA_INS.3.a: "It's all burnt up."

USA_INS.4.t: "Our Dictator Wins"
USA_INS.4.desc: "In the White House, a meeting room was dead silent save for the voice of the Secretary of State. Quietly listening around a table were the President, his cabinet, and the Australian ambassador. News of the Indonesian War's conclusion had finally reached Washington, and now everyone anticipated what their next move would be.\n\n"In short, Free Indonesia has won." The Secretary of State's remarks were met by a round of cheering at the news. However, the man speaking did not share their excitement. As the noise died down, he continued reading. "However, the government is led by Zulkifli Lubis, not Hatta. Given his cooperation with Suharto, it's unclear how much he can be trusted."\n\nHearing the last piece quickly sunk everyone's mood. Suddenly their investment had seemed a lot more questionable, especially considering some pro-Japanese elements might still be lurking in the background with the Suharto. No one wanted to address the room.\n\nExcept for the Australian ambassador, who ended up breaking the silence.\n\n"Well, it might not be our preferred guy, but at least we've given Tokyo a black eye. That's at least something we can give to the public, even if it won't assuage the families of the dead. I'm satisfied, gentlemen."\n\nAs the ambassador left, the President looked to his Secretary of State over the whole affair. Both men possessed confused expressions, but neither could say the ambassador was wrong. As the President dismissed the meeting, he began to think about what had been the greater victory for them in the conflict, Indonesia - or Australia."
USA_INS.4.a: "It's at least a victory."

USA_INS.5.t: "The Faraway Light of Freedom"
USA_INS.5.desc: "It was funny, Chef Haller thought. He used to take care in sourcing his ingredients when he was working at the hotels. Granted, he had to accept some level of restriction when he started work in the White House. Security concerns prevented him from using the same supplier or grocer too many times, but he still had a general list of places he liked. But in the cafeteria, they only had one type of coffee, and he didn't know where it came from. He looked into the cup, and wondered. Guatemala? Mexico? Brazil? Or maybe -\n\n"Do you think we will be getting Javanese coffee, Mister Allen?" he thought aloud, alluding to the day's news.\n\nEugene Allen shrugged. "Perhaps the Indonesians will sell us some now that they won," he said. "But for some reason... a lot of people aren't happy about it here."\n\n"How so?" asked Chef Haller.\n\n"They seem to think they missed an opportunity," Edward explained. "If the President went all in, they could have kicked the door wide open and defeated the Japanese for a massive political boost. Not to mention have a lot more of the Indonesians be dependent on the United States for getting them there."\n\nHaller thought it over, taking a bite of the donut. "Mister Allen," he said, "when I was a younger man, I was in the Swiss Army after being called up for war. Every time I went to the theatres, I saw Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Moscow, all the great cities of Europe go up in flames, the Nazis smashing through any resistance, and I was worried we - little Switzerland - would be next. And I feared I would die at a young age, never to accomplish my dreams. But fortunately, the war never came, and I got to grow up and be in one of the greatest jobs on earth. Do you understand me?"\n\nEugene nodded. "I think I do. We won a war we didn't fight.""
USA_INS.5.a: "Serve after letting stew."

USA_INS.6.t: "Freedom Extinguished"
USA_INS.6.desc: "The tension in the White House was so thick you could... no, thought Chef Haller as he sliced up the onions for the President's chili. Too obvious, too cliche, too, well, light for this miserable day.\n\nFrom when he read the news, he knew this was going to be a terrible day. Everyone knew the OFN had failed in the far east, and everyone was angry about it. Some believed the Indonesians had failed, others that the Australians had not finished the job through. But still others had their own ideas. They were the ones who urged US intervention, that they could have won the conflict if the US bothered to get involved.\n\nNow, the conflict was lost, and maybe everyone was right about how it failed. Or perhaps none of them were. But the ones who argued the President had failed were the loudest. If they had listened to them, Indonesia might be free, the Japanese would be the ones kicked off the islands, and Tokyo would be sweating it out and not them. They had their own group in the White House, cutting across a wide swath of the people who came and went today, and certainly everyone was ready to burst.\n\nEugene Allen entered in his butler's uniform, not saying a word, heading straight for the liquor cabinet. He looked Haller right in the face, an expression of mutual understanding. He got out the ice and glasses, then paused, deep in thought. Eugene asked "you want to know what I think?"\n\n"What do you think, Mister Allen?"\n\n"If we had lost... and we had our sons and fathers over there..."\n\nAllen shook his head and walked off, leaving Haller in the kitchen with the onions."

USA_INS.7.desc: "There they were, the President, his cabinet, and the Australians, all shuffling silently into the room. The cold reality of the situation made them all awake, all very sober to process what happened.\n\n"SUHARTO WINS." Two simple black words on the morning's newspaper spelt out the new reality. They spent a lot of time, both in that meeting and others, reflecting on what went wrong and how they lost so much. It was true that in the course of that long, drawn-out war - a war that cost many American lives and much more in the lives of the Indonesians themselves - there were moments when it seemed that the tide was turning, that they really could win.\n\nWasn't it because of this hope that they sent so many of their sons to fight in the jungles? Was their confidence so misplaced? What, then, could they say to the grieving families welcoming the body bags back home? Was it all worthless?\n\nWell, they could tell them the truth. That Suharto was never interested in working with America even before the war. That, with all threats to his power eliminated, Suharto would take Indonesia in his own direction, which would be as far away from the OFN as possible. That, ultimately, Tokyo had won the fight and that America's boys died for nothing.\n\nOf course, they couldn't tell them that. They'd throw out the same banal platitudes they always did and hoped they would help. But no cliche could erase what everyone - both within the room and without - knew:"

President [USA.GetLeader] interrupted the briefing by the Secretary of State, looking just as confused as the Cabinet. Describing the mood in the Situation Room as confused would probably be underselling the sheer bewilderment present on everyone's faces.\n\nThe Secretary of State cleared his throat. "Yes. It appears so. This shouldn't have been possible, but then again, nobody expected Lubis and Suharto to go for that power grab either.'\n\n'To summarize, the situation on the ground is rapidly spiraling out of control,' he continued. 'We doubt that the new government can control the chaos any better than the previous ones. Even if we'd like to help, they haven't reached out to us at all. I don't think they're interested."\n\nThe President examined the myriad documents on the table. They didn't need to be read in detail: the pictures of a broken Djakarta told the story well enough. After letting out a sigh, they spoke, making their frustration obvious.\n\n"Let's take a step back here. Do you know what this means? This was the chink in the sphere's armor. This was meant to be our beachhead into the Sphere! At least Tokyo doesn't have it: that would be worse.""

Under Zulkifli Lubis and Suharto, the context of the war has been completely upended, and a regime is now in place in Djakarta far from what we wanted when we originally began sending men and materiel to Indonesia.\n\nAt the very least, Lubis - President Lubis - seems to be the one more in control between the two, and he does possess some sympathies to the OFN from all the aid allotted to him. However, it comes as little relief to the State Department, the President, the troops returning home, and the people who now demand answers on the meaning of the Indonesian conflict after so many twists."

All eyes were on the President, who took a few moments to process everything that was happening.\n\nAt the beginning of the war the costs seemed to be manageable. They were tough to bear, of course, but they were still acceptable, even noble - as long as they didn't increase. But month by month the reports grew longer and longer, culminating in last month's reports, which showed such a high jump in casualties and lost equipment that it startled the usually nonplussed National Security Council.\n\nThis month's reports, which they looked forward to, were supposed to reverse this trend. Instead, the trend only accelerated. President [USA.GetLeader] picked up one of the reports. It was clear that fighting had now spread across the entire country, and increasingly their boys had to fill in gaps in Hatta's Free Indonesian Army - with the resulting casualties.\n\nA stray idea weaseled its way into President [USA.GetLeader]'s mind. What if the US left the war, just cut their losses and ran? That thought was immediately rubbished. Even if you ignored the enormous stakes, America had paid far too high a cost to leave with nothing.\n\nSo they would continue, then: more of their boys will die in Indonesian jungles. America will have to endure. All eyes were on the President, all in anxious anticipation of what the decision would be. The words that were spoken would leave no doubt of their resolve."

This is a waste of time." Before the President could respond, the ambassador got up to leave, slamming the door as he went out.\n\nAfter the ambassador slammed the door shut President [Root.GetLeader] let out a breath he didn't even know he was holding. This meeting was much more tense than anything else he'd had in a while, but there were good reasons to be worried.\n\nBy now even the general public was aware that both America and Japan had soldiers in Indonesia. Most were blissfully unaware of the deeper implications. With nary a soul noticing, what was once unthinkable had become a reality. American and Japanese soldiers were shooting each other, killing each other.\n\nOf course they couldn't say that out loud. Both the President and the ambassador realized what would happen if they did: it'd be a race to the top of the escalation ladder where the only prize was nuclear annihilation. Even as their armies were slaughtering each other with all the destructive force that only modern war could bring, both sides had to pretend it wasn't actually a war.\n\nThere they were, America and Japan, locked in this uncomfortable pas de deux:"

After managing to secure trust with the Copra Colonels, we were able to make contact directly with the group's leadership themselves, among them a Colonel Ahmad Husein.\n\nColonel Husein had expressed a growing resentment among his men due to the lackluster resources he had been provided by the government to perform his duties, and had begun to seek out funding to accomplish that task. After discussing the possibility of receiving American capital among other things to invest in his forces, the Colonel has demonstrated a willingness to "act" upon his dissatisfaction against Djakarta, as long as we provide better benefits to persuade him.\n\nSuch an exploit could prove invaluable in undermining the unity of the Indonesian Army and weaken the regime's hold upon the region. At your behest, Mr. President, we could begin the process of further negotiation."

More to the fact is that many see the government as a mere puppet to Tokyo, its creeping influence felt in both the industrial sector and within its armed forces.\n\nYet, even despite this unifying cause for revolt, no leader among the rebelling factions have proven capable to truly bring together the full force of Sukarno's opposition. Each group differs too greatly in their objectives and aims, which leaves the prospect of a popular/ elite-driven coalition against the regime a remote possibility, for the time being.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation, until new developments arise."

However, much to our surprise, they had approached us with an offer.\n\nOne Zulkifli Lubis, the director of the Indonesian Intelligence Directorate, had proposed that in return for broader support of the rebel groups situated in the Sumatra region, our agents would be released from captivity. It is truly fortunate for us to have made an ally in such high ranking within the government, and we have taken the appropriate measures to make use of this golden opportunity.\n\nIt should be stated in the record, however, that luck is far from an actionable policy for our profession."

Among them is the one remaining political figure that remains respected by the Indonesian populace: the Vice-President, Mohammad Hatta.\n\nAccording to intel on the ground, Hatta has expressed great opposition to the recent policies implemented by Sukarno, as well as being noted to have grown far more distant with his revolutionary friend than he had been before. Due to his unblemished standing among the public eye, we believe that we may have finally found the rallying figure to kickstart the rebellion into action.\n\nThe Agency advises to attempt reaching out to Vice-President Hatta, directly if possible but more likely by approaching him through either rebel groups in Sumatra or Sulawesi.

Smith - the Department Head for International Security Affairs - was at the front, looking most serious of all and ready to begin this morning's briefing.\n\n"Thank you for coming today. I believe all of you have seen the recent statements from the Australian government calling for a full-scale intervention," Smith began. "Since they're on the front pages of every single newspaper in this country."\n\n"I'd like to take the opportunity to clear up our department's official position. While we appreciate their enthusiasm, we will not recommend a direct intervention in Indonesia."\n\nScattered murmurs fluttered around the room: some of the stony faces showed flashes of concerns. Would America be wobbly at a time of great need?\n\n"Make no mistake: we are just as committed to the war as the Australians are. This position may even change in the future. But we understand that escalating the war so quickly comes with risks that are far too high to bear. To put it bluntly, we risk war with Japan itself."

This task was important enough to wait, however.\n\nIf America was to win in Indonesia, it needed connections, and there wasn't anyone in North Suwalesi that was more pro-OFN than Colonel Warouw. So he continued to wait patiently, hearing the shuffling of chairs and some muffled conversation in the background.\n\nA young man's voice suddenly came on the line: it spoke in clean, slightly accented English. "This is the Colonel's translator. Who are you?"\n\nThompson was startled, but quickly gathered himself. "Ah, yes, thank you. I'm Agent Thompson. CIA. We've been monitoring the situation in your country for some time: all of America is impressed by your movement's courage and strength.\n\n"I want to let you know that we have your back all the way. We'll be sending you supplies by air and submarine: you should get them soon. This should help you to hold your ground against Suharto's regime. If you ever need anything, just call this number and we'll see what we can do for you."\n\nThere was another pause before the young man spoke again. "The Colonel thanks you greatly for your generous help. We promise that your help will not be in vain. Let's stay in touch."\n\nThey chatted for a little while after that, exchanging some pleasantries, before breaking it off.

This event was the grand opening of the very first branch of MACI-SOG, the Special Operations Group of the Military Assistance Command Indonesia.\n\nThe General went to the stage, tapped the mic, then began speaking from a set of prepared remarks.

It shows to our allies - and our enemies - America's firm and total commitment to the war. In fact, to show this commitment" the General said, gesturing to the crowd.

JAP_ICW.1.t: "Indonesia Ablaze"
JAP_ICW.1.desc: "The office of the Prime Minister was engulfed in cacophony, as aides and officers flowed in and out of the cavernous office in an unending stream. Some brought news from the embassy in Djakarta, describing sporadic shooting on the streets and political pandemonium. Others carried reports from the Japanese bases on the archipelago, where guards pointed their weapons nervously at the no-man's land surrounding them.\n\nPrime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] fought down an urge to retch at the thought of Sukarno. The man's proclamation of martial law - and the nationalization of Japanese assets - had been a knife in the back on top of the fallout from Yasuda, and those with short memories had been barely restrained in their glee at Sukarno's misfortune. The more circumspect among them had already called for caution - was now the time to be spending treasure on another foreign adventure?\n\nThose with longer memories - or those who had access to the military and Foreign Ministry briefings - were far less cavalier with their response. The strategists swallowed whatever unhappiness they had for Sukarno in the face of Indonesia coming undone, exposing the soft underbelly of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The generals angrily pointed to reports of Japanese troops being called on to join the fight in some of the contested cities in Sumatra, haranguing the Prime Minister if they would let Japanese blood be spilled without consequence.\n\nAnd then there were the Americans - and the Australians. They'd had their fingers in Indonesia for years, and they would surely not let this crisis go to waste. Or worse - what assurance was there that the chaos wasn't one of their grand designs to bring Japan to its knees?"

Some savored the prospect of a much-needed victory over the Americans in Japan's sphere of influence; others were thankful that Japanese soldiers would return home alive to cheers, instead of disappearing into the funeral crematoriums amongst sobbing family.\n\n"I'm sure the Indonesian Ambassador will come to thank us for our assistance in person," Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] said. "And if they don't do so this week, make sure to remind them."\n\n"Of course," the Foreign Minister replied. "Sukarno won't soon forget what we've done for him.""

No matter what the propaganda said - and there wasn't much of it anymore, not after Djakarta had fallen - it was a thin coat of paint over the evident reality that Japan had lost Indonesia.\n\nAlready, ships were beginning to arrive in Japan with wealthy and dispossessed Indonesians - collaborators escaping the 'mercy' the rebels no doubt had in store for them. Several communications from Mohammad Hatta's representatives lay opened on the Prime Minister's desk, awaiting Japan's formal recognition of the reality that the age of Sukarno had ended.\n\nAnd however much Hatta pledged to remain on good terms with Japan, that the bitterness of the war was always about internal Indonesian politics and would not shake Indonesia's place in the Sphere, it was impossible not to see the shadow of the Americans and Australians over Hatta's every move.\n\nOnly a fool would believe nothing would change - for the simple reason that in the Cold War, 'redeployment' was synonymous with 'defeat.'"

Long-term disability care and pension estimates for the bereaved have been provided - "\n\nAnd what woud [JAP.GetLeader] say to those bereaved, if not for informing them that Indonesia was safe in Japanese hands?

Our forces operate in Indonesia at the invitation of the Indonesian government; I would advise your citizens to leave if they do not want to be caught in the crossfire."\n\nThe two men faced each other silently, a storm of accusations and recriminations swirling between them. What else could be said? The Japanese military's presence in Indonesia was no secret - the American and Australian presence, likewise, was an open secret.\n\nAnd yet neither could acknowledge the obvious truth this presented - that in the jungles, cities, and skies of Indonesia, American and Japanese troops were engaged in direct combat, killing each other in a war that neither government could officially acknowledge for fear of starting the apocalypse.\n\n"Consider this a formal protest from my government to yours."

They had mentioned that Suharto had already asked for several advisors to remain to oversee mop-up operations - a request that, even if it blew against the political winds at home, would be granted.\n\nIt was, after all, better to keep a close eye on a man who had already betrayed their master once.\n\nAll Japan needed was for Suharto to keep the Australians and the Americans at bay, licking their wounds across the Arafura Sea.

The Diet would be in an uproar, if only to capitalise on his failures than anything else.\n\nAnd the people?

It was hard to miss the criticisms in the headlines, as celebratory as they were, which sucked away any joy that might be had from Indonesia's victory.\n\nThe generals and admirals would no doubt ask him - respectfully, of course - if the outcome could have been hastened with Japanese support. The politicians would congratulate Sukarno on his hard-fought victory, while whispering about his own impotency and indecisiveness.\n\nAnd Sukarno, of course, wouldn't be nearly as polite.

No - but then again, nobody had expected Lubis and Suharto to upend the conflict. Perhaps, with peace, there would be no more surprises.\n\nBut there would be no rewards. The new government in Djakarta had offered nothing more than the most basic of correspondence with Japan - and with the U.S., if the intelligence from Washington was to be believed. With a country in ruins, Indonesia's new leader would be spending years simply trying to put Indonesia back together - and they had made their distaste for foreign intervention more than abundantly clear.\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] pinched his nose. Indonesia's destruction meant that it would no longer be able to fulfill its function as the southern bulwark of the Sphere for years - let alone return to being the resource hub it had been before the war.

The entire stated intent to phase out the Romusha system over time - that source of labor the Zaibatsu had grown to rely upon - and develop Indonesia's resources on their own was one that would elicit some rumblings of dissatisfaction in the business world, with ripple effects into the Diet and the YSK.\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn't be cheap. Even if the promised returns on resources and output in Indonesia could entice the Zaibatsu to sign on with a capital stake, the amount they would need to spend upfront would make them turn to the government for some kind of guarantee - some skin in the game."

The Minister of Foreign Affairs tugged nervously at this necktie. "Curfews are in place without valid documents - "\n\n"Not the declaration of martial law!" [JAP.GetLeader] spat, before flipping through the foreign ministry bulletin and stopping on the relevant text. "Nationalization of Japanese assets. Did the Ministry get any indication that this was going to happen?"\n\n"None at all," the minister said, trying to salvage his own position in front of the Prime Minister. "We're getting the Embassy to confirm the details immediately -"\n\n"They'd better! I have a meeting with Mitsubishi and Mitsui's executives this afternoon, and if I don't have any answers then it's our asses on the firing line in tomorrow's morning papers."\n\nThe Foreign Minister offered a quick nod. "And what about the military? Surely they'll be pressing to 'convince' Sukarno to reconsider - "\n\n"With what forces? As well-trained as our military is, the Indonesian military is far larger than ours - and whatever divisions exist amongst them, our moving against Sukarno will unite them against us." The Prime Minister slammed his palm against the desk to empahsize his point.

If the Ambassador showed any indication of being annoyed at being kept waiting, he was smart enough not to show it.\n\n"What can I do for you, Ambassador?" [JAP.GetLeader] made a show of tapping his pen on his desk as he broke the silence, to fully impress upon the Indonesian emissary the degree to which he was imposing on Japan's patience.\n\n"Despite our President's decision to nationalise industries in the name of the Indonesian revolution, we wanted to assure the Empire of Japan that we continue to remain committed to the cause of pan-Asian solidarity," the ambassador said, wiping sweat from his brow. "But if Indonesia is to serve as the southern bulwark against the imperialists in Australia, we must revisit our defense cooperation agreements, especially when our internal situation is so tense as to require martial law."\n\n'Defense cooperation' - shorthand for requesting Japanese military assistance, without even the offer to reverse the nationalisations. But, equally, if the situation in Indonesia following the declaration of martial law - and the abortive coup attempt against Sukarno - was as dire as reports suggested, then Indonesia could ill afford to project weakness in the face of the OFN."

Restoration of full scope of naval interdiction patrols following 1964 budget allowances indicate significant deterioration in maritime security surrounding Indonesia.\n\n2. OFN weapons contraband seizures have been reported off of NORTH SULAWESI (likely origin Australia) and WEST SUMATRA (likely origin India). Seizures are well in excess of previous interdictions and indicate sustained effort to deliver OFN armaments into Indonesia, likely connected with circumstances surrounding recent martial law declaration.\n\n3. Republic of Indonesia naval forces are either not capable or unwilling to exercise authority over maritime borders. The lack of noticeable degradation in the quantity of Indonesian military assets leads intelligence to suspect the latter - a worrying indication of division in an allied military.\n\n4.

Kawashima Shojiro could only surmise that his friend had grown far more paranoid since they'd last spoken, when Djuanda had still been Prime Minister.\n\n"You seem calmer than the soldiers outside." Kawashima was reassured to see Sukarno poring over maps, writing notes and orders to add to an ever-growing stack.\n\n"It's too late to be jumping at shadows, Kawashima," Sukarno sighed, rubbing the heavy bags under his eyes. "Now I have to clean up the mess that's left. Even if it feels like cutting my own arm off."\n\n"I sympathise," Kawashima said, grasping for the proper depth of emotion to have in the face of Sukarno's pain.

The declaration of rebellion by the Free Indonesian 'government' across Sumatra had been received with utter confusion, at least until the explosions began to ring out from the neighboring city. Nishijima and his platoon had been issued full combat gear and told to dig trenches behind the barbed wire surrounding the installation, and then - waited. For orders to attack, or for a rebel attack - neither materialized, at least at first.\n\nThe rebels had tried a half-hearted attack a week after the war broke out. A scattered fusillade of gunfire had sent the Japanese sentries running for their trenches, while an errant rocket had blown one of the guard towers to splinters. Nishijima and his compatriots had fired back in a more disciplined fashion, pinning the rebels down while one of the garrison's tanks blew their cover apart, forcing a retreat.\n\nThat had been two weeks ago, and there was no sign of when the next rotation would be. Every so often, a crack would remind him of the consequences of a wavering attention - sometimes followed by the cry of an unlucky soldier picked off by a rebel sniper. No officers came by now to kick him awake, so if Nishijima didn't want to find his throat slit, he'd have to do the hard work of staying awake by himself.\n\nThere would be no rest tonight - and tomorrow, and the day after that. As long as Nishijima's orders were to hold until relieved - without any clearance to advance and secure some breathing room - nobody in the frontier installation would be getting any rest."

There weren't many people present - just a small, carefully curated pool of photojournalists, taking pictures to a grand illusion far removed from the hurried nature of the event.\n\nThey also took care to avoid showing any photos of the Imperial Japanese Army guards deployed throughout the port, handling security for every part of an event ostensibly hosted by the Indonesian government. Confidence in the Indonesian government was just one more part of the illusion.\n\nThe IJN captain saluted the Japanese ambassador, who listened, at attention, to the orders given to the task force.

#Arafura Sea Crisis

TT_ICW_Arafura.1.t: "Busted"
TT_ICW_Arafura.1.desc: ""What do we do?" Asked the radioman, looking to his captain for confirmation. He would get none, as he was staring blankly from the bridge at an Indonesian ship nearing their vessel. "They're repeating their request, sir."\n\n"Christ, uh, yes, allow them to board," stammered the Australian captain, sweating bullets. "And tell the crew to make sure everything is hidden properly." The radio operator nodded and began relaying the orders. The crew scrambled about and below the deck to get their cargo secured and themselves to their posts should there be violence. Aboard the proper naval vessel looming over the glorified scow, the Indonesian captain was having his own exchange with his crew.\n\n"These Australians really thought they were pulling something off, flying an Indian flag," he said to his radioman shortly after terminating communications with the 'Indians'. "Well, you know what to do." More orders were exchanged, and fairly soon a small Indonesian boarding party was on the Australians' deck. The Australians were unarmed, making the Indonesians' job quite easy. Like a pack of coordinated hunters, they split up across the ship while two remained to keep the captives in check.\n\nAmong them was the executive officer, who was sweeping through the decks with the rest of his men. "Sir! We found it!" he declared.\n\n"Found what?" The Indonesian captain asked, despite knowing the answer, as he strode to the room the shout had originated from. Fairly soon he was in the galley, where one of his men had shunted aside the ice box and opened a loose panel on the wall. He waved the XO over, and he crouched down to examine a now exposed crate. They removed it from the wall and pried it open, and there they were. Firearms - OFN firearms. The officer patted the crewman on the shoulder, "Tell the men to take the crew prisoner.""

TT_ICW_Arafura.2.t: "A Question of Escalation"
TT_ICW_Arafura.2.desc: "The situation had gotten out of control with the subtlety of a raging bull and the speed of one, too.\n\nAn Indian-Australian smuggling boat and an Indonesian naval patrol vessel had turned into what might as well have been half of both countries' fleets staring eachother down. An Indonesian boarder had gotten lazy and failed to notice a radio operator slipping away to send a distress call. An Australian fleet had responded at the behest of gung-ho admirals and Indonesia had no choice but to respond, and slowly but surely the waters had gotten more crowded and those that sailed them more belligerent. Fingers were on triggers everywhere and conflict was always seconds away. Like every fight, everyone dreaded one but were ready to start one anyway.\n\nThat was the gist of the report on the desk of [JAP.GetLeader]. He'd been staring at it for about half an hour, going over his options in his now aching head. Indonesia was in their sphere, and letting them handle themselves would risk losing the country to the OFN, which would be a massive blow to Japanese hegemony. Obviously the answer would be to step in and tell Australia to back down. That, however, could lead to Japan herself getting involved, so the answer would be to let the Indonesians sort it out. This cycle of contradictions continued until he was forced into action by a voice.\n\n"What are your orders, sir?" Asked an official, who [JAP.GetLeader] had forgotten had even been there. He looked back down at the report and was tempted to flip a coin. Instead he looked up and answered,"

TT_ICW_Arafura.3.t: "Murky Water, Azure Sea"
TT_ICW_Arafura.3.desc: "Word had passed quickly to the sailors aboard the host of Australian and Indonesian ships involved in the freshly coined Arafura Sea Standoff. In rumors below decks and in official meetings on bridges, the topic of the Japanese ultimatum was discussed thoroughly. For the sailors it was an obfuscated subject, murky as the waters below. The broad strokes were there. Back down or face the consequences. Whispers of a full on Japanese naval intervention, even bloodshed, were abound.\n\nThe officers had a much better idea of what was to go down, or rather what could go down. The Japanese had given the Australians their ultimatum at last - allow the Indonesians to impound the ship and its cargo, after which the crew would be released, and there would be no trouble. Since then, they'd been waiting, teetering on the edge of disaster. After all, all they could do was wait. Every phone call and radio signal was met with anticipation, as any one of them could be the government's verdict on the ultimatum.\n\nThe Australian Vice Admiral himself was the one perhaps the most aware. Every morning he woke up expecting a communique and every night he went to sleep expecting to wake up to gunfire. That is until one day on the bridge, he was staring out into the sea. It seemed so unbothered. It didn't care whether the ships parted or blew each other apart, and it would remain the same azure. His speculation was interrupted as the phone rang, and he picked up the receiver with a shaking hand."

The captain, and the rest of the crew, breathed a collective sigh of relief, and set a course home. After days of Indonesian marines poking around their vessel while they sat in a dank brig, then another few after being tenuously released after their government had finally struck an agreement to back off. The smell of the sea air had been a refreshing sign of their return to safety. The last few days had consisted of prepping the ship to leave Indonesian waters, working carefully with authorities and meandering their way back to the very edge of the sea with an entourage of Indonesian ships.\n\nIt felt like the end of an era to the other Australian and Indonesian ships as well as they parted, albeit an unsatisfying one. The oppressive weight of imminent conflict had been lifted, but neither had particularly accomplished their goal. The Indonesian Officers were kicking themselves for not being allowed to bring the Australians to justice, for allowing the Japanese to make the decision for them, and for showing weakness in the face of danger. The Australian officers were glad to be out of danger and yet they had been thwarted through a marriage of incompetence and perceived cowardice.\n\nAs the fleets returned home, the new situation was still not all that different. The OFN and the Indonesians still were leering at one another with fingers on triggers, only at a greater distance."

"Why would they be flying a foreign flag and hiding the weapons in the damn walls if it was all above board?"\n\n"I don't believe it either," conceded [JAP.GetLeader], "but can we really risk pressing the issue? I mean, our best case scenario is they just keep telling us no, and the worst case scenario is well..."\n\n"The unthinkable," finished the first advisor. "I agree."\n\n"I wouldn't be so pessimistic. I think if we flex our muscles a bit, we could get them to back down. I mean, those weapons won't be the last shipment to the rebels, and they probably aren't the first, either. Letting this slide means letting the rest slide, and that's just going to make things worse down the line, is it not?" argued the second advisor.\n\n"So you're saying you want to escalate this? We could end up with a war on our hands!"\n\n"Chances are there's going to be a war in Indonesia regardless, and if we keep letting weapons through, chances are we're going to lose."\n\n"Alright, alright, enough bickering," interrupted [JAP.GetLeader] "I believe it would be in our best interest to...""

The Indonesian and Japanese governments offer their sincere apologies," buzzed the radio aboard the Australian ship, which had for the last few days been precariously balanced between two fates: capture or freedom. Thankfully for them, the latter had come to pass. The official record would note that the weapons, as the Japanese conceded, were legitimate cargo headed for Canada. Most people on both sides knew that was ridiculous, but they also weren't too keen on an international incident. Or, rather, more of one.\n\nBoth fleets dispersed from the crowded waters overtime, and sweat was wiped from brows everywhere. Before long, the Australian ship was once again alone, its crew thanking God and pushing on through the azure waters. Predictably, it was not toward Canada. The Indonesian rebels were grateful, and quite surprised, when the weapons arrived. It seemed a miracle to them, just as it had to both the crew of the Safe Passage and the Australian government.\n\nOf course, the Indonesians weren't exactly happy, as the fleets returned home with nothing but the knowledge that the rebels would only be growing stronger. The fact that their fate had been determined by the Japanese and not themselves was also a point of contention. Still, nobody had been shot, and that was enough for many a sailor and marine aboard the responding ships."

"Let's begin with a short recap of the events of the last few weeks, shall we?"\n\n"Of course. Weeks ago, our ship found contraband aboard an Australian vessel, and they were provided an ultimatum to leave our waters. They refused, and there was a dispute and a misunderstanding that led to a brief firefight. Men on both sides were killed," He summarized.\n\n"A tragedy indeed. Do you agree with the statement by the Organization of Free Nations and the Co-Prosperity Sphere that the incident was simply a minor skirmish between two sovereign nations that will not jeopardize global peace?"\n\nThe Captain paused. The image of a dying sailor with his jaw blown off, trying to scream for help but unable to form any words had been burned into his mind since the incident. He gritted his teeth and faked his best smile, "Yes. Although this was a tragedy, casualties were low and it should be seen only as a lesson in de-escalation.""

After so long staring down the barrels of a vast fleet ready and willing to blow them out of the water at the slightest provocation, it almost felt strange for the crew to be safe. Admittedly, they were leaving a few hundred pounds lighter than when they'd left, with all the weapons confiscated, but it still felt like a victory to those whose lives had been on the line.\n\nIt had been a different story for those whose lives weren't, at least for the time being. Headlines across Australia declared the incident a travesty, that if the government had any sense it wouldn't have let the Japanese intimidate them. Accusations of cowardice and incompetence flew. In offices and bureaus, officials argued over whether the blow to the cause of the rebels they had been not-so-clandestinely supporting was worth it, or if it had even been necessary to back down when the Japanese fleet could very well have been a paper tiger.\n\nFor Japan, it was as if nothing had happened, partially perhaps because they knew for sure they weren't paper tigers. They'd come ready for a fight, and didn't have to fight one. The situation hadn't changed. The only differences were the Australians' bitterness, and their inability to support the rebels they had so obviously been backing.

"Neither are particularly good. Either they try to clumsily posture and put our lives on the line, or they let the Australians go and make us look weak."\n\nThe XO tried to avoid informing his superior that he was stating the obvious. Instead he said, "Well, there's not many other choices."\n\n"I'm well aware, doesn't mean I can't complain. I just wish we got a say instead of some armchair admirals who don't know what they're doing."\n\n"Agreed, sir.

When the accompanying escort ship opened fire, he circled back and strafed the deck with machine-gun fire. Blood pooled and dripped down the bullet holes, stark against the gunmetal grey. It was a successful sortie. The Invader was a sweet, deadly ride.\n\nOn his way back, however, his gunner reported that a bandit was on their tail, fast. Shit, he said under his breath. How did these bastards get their hands on one of those, anyway? The gunner gave an unseen shrug, before the autocannons were let loose, drumming a rhythm of calamity.\n\nGet back to your station, he hissed. He dove low again, unto the vast expanse of green and blue below. Gunfire and ordinance tore through the fuselage, machine guns joining the autocannon's thump in a chorus of explosions. A scream echoed behind him throughout the craft. Then, stillness. All he could hear were the twin engines, rasping as if on the run. He could feel the heat rising in the cockpit, sweat lathering his coveralls. Faint cracklings of fire.\n\nA second later, as if on cue, the autocannons began again. They tore loose the port wing of the plane, and he began to fall, down, down towards the vast azure expanse below. The sun was a golden disk borne aloft amid the cresting, rising waves. Goddamn it all. He strapped a parachute and jumped out. As the land got closer, he popped the chute and sat adrift in the air, waiting for terminal velocity to do its work. He aimed for a clearing near the beach below, missing it by a few yards.\n\nBefore he hit the ground, palm trees snagged the suspension lines of his parachute, stranding him a few feet above the ground. Once he cut himself free, he landed with a crack on his right leg. He screamed. He tried standing once he felt better, and fell on his face. He sat up, taking a deep breath. His hands fell to his side holster. Empty.\n\nWhen they came for him, they asked for his name. He spat. What's it to you? He said, glaring. Do it. End it already."

A bucket, a wooden bed folded into the wall, and a small, barred window at the back. Chains rattled as he lowered his bedding. He sat on it and sighed, looking towards the slitted blue sky.\n\nHe refused to tell them his name. Not that it mattered much. His dog tags spoke for him when his mouth couldn't. The mood around the military prison was morose and hostile. He surmised that much between the debates in their interrogation rooms, emotions whose signals were gestures, punctuated by halting, aggressive English. After a week, the interrogation sessions receded.\n\nOne morning, the warden and his band of guards entered his room. He stood at attention, leaning against his crutch. For the first time, he saw them in a merry mood. "Mr. Allen Pope," the warden said, smirking, "you are going to court."\n\nThey provided him with legal counsel, and an interpreter. After a week of deposition, they brought him before a judge. In three sweltering days, they would work out his verdict.

TT_ICW_AP.6.desc: "FROM: Takeuchi Ryuji, Ambassador to the United States\nTO: [Root.GetLeader], Prime Minister of Japan\n\nAs expected, with less than a week towards Pope's execution, the Americans have finally caved under pressure. Now, they offer to de-escalate their support for rebel elements within the Republic of Indonesia, as well as a significant amount of ransom to go into the Republic's coffers. An official apology will also be issued. In exchange, they will send a plane to Djakarta to retrieve Pope.\n\nThese concessions are crucial and beneficial. Sukarno will need every help he can get. The Cabinet may accept the deal as it is, or push for more. Be warned, however, that the Americans have their limits. I believe in the government to make the wisest decision in this regard.\n\nSigned, Takeuchi Ryuji."
TT_ICW_AP.6.a: "Accept the deal, fly him out of there."

TT_ICW_AP.7.t: "Back to the Sky"
TT_ICW_AP.7.desc: "They were kind enough to give him two cigarettes and a sip of coffee. After breakfast, the warden tapped his shoulder. Let's go. We'll be late. He nodded. The guards walked him down to a car, a beat-up Japanese car of some description. Then, they drove under an overcast sky, the drizzle pattering down the avenues they passed. Up, up. To the military airbase. He sat at the back and listened to the guards' chatter until it fell off into silence. Faint thunderclaps beyond the window panes.\n\nThe plane had already landed by the time they got there. A Grumman C-1 Trader, carrier onboard delivery. He held back the desire to whistle at the sight. They're pulling all the stops, just for him. Yesterday, amid the hooting and hollering of the soldiers, he heard that his government had apologized for his actions there. He scoffed. There was no need. He was a happy killer if there ever was one.\n\nHe and the pilot entered the plane. As the engines sped up and they begin to lift, he saw those soldiers wave goodbye at him from the port windows. Funny gesture.\n\nWhat's it like down there? The pilot said, through the din of the engines.\n\nLike nothing I ever knew, he muttered."
TT_ICW_AP.7.a: "An amicable solution if there ever was one."

TT_ICW_AP.8.t: "From Sky, to Earth"
TT_ICW_AP.8.desc: "It was a matter of putting one foot in front of the other. Behind him were soldiers, whose burnished rifles and varnished, lathered skin roused anger within him. Other than that, he supposed, it was a beautiful day to die. The sky was clear, steady tumuli of clouds drifting windward. Journalists, cameras hanging from straps hung about their necks, shook hands with the warden.\n\nThey fastened the noose around his neck. "Any last words?" the warden said.\n\nHe shook his head. No. They read his sentence. Sabotage against the Republic. Abetment of separatism, manslaughter. A chaplain prayed for his soul. Amen. He nodded, though he did not understand. The warden nodded to his executioner, and the platform beneath him gave, to snaps of cameras.\n\nHe didn't struggle much. They took him down and buried him unmarked beneath boughs and ferns."
TT_ICW_AP.8.a: "There was no other way."

TT_ICW_AP.9.t: "Confession"
TT_ICW_AP.9.desc: ""So this Allen Pope crashed in Indonesia. I understand the urgency, director, but I hardly see how this is so urgent. Surely you can get some of your friends in the FRI to pick him up and escort him to safety?" President [USA.GetLeader] sounded unimpressed. Keeping tensions from boiling was already stressful enough; why was he being briefed on such a minor thing?\n\nExhausted and impatient, the director of the CIA stared back at the President with a sense of expectation. "Well, there's more than that. According to intelligence, the Japanese have already found and sentenced him to death. If he's executed, the press will have a field day with you. Not to mention the tensions this will increase on the ground."\n\nSuddenly the director's intention made a lot more sense. Leaning forward in their chair, the President asked their question with a raised eyebrow. "So then, what can we do?"\n\nA smile appeared on the director's face, finally sensing the end of the formality of the last few hours. "I can have a rescue attempt prepared in a few days. FRI assets are already aware of the situation and have volunteered to launch an attack. All I need is a little more intelligence and a few resources. Oh, and your permission of course."\n\nThe President looked down at his desk as he considered the director's words. Pope had served their country, and such loyalty should not go forgotten - but for the risk of sending more loyal men to the mercy of the Indonesians. Finally, the President stared harshly at the director before giving their final answer."
TT_ICW_AP.9.a: ""Go for it.""

TT_ICW_AP.10.t: "Escape Plans"
TT_ICW_AP.10.desc: ""You'll have to forgive me, Director, but my knowledge of Indonesia is not exactly scholarly. So this prison in Jogjakarta, what is it like?" President [USA.GetLeader] asked with determination, leaning over his desk.\n\n"Well, it's no Alcatraz, but it's still not your average county prison. It's located on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by fields on all sides. It has guards armed and loaded 24 hours a day, with concrete walls and cells. There are only two entrances to the facility, both guarded by machine gun turrets on the guard towers."\n\nThe President leaned back as he processed the information. "Alright, well, what can be done? I assume you wouldn't just describe a fortress like that if you didn't already have a plan."\n\nWith a smile, the CIA director extolled his plans to the President with all the excitement his intimidating office would allow. "Well, the easy thing to do would be to leave it up to a local FRI cell. They know the area and prison better than we do, although whether they are materially capable is another story. Alternatively, we could send in a special forces team with the FRI, though it would be costly, and cause us more trouble if we're caught."\n\nStaring back in contemplation, the President left the director in a moment of silence. How much was one man's life worth, the President thought. Was it worth a few more American men, or just a few Indonesian lives? The director seemed to trust the FRI, perhaps they would be enough. Then again, a few extra men would not hurt either. With a heavy sigh, he opened his mouth and gave the director his answer."
TT_ICW_AP.10.a: "Best not to leave it to chance."
TT_ICW_AP.10.b: "The FRI is more than capable."

TT_ICW_AP.11.t: "Premature Detonation"
TT_ICW_AP.11.desc: "With a spare stick, Allen Pope carved a tally onto the floor of his cell. Just three more days until his execution he thought. In all his passes he had always been careful, but he got a little cocky once and ended up marked for death. Life was truly unfair, he confirmed to himself.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the sound of an explosion as the ground shook. Cautiously moving to his cell's window, he looked out at the commotion. Outside he could make out scattered gunfire between what appeared to be an FRI cell and some of the prison guards. Pope's heart began to flutter. He knew he wouldn't be forgotten, he was going home!\n\nYet that optimism quickly faded. As the minutes passed, he watched the lights of the gunfire disappear one by one, until an order to retreat was called and his rescuers disappeared. Just as quickly as his hope rose, his heart sank. Nope, he was fucked, he thought to himself. How foolish of him to think life would throw him a bone.\n\n- - -\n\nMeanwhile, at the White House, the President sat in his office as the Secretary of State raddled off the news of the failed attack. It was disconcerting and would require a chat with the director of the CIA, but there was little that could be done. That was until he heard the secretary's next words.\n\n"The Japanese have made an offer to release Pope in exchange for reparations for those killed in our little rescue attempt. The offer would keep tensions down if a little humiliating. What is your decision?"\n\nLeaning back, the President thought about it for a second. His Secretary of State was right about its benefits. Then again, Pope was only a single man, casualties were always expected. Leaning forward again, the President gave his answer."
TT_ICW_AP.11.a: ""A fair deal's a deal, accept their offer.""
TT_ICW_AP.11.b: ""Like we'd ever negotiate with them over a single man!""

TT_ICW_AP.12.t: "Pickup and Promises"
TT_ICW_AP.12.desc: "After the failed rescue attempt, the end wasn't the one Allen Pope expected.\n\nThe Indonesian guards - now uniformly sullen and perpetually armed - had thrown open the his cell doors, tossing a clean shirt and pants at his feet. He was expected to get dressed and come out in five minutes - at which point Allen had held up his shackled hands. How the hell was he supposed to get dressed like that?\n\nThey'd pointed a gun at him for that, but another soldier dutifully released him from his shackles. They kept the gun pointed at him as he finished changing, then all the way through the entire complex until they pushed him into a waiting car at the prison's entrance.\n\n"You're going home, Mr. Pope," the man next to the driver said.\n\n"Thank God," Allen said. "After the firefight -"\n\n"And you're going to stay stateside," the man interjected. "God knows how many people we lost to get you out the first time."\n\nAllen digested the news. "Whose promise? The people I work for -"\n\n"The CIA works for the President," the man laughed, with a tinge of bitterness. "And when the President makes a promise - ""

TT_ICW_AP.13.t: "The Next Chapter"
TT_ICW_AP.13.desc: ""...they did it, Mr. President."\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] didn't respond for several seconds, his hand frozen over a memorandum he was annotating. The words were sufficient to drag him away from his momentary respite from the nightmare that had gripped the White House for months, and which had now reached its terrible conclusion.\n\n"When the Japanese said 'at any time,' they meant it, huh." President [USA.GetLeader]'s said quietly, more to convince himself than anyone else.\n\nThe Oval Office was silent but for the ticking clock on the wall. There wasn't anything more that could be done to save a dead man; all that mattered now was what came afterwards, from dealing with an incandescent press to what America's formal response to Indonesia - and informal one to Japan - would be.\n\n"Send over the CIA Director," President [USA.GetLeader] said, after a long pause. "Have him prepare anything we have ready to go for Southeast Asia and Indonesia.""

TT_ICW_AP.14.t: "Breakout"
TT_ICW_AP.14.desc: "The first sign that something was wrong was that the power went out - thirty minutes before lights out in the cells.\n\nThat had been enough to get the guards worried, but they had no way of knowing anything else was wrong until the door to the cell block was thrown open. "Secure the American! They're -"\n\nThe screaming guard's head exploded, and the guards outside Allen Pope's cell were similarly cut down by gunshots, cutting twice into their bodies and once into their heads. As the inmates roared at the sight of their tormentors' deaths, a group of five men scoured the cellblock - coming to a stop outside Allen's cell.\n\n"We're getting you out." The man unlocked the cell door, before pumping a rifle round into the prostrate body of the guard assigned to Allen. "Just making sure. Can you move?"\n\n"Yeah, I can move. I can use a weapon - "\n\n"No need. No offense, but we don't need any more surprises in this op. Now - "\n\nThe lights came back on, followed a second later by the blaring of the prison's alarm system. Alan scrambled to the center of the American special forces team, tapping the one who did the talking on the shoulder to let him know he was ready.\n\n"Stay close, and move when we tell you to. Follow our orders until we get to - ""

TT_ICW_AP.15.t: "Rocky Ride"
TT_ICW_AP.15.desc: "Allen Pope's heart had sunk when he saw the speedboat, hastily moored at the pier that the American black ops team had pulled up to. They'd had to shake numerous Indonesian patrols on the way there - each one sent careening to the side of the road by expertly placed shots into the drivers' heads - which had made for a deeply uncomfortable ride for Allen.\n\nThe speedboat promised no relief, and exactly as he expected, the boat powered into the sea at maximum speed. The lights along the shoreline sank into the distance as the boat roared into the inky blackness of the night sea; every time the boat slammed back into the water after cresting a wave, Allen swallowed a mouthful of sea spray, deafened by the roar of the outboard engine.\n\nFinally, the engine's cacophony mellowed into a low hum, followed by the blinding light of searchlights being fixed on the boat. He felt a gentle bump as the speedboat pulled alongside a larger trawler - one with the Australian flag flying from its stern.\n\n"Easy, easy!" One of the American commandos warned an Australian sailor as Pope was hauled up the rope ladder thrown over the side of the larger ship. "Man's disoriented after the escape."\n\n"We've got you, Mr. Pope." The Australian sailor carrying Pope in a fireman's carry up the ladder handed rushed away after depositing him on the deck, only to come back with a cup of tea. "We're taking you home.""

TT_ICW_AP.16.t: "Sky Cruise"
TT_ICW_AP.16.desc: "Allen Pope's heart had jumped a bit when he saw the unmarked C-47 pulling into view ahead, with ground staff conducting final checks on the airframe. They'd had to shake numerous Indonesian patrols on the way - each one sent careening to the side of the road by expertly placed shots into the drivers' heads - which had made for a deeply uncomfortable ride for Allen.\n\nCompared to that, the prospect of a stable cruise in the skies was intensely appealing.\n\nAs Allen clambered aboard, the American commandos performed one final check on the airframe, before boarding themselves and motioning for the pilot to take off. With a roar of the piston engines, the aluminum airframe lurched into the sky, clearing the woods at the end of the runway with a few feet to spare.\n\n"How're you feeling, Mr. Pope?" The commando that had unlocked Pope's cell door took a seat opposite pope, resting his rifle against the spartan seat. "I promise this'll be a better ride than the last one."\n\n"I hope so," Pope said, rubbing his neck. "How long until Australia -"\n\nPope didn't remember what the soldier said next, as his brain struggled to process the muffled explosion outside with the simultaneous rips and tears ripping through the airplane's fuselage. The plane lurched downward, throwing Pope from his seat.\n\nThe controls, Pope thought. Even if he wasn't qualified to fly a C-47, how hard could it be -\n\nThen he saw the entire front of the aircraft pull itself free from Pope's rear section, the aircraft disintegrating with the shriek of ripping metal, leaving him to fall to earth with a single thought:"
