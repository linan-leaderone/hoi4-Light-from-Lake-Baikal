 POLITICS_METODIJA_ANDONOV_CENTO_DESC: "The battle for Macedonia has been endless. Over twenty years, Metodija Andonov-Čento has watched his friends and family perish, as his nation burned under royalist captors. But take one look in his eyes, and you will know that the war has been worth it. Macedonia would be worth anything he could give.\n\nBorn under the chains of the Ottoman Empire, Andonov-Čento has watched his nation fall under every one of Macedonia's conquerors. After thirty years, he took to protesting - and later, to arms. Andonov-Čento proved to be an adept general, and soon the de-facto leader of the partisans.\n\nUnder his rule, the Partisans moved away from strict communism and towards inclusive, unfettered nationalism. It has proven effective, despite the qualms of former hardliners. Almost every Macedonian has something to support in Andonov-Čento; almost every Macedonian joined him in the streets when his forces took Skopje.\n\nNow, Macedonia is free at last - a fifty-year struggle has been realized. There is far more to be done - a language to codify, lands to liberate, a government to define. Yet for just a moment, there is time to take a breath. Nowhere on Earth is the air as sweet as in Macedonia."
 POLITICS_MIHAJLO_APOSTOLSKI_DESC: "In another world, perhaps Mihajlo Apostolski and Metodija Andonov-Čento could have lived each other's lives. Two men stood ready to save Macedonia. Two men devoted their lives to its liberation. Two men lived to see it free.\n\nYet one became lost. Too willing to accommodate the Bulgarian reactionaries, he gradually alienated his base of Macedonian youths, whose dreams of independence he slowly sold away. When Andonov-Čento flew too close to the sun, Apostolski returned to cut off his wings.\n\nNow leader of Macedonia, Apostolski's fears has come to dominate Macedonian life. A scholar as much as a warrior, he has long written of Bulgaria as a nation of oppressors, from which Macedonia must defend. With hostile forces surrounding him, the chairman saw no choice but to lock Macedonia off from the world.\n\nNow, Macedonia is independent - fiercely independent, with a growing army and a mess of fortifications in every city. Yet Bulgarians live as second-class citizens, and even Macedonians must watch for government eyes. Apostolski is not a cruel man, but he demands freedom for his nation. Until the world accepts Macedonia, he will never emerge from the fortress he has made."
