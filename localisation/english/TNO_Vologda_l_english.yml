 ### Character Loc ###
 # Leaders #
 VOL_Vasily_Ivanov: "Vasily Ivanov"
 POLITICS_VASILY_IVANOV_DESC: "Vasily Nikolayevich Ivanov had a humble beginning as a rural shoemaker before being drafted into the Red Army in the 1920s. In the following years, he was able to join the officers' academy and steadily improved his position, holding the rank of Colonel by the time of the German invasion. He and his brigade fought in the ill-fated defense of Moscow, but were able to pull off a relatively orderly retreat when the Mozhaisk line broke and the Wehrmacht poured through. They went in the opposite direction from many of the other veterans and retreated north, falling in with Marshal Yegorov's forces. Ivanov was promoted to the rank of General in the nascent West Russian Revolutionary Front, and he was one of the commanders who led the charge in the offensive against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the momentum would not last. Betrayal and internal power struggles weakened the Front, and the Germans and their collaborators were soon able to reverse the tide. Having already liberated and occupied his native home of Vologda, Ivanov made the hard decision to abandon his cause, and his army seceded from the Front and declared neutrality. To him, continued involvement with the rapidly-disintegrating Front would have simply brought more bloodshed to a region that had already seen so much.\n\nThis move has won Ivanov the praise of the people of Vologda, who view him as both the liberator of their city from Nazi tyranny and the bulwark who keeps the chaos of the other warlords at bay. His position has also been reluctantly accepted by both the Front and Reichskommissariat Moskowien, who recognize the usefulness of a buffer state existing between them. But while this policy of armed neutrality has been a successful deterrent in recent years, it is only a matter of time before a warlord calls his bluff and puts his army to the test."
 
 POLITICS_PAVEL_BELYAYEV_DESC: "During the Great Patriotic War, during the Moscow evacuation, Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev was a nobody; a flight school cadet, not someone one should fear. During the West Russian War, he rose to prominence as one of Ivanov's most capable pilots, eventually cementing for himself a place among his closest advisors. When Ivanov founded the State of Vologda, Pavel stood beside him all the while, a godfather to a newly christened government. During this early period, he served Ivanov faithfully, pledging to be above politics and to continue advising the founder as capable as he could.\n\nPavel would break this promise only a few years into the founding, partially out of fear of being rendered irrelevant, and partly out of his disappointment at the State's indecision. He was elected into the People's Assembly, the legislative body of Vologda. No one, at least not publicly, doubted his loyalty to Ivanov. However, in the chamber itself, he had become increasingly critical of Ivanov's almost-pacifistic conception of Vologda as being a "neutral zone" for all Russians. He joined the Militarists, and, owing to his prestige as a godfather of the State, he climbed the rungs of their hierarchy, emerging as their head.\n\nNow, as the leader of the Militarists, he advocates for something radically different from the other parliamentary factions. He regards their policy of "neutrality" and "liberal democracy" as being stumbling blocks that will set the State tumbling down. Instead, he passionately argues for irredentism. To him, war and force is the safest guarantee for Vologda, but not everyone is as sure."

 POLITICS_ANATOLY_DRYGIN_DESC: "Anatoly Semenovich Drygin is a divisive figure in Vologda. To his supporters, he is a rare human face in the military, a true believer in democracy and in safeguarding the statelet's ordinary people. To his opponents, he is a naive dreamer with no answers to Vologda's pressing security questions. One thing nobody can dispute, however, is that Drygin has always fought nobly for what he sees as right.\n\nBorn into a large peasant family in Saratov, Drygin initially studied agronomy and became an expert in berry cultivation (a hobby he still indulges in his free time), but was drafted into the Red Army when the Germans began their invasion, continuing to fight for the West Russian Revolutionary Front after the Soviet Union collapsed and eventually serving under General Vasily Ivanov. Never a military man at heart, he learned to suppress his personal ideals for the benefit of Russia, facing some of the most brutal battle against the Reich without once questioning orders.\n\nFor Drygin, Ivanov's declaration of neutrality in the West Russian War was an eye-opener. Seeing military achievement sacrificed to protect human life inspired him, and his war-hardened cynicism rapidly disintegrated. He ran for the People's Assembly almost immediately after its foundation, and became the founder of its Democratic faction, avidly promoting reforms for the territory's peasant population.\n\nDrygin has long had dreams of making Vologda the democratic pearl of western Russia. Now that he has consolidated power in the People's Assembly, he is well-positioned to make them reality."

 ### Ideas ###
 VOL_neutral_zone: "Neutral Zone"
 VOL_neutral_zone_desc: "Enough bloodshed; with these words General Ivanov has decreed the cessation of fighting in the sector under his command. No longer will we shed Russian blood while the hated German has already broken the Homeland's spine and while civilians fear for their lives. No - we will protect those under our care, and wait for better days. Then, and only then, will we strike."

 VOL_ONG_Miklay_Kazakov: "Miklay Kazakov"
 POLITICS_MIKLAY_KAZAKOV_DESC: "The Mari people had long been denied their nationhood by every Russian state and its successors who ruled over them. Whether they bore the red banner of socialism or the tricolor, it was all the same, but Miklay Ivanovich Kazakov made it his life's goal to change that. As the victory of the Anti-Communist Guard in West Russia became almost an inevitability, he rallied ethnic Mari across the region to join a Mari Regiment which fought alongside the Guard.\n\nLabelled the "warrior poet" by his compatriots, as he always kept a passion for poetry and literature, Kazakov was the obvious choice to be placed as the leader of the first ethnic Mari state and so he became.\n\nThe Republic has been another success story for North Russia, as Kazakov has stabilized it and looks to other states of the Idel-Ural as well as Arkhangelsk for cooperation and solidarity."
