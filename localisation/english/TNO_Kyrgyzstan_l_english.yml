POLITICS_TURDAKUN_USUBALIEV_DESC: "Turdakun Usubaliyevich Usubaliyev was born in 1919 into a Kyrgyz peasant family and embraced communism in his youth. He once envisioned a bright future, but after graduating from Kyrgyz State University in 1941, the Germans destroyed the Soviet Union, leaving the people of Central Asia in ruins.\n\nClearly, something had gone wrong with communism; yet, communism was not all bad. It was through communism that a poor farmer's son like him had the opportunity for education, employment, and social advancement. The main problem with communism was obviously its refusal to harness the unifying power of religion. Turdakun would not make this mistake again. To unite the Kyrgyz people once more, he needed not the promises of the past, but rather the power that had united the people for centuries. This power could also help Kyrgyzstan gain external support.\n\nWith this ideal in mind, the Islamic State of Talas was born. This country still adhered to orthodox socialism, but with a strong religious tone throughout the government. This approach of blending different ideologies was the creation of its leader, Turdakun—of course, for the benefit of all the Kyrgyz people."
POLITICS_KALIYNUR_USENBEKOV_DESC: "The chaotic events of the past few decades have left an indelible mark on Kyrgyzstan. This mark is etched on every inch of the land, in the lives of its people, and most notably, on the country's president. Kaliynur was born in what was once the Turkestan Soviet Republic. Raised by his parents to be an ideal Kyrgyz, he grew up hearing stories and legends of the Tsar's fickleness and the governor's brutality, becoming a model Marxist-Leninist. He then joined the Red Army, defending the land beneath his feet, the people around him—and the infinite distance, the countless people.\n\nBut eventually, the Soviet Union met its tragic defeat, and Kaliynur had no choice but to return to his homeland with his comrades. They hoped to regroup and recover after the defeat, but instead encountered more conflict. Neighboring Tajikistan and Afghanistan were engulfed in war, and over time, the Tajiks' situation worsened. Kaliynur led the Kyrgyz People's Red Army in a heroic resistance against powerful enemies. Unfortunately, he fell into the hands of a particularly brutal Afghan general during the fighting, nearly losing his left eye in a freezing prison.\n\nFortunately, Kaliynur was eventually rescued. This rescue did not come from a powerful liberation army but from an unparalleled hero—Turdakun Usubaliyev. Together, Kaliynur and Turdakun returned to Kyrgyzstan as tragic heroes who had faced many setbacks. From then on, Kaliynur was determined to turn to political struggle, where he would fight for his own victory. The people trust him, the people support him, the people rely on him—and he is determined to carve a bright path for the rebirth of Central Asia."
