 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_MODIBO_KEITA_DESC: "If one was to tread through the various fiefdoms of West Africa, the state of Mali would be seen as rather quiet and ordinary, the people seeming less repressed than the various others. This is the nation of Modibo Keïta, a man trapped between the strength of his morals, but the danger of radical beliefs in a place as unstable as West Africa.\n\nBorn in a neighbourhood of Bamako, Keïta could claim ancestors in the founders of the Mali Empire, but he was never an advocate for wild expansionism. Instead, Keïta found his home in socialist groups across French West Africa, uniting many across Mali in the quest for Malian freedom and properity.\n\nHe ran into a roadblock in this noble goal with the German Victory over France. As Charles de Gaulle's forces secured what it could of West Africa, Keïta stayed in open revolt against the French, creating his own Militias and mobilising against de Gaulle's army, much to their chagrin. And then, the bombs began dropping. The French were not only pushed out of Mali, but pushed to the Ivory Coast, and Keïta maintained what control he had... at least when they weren't afraid to step outside on a clear day for the planes dropping fire from the sky. At this point, the militias were a melting pot of everyone wishing for any kind of Malian autonomy. Islamists, Socialists, Liberals, Fascists, everyone rubbing up against eachother. Fights constantly erupted between various members in the Malian State to the point of farce. Keïta's constant progressive reforms to the maintenance of the state didn't help, as it simply made the more conservative militiamen angry.\n\nThen, one day, the bombs stopped, and ironically, while the chaos in the desert silenced, the chaos in the state only became more aggressive. The dissident Moussa Traoré has united the Islamist militiamen into a stable army, and has siezed the city of Kayes as his own. It seems that a battle for the future of Mali has begun, and Modibo Keïta is leading his armies into the future."

 ### Ideas
 MLI_idea_keitas_leadership: "Keïta's Leadership"
 MLI_idea_keitas_leadership_desc: "Given the circumstances, elections in Mali could not have gone better. Modibo Keïta is Mali's first- and thus far only- President, elected by the will of the people. Keïta's own mandate is a particular unique blend of socialist ideology and more practical methods of maintaining control.\n\nMali is divided between those who hold up Pan-African ideals and seek to align the nation with Cameroon, and the traditionalists who wish to preserve Mali's sovereignty. Keïta walks a thin line, but if he can hold the country together, Mali will emerge on the other side all the stronger."
 MLI_idea_traore_problem: "The Traoré Problem"
 MLI_idea_traore_problem_desc: "Though President Keïta was chosen by the people, not all of the people have faith in the leader of the young country. All the same, these detractors are by and large, nothing to worry about. Jealous ingrates and incompetents, with a glaring exception.\n\nMoussa Traoré is a young military officer who has the ear of much of Mali's military. Rumor and fearmongering about puppeteers in Cameroon run rampant among the ranks, and no doubt, he is looking to foreign capital to support the possible overthrow of Malian democracy."
