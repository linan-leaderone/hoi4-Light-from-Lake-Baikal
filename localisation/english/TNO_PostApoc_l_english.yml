 RAD_RUS.1.t: "Another Day in Siberia" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.1.desc: "It was a cold, cold day in Siberia, as it always was. Snow covered the ground, hiding dirt that had never seen the sun deep below, and never would. As Artyom marched through it in boots and furs, a bundle of birds in one hand and his rifle in the other, he looked at the clouds above. They looked darker than normal, a sure sign of a storm.\n\nShrugging off the snow from his furs and leathers, he approached his ramshackle hut and slowly opened the door, carefully placing his items down on a table nearby.\n\nAfter a quiet moment of contemplation as he remarked over his quiet abode and lit his lamp, he scratched his dog, Sasha, behind the ear and turned on the radio as he did everyday, and frowned as he got nothing besides static.\n\nArtyom quickly started surfing through the few stations he reached, and found nothing but static, static, and more static. After some time, he shrugged, he had expected the old tilting radio tower near the equally dilapidated village to collapse for days now, nothing could be done. The outside world, and all of its wonders, were nothing but a distant thought for Artyom, and after a sigh, he turned off the radio for the last time."
 RAD_RUS.1.a: "Life goes on..."
 
 RAD_RUS.2.t: "The Watcher in the Hills" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.2.desc: "The old man sat, like he did many days, just outside of the cabin on the hill in which he had lived for decades.\n\nSlowly, he rocked in his chair, an old, beaten radio sitting next to a pile of books, blaring out hectic announcements about the destruction of Germania, of Tokyo, of London and Rome, and of New York City. Even from his perch on this hill, he could see distantly the change in the color of the sky, some sort of wayward weapon launched into the Russian wastes. The Germans, no doubt. It was always the Germans.\n\nThe man sighed, wiping a tear from his eye, looking at the old red flag which he still hung from the wall next to his door.\n\nIn a well practiced movement, with shaky hands he slowly removed a weathered photograph. He looked at the figures in it, all so much younger back then. They were at their teacher's funeral, all of them. Before it had all gone so wrong... before he had played his own hand in destroying the world...\n\nThe old man pushed the photo back into his coat and turned off the radio. After contemplating the distant sky and wiping away a final tear, he stood up and walked inside, before firmly closing the door behind him.\n\nThe past was in the past, but all had to pay for it."
 RAD_RUS.2.a: "A story to be forgotten in time."
 
 RAD_RUS.3.t: "The Horde Rides" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.3.desc: "The bombs fell, and the bombs destroyed civilization as the world knew it. In some places, however, civilization had not truly existed, at least not for a long, long time.\n\nIn Western Russia, many died as the Germans, out of spite, dropped any spare nuclear weapons in their arsenal on Russia, perhaps out of a hope that the Russians would not be the ones to win the wastes.\n\nThis did not work, however, for the real damage made by a nuclear weapon is its effect on a society, and the Russians had already built a society well used to German bombs and atrocities. In the time after the bombs fell and the world went silent, the Russians continued as they had, fighting, pillaging, battling one another for land.\n\nIn West Russia, however, large bands of Russians, bandits and mercenaries, settlers and adventurers, all began the long trek west. In a horde they came, scaring off or destroying the struggling communities of Germans holding on in the wasteland, and slowly but surely, they drifted through Moskowien, through the remains of Poland, and into Germany itself."
 RAD_RUS.3.a: "A new migration begins."

 RAD_RUS.4.t: "The Second Sun" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.4.desc: "The SS would be forgotten, in time. Another remnant of an ancient civilization that would be left for the archaeologists of the future to theorize on. However, like many lost things of the last age, they would struggle for survival in this new world, furiously refusing to accept that what they once fought for was well and truly gone. Ashes and smoke, dust and dust.\n\nOne such splinter persisted in the land of Cossacks and grain for two decades after the collapse. The land they guarded was known as having once been a military base, though nobody could quite tell what was on it. The soldiers would shoot any who dared come near, whether the harried German survivors or the bandits of the east, and all the natives knew to avoid it.\n\nThe SS inside plotted, behind closed doors, to create a great second sun and purge clean the filth that inhabited what was once a great Empire. Nobody would ever know this, however, or the story of the one aged man, who in the uniform of evil stepped into the room where these men worked day and night to restore the great tools of war, armed with only a pistol and his faith.\n\nA second sun bloomed across the land that day, and nothing would show that the SS once persisted here besides the simmering remains of the missile base."
 RAD_RUS.4.a: "Lost to time."

 RAD_RUS.5.t: "Faith and Fire" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.5.desc: "The small church survived the fires which wiped out Tyumen. Isolated as it was and bereft of anything valuable to steal, the building and its congregation survived the decades of hunger and cold that followed. The mayor had perished in the fires, and it was up to the local priest, an outcast of little note, to guide the villagers and refugees through the harsh times.\n\nIt was thirty years after the fires when the old Bishop died, his replacement elected from the priests he had appointed and the man himself given as luxurious a funeral as the village could provide. Sixty years after the fires ended, the first of the Great Warlords, claiming to be a reincarnation of Old Zhukov, strode through the small town square and proclaimed his dominion over what had become known simply as "Church Town" and its inhabitants for a thousand years hence. Soon his rival, the Chairwoman of a new Soviet Union based out of old Yugra, drove him over the mountains and back into Yakutia from whence he came, and she too proclaimed her rightful leadership over Church Town in front of the Bishop's mausoleum. A hundred and twenty four years after the ash fell, when the Fourth Chairman was slain by his own generals, the Archbishop took the opportunity to quietly stop paying taxes to his nominal liege.\n\nA hundred and eighty seven years after the world died, the Church Upon the Hill had become the center of a thriving if troubled trade city, constantly appeasing whichever of the Diadochi demanded tribute that year. A hundred and ninety three years after the smoke cleared, the Metropolitan of Tserkov' na Kholme proclaimed a holy Kingdom of his own atop the ashes of six armies sent to slay him and burn his city to the ground.\n\nThree hundred and two years after the bombs ended what was, a part of Rus was once again subsumed into a greater whole."
 RAD_RUS.5.a: "For the motherland!"

 RAD_RUS.6.t: "The Cossack" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.6.desc: "There had been a time, he was sure, when things were not quite so bleak. If he were to call back to his oldest memories, back when the Tsar had still reigned and Bukharin was but another member of the party, then he could even recall feeling joyous about the way in which the world was headed.\n\nUnder the Soviets things had been harsh of course, but all the same he had continued onwards in the sure knowledge that his nation would travel through the bitter age into one of light and joy. Then the Germans, carelessly, irreverently, callously destroyed everything he had valued in nought but a night. His family dead, his nation sundered - his spirit had broken. But as the old Cossack sat upon the hill, gazing upon the great mushroom clouds in the distance, something inside him awoke.\n\nWhen the villagers flocked to his house with question he answered and organized them into a militia to stop the inevitable bandit raids. When the disparate mix of former soldiers, some still wearing the robes of the vanished Red Army, passed through the village he recruited those of good temperament and spirit. When the long winter ended, an army set forth to bring peace to a motherland long wracked by war.\n\nThe task was not completed in his lifetime, nor that of his successor, or her successor after. But eventually, part of the motherland was peaceful and free from the tyrants who had for so long brought nothing but ruin to its people. For a time. And in the streets of what had once been Moscow, the vigilant traveler might find the lovingly preserved statue of the old Cossack."
 RAD_RUS.6.a: "A good legacy."

 RAD_RUS.7.t: "And Just Because He's Human" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.7.desc: "What is a man?\n\nIs a man just a human being with intelligence? Is he a man because he can think and feel? No, for a slave can do that as easily as any man. His father had been a slave before the fires blotted out the horizon, beholden to the local officers and whatever bandit king was stronger than the rest on a given day. His death had only bound his family to the servitude he was shackled to in life.\n\nDoes a human become a man by belief, by some secret knowledge that in truth he is no bound to the will of another? His brother had believed that, right up until the moment the guards beat him half to death for talking back and finding he could do nothing. He hadn't lasted so long after that.\n\nMaybe what makes a man is birth? Some arcane and unknowable force that gives other men the power over others? But if that were true then the son of the old Baron would not be working here beside him, half starved and missing an eye. No, no liberation from above was evident, nor was any forthcoming.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that a man chooses. A slave obeys.\n\nAnd Vasily, youngest son of Ivan, worker in the mines, reflected that it might be time to stop obeying the overseer."
 RAD_RUS.7.a: "No kings, no lords, only men."

 RAD_RUS.8.t: "A Man Would Like a Little Bite to Eat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.8.desc: "Hunger was an old friend to the people of the steppe. A gnawing, constant companion for those who lived on the edge of the known world. When crops failed, you felt hunger. When the sheep died, you felt hunger. When the lords and generals came for their taxes you felt hunger most keenly of all. For they took what was not theirs to take.\n\nIn times long past some of the elders claimed that things had not been this way - they spoke of times of plenty, where every man could eat his fill and nobody paid more tax than any other. But who amongst the lords and the army men would listen to the tales of some scum from the steppe? Even the wrath of Allah, raised against their decadent cities like blinding fire, had not been enough to crush them completely, for like rodents they emerged from the earth and rebuilt them.\n\nBut on this night, the young men of the clan were ready to prove to the army men and the lords that it was poor practice to take the food of a starving man and not make sure he was dead afterwards. Readying the old PPSH his grandfather so treasured, the boy watched silently as the column of men marched below the hillside below. It clung to his overalls, a chill presence.\n\nThen at the signal, he moved. Slowly the figures descended into the village - the peace of the night was lost amidst the screams and growing, rank smell of smoke."
 RAD_RUS.8.a: "Desperation is a powerful motivator."

 RAD_RUS.9.t: "He Wants No Bull and a Lot of Talk" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.9.desc: "The bunker was a dark and dreary place for civilization to have been displaced into, a concrete nightmare of dull edges and flat empty walls. The Commissar had been surprised the day he was told that if the worst happened, it would be himself and no other who would take charge of the survivors of Bunker A4. In retrospect he supposed it was no real promotion so much as it was sidelining him to allow the Major to promote his son to the position of regimental Commissar.\n\nBut the world was full of irony, and the Commissar was quite certain that neither the Major, his son or anyone else outside the bunkers was alive. The screams of those poor souls, rent in the inner parts by the aftereffects of nuclear annihilation, had ceased months ago anyway. He'd heard their cries drift into the dead static on the radios.\n\nNo, the trouble that the Commissar was running into was keeping high the spirits of those who were trapped in Bunker A4 with him. Those either selected for their skills or lucky enough to have been near the entrance when the sirens sounded were alive, which put them at a great advantage to their contemporaries, but they were growing restive. He kept up the patriotic speeches as much as he could. He reminded them that their survival was ensured with the rudimentary designs of the complex (at least until the food ran out or the water systems spoiled), and that to continue living both spited the hated enemy and honored the memory of the fallen.\n\nBut if he was honest, he was unsure how much good his speeches did. And if Bunker A4 had its own Commissar doubting the future, what could be said of its soldiers?"
 RAD_RUS.9.a: "An apocalypse is not an easy thing to live through."

 RAD_RUS.10.t: "That Gives No Bread or Meat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.10.desc: "The crops had been poor one year too many. A single year of failed crops and people would curse, but they might go on with their lives afterwards and keep it as a bitter memory. Two years of failed crops was a disaster, but one that could be managed with stored foods and appropriate reductions in the taxes paid. Three years though, three years was dangerous. It implied something supernatural was punishing the village for its sins. Or, as some were whispering in the darker alleys and the tavern, the sins of its leaders.\n\nLocal Party Chairman Mikhail had tried to quell those rumors at first by donating out of his own stock three fine pigs for a village feast, but the villagers had been more interested in the fact that he could so easily give out three of the fattest pigs they had ever seen when the livestock on their own lands was so thin a breeze might blow it over. Boris had never considered himself the most socially observant of men but even he could see that the cauldron of poor decisions might easily boil over if the wrong actions were taken.\n\nWhich was why he now sat in the middle of the street, accordion in hand, singing a song his grandmother had taught him from her youth. The accordion sat uncomfortable in his hands, and he got sore easily, but old habits built from childhood were hard to erode. Quickly the Commissar's tune became steady and his song acquired a rustic strength to it.\n\nAt first the village folk were unsure of what was going on, and then the eldest amongst them began taking up the verse. Then the children, eager to please, added their fickle voices to the harmony. It took time, but eventually all in the village, from Old Mikhail to the drunken beggars, had joined the chorus.\n\nThe talks still took a few days afterwards, but the fire had cooled, and the village folk accepted that another year would be given a chance before action was decided. Everything had calmed, for now."
 RAD_RUS.10.a: "The will of the people is a fickle thing."
 
 RAD_RUS.11.t: "Erasing What Was" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.11.desc: "It had always been a quiet town, before the bombs. One of relative peace and quiet, situated comfortably in the eastern woods. Yet when the bombs fell, bringing great roaring flame to the cities of men, the peace was broken.\n\nIt was not the bombs that brought chaos to this quiet place, but those within. As the degradation of outside society occurred, the townsfolk felt the effects despite their separation. The cessation of all essential imports, the sudden lack of governance, the collapse of local security forces. Whilst not struck by the bombs, the town was still struck by utter disaster. And that was when the fanaticism erupted.\n\n"Remove all traces! Simple lives for simple men!" the leaders cried. "Let us never return to those corrupted ways!", they would proclaim, in reference to the technology upon which they all had once relied. A wave of anti-technological fervor swept the town. Vehicles were burned where they stood. Books educating upon any topics of technological significance were destroyed. Any piece of post-industrial technological progress was brought to ruin. Even firearms, initially used to enforce compliance with the destructive mob, had their ammunition expended and were in turn destroyed.\n\nYet what initially began as a flare of violent fervor, created the benefit of early adaptation to the new world. Unlike many societies, who would cling to the final operational facets of the industrialized world until it would spell their doom, the village found itself reverting to a rather primitive society within a very short period of time, forced by themselves to adapt quickly to the changing world.\n\nAs the years would drag on, and as the town survived many hardships, the reactionary fervor of days past was all but forgotten. The town would continue to stand the test of time, as progress was made to a brighter future once again. Only the lingering name of the village - Simple Town - was left to bear witness to the chaos which had once rocked it."
 RAD_RUS.11.a: "Perhaps some knowledge is not worth saving."
 
 RAD_RUS.12.t: "The Horse Lords" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.12.desc: "In the boundless steppes that form the heart of the great continent, far from the great rivers and mountains, roams a growing nomadic society. The boundless grassy flats of the steppes have long been home to a plethora of different peoples. With the lands so well suited to grazing, pack animals and livestock herds became incredibly abundant. With so few conditions existing to attach the natives to their land, entire societies took to the saddle. Entire populations began to roam the steppes, with few permanent settlements dotted throughout the lands.\n\nThe phenomenon of mobile societies grew to be an increasingly common sight in the great steppe. Some roamed peacefully about the lands, tending to their livestock and moving when favorable, yet others took their mobility to a more aggressive advantage. Talk of roving societies of raiders upon horseback were spoken of in hushed voices. Great bands of mounted warriors traveled between settlements with an ultimatum; to present to them a tribute, or to face the sacking and plunder of their homes - eventually the riders grew drunk on their power and brought torment to all in their reach who remained rooted to their lands.\n\nThe evolution of a mobile society created many woes for the people of the steppes, and those surrounding it. Scarcely could one consider themselves distant from risk. Yet it also created great opportunity for those willing to seize it, by saddle and sword."
 RAD_RUS.12.a: "How freeing it must be to live by the saddle."
 
 RAD_RUS.13.t: "The Cirque" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.13.desc: "The settlements of former Siberia were dreary places. Cold, dark, and isolated, one would think the people of this far north land would be melancholy and quiet, concerned only with maintaining their meagre state of survival. Yet, this was never so in these days, in part because of the efforts of the Cirque. No one knew exactly where or when the Cirque was first founded, or what its motivations had ever been. No one knew exactly what a Cirque was, even--but that didn't stop them from enjoying it.\n\nThe Cirque traveled from town to town, settlement to settlement, commune to commune, spreading stories and mirth as they went. Popular with the young and the old alike, their stories sang of ancient ages, long past; ages where man conquered the sky and stars, where the land around them was united under one red banner, then blue, then black, then red again. Their stories inspired a vision for a future in the young and a nostalgia for the past in the old, exciting and invigorating them all.\n\nEach of the plays and dances of the Cirque were a source of hope and comfort to the people of this frigid country. Their songs told not only of the past, but of a vision of the future, one that urged the men, women, and children of the north onwards, to a brighter life ahead of them."
 RAD_RUS.13.a: "The snows shine bright in winter."
 
 RAD_RUS.14.t: "Ashes to Ashes" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.14.desc: "No one could remember when Lenin died, and just as many could remember why exactly they guarded his corpse so zealously. For generations, the villagers surrounding the hovel that was once the city of Tyumen worked tirelessly to keep the casket that contained his corpse safe. Once, surely, they had known their purpose. They had known why this man was so important that generations should gladly give their lives to protect him.\n\nBut that was a long time ago, and now they worked day and night to protect little more than a skeleton. They did what they could to keep the body preserved, but the techniques and technology their ancestors had used so long ago had faded from memory. And so the venerated man in the casket had withered and faded until he was little more than bone, hair, and a suit. Even the man's name had faded from memory. The word Lenin remained, yes, but if this was his first or last name, none of them could say. The time had come to lay this man to rest, at long last.\n\nAnd so it was that a grave was dug and the body was lowered gently into the grave. As the people of what was once Tyumen buried the body, they felt a sense of closure. They were ending a chapter in their history. Perhaps a new one would soon begin."
 RAD_RUS.14.a: "Laid to rest at last."
 
 RAD_RUS.15.t: "Stalwart Shell, Soft Heart" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.15.desc: "Beware, child, beware the west, for there the Gormayans once did dwell. Terrible monsters were they, as tall as three men, covered in white hair, their eyes blue as ice. In the olden days did they ravish our lands, burn our fields, and steal our women and children to appease their dark god Nazeh.\n\nBut even in the darkest of times, hope was not lost. Brave men and women stood against the Gormayans -- oh, your many-times-grandfather was one of them, child! He survived even after the Gormayans destroyed his village, even after they left him in their den without clothes to protect against the winter snow, so great was his determination to defeat their evil.\n\nHe escaped from the Gormayans, you see, and found his way to the ruins of his home. From there he built an army to oppose them. They adorned themselves in armor of darkest black, shade of the ash into which the Gormayans had turned their lands. For years they waited, trained, prepared for the moment to deliver their vengeance... and one day, it came. In their own hubris, the Gormayans had weakened and bickered among themselves. The time had come to strike.\n\nAs one, your ancestor and his Black Army surged to meet the Gormayans in battle. Their struggle reduced cities to rubble and nations to ash. But in the end, the Gormayans lay defeated. Your ancestor paid a terrible price for his vengeance, young one, and you must never forget that. The monsters lay dead, but so did the world itself.\n\nAnd so he laid down his arms and worked to rebuild the world, to repay it for his role in destroying it. Our family has always, and will always, carry on his legacy, child, for we have the greatest of sins weighing on our backs."
 RAD_RUS.15.a: "An Old Wives' Tale, surely?"

 RAD_RUS.16.t: "The Last Gun" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.16.desc: "The assembly of the AKM rifle with serial number MX 5807 concluded at the Zlatoust Machine-Building Plant at precisely midnight, where it would be loaded into a box along with several others and assorted ammo and shipped off to its buyer by truck.\n\nHalfway through its journey, the world ended. It would never reach its buyer, as their city had been scorched to magma by a nuclear blast. The driver would turn around and try to find somewhere to take refuge, abandoning the truck when it ran out of fuel. Several weeks would pass before the truck and its contents were discovered by wandering refugees. MX 5807 was taken by a young woman who would go on to use it to lethal effect in defending her loved ones from bandit raids and savage beasts, before her unfortunate demise at the hands of a violent drunk, who would proceed to turn the gun on himself in shame at his actions.\n\nThe gun would lie beside their slowly rotting bodies for days, accruing rust and mildew in the meantime, before being picked up by a wanderer heading for the mountains. In time he would sell it for a bottle of vodka, and the gun's journey would continue. From hand to hand it would pass, but as the years wore on and ammunition grew scarce it became less of a weapon and more of a trophy piece. For twenty years it would hang within the tent of a great warlord as he marched west, before being won in an arm wrestling contest by one of his underlings.\n\nFollowing his master's final defeat, the underling found himself lost and penniless in a foreign land.

He would die nameless at the edge of what had been the Commonwealth, a kindly stranger taking the time to bury him with his remaining possessions, including his ancient treasure.\n\nWhen MX 5807 saw the sun again, curious faces stared down at it, dusting it off carefully with special tools.

 RAD_RUS.17.desc: ""For the inhabitants of Uralia, things certainly could have been worse. From what could be pieced together so long after the event, the cleansing flames had not affected the region much at all. At least, if one where to ask a traveler from the east or west, they would paint a picture of devastation that was simply not to be found in the snowy mountains where many had in fact fled to during the Great Exodus. While it is harsh and unforgiving, ask any Uralian if they would rather live somewhere else, and they would look at you with their red-rimmed eyes as if you were crazy.\n\nI had a chance to speak to several Uralians candidly about their history and legends while I was researching for this book, and found that there are many stories to be found in the shadow of those mountains. One legend of note concerned a rumored legion of ghost warriors who have appeared over the long years to cause chaos and violence. There may seem to be something to these rumors, for I have found documentations of entire villages going missing in recent years. However, my book examines the evidence and I believe that the nomadic tendency of the people of the Urals is the cause of these disappearances rather than anything supernatural. As for the source of the legend, I have also discovered interesting information regarding a pre-Catastrophe bandit gang that is the likely inspiration for these myths.\n\nAnother prominent regional superstition I investigated was that of the so-called "Shadow Mountain" where none but the bravest or most stubborn Uralian would dare approach sober. While questioning East Eurasians can often be a difficult task for a foreigner, I was met with even stiffer resistance than usual. Apparently it is an uncomfortable subject, though I confess that my lack of progress in this area makes speculation as to why this is the case difficult. Obviously the claims that a great demon resides under the mountain itself is nothing more than myth, but I remain disappointed in my inability to discover the context and explanation behind said myth..."\n\nExcerpt from "On the Legends and Superstitions of the East-Eurasian Peoples" by Kynrid Atum"

Instead, he found them hounding him, all the more intensely: the fire, the bright flash of light, the coming dust storm that had swept the land away, as people and buildings crumbled into ash. Tears streamed down, washing away the dirt that marred his hands, flowing past the gaps in his fingers; the first time in such long years.\n\n"What are you doing here, mister?" said a voice, childish and distant. "Are you lost?" He looked up, his eyes red. He stared at the child, a boy of nine, for some time, his lips unmoving. No nerve in his body could command them to open. Finally, his throat screeched a pathetic reply, "What?" He drew up the sleeves of his uniform. "Do you see this?" He pointed to his tattoos, tracing the swastikas as they snake their way through his arm. "I'm your enemy! You should fear me!" He strode forward only for his knees to fail him, and he landed face-first on the ground.\n\nThe child laughed. Valdemar groaned on the ground. "You're funny, mister," the boy said, crouching as he approached Valdemar. "What's your name?"\n\n"Name?" Valdemar muttered, his crimes pursuing his thoughts, his conscience tainted by the blood that flowed from that name. "I don't have one," he finally said.\n\n"Aww, you can't be serious, mister," the child pouted. "Tell you what, I'll give you one: I have a buddy called Vanya, and he's my best friend. I don't know where he went," the child swung his head to the left and right as if looking for Vanya, "so you can have his name."\n\nValdemar sat up. "Vanya's a bad name for a man like me," he finally said, smiling desolately at the child, "Ivan is better."\n\n"Fine," the child said, stretching it out "What's so great about Ivan anyway?"\n\nIvan didn't answer, looking up into the sky.

No sonic scream of jet engines, the sound of bombers overhead. No crack of distant explosives, no strays to strike the village. For the first time in years, there was no bombing, no war, no more. It was over.\n\nA massive grin stretched across Pyotr's face, and he leaped into the air out of pure, overwhelming joy. Rushing back inside his hut, he called out to his Babushka.

No matter what frequency he tuned it to, however, or how hard he smacked it, it received only static. Not to worry.

The black gold so valued in the old world was hard to come by, so far from the ruins of the Mountain Reich and its vast, arcane facilities. With no source of the strange, flammable liquid to hand, those elders who knew its secrets felt no need to pass their knowledge down to later generations. So it was that the horse, once obsolete to all save the impoverished nomads of the World-That-Was, became a dominant force on the battlefield once more.\n\nOf all the disparate tribes who remained in the harsh steppes north of the Three Seas, none were so fearsome as the Eagle Guard. Riders without compare, the Guard were born of the merging of two older and equally mighty tribes: the White Eagles, exiles from a verdant land far to the west, and the Gorno-gvardia, hard and cold-eyed men of the northern mountains who had come south seeking allies against the wicked Cult of the Hooked Cross. Once thought destroyed in the fires that consumed their original homeland, the Cult had constructed a new temple-city in the frozen north from which a new and horrific empire of slavery and genocide was spreading.\n\nAt the head of a grand coalition of southern tribes, the newly-formed Eagle Guard struck north, leading charge after charge into the howling blizzards. Even as their allies buckled and retreated before the frigid northern winds, the Guard was relentless in their advance. The battle was not yet lost so long as a single Guard and his horse kept fighting - and they numbered in the thousands. With gun, sword and lance, the Eagle Guard thundered through the Cult's lines like an unstoppable force of nature, the name of Saint Mendowicz on their lips. By the time the blizzards began to subside and green returned to the tundra, the Temple of the Hooked Cross was a smoking ruin, and the banner of the Straight and True Cross flew over the palace of the Aryan Priest-King.\n\nThis is the most famous of their tales, but far from the last. Even today, the Eagle Guard spreads its wings across the steppes, banishing evil and Aryan devilry wherever it might be found."

All across the scattered steppe and cold expanses of tundra, men and women woke up, got dressed, and carried on with their day. Many nations continued in some sense, for better or for worse. The Tale of the Black Mountain of the latter.\n\nIn the center of the old land was the Black Mountain. Before the war, the surrounding region was ruled by a maniac, whose perverted experiments lingered in the public memory long after his name was forgotten. The Thinker, as he came to be known, was obsessed with the concept of human purity and the refinement thereof. He believed that athleticism, intelligence, even morality could be made a function of chemical formulas and trauma, observed and tested for through vile experimentation on live humans. The Thinker knew no ethical restraint, exposing his unwilling subjects to boiling heat and freezing cold, unproven pharmaceuticals, or physical torture; nothing was too depraved.\n\nWhen the bombs fell, the Thinker himself survived in his mountain. In the years following the Last War, he used the fruits of the apocalypse to conjure up newer, more horrific experiments. In time, the Black Mountain ruled over the land in much the same way as before the War.\n\nBut for all his depravity, the Thinker never produced anything in the Mountain other than misery. His crimes against humanity went unpunished, as he died in his sleep. Perhaps that is the lot of man. To suffer and to toil against terrible powers outside of their control, and then pick up the fragments after their suffering is through."

The priest, as quickly as he could, put his clothes on and ran as fast as he could to the church. There, he was awaited by the only man that could possibly be hitting the bell, the only other priest in the town. After hastily greeting him, Andrei asked what was happening, and the answer he got was simple: no one knew. Major cities in the region were disappearing, and people told tales of utter destruction and chaos wherever these massive explosions were happening. The priest thought he had an idea of what was going on, though.\n\nAndrei grabbed the Bible and quickly looked through its pages. As he did so, he recited verses he could remember, that all had something in common, something they revolved around: the Second Coming. The Day of Judgment by God Himself had come, and those who served him would join him in heaven, while those who did not would burn in hell. Holding the Bible in his hands, he ran to the grand entrance of the building and looked at the town for one last time. Seconds later, he was blinded by the lights. In his last few moments, he thought of his family, his home, and above all, Him. The time to join Him in heaven had come. The heathens would be proven wrong."

It was not legends that interested him but items of survival, and this place was sure to have some. In fact, it looked like there could be something hidden behind the massive cover that dwarfed Yuri in size.

The character of Mother Russia, in all of her endless incarnations, has mesmerized generation after generation, as new tales of her great deeds are discovered and immortalized.\n\nIn one tale, she was the daughter of a great leader of all of Eurasia, taking control and restoring his lands after he was struck down in battle. In another, she stands up to an entire angered city, to protect her unjustly persecuted lover. In the far-off lands around the frozen Vychegda, she is remembered for facing a dark mirror of herself to save her people from annihilation, and in the sand-swept lands of the southern Khans, the Qazaqi whisper fearfully of her wrath if they dare invade the lands of the Rus.

In the North, on the very doorstep of the world-devouring Reykh, one grand city held on, holding its peoples dear. Through the black rains, and flooding, through the waves of refugees and plagues that wracked the lands of once-proud Russia, the city on the river Syktyv endured, swelling its boroughs and outlands with every caravan that fled north.\n\nAs the empires of the Rus rose and fell, clashing and trading with one another, the Syktyvkarsky only continued to swell, until the great city crossed the banks of the river that sustained it, and illuminated the landscape for miles around with its grand lamps and engines. Fortune-seekers, visionaries, and the oppressed sought out the Syktyvkarsky for their tolerance, and found their fellows there, in the blooming libraries where they could learn of the Old World, and the theatres, where they could absorb the legends of their new home.\n\nIn these houses of knowledge they learned of the Convergences and Coalitions, of Voznesentsi soldiers and Suslovtsi bureaucrats, of the conflicts that their city was built upon.

Assembling the tribal councils of old, and gathering their texts and manuals, the Nenets moved south, bringing life to dying villages and starving people. Refugees from the south were taught the arts of hunting the reindeer and identifying edible plants. City dwellers were instructed in the old rites of preparing mushrooms and purifying melted snow, and former military were taught how to utilize the bow and arrow once the bullets ran out.\n\nWhen the winter lifted, and the brief, weak summer once more caressed the people of the far north, the sun did not fall on a field of frozen corpses, but on a new, toughened and enlightened civilization. The Nenets were honored and the praises of their teachers sung - from the Citadel of Gabriel to Manchugrad, the legend would spread, of the wise men of the north who saved the people of the North from ice-locked ruin."

They were proud of their ability to work on their feet - enduring impossible conditions and keeping the systems of the industrial city running.\n\nAnd that is why, when the atomic fires blanketed Russia, it took days for the news to arrive, heralded by panicked and isolated radio signals. As the snow cloaked the city once more - the Engineers quietly worked on, as they always had. Broken-down systems were used for parts to repair the rest of the enormous refinery complexes, which still produced refined metals to be used once they were rescued once more.\n\nAnd so it continued, for season after season. With each year, the furnaces dimmed as they began to run down, stripped of fuel and every redundancy possible. As their machines deteriorated, the Engineers did as well, falling one by one, cloaked by their winter coats, their bodies exhausted and starved. But the rescue did not come, and the Engineers worked on.\n\nAnd so, the lights of Norilsk began to dim, and go out. After what felt like an eternity, the last of the Norilsk Engineers, still faithfully feeding the final furnace with every scrap of material he could, began to feel his own body failing. And yet, he worked on.\n\nUntil the very end. Until he could see the lights in the distance.

She was told to be an angel with short hair, a simple face, who had lived meekly before evil came to her home, and who was armed with an artifice of God. For most, Vladimir told nothing more than tall tales, stories made merely to satisfy the wants of bored sleepless children, or, in Vladimir's case, to leech off youthful foolishness. However, to Lyudmila, each tale was true. Of plight, and great destruction, of struggle, of heroism, of traitors and bandits, and, of the Angel of Death, and her thousand slain evils. In greater times, if not better ones, in the age of great evil and strife, Lyudmila could only exist. And, to the young child, that was all that she needed.

Those entities for which the people of this island had depended on for the basics of life for as long as they'd drawn breath seemed not to exist anymore. There was no way of discerning what had happened to them, or if any remained, but their boats simply never arrived at the shore anymore.

Great apple orchards and fields of golden wheat filled the landscape on the approach to the city gates, and fresh, cool water flowed freely in streams from the mountaintops. High in the foothills, distant flocks of goats and sheep could be seen milling about, with their shepherds silhouetted against the brilliant blue sky above them.

He has a thousand more bandits who follow him, and obey his every order. Even if we were to slay the Bandit King, we would die too, and our heroism would be for naught." At this, the Guardsman nodded his head, and returned to the north. Nobody heard from him for two months, but after that time, he returned with an army of his own: thousands of strong, brave knights riding trucks and horses. They told the villagers to spread word of their arrival, then put their steeds away and hid among the villagers' houses.\n\nWhen the Bandit King heard of the Guardsman, he was enraged, and came to the village atop his black stallion, with his army behind him. "Who is this Guardsman who speaks out against me?" he demanded. "Turn him out to me, peasants, or I will burn your homes to the ground and give your children to the wolves for a feast!" At this, the Guardsman emerged from his hiding place and shouted at the Bandit King. "Oskar!" he yelled, for that was the Bandit King's true name, "In the name of the mountain, I judge you!" With that, he made a gesture with his hand, and the Bandit King was struck dead by a bullet from thin air. He toppled to the ground and his brains fell out, and his army ran away in fear, scattering to the winds.\n\nAnd that is how the Guardsman destroyed the bandits.

What was all that for? Each believed in something different, unique ways to govern their lands, and unique ways to achieve peace and prosperity. Their thoughts mattered little when the Great Fire torched them all to the ground. They struggled for survival, yet they never deigned to seek help from their enemies. And when the fathers that had led these states for years relayed their knowledge and wishes to their children, their key instructions were simple: do not let others take your town.\n\nTheir children did not let them win, and neither did their grandchildren. For generations after the Great Fire, the wars continued. However, slowly, the lines dividing their beliefs began to fade away. The original ideas from before the Fire were twisted and changed, and the mysterious names to describe them were forgotten with the passage of time. In the end, the four states came to a realization. What were they fighting for? No one could remember, and it seemed that all that they believed in was the destruction of their enemies and nothing else. But their ancestors, who cemented these ideas, were long gone. So did these states come together. Their new leaders came into an agreement, and from then, a new nation was formed. Its goal was to rebuild the ruins of the Great Fire, to survive and prosper, and help those who couldn't. The old "ideologies" were gone, as they were replaced by the mere wish to survive in a dying world."

The End may have scorched all, but the city itself, whether by luck or miracle, survived intact. Men and women farmed, gave birth, lived lives, and died together as time pressed on. Now, it was an oversized hamlet, around a hundred people strong, farming on what little arable land there were, supporting each other against nefarious men and erratic weather.\n\nThe library is huge, full of stories of men and women living in harmony or fighting in battles of a massive scale. But what caught the man's eye was a simple book, as written by an... Es-kof-ye? He flips it open, and saw inside simple instructions instructions for to mix together different foods: to create flavor, to create life, to bring joy. He skims through the book some more and sees a simple enough recipe. He may not have most of the ingredients, but he has water and some root vegetables, so he does what he can. After roughly chopping them and tossing them together into a makeshift pot, he brings the mixture to his mouth and drinks.\n\nFeelings of joy run through his mind, shaking him to his core.\n\nYears later, a different person stepped into the bustling city. He heard that a great man lived here, who combined simple dishes to create magical meals. A man of incredible skill in the culinary crafts, who could fashion all kinds of meals to satisfy the most exacting of palates. He sat down at a table within a shop said to be run by this fascinating man. He is served an ornate meal, elegant and simple in equal measure. He smiles, thanks the cook, and takes his leave."

"Were the bandits to follow us, they would cart you away and flay you for their own amusement, or cut off your hands and cart you around." His son naturally responded to this 'cheerful' statement with small sobbing, which only got more of a berating.\n\nOh, how he wished there was some way that things would get better if partially to get his father off his back.

The boy waited a few moments, before beginning his own.\n\n"I wish the bandits were gone. I wish that we never had to run every time they came to a village. I wish that they were dead."

Even after the last of the Sickness had passed and the remains of the old Kingdom began to establish something resembling society, the spirit of England had been effectively extinguished.\n\nAs generations wore on, a legend emerged. Just before the fires came, it was said, the last monarch of those simpler times spoke to all the people of the isles through powers long forgotten. For centuries, the people of Britain had protected their monarch through an incantation of power repeated ad infinitum, calling upon God to save them from their enemies and to bring them victory. But in their last act before the end, the monarch had turned this power back upon the people, invoking the words "God bless you all."\n\nIn doing so, the monarch had called upon centuries of druidic power to protect Britain, relenting their own protection and perishing in the process - and it was this final act of love that saved the isles from total extinction. As the Britons began to rise once more into a renewed world, this myth of ultimate sacrifice for one's country would form the basis of a new national epic, an ethos that endured in the hearts of men. It warmed them in the dark times and guided them in the bright ones.\n\nThe legend's variants were indecisive on who this monarch really was. Some called them King Arthur, returned at the dusk of his Kingdom to defend it one last time. Others believed them to be Christ reborn, repaying the faithful for their piety.

The trip was absolutely miserable for Ervin, who never liked playing to other people's tunes, especially not a bunch of old idiots who thought grey hair made them better and more experienced in guiding the Knights forward.\n\nNevertheless, he was still a Knight-Major - and so Ervin, upon getting off the wagon and shaking off the travel sickness, took command with all the brusque efficiency he could muster. The Squire-Privates ran around the site with a renewed intensity, lighting arkfire upon the massive hole dredged out of the earth and the digging, scraping men within it. Beneath the hole, it was said, countless riches and arts long lost to man lay in wait. Ervin had no patience for fools and even less for rank foolishness, but he certainly appreciated the profitability of ancient stone and metal - all of which would be in abundance in Old Lundon. One could only hope that the Purple Death which was said to haunt all who touched devices of the Old World would not be in evidence here.\n\nFor weeks he gathered and shepherded, and when his patience ran out simply bellowed, the project to completion.

In a land where few people complained when Doichmen were hunted and torn apart in the street, being a merchant was enough to buy a degree of economic security. Survival, no matter how undignified, was infinitely better than death.\n\nThat illusion fell apart on a fine summer's evening, as Wulgang prepared his crossbelts and wares for the evening's transactions. He lost his heart at the first glimpse of her beauty and fire and strength. A whirlwind courtship, held in secret: but the crowds' mercies were not gentle. The old curses were hurled as familiar abusive stains. "Doichmen go home! Back to your country!" and "H'mlir drive you deep beneath the earth, or we will do it ourselves!" Wulgang retreated in the face of such adversity, back to his minimally furnished house: it seemed utterly empty now that he had met someone he wished to invite into its rooms.\n\nWulgang cursed the Gods and his ancestors for the misfortunes of his birth. Why had H'mlir chosen to bring his people to a land they were strangers to, and why had he inflicted the Leaden Hand on Franche to such extremes that the pain still rankled ages after the Fire? Bitterly he wept, and resolved to act. For the injustice of a love denied, Wulgang Shyder would make it his life's ambition to heal the wounds between Doiche and Franche.

A great gasp arose from the Scribers as they painstakingly read and checked its content. It was a Book of Danger, one tied to the great horror of the Fire itself, and its magicks and daemonic utterances had to be checked at any cost.\n\nThe little hamlet gathered in the ceremonial public square, so called because it had never before been used except for the rare public execution of a murderer, and the book was gingerly laid with trembling hands at the top of a pyre constructed for the occasion.

He gave orders for his men to clear the rubble around the site, repurposing them for settlement construction around the rings of the Old City. Perhaps the Wise Men of his House would be of aid in this. He summoned them in the fall to begin plans for restoration of the estate. But the touch of scarlet-plague interrupted his plans, and that fall the House met not to plan, but to mourn.\n\nDecades passed. The house continued to fall in on itself. One day a Sage of the Court paid a visit to what had once been the Baron's prize project.

Elegant curved leaf-patterns, some still bearing the imprints of ancient fire, curled across the estate, metal dancers swept in some wild tune. Children ran through them, laughing. Watching their outlines merge and twist in the shadows of evening, it was easy to forget that the house had been a place of loss - and the past seemed to melt away into the forgiving embrace of the waters of time."

As a King he was noble, wise and fair, and his courtiers and subjects loved him for his benevolent character. In time he would take a Queen, one who he would love like no other in the world.\n\nOne day, the Queen fell very ill. The King's physician discovered that she had caught the Tumors, and that she was unlikely to last more than a few years more. Distraught, the King turned to his scholars in the desperate hope of finding a cure. Yet none could be found. And so the King instead turned to the people who loved him so, and promised to whoever could discover a cure for her affliction would be rewarded with whatever was in his power to grant.\n\nA gallant Knight heard of his plea, and embarked upon a quest to find the cure. After searching high and low, first throughout the Kingdom, then the isles themselves, he finally found the answer. An old wise woman told him of an ancient cure held by the old ones, used to eliminate or, at the very least, stem the tide of the Tumors. The secrets of its production had been lost, but stashes of them could still be found if one knew where to look. This great panacea had a name - the Chemo.\n\nAfter further research, the Knight finally discovered a source for the Chemo. He rode far south to the halls of St Bartholomew in the lands of Kent, only to find that its ancient walls had been occupied by the forces of the Hun-Beyond-the-Sea, in some mad effort to retake the isles through an ancient claim. In the name of his King, and in the name of the isles, the brave Knight told the plight of his Queen to all who would hear, and before long he had gathered a small host of warriors to claim the halls.\n\nAfter a long and hard battle, the Knight was victorious, and the invaders were driven back into the sea. Claiming his prize, he returned to Scotland and presented his panacea to the King. The Chemo was administered to the Queen, and though she lost her long flowing hair in the process, she was granted many more years with her beloved. The King offered the Knight anything he desired in return for his brave quest.\n\nIn the end, all the Knight requested for his troubles was to have the honor of serving at his King's side; he would continue to serve him and the people of his Kingdom for all his days."

For Beatrice, time stood still. Only the faintest echo of what had till a moment ago been a normal Sunday afternoon in Piccadilly registered in her mind. As the alarm blared overhead, she found herself incapable of thought, until a gentle tug at her left hand brought her back to the terrible reality.\n\n"Mummy, what's happening?" asked Simon, her youngest.\n\nThe deepest agony any mother could ever feel racked Beatrice to her core. Her own fate, she could accept, but for little Simon and his big sister Lisa - herself holding Beatrice's other hand - the thought was too terrible to bear. She had visions of them both burning in the flames of Inferno come to Earth, and her mind immediately rushed to where they too might find shelter.\n\nBut she knew that they were right in the heart of the capital, and in spite of the efforts of the panicking crowds around them there would be very little to be achieved by hiding. Images filled her mind of what might happen if they did live. Of Simon succumbing over many weeks to the ravages of radiation. Of Lisa wasting away in a world where all the food had turned to ash. Of them both having to watch as she was dragged away by maddened survivors in search of a slave. Or food. Or worse.\n\nThe world might turn right again, one day. But she knew none of them would live or remain sane long enough to see it. So she did the only thing she could do. She sat down on the steps of the old theater and held her children tight, like she did every night before bed. Through her tears, she told them of how much they made her proud, of how much she loved them every day, and how she knew that they would stay together, wherever they were going.\n\n"Where are we going, mummy?" asked Lisa through shuddering sobs. In the sky above, a tiny shape began to make its final descent.\n\n"To heaven" said Beatrice.\n\nThen there was a flash. And all that was left was a dark shadow on the steps."

Today they had found an opportunity to slip away from their responsibilities in the village and had come out for a frolic in the surrounding countryside, in the idyllic hills and mountains of the Osterlund. They laughed and danced amidst the rolling valleys, reminiscing about the times gone by and joking about how their elders would surely give them a hiding for their frequent absences.\n\nHe had come to love the girl, but had always been hesitant to declare himself. Growing up, he had heard the nightmarish tales told by her parents of how their people had once been hunted, reviled, treated as less than dirt by the great blonde beasts who had ruled this land long ago. The boy was himself possessed of a mop of golden blonde hair and shy blue eyes, and he often feared the girl saw in him the monsters that had once haunted her nightmares.\n\nAnd yet on that day, when his beloved suddenly turned to him, embraced him and sealed her love with a kiss, his fears were at last put to rest. In each other's eyes, they were neither monsters nor subhumans, but nothing short of perfect. The ravages of ages past could hurt them no longer - they were in love, and that was all that mattered.\n\nIn time, they would wed, and the whole village would come out to celebrate their union. Their children would grow up surrounded by bountiful hills and a community of merry and joyful people. And when at last they were old and grey, they each remarked that there was no other life they would have wanted but this one."

They had never seen such strange metals and signs before, and were wary. After weeks of debate, they approached it--cautiously at first, but when the first man touched it and survived, their own experimentation began. The carvings on the fallen star, for that was what they decided it had to have been, seemed almost like the letters the oldest members of their tribe knew as the letters of the world before. "N A S A", the carvings read.\n\nOn their second day of exploration, one inquisitive child noticed something new. The top of the thing, which had been covered in rubble, seemed almost transparent. When they pressed their faces to it, they could almost see the form of a man inside. This discovery urged the Flurens on: this fallen star contained another human! They labored for three days and three nights, beating the windows of the fallen spacecraft with rocks, stones, and even a few rusted tools.\n\nOne day, the black barrier gave way, and as the first tribesmen stuck his head in and breathed the dusty air, what he saw amazed and terrified him. The shape they had seen was a man, yes, but a man unlike any ever seen before. He was covered in white cloth, and on his head rested a massive dome, constructed of similar material as the barrier they had broken through before. A skull smiled at them from the other side of the helm.\n\nIt was sorrowful, the tribe reflected. They had thought the man inside the star would be a god, a hero, a sorcerer. But no, he was merely a corpse, for gods, heroes, and sorcerers don't die.\n\nThe craft itself was of far more interest, they realized. The buttons, knobs, and metals that constructed it were wonders, and while they knew not what the craft was for or how to construct another, they took comfort in the fact that mankind had once dwelled amongst the stars.\n\nThe Flurens named themselves in honor of the craft's apparent creator, for they would one day reach the sky above, as the man in the star had.

Their castles crumbled, their cities housed only ghosts, and their towns were sacked. But still, they endured, and in their diaspora they found a form of comfort.

But no.\n\nHe breathed in the air - it smelled of sulfur, but it was air still. He heard the birds singing in the tree next to his house, which, though battered, still stood. He was lucky to have lived in such a small village, he supposed. He couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment. Part of him wished he'd died in those flames, he thought.\n\nHe walked through the town, hand pressed against the pistol he had been carrying with him in recent days. Only silence greeted him. He looked through the windows of his neighbor's house. Sophia lay dead, a pistol in her hand, the television still blaring the emergency warnings. It was almost funny, in a macabre way. She had survived the apocalypse, but had deigned to kill herself rather than face what would come after.\n\nFranz entertained the thought of doing the same, for a brief moment, but no. What would be gained if he joined Sophia? The world would keep turning, and no one would be there to cry for him. He sighed and continued walking. He wasn't entirely sure where he was going; the only desire he felt was to walk.\n\nHe reached the borders of his town, and walked still. When he reached the next dead town, he walked still. For weeks, months, years, he walked his lonesome road, searching endlessly for others who had survived.\n\nFinally he found them. A small town, right on the borders of what had once been the Reich, but that name was dead now, as was the ideology it had followed. The town Franz had settled in would one day become a great city in the wastes of Europe, a light of hope and beauty in those dark times, but more importantly, it was a new start. A new beginning."

No one remembered a peaceful time in the history of the island, despite the skeletons of cities and towns that promised that it had happened in the past.\n\nBut the people of the island clung to one hope: the stone. The stone sat in the center of the largest town-state of the isles, and it was whispered among the peasants of the land that whoever could open the safe and retrieve the object within was destined to unite the island, and to become the first and final King that had evaded them for so many miserable years.\n\nMany had tried, and many had failed. The simplest solution was to simply break the stone open, but no matter how hard they tried, the metal wouldn't crack. There was one small hope, however. On the front of the stone was a deceptively simple looking lock. Perhaps all that was needed was a key, but the knowledge of key-making was long since lost, and no one knew where a key could be found.\n\nOn an ordinary day, one like any other, a young man approached the stone. Once, this would have been met with a crowd, anxious to see if their new king walked among them, but so many had tried and failed that none cared anymore. Besides, this lad was skin and bones, not at all kingly.\n\nIgnored by the townsfolk, no one saw the lad produce two sticks from his pocket. Assumed a fool, none of them saw him place them into the lock, and none of them paid attention to him as he labored for hours, twisting and turning the sticks in just the right way, until...\n\nClick. This foreign noise attracted the attention of many a nearby peasant, who scrambled towards the stone as they saw the lad stick his hand through an opening that hadn't been there before. They were more amazed still as he pulled his hand out, holding something not unlike a stick. It was black, and metallic, and appeared to have a handle, but a stick it was nevertheless. None knew what to make of it, until the youth pressed down on the contraption, and fire erupted from the end. The magic of this 'sword' was something the people of the city had never seen before, and all as one they rose the lad up on their shoulders. The first and final King had been found, and he would, with his weapon of fire and steel, unite the island."

When they had dumped her in the quarters, she had heard a thunderous roar, as if a thousand thousand gunshots had fired into her ear. She didn't remember anything else.\n\nAs she approached the light, frantically moving rocks and chunks of concrete out of the way, she became aware of a dull pain in her gut. She rolled onto her back, and felt for the source of the pain. As her hands clasped around the large chunk of wood embedded in her stomach, her eyes filled with tears as the pain hit in full force. She had to get out. She had to escape.\n\nSwallowing her sobs, she crawled once more towards the light, hands bloody and raw as she scraped them against the stones. The light slowly, gradually, grew bigger and bigger, until she could just barely crawl through into the world beyond.\n\nShe had never been so grateful to see the sky, and as she slowly, unsteadily, rose to her feet, she couldn't help but smile at the ashes and the ruins of what had once been a slave camp. She grinned ruefully at the body of a nearby German--he had always been the kindest to her, but in these camps that meant he was only slightly gentler with his beatings. She laughed, some blood spurting from her mouth as she made her way to the edge of the camp, staring at the sky.\n\nShe was dying, she knew that. She had sat by her mother's side on the day she breathed her last, and now she had a feeling she'd breathe her own last breath soon. As she sank down, she still found herself smiling. For, unlike her mother, and her mother before her, she would die a free woman. No more Germans here, she thought, bitterly.\n\nAnd as the life left her eyes, she whispered a thanks to the God that had abandoned her people for so long."

They lived alone in a small valley, farming grain and apples, occasionally battling other tribes that dared encroach upon their land. Their kings were, for the most part, wise and fair: until their newest king had executed a child for the crime of crying in his presence.\n\nThe people hadn't quite considered the possibility of a cruel, unjust king before. After all, you had to be wise and fair to be a king--that was why they had kings in the first place, surely. At first, they searched for the last king's true son, for surely this brute couldn't have been descended from the wise old man they had all adored as children. But their efforts were fruitless. The tyrant that sat in their village was, by all their customs and laws, the rightful king.\n\nHis claim was true, then, but the people of the village were never content to sit by when a problem presented itself. They armed themselves with the stone axes and picks they had before used to build their homes. Some stole the rusted iron tools the king hoarded for himself, deep in the rusted mine the village had been built around so many years ago.\n\nAs one, the people stormed the King's home, and, carrying him on their shoulders, threw him into the mine. Then they used the tools they had brought to chip away at the very foundations of the ancient mine, and collapsed it in on their tyrant king.\n\nThe people celebrated for three days and three nights, for never again would they bow to a tyrant such as the king they had buried. As they danced and sang, a strange idea formed. No one was quite sure who first whispered it into another's ear, but soon they had all heard of the bold new proposal for their lives.\n\nThey, the people, would come together as a village, and discuss their problems. They would cast their own votes, and whichever ideas had the most votes would be implemented. Never again would a King rule them. The idea quickly took hold upon the youth, and even the elderly found it had a certain romantic charm to it.\n\nThe first vote was on the topic of names. Their prized tradition of having no names was an invention of the kings, some argued, and they should give themselves names as the oldest of their ancestors once did. The vote was passed by a margin of one old man, and the people spent the next month naming one another, and their homes, and their village, and the tyrant they had deposed.\n\nIn the end, though the new form of life had its troubles, the people had started something amongst themselves, a fire burning in their very souls.

Herculean feats were made, then, to stem the dauntless advance of what must have been Death made manifest.\n\nNone of them worked. For a time, the remaining peoples of what the old tales called England began to fear that nothing can work. Perhaps the End Times truly had come again? Society began to unravel like a spool of yarn: anarchy ruled the streets, and despair gripped the hearts of men... until the Good Doctor graced many abodes with his presence.\n\nNo one ever saw his face, for the mask he wore covered it completely. He would simply visit a town with a bag full of strange needles on his person, travel from house to house and ask if its residents require protection from the plague. He administered treatments most bizarre when they agreed: first he would wrap an arm tight with a bandage, then gently pushed the needle of a strange contraption beneath their skin. From there he filled the contraption with strange potions, that they may flow directly onto the puncture wound and into the corpus.\n\nHow the Good Doctor's treatment exactly worked remains a mystery, but those who did found themselves free of the pustules and blisters that mark the plague's presence. As he treated more of the land's people, the plague slowly began to subside. The towns and cities he had saved celebrated merrily, but he never stayed long enough to partake in them -- only a day or two, in fact, before he headed to another place that needed his treatments. Once every town, village and city acquired the Good Doctor's treatments, it is said, he disappeared from the isles and joined its myths and legends.\n\nTo this day, physicians and doctors swear an oath to help all those in need, just as the Good Doctor had."

Estimates for the date of this disaster range from anywhere between one to three and a half millennia prior to the modern day. There is much evidence prevalent in the historical record that lends credence to the existence of such an event, such as the near complete void of cultural data that has been uncovered past the Shadow Ages, but also recent revelations of advanced technological innovations apparently developed prior to this event - for instance the so called "Nigma Device" that excited archaeologists last year, as well as the many hulking wrecks of ancient steel warships found by divers over the last few decades.\n\nWhile the nature of what we shall term the Post-Antediluvian Collapse (henceforth P.A.C) has been lost to time, a multitude of theories have been posited by those seeking to better understand this difficult era of human history. Creek and Jianqi, et al. posit a notion in their paper "The Population Bottleneck" that, as evidenced by the Hulme quotient of the skeletal structure of bodies recovered from before the P.A.C, humankind experienced a drastic decline in fertility that resulted in a collapsed population and a complete breakdown in societal order. Though the validity of Hulme's theories in bioprediction are disputed, this theory is currently the most widely accepted of explanations for the collapse.\n\nThe issue is far from settled, however. In Konyevske's paper "Radiography in Anthrogeological Studies," she suggests instead that the heightened radioactive state of P.A.C artifacts that have been recovered to date may hold a clue as to the fate of the ancient world; that some radiological event of massive scale must certainly have occurred to cause such an anomaly. Other (though less accepted) theories include a worldwide outbreak of Phage, a collapse of oxygen levels, a significant alteration in solar activity and a major cosmological impact event. More controversial scholars suggest that the Antediluvian world is actually a myth, such as the First World school of historical thought that states..."\n\n- Excerpt from "Ponderings on the Historical Void", Authored by Dr. Gunthir Parlya of the University of New Atiles, Department of Anthrogeology."

Through the soft snow and lightly thawing ice the men trudge forth, in search of new ways of passage through the barrier that this great mountain range poses.\n\nAs the days draw on, the men stray ever deeper into the heart of the mountains. Their search for a mountain passage goes well. They proceed through the range with increasing haste as the rocky slopes and jagged peaks open up into more forgiving terrain. Believing their tiresome journey to be near a successful conclusion, the men become much more jovial.\n\nThen they stumbled across the frozen man.\n\nFrom the thawing winter ice the skeletal remains of a man emerge, half exposed from an icy shelf. Still fully clothed, the man wears peculiar winter garments that are all but alien to the men of the expedition. The arms of the garments bear several strange insignia, which cannot be comprehended by the men. Upon the skull rests a masterfully crafted steel helm. The most peculiar oddity of all, however, is the item that rested partially stuck within the ice.\n\nThe men, in their curiosity, chip away at the ice as to free the rest of the skeletal remains, exposing the legs of the figure as well as the odd item that rested by his side. A length of wood and metal, the men cannot discern the purpose which it might have possibly served. It appears to have no use as a tool in any practicality - no blade or heft to stab and pound, and the mechanisms of the object serve no real purpose other than to make noise.\n\nFollowing a short debate, the men of the expedition elect to carry the remains of the frozen man back to where they came for further study, as well as the odd object the corpse carried with it to its death."

An imposing structure that reaches to the sky and extends off into the horizon. The waves of the sea clash furiously with the great fortification, yet the wall stands firm, as it has for centuries.\n\nDespite the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the structure, it is clear to all that this wonder is not of natural formation. Clearly it had been constructed for a purpose, but what purpose could it have possibly served? All over, different people speculate a wide range of possibilities.\n\nSome say the wall was built by the gods, made to hold the terrors of the sea at bay. Most agree that the wall must have been erected by a great ancient civilization, now lost to time. But why would they construct it? Depending on who one asks, some may say that the wall was built to hold the sea in place, preventing a catastrophic flood. Others claim it was erected to bridge the gap between land masses and allow passage overland. Some unlikely theories even suggest that it was intended to drain a sea, or to harness the power of the waves, however that might have worked.\n\nDespite the speculations as to the origins of the wall, it stands firmly against the battering of the waves to this day.

Recent studies, however, have yielded unexpected results.\n\nA recent multi-faceted effort, consisting of object studies as well as multiple archeological digs across several continents, has yielded results that have baffled historians and archeologists the world around: signs of a precursor civilization to that which existed before our own. It would appear that they stretched from the northern isles to the great deserts, yet they were technologically ancient in comparison to those who perished before us.\n\nMuch speculation has occurred as to how such a society could have nearly surpassed the scope of any of the last civilizations of the previous age, yet at the same time have operated under such primitive conditions. Historians and scholars have since leapt upon the rising studies of this civilization, studying dug-up fortifications, ancient currency, and even some long lost structures, all marked with similar identifiers.\n\nClearly there are thousands of years of history that still lie beyond the present boundaries of our knowledge.

The panic seems uncharacteristic of the usual action drills that have become common since his units readiness status was upgraded.\n\nNoticing one of his officers jogging by, he takes the opportunity to learn of the chaos. "Sir, what's the panic? Another drill?" Theodor asks loudly. The officer halts his stride and turns to face Theodor, his face flushed, as if all the worries of the world are upon his shoulders. "There's no drill. Run to the armoury, Feldwebel. The bombs have been launched." the officer retorts.\n\nTheodor feels his heart sink inside his chest, and feels as if he is going to puke. Instead of following his orders to report to the armoury, he doubles back and retreats to his garage. Frantically, he begins work on preparing the truck he was working upon to drive. He swiftly places all removed parts back to their respective spots and secures them. Slamming the hood back down, he notices two of his subordinates returning with their rifles.\n\nAttempting to avoid his men, Theodor does not acknowledge their presence, and begins to climb into the cabin of his truck. "Feldwebel, where are you going? Where's your rifle?" asks one of his men. Continuing to ignore them, he turns the key. Much to his relief, the engine roars to life with little delay. "What are you doing?" exclaims his subordinate. "Leaving." replies Theodor, as he begins to slowly reverse the truck out through the garage doors. Of a sudden, a deafening gunshot rings out, and he feels winded. He struggles to retain his breath, as another gunshot rings out. In a panic, he clumsily falls from the cabin.

The yield of knowledge from this particular project was expected to be significant. An ancient subterranean tomb, partially caved in, constructed by an advanced civilization of ages past. Many hoped this complex would contain a treasure trove of history to be discovered.\n\nYet what was discovered within was much more than many had bargained for.\n\nThrough thorough, multi-year studies, the shocking intent of these ancients has been unearthed. It appears as though the complex was designed as a protective bunker, made to shield the inhabitants from hazards upon ground level. This particular bunker, however, seems to have failed in its purpose, partially collapsing and dooming its inhabitants to permanent entrapment within, until their untimely deaths.\n\nThe true disturbing nature of this site comes not from the untimely fate of those within, but from the organization that controlled it. An organization with a decisive multi-staged organizational structure, they appeared to be one built upon death. Ideals of murder, enslavement, subjugation, and destruction were seemingly held dear by this group. It is unsure if this organization held such ideals due to a religious following that may have existed at the time, or otherwise. It is apparent that they did not exist alone, as signs exist that this group had, at one point before their demise, lines of communication with other external facets of their organization.\n\nA shocking discovery to most, this project has as of yet cast a very grim shadow upon the history of the ancient world."

The lavish ceremony held for the young monarch had lasted the better part of a day, and the proceedings were finally drawing to a close. In a grandiose finale, the new ruler was to be presented with a great dynastic heirloom - one that had passed through the heads of the family for countless generations. It was a peculiar kind of ancient weapon, wielded by the founder of the dynasty in ages past.\n\nThey say this predecessor was an inspirational warrior, wielding not only great skill upon the field of battle, but also an impeccable ability for leadership. Whilst little is recorded of his life story, it is said that prior to a catastrophic event that shattered the empires of his time, he was but a common citizen of a great nation, the likes of which are unimaginable today. Tales are told of his exploits following the great collapse, when he led an alliance of elite warriors under his leadership who provided protection to those under their influence. Unrivaled in combat, his warband grew with each victory, as did his legend.\n\nHis leadership and bravery paved the way for a kingdom that would stand for generations. Now, all that remained of his many treasures was the heirloom: a weapon that, whilst beyond the understanding of modern man, could strike down a foe from great distances by simply looking upon them and activating the mechanism within it. It was a wondrous and slightly unsettling concept that few believed could possibly be within the realm of possibility.\n\nThe young king was ceremoniously presented with the weapon, as the coronation drew to a close.

The bitter fall mornings were usually rather silent, as the singing birds flee in preparation for the coming of the cold winter months. Yet this fateful morning was far from silent.\n\nThe silence was broken by the metallic rustling of metal, as a sizeable company of foreign men, all clad in iron garments, arrived at the village. At the helm of the company was a man clad differently from the rest.\n\nThe curious villagers crowd around the strange arrivals, as the man at the front of the company began to speak. An interpreter, speaking a similar dialect to the tongue used in the village, began to offer a rough translation of the words spoken by the foreigner.\n\nHe spoke at length of a benevolent empire that delivered security to all those within her bounds. He continued to speak of the great progress that came with being a citizen of the empire, and of the privileges of being under its rule. Before the villagers have but a moment to ponder the strange speech given to them by a man who could not so much as directly communicate with them, the man then followed with a bold announcement. All members of the village were now under the jurisdiction of this aforementioned empire, and owe to the empire a tithe.\n\nConfused, afraid, and unwilling to defy the metal-clad men, the villagers obliged, fetching whatever belongings necessary to satisfy the demands of the foreigners.

That of redemption, and the chance that our gracious Lord granted us long ago. In days of yore, humanity was a corrupted thing. We knew naught but evil, as the good in our hearts had all but fled. Our Lord, in his solemn realization that we were all but lost, realized that he had but one choice. He understood that those whose hearts were tainted with the evil that had overtaken humanity must be vanquished, and could no longer be left to walk the earth, poisoning it with their sin."\n\n"And so, we were delivered from evil and sin, as our Lord engulfed the earth in a holy fire as those with good left in their hearts were delivered from the flames. As the good men rose from the ashes, they set forth to rebuild humanity in the image of our Lord, as such we stand here today, by his grace."\n\nAs the priest continues on at length, few take the texts literally, many grumble internally, viewing the sermon as little more than a dramatic metaphor for minor personal redemption.

Not only was this statue bigger than any of the other sculptures found in the ruins, but it was also in a place of importance in front of the building instead of inside it. Truly, the ancients must have revered this statue more than the others!\n\nHe stepped closer to the marble man, admiring its details more closely. One of the arms was missing, but the broken remnants of the shoulder seemed like it lined up with the other arm, proudly posing hands-on-hips. The statue's face clearly spoke of a handsome and driven man, perhaps a ruler or deity. A smooth, polished head was topped by some kind of cylindrical hat or crown, inscribed with the crest of an eagle. Oh, to imagine what this man's life had been like! The conquests he achieved, the love his people felt, the wealth he earned to commission such a beautiful image!\n\nBut the Vasilvey could spend no time reminiscing about the past any longer. His fingers danced along the inscription at the statue's base, silently whispering its name, as he returned to his throne room to hold court. His eyes passed over the other treasures in his hall: the bust of a flowing-haired man, a bathing woman, the elaborate mosaics, and other works that all paled in comparison to his latest acquisition.

Most men who needed to get from one side to the other simply chose to go around, either through the more temperate greenlands to the north or by boat across the Shallow Strait to the south. Only two kinds of people chose to cross; the desperate and the mad.\n\nThere was also a third sort. They came to the desert, looked at the wastes and the salt-flats, and stayed.\n\nEven before the Deluge, the desert had been home to the unwanted of the world's powers. The first of its inhabitants had not come out of choice, but over many years people had come willingly to escape whatever persecution, legitimate or no, that they may face. Some of them were innocents running from some unjust authority, others were crooks and knaves looking for a place to hide. Regardless of their reasoning, all struggled together to survive in the arid wasteland. Small townships and semi-nomadic bands would form, and over time the Adriani would come to tame the wastes. And where food could not be found by fishing in the Strait or farming what few crops would grow, the greenlands' bounty would suffice.\n\nBandits grew into raiders. Raiders grew into a horde. In time, even the greatest of the wetland powers would come to at least find a great irritation in the plundering of the Adriani warlords. There would come a time where the empires would grow greater, and the people of Adriania would be brought back under the boot.

Stupid, stupid, stupid!\n\nHe never thought he'd get the talk of the city with lies alone. The uniform wasn't his, not truly, having been acquired from an old ruin. Neither were the "tales of heroism" he had regaled the Dona his either; about half was gleaned from a picture book before the Fall, and the other half was his bluster alone. He sighed and turned to the window, doubt cycling through his mind.\n\nThe lagoon had grown since he first remembered it. Back then it was nothing more than a small lake by the town of Serenisma. As the years pass it somehow grew more and more, just like the edge of the horizon suddenly filled with water, and now they had to use boats instead of carriages to travel its sights. For some reason, however, the new water seemed to fit Serenisma perfectly, like glove to hand. Arches and channels, once old roads, were just the right length for boats to travel and pass through.\n\nHis doubt grew as they entered the inner districts. Fancy houses, homes of high society. Not like the shanties and slums he was accustomed to before Father Grigori had taken him in. As the gondola stopped and slowed into a small wooden pier, Giovanni sighed resignedly.

To an untrained eye, the lake seems like a natural haven.\n\nBut there is also said to be a terrible curse placed upon the lake. For while animals freely come and go as they please, men who spend prolonged periods by the bog inevitably become sickened and weak. Entire families have been known to waste away despite ample nourishment from the lake's bounty, and the sickness is said to claim even those who visited it merely once. Over the years, men have learned to avoid the lake at all costs, lest they too fall victim to the noxious death that lurks over the moor.\n\nThere are varying accounts that speak of why the curse of Widgemeer might exist. Some say that one god or another sought to protect the creatures of the lake from the greedy humans, and so made a place where they could live but man could not. Others say that on the eve of the Götterdämmerung, a great warrior bird fell from the sky into the lake, and that the corruption spreading from the rot of its still decaying flesh and its unborn eggs is toxic to man.\n\nRegardless of the reasons, men keep away, and for the wetland creatures that make the bog their home, Widgemeer is an unspoilt paradise, free from the corruption of the world beyond - until the curse lifts, that is."

Scuffles for the limited safe territory available would be commonplace, but ultimately the factions would maintain a certain camaraderie and cooperation in the interests of collective survival.\n\nMany years after London burned, life would return to the ashes of the old capital.

"I've made my choice."\n\nFraulein Strauss always had her way -- or else. Her stubbornness was tiring most times, some times endearing. This time, it frustrated him. The air sirens kept blaring their infernal noise outside. The grandfather clock ticked and tocked, edging closer to the end of the world. "There's still time before they reach Germania," Yosef pleaded. "You need to get dressed and leave. The rest of the estate won't go until you-"\n\nThe kiss caught him off guard. Memories of warmth and bliss rushed to the forefront; for a brief moment, he returned it with the passion he had shown her not an hour ago.\n\n"Dumpkopf. Hold me closer," Fraulein Strauss said after pulling back, smiling and eyes glazed. He hesitated.\n\n"That is an order." A brief, uneasy moment of silence, then a weight settling itself back on his chest. "Please. Yosef," came the murmur.\n\nThe servant obliged, wrapping an arm around her small figure. His chin rested on her smooth, white locks. "Wilma, I promised to keep you safe. I'll be fine."\n\n"And you promised not to leave my side, no?" Yosef had no answer, to his shame. Suddenly, he felt her figure tremble, hot liquid spill onto bare skin. "Just... just let me have this," Wilma begged shakily. She continued, "Please. Please..." A stream became a torrent, flowing freely, as her words faded into whispers.\n\nSighing, Yosef rubbed small circles on Wilma's back. Fraulein Strauss demanded his obedience. His... lover... asked something of him. Who was he to refuse either way?\n\nWith a peck on her forehead, Yosef wrapped his arms around Wilma and pulled her close. He felt her own settle gently on his back."

Malcolm replied uneasily.\n\nThe two men had been held in the field for days now. Or wait...was it weeks? Years perhaps? Who knows anymore. Who cares.\n\nWhat the two men were tasked to find, under the watchful eye of their ever-present supervisor, was a great treasure in this field. Their boss was certain of it, he only required a "keener eye". It was apparently why he conjured up Malcolm and John, in order to get them to help him find it. The field proved mystical in its workings though. The men looked long and hard for the treasure said to be buried here, but found very little in terms of material items. Instead, they had only each other, united in the fear of the boss' retribution should they fail in their task.\n\n"God is punishing us." John stated to Malcolm as they dug through the ground using only their hands.\n\n"What for?" Malcolm asked.\n "Everything" said John wearily.\n\nDays, hours, months or weeks past. Who could really tell. What the two men could tell, however, was when they eventually found the treasure.\n\n"Boss, boss! It's here, we found it!" shouted Malcolm, with tears in his eyes.\n "Well done, my lads," acknowledged the boss "now let us see it."\n\nThe boys stepped back from the pit to show off their findings, and what the boss saw pleased him deeply. Down in the ground lay a massive unexploded bomb, just waiting to be taken. One could only imagine its possibilities."

The rough wooden plank stood out against the row of perfect white posts, but paint, like many other things, had become hard to come by. No fussing over something that does the job, anyhow.\n\nDiligence was a virtue he practiced more than his ordained duties nowadays. The chickens needed feeding, the potatoes needed harvesting, the fields needed sowing. One of the pews had given in after some termites burrowed a nest out of its leg. Dust began to coat the glass relief on the facade. Some of the saws in his little shed didn't cut as well as they used to. So much to do, so much to fix. None of them relate to matters of the soul; nevertheless, he threw himself at them just as faithfully, just as ably.\n\nHe looked at the sky, eyes squinted. The sun was just about to reach the very top: half past eleven, Father Tom reckoned. Just about time to prepare lunch.\n\nAs he strolled back to the church, the Father let his mind wander. He had a flock, once. They praised His miracles and cooked barbecues afterwards every Sunday. Rows of cars parked along the worn road beside the fences, came from miles around. They stopped coming when the skies turned red that one moment many, many years ago, before he had a church without a purpose.\n\nHe shook his head. No use lamenting over what had been. The Lord's church needed someone to look after it. Service in His name remains, with or without an audience, and Father Tom swore to do his job until his knees give in and he returns to His embrace."

It was quite peculiar, really- no matter how hard the wind had blown yesterday, the fan had remained perfectly still. Julio treated this problem with the severity it deserved. In his town in La Mancha, the windmills were not merely historic landmarks, but essential to provide his neighbors with their daily bread.\n\nWhile he was up in the rafters replacing the broken part, he gazed out of a little window towards his town. The sun was rising in the east. Much of the old town still slept peacefully, awaiting the rooster's crowing. Suddenly the sun grew painfully bright, and Julio shielded his eyes in confusion. This couldn't be the sun, he thought. It was far too bright. A deafening thunder roared across the landscape, and a gigantic plume of dust began to rise in the distance. Before Julio could even cry out, he saw a shockwave tear apart the land and rip the town apart. Houses shattered to pieces with families still sleeping inside them. A historic church, having stood the test of time since the Reconquista, crumbled to dust before his eyes.\n\nJulio's windmill stood just outside the blast radius. All that the blast managed to do to the last structure of the village was make the fan turn one last time."

A promise, they said, handed from father to son and mother to daughter, from when the sun shone bright on these snowy climes. Words handed by their great forefathers, who the old crones told had fled that land for reasons nebulous. They shaped their desires into a sacred oath; time had shaped it into tradition.\n\nFor those addressed with it, however, no promise rings more hollow. The Ocean was vast, with no land in sight. Fishermen dared not to travel beyond eyesight of coast, for nothing awaited them beyond but Cap'n Jones and his watery lockbox. Most received the promise in one ear and let it leave out the other, before partaking in the customary po-teen dinner.\n\nOne man, his name lost to history's torn-off pages, kept the promise to heart. In time he became a skilled navigator, having served faithfully in the Scoshan Marine for many years. With the backing of old friends and the "Alban Society", he purchased a sturdy ship, provisions, and the men to man it. So did he proclaim to Halafacks Square: they will depart Eastwards beyond the Ocean, where a land awaits forever green for the sons of Always-White.\n\nMany scoffed and jeered at the tomfool so eager to join a hundred other hopefuls beneath the waves. But some had revealed themselves kindred souls, from many backgrounds, and joined the ambitious expedition. They departed in the fog of morning, heckled and encored in equal measure.\n\nNo one knew the fate of the Victory and her Hundred Braves. Anyone with an opinion filled the blanks as their fancy dictated: either they reached the promised land, or the Ocean smote them for their hubris. Nevertheless, the voyage became talk of taverns and halls across the land; whether or not it succeeded, the navigator and his men are assured to live forever as one of many great legends from the early days of Ka-na-da."

Times had been tumultuous recently, but he rested easily at night, knowing this haul was going to net him a tidy bonus. After all, his boat carried 320,000 deadweight tons of crude black gold, direct from the heart of Texas. It had been a long voyage across the Atlantic, but the trip was going to be well worth it.\n\nThen it happened. First, a bright, burning light illuminated the ship as if a million spotlights had been trained on it. McDougall had no time to comprehend this before a blast from afar rocked the ship and tore apart the hull. McDougall barely understood what was happening, but he knew what he had to do. He ordered all men off the ship. He organized a swift gathering to the lifeboats. One by one, his crew embarked. After the last men had gotten away safely, McDougall cut the boat's line's loose and remained aboard. The last his crew saw of him, he was lighting up one last cigarette and flicking the match into the leaking oil.\n\nThe crew would soon make it to a southerly island between two greater lands. Though there were never any shortages of hardships in their community, they always would remember or be reminded of the old Captain when tensions rose.

However, in a world sent backwards in time thanks to the power of destruction, a symbol can all to easily become a reality, as it in fact did. When the first king of our small portion of Albion adopted the mantle of the old legend King Arthur, he could hardly have anticipated the consequences of his decision. When people are desperate, they may turn to even the strangest of sources for comfort, and when the people came to see the hero-king Arthur, the king saw no reason to disabuse them of their mass delusion.\n\nNow, as living things eventually do, the king died, and the news caused panic amongst the people who had viewed this self-proclaimed legend as their divinely guided protector. It was then that the son of the king made a fateful choice. He donned the robes of his father and addressed the crowds of his subjects who stood nervously at the castle gate. King Arthur was not dead at all, for he was now King Arthur. Just because the holder of title was gone did not mean the title was meaningless or hollow.\n\nKing Arthur was an idea, a model for just leadership and righteous authority. In time, the house of that first king would fall from grace; they had abused their power and position and were no longer fit to hold the role of Arthur. Many more families would at some point or another take possession of the right to hold the title, but all would eventually be found wanting. At last, it was determined that as a true leader of the people, the Arthur should be accordingly chosen from among the people themselves. To be called Arthur is to be the defender of all, it is a responsibility that few are worthy to bear, and yet anyone can, if they commit themselves to a life of selfless devotion to our beloved nation."

A chain of tables that stretched from one road to another, stacked with plates of delicious, mouthwatering dishes. Children chasing children, men chasing women, women chasing men. Tonight, the otherwise stiff mores and habits of this village in Ibra seemed to melt away as its people celebrate their bountiful harvest this season.\n\nSuddenly, a lull descended in the crowd as their mayor, bedecked in roses, badges and all sorts of honors waved his arms in the air. Grins broke out of their faces as they gossiped to one another in murmurs, their eyes trained into the plaza grounds.\n\nFrom the crowd arose a beautiful young woman wearing a fine gown -- a design from before Judgement Day, abound the whispers -- and a pair of coconut shells on each hand. A handsome young man joined her as they approached the center. They froze into a pose, one hand on the other's hip, as they looked away. A trio of mustachioed men sat in one corner, holding guitarras.\n\nThe Old World might have died in the Thousand Sunsets of Judgement Day, but the song and dance its people enjoyed were harder to kill. None were more beloved in Ibra than the ancient, venerable calé. The eloquent dance proved popular among the towns and villages that blossomed: calé only needed men, women, guitarras, and hours of practice for everyone to enjoy in some way, and they had all four in plenty. Soon every comunidad looked for excuses to play calé, whether in weddings, birthdays or, in this instance, fiestas.\n\nTension wound the crowd up as the silence lingered. Everyone waited with bated breath for the trio to pluck their strings, the duo to burst into action. One minute passed, then two...\n\nThen with a clap, a flourish, and two heads snapped to lock gazes, calé night had well and truly begun."

But these brave sons and daughters of the Vaterland didn't have those options, all removed from their hometowns and shuffled around the Reich for whichever military or bureaucratic jobs needed staffing. Happenstance had brought them together, and they were going to die together, so why not have some fun? They were about to be denied all of life's pleasures forever, so they made up for lost time by trying them all at once.\n\nAs the minutes slipped by and more radio stations grew silent, the pace of the party got more frenzied. The final drops of alcohol were eagerly drunk, bellies were stuffed with every morsel of food, and tablets of Pervitin were passed around and swallowed like candy. The newscaster said it was ninety minutes to impact, right? Whenever it was, they all wanted to go out numb when it happened.\n\nThe ninetieth minute passed with nothing of note.

Now, another empire has collapsed, and the monk knew the world would go on, and like their ancestors of old, the priests must preserve as much of the old world's knowledge, for the benefit of the new.\n\nThe local monks and priests would copy down every book in the village, big or small, in languages alive or dead, repeatedly. They would write, learn, and they would understand, so they would remember.\n\nWord got around, and a stream of merchants would come in and sell ink, paper, and books. The villagers were eager to buy, and insisted the travelers leave with a book or two, in the hope that knowledge would propagate throughout the world. And people came from all around not to sell, but to learn, to think, and to discuss. Soon, the village had grown, filled with scientists, artists, writers, philosophers, and students. Now, it would be a bright spot of learning and knowledge in a dark continent, thanks to a distant memory in a foresightful monk."

Whatever even actually once bound the group together was also forgotten, with thanks attributed to the long hot walks across the plains. It mattered little though these days, for the group had found a new purpose and direction in their self-appointed leader. He was a tall, bald man who called himself "The Chief". It was a grandstanding, and rather egotistical, nickname, but the group could not help but go along with it. For the man commanded... a certain aura. Some party members had heard about similar charisma attached to the leaders of the past that had ruled before the dropping of the bombs. Dangerous, oily and oozing charm. However, the group's collective memory had become far too hazy to recall the names or faces of these rulers. Few could even really recall the names of the countries they had once belonged to - if they had belonged to any at all.\n\n"How far do you reckon, Chief?" shouted one of the men trailing off at the back of the party's caravan.\n\n"Ah - not long, my friend, not long at all." The Chief yelled confidently. It appeared to be enough to put the man's mind to rest.\n\nThe group would often encounter a wide range of bandits in their long march to The Chiefs designated location. This was what truly brought the group together under The Chief's guidance. They fought like brothers whenever they entered into a hostile environment and every victory would spur the group on to follow The Chief with even more devotion. Wherever they were heading no longer mattered, as did the duration of their walk. All were content and happy to just keep on walking, seemingly until the end of time."

Generations had been born, grown old, and died peacefully within eyesight of the half-ruined building, and still, not one had ever had the courage to enter into its depths. It had reached the point that there was not a single individual in the community of Ostpar who could even definitively explain what the building was or what it had been used for. They only remembered the warning their parents had given them when they were young, and those very same parents had heard much of the same admonitions from their parents too.\n\nIt was not that no one had ever thought about challenging the local superstition either. A few of the older residents of Ostpar, often in their attempts to dissuade curious youngsters, would tell a story of just such an attempt. An out-of-towner from the east of the Duchy had managed to actually get his hand on the door of the dark complex before fainting from a curse. That was how the old-timers remembered it at least, but no one was ever stubborn enough to find out if touching the door actually caused fainting.\n\nSome claimed the building was the house of an evil spirit, while others insisted that it was the old palace of the first, 'Mad' Duke of Burgundy, a figure out of legend and myth. Most didn't actually care what its original role had been. It didn't bother them if they didn't bother it, and they certainly weren't going to do anything close enough to it that it might perceive as "bothering". One day they would tear it down and salt the earth it had stood upon, they would say in meetings of the village council, but then again, that line had been said so many times that it had lost all meaning.

They were going to die very soon. That was why they were playing Mozart's Requiem. It seemed funny, in a very disturbing sort of way, to the wizened old Conductor, to play such a song. As he picked up his baton, he let out a derisive chuckle, "I'm not sure about you all, but I never imagined I'd go out listening to Mozart myself. I happen to be more of a Schubert man to be honest." A few laughs, a handful of grunts, maybe a sob. It didn't matter one bit to the Conductor if they found his gallows humor funny or not. He had already begun to stir up the strings.\n\nThe music picked up in earnest, all at once like water rushing out from a bursting dam. The Conductor had always preferred to have his orchestra play in smaller venues or better yet, privately, for the music's sake. Yet as heard the strains of the violins, the wave-like rolling of the cellos, what he wished for more than anything was an audience. How they would have marveled, how they would have been enraptured! The frantic, desperate air of inevitable destruction that was given to the playing was elevating this performance high above any that had ever been heard by mortal ears, the Conductor thought to himself as he let his baton drop. They no longer needed direction; they were being carried along by devotion to the craft, devotion to beauty.\n\nThe music seemed to finish as quickly and as suddenly as it had begun, the echoes of the last refrain hanging heavily in the air.

Just because the bastard was almost certainly going to die in the flames of Armageddon didn't mean her mission was meaningless. It mattered how that man would die, it mattered that she would be the one to end his life, it mattered that even if it could only happen in the final moments of history, someone stood up to that man and exacted well-earned justice.\n\nShe knew where he would go.

Authoritarian or free, capitalist, communist, fascist, whatever; most nations sent seeds as a last contingency.\n\nErik wondered what seed he should choose as the first to be planted again. He had no access to tropical areas as of yet, so any plants native to that area were out of the question. Scandinavian cold narrowed the shortlist further, and the need to thrive in more temperate areas winnowed the field to a few choice candidates. Wheat, the first crop ever grown by man, would be poetically fitting, but there was no true way to know the best choice.\n\nWalking into cold storage, the superchilled air caressed Erik's face, and he realized that it did not matter which plant he chose; it would be years before any were planted. Perhaps that was to be his lot in life, to be the agrarian vanguard of the new age. He sighed deeply, unsure, unready, unknowing of what the future would hold for Erik the Reclaimer."

The road was a dangerous route, crowded with bandits or thieves hiding behind every corner. However, the caravan found strength in their unity. Armed to their teeth, they slowly moved with soldiers guarding all their flanks, and the women, children and elderly people in the center, to be protected from the numerous threats that could appear at any moment.\n\nThe darkness spread over the sky, and everything became a shade of black, except from those who were clever enough to carry a torch or a lantern. After a while, the caravan stopped under the cover of trees, to rest and eat. When they were back in shape, they continued. Just before the light began to appear once again, the leader of the caravan bumped into someone else, who was leading a group moving the opposite way. He looked at the man, a soldier, who looked equally tired from the journey as he himself was. Behind him, two dozen people looked, expecting him to continue.\n\n"Przepraszam", the caravan leader exclaimed instinctively. He turned and waved to others to continue, but before they could the soldier stopped him.\n\n"Did you say... excuse me?" he said, in a perfect Polish accent. "Where are you from?" And so, the leader told their story. From their obedience to the Kazakh communists on the fringes of the Reich, to their final sovereignty after the War, and at the end, the nuclear disaster that struck them. A tear could be seen on the soldier's cheek. When he had to reply, four words were enough: "We're from Poland, brother."\n\nThe men, and all their subordinates, cried and cried for hours. After years of hardships and terrors for both sides, they had encountered each other."

The car was in dire need of fuel, and gasoline was running out everywhere. He never expected that it would come down to this.\n\nThe cars touched the starting line. Both had a great deal of modifications, that were not about beauty or style, but about efficiency. Ahead of them, the race track could be seen, across the endless salt flats of Adriatica, what was once a sea. The winner would be the car to go around the large rock around a mile away and return first, or whoever could knock the other vehicle out of the race. As the neutral observer from a different group counted down to the race's start, the two engines roared increasingly loud. Then, the race started. The cars left a trail of dust behind them as their wheels grinded against the dry ground. The rough terrain made them constantly go up and down as they raced, and the heat was intolerable. But neither crew would give up, for this was their last chance. Initially, the decorated black car was in the lead, and the distance between the two kept growing. The racers drifted around the rock, creating a large beige-brown cloud that reduced their visibility. The black car grabbed the opportunity, ramming into their opponent, but that achieved little in the end.\n\nThe finish line was clearly in sight. It was right there, no more than a thousand feet away. That was when the black car's engine began coughing, occasionally at the beginning and constantly as they continued. The opponent took the lead, and was coming closer to the finish line. Slowly, the black car ground to a halt. The crew came to the obvious conclusion. Gasoline had ended and, as they could see their opponent winning, taking the last tank and leaving with it in the distance, there would be no more fuel. The car sat under the scorching sun for hours, days and months, until it was covered by the dust and sand of Adriatica for the years to come."

Whether socialists, republican or monarchists, their desire to see their motherland free was what united them. And when the War occurred, they were all confused. It was hard to understand what happened, aside from contact with cities disappearing and the garrisons disarrayed in chaos. The only real way to comprehend the situation was for the warriors to go see it for themselves.\n\nIn the wake of what was assumed to be total destruction, those who were long assumed to be dead or missing in action emerged from the woods, the mountains and the vaults. But it was not to celebrate the freedom they have earned, nor to reunite with their families.\n\nThe sight of the greatest cities of their country flattened and turned into nothing more than a crater covered in smoldering ruins was too much for many. Some went back to their hiding spots to continue their life in isolation, far from the civilized world. Some simply took the weapons they had used to kill others for years, and turned them against themselves. A few, who saw beyond their own survival and satisfaction, remained in the areas, to care for those that had suffered and help piece the old world back. But for the vast majority of the Resistance, the world had not been freed. The weapons that they saw as tools for power and threats between the Great Powers had been used for the most evil purpose imaginable, and Greece had been caught in the cross-fire."

Perhaps it was some kind of learned experience from generation to generation that enabled anyone born in this land to remember what once stood before. Or, more likely, it was because the old lot never shut up about the past. Whatever the reasons, remembrance still rang strong in the land people now called The Erin. The original name had unfortunately not survived the great fires that kissed the island, but memories of this land's past lived on in the survivors of said attack. When efforts at rebuilding began decades ago, it was made sure of that the restoration of society echoed that of the old.\n\nIn a darkened pub, sat two friends sipping their drinks as the day closed to an end. Hunting was difficult... "As it was once in an age before you know", the elderly among the community loved to say.

Sneak out the community gates and into the Old City, its decaying corpse still breathing elements of life even though most of the city had been turned into rubble. Danny and Sarah found life in the unlikeliest of places on their strolls out. They saw the remnants of great signs that must have once glistened in the nighttime sky. They found incomprehensible artwork that still captured their imaginations to this very day. And today, they had found another living breathing part of the Old City.\n\nThey had heard of these places before, apparently people used to come with their friends and family to view moving pictures as some kind of shared experience. Well, it sounded like the perfect day out for two young star-crossed lovers such as Sarah and Danny. After settling themselves down, they found they could only get the machine working by simply playing what was already set up. To do anything else was far too complicated and wasn't worth ruining the experience to view something such as this together.\n\nWhat appeared on screen shocked and enthused them deeply. The screen showed a mass of people fighting one another with such zeal and vitriol, that the two could almost feel every punch that landed and every stone that was thrown. The voiceover made the images clearer to the two lovers, stating how Fascist fought Communist and how an entire community managed to defeat rampaging hate... at least for the time being. It was certainly a compelling story, the two lovebirds thought. The people who lived before "The Event" must have had vivid imaginations to come up with this kind tale.

Although many dismiss it as a mere childish fantasy, or a fiction, it is difficult to truly discount, in the true fashion of many myths.\n\nAccording to the legend, in the twilight days of the Old World, a great submarine washed up on the shores of what had been Crimea, and lay there, dark and dead in the long night. The people of Feodorstapol were frightened, and assembled around it - armed with weaponry that they hoped to breach its hull and slay the great mechanical beast\n\nIt was then that the man emerged from a hatch, hands raised, bleeding. His uniform was shredded, and in his gloved hand, he carried a metal tablet, inscribed with the wheel emblem of the Great Reykh. With his dying breath, he spoke to the mayor of what is now Feodorstapol, in hushed whispers, and agitated curses. On the tablet, he had hammered the greatest secrets of the Reykh, atomic codes, the means through which Man may conquer the world once more. He spoke until his eyes filled with blood, and his skin began to flake off. With his last breath, he thrust the Tin Book towards the Mayor once more, before expiring, and falling once more into his steel tomb.\n\nThe Mayor looked at it once, with bittered eyes, and simply dropped it off the side."

They did not all speak the same language, nor did they share the same ideas and goals. However, though many could and would likely fight each other violently in the future, there was no strife within the first few weeks.\n\nIn fact, among many of the older members of the bunkers, there was a similar reaction of camaraderie and awe; for the first thing to surprise them was the colors. A bright blue sky without even a hint of the smothering, sinking gray fog that had drowned out the horizon for years. Plants, green and growing. Where there had been a once baleful red eye hanging above, glaring through the smog at those toiling and suffering below, a gold disk hung, bright and shining.\n\nThe elderly laughed and sobbed, and the children questioned for weeks and months to follow, and even though several couldn't speak the same language, they understood pointing. The older ones would point at what appeared to be a miracle to them and laugh among themselves, while for a time the younger ones questioned each other, getting different words for different things.

Statues of old, bearded men's heads were placed with loving care and a large red flag hung from the wall. It looked as though the office had been untouched so really, this was the jackpot.\n\nJack searched eagerly through the drawers and cupboards and desks but, disappointingly enough, found very little of value. All he found was a book titled "Reg Birch: engineer, trade unionist, communist". He knew some of the other lot liked to read about fanciful stories and such so maybe this would be right up their street. After a quick skim through the book, Jack found that not to be the case.\n\nBlathering about "dialectics", "the labour aristocracy" and "revisionism" did not make up for an interesting story.

Miss Jackson was a mix of the first and the second category, offering the parents in town to teach their children how the old world used to work in exchange for them all pitching in to pay her room and board. A few of them were skeptical, but most were embarrassed to remember they'd never formally taught their kids much of anything other than how to work, and agreed to her modest terms.\n\nMiss Jackson's curriculum seemed very disorganized, if it even existed at all. Every day she'd gather up the kids from all the houses who were pitching in for her lodging and pool them all together in some ruined old building she had halfway cleaned up a room inside of, to serve as her classroom. The children weren't given any homework to do, or taught anything in the ways of maths or sciences. Instead, Miss Jackson would tell them little stories about the way things worked in the old world, and answer any questions they had about the purposes of any relics of that era they stumbled across.\n\nHer first day in town, a short little boy asked her why so many of the buildings that were around in the olden days were so tall: didn't the people know they'd all fall down some day? Miss Jackson gave the boy a kindly smile and explained to her class that people used to make tall buildings so they could fit more rooms in a smaller space; back then, space was at a premium, and buildings had to be tall so they could make good use of the spot of space they had. Weeks later, one of the older girls asked her what people used to wear before the world ended, and Miss Jackson calmly explained that they wore most anything they could think of to wear, and that crazy new ideas for clothes swept everyone up in a frenzy every new season to buy all the latest clothes, even if their old ones hadn't worn out. One of her students never asked Miss Jackson any questions, though, and on her last day before leaving town, Miss Jackson decided to single out the quiet boy and ask him what he wanted to know about the old world.\n\nThe boy paused and kept silent for awhile, but eventually he asked, "Miss Jackson, why were all the people back then so silly?"\n\nMiss Jackson smiled, and she told the boy, "They were all so silly because they didn't have me around to teach them.""

Before the explosion that rocked the world all that time ago, Germania was the greatest of all nations, larger and stronger than any of her peers. Her army was the grandest in the world, and it was an attempt to destroy it that ended the old way of humanity, and reduced our ancient cities to ruin. Germania achieved such strength because she was a mother with many children, who used the best traits of all of them to maintain her preeminence in the world. So many small parts of this old empire all called Germania mother, but each of them still knew that they were their own lands with their own identities.\n\nOne of the most astounding of these children of Germania was Wien, in the south, who held sway over all the land where the mountains rise. Another was Salut, in the west, an estranged sister of Germania, where the people spoke a different tongue from the rest of Germania's daughters. One more was the land of Han, whose founder was the namesake of all men named 'Han' today. He was a legendary sailor from the far north, where the ground ends and the world sea begins, who once made a journey by boat to conquer another land--the island of Britannien--as a gift to Germania.\n\nThough the people of all these countries understand their common lineage from mother Germania, they do not still call themselves brothers and sisters. The Bavars fight ferociously against the tribes of the Wien for their continued independence from them, even as they would call them cousins. So too is it with the rest of what was once Germania: her children have grown up, and share all the same rivalries any two family members might. The name of Germania and of the wonders she brought to the world will never be forgotten, but still: no man alive today would ever consider himself to be among those ancient ancestors of ours, the Germanians.

Perhaps when the world figuratively went to the wolves it did so literally as well. Whatever their source, they were a menace now, but a menace with lots of useful bits for someone resourceful like her to chop off and make use of to keep her alive.\n\nIn a clearing in front of her, near to the horizon, she saw them. A small pack, just six. They'd killed a young deer and mostly picked it clean already. Only the tiniest one was still eating, the runt of the litter subsisting off the alpha's scraps. He didn't have much meat on his bones, but it wasn't his meat that she was after. She crouched down low to the ground and stayed still, waiting for the pack to move on. When they did, she took aim, and killed the young wolf with a single crack shot. The rest of the wolves would obviously have heard her, but they wouldn't come back for the odd one out of the pack.

The group was made up purely of youngster's keen on discovering old world culture in order to help gage just how to reflect current life in this new world. They had decided that music would be the best cure-all for the lack of reflection in today's society and so, with little more than some scavenged instruments and old records brought in from some far away land as inspiration, the budding band was formed.\n\nThey had already captured the community's attention with their first song, a tune about the gangs of the city and the authorities response to them. It raised a few eyebrows from the higher ups, but they could do very little to censure the young lads due to the astonishing popularity of the band. Now, it was set to be the launching of their big follow-up tune and it was wished upon by many that they could hopefully surpass their last hit.\n\nAs the band started up, the sound they played conveyed an impending doom using a series of weird, diminished chords. It was assisted along by powerful, yet sparse, lyrics that directly addressed people's yearnings.

To keep order, the book talked about what was called a "feudal system" where a hereditary elite would control matters with some kind of divine right to do so. It seemed... entirely relevant. Manny hurried back to his home, excited to tell the commune's council the great wisdom he had uncovered.\n\nThe communes current spokespeople, it's fair to say, did not share Manny's enthusiasm for feudalism. The words "You spent all that time, tucked away, just to come out with this shite! Get lost!" were not exactly the ones Manny wanted to hear. Well, they were going to be far worse for it, he thought to himself. Anyway, some other commune elsewhere would accept him and his ideas, Manny thought. He was sure of it, it's too good of an idea not to pass up on... isn't it?"

The Alpine vistas, the chirping of the birds in the trees. The serenity wandering brought him after a hard day's work was one of his greatest joys in a simple life.\n\nA spark from behind, and a heat that could be felt even through the layers of cloth he was wearing. As he watched the fire consume his town from his favorite viewing spot high above the mountains, he was petrified with fear. He stood like that for almost an hour until the smoke had dissipated. When he finally was shaken from his stupor, he fell to the ground and sobbed.\n\nOh how he sobbed.\n\nWhen he had recovered from the shaking, when the tears had at last ceased to flow, when his head cleared and his heart summoned the strength, he kept hiking. That was all he could do. Where was he hiking? To safety? To find survivors? To get as far away from what he remembered? None who would meet him over the years knew, least of all him. But even after all that had happened, the miller never stopped doing what he had done throughout his life: Wandering."

Mary's Chapel, despite the innocuous-sounding name was a lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons.\n\nThe members of this society had met for hundreds of years, speculating about the moral lessons that could be derived from the working tools of operative stonemasons. Symbols like the hammer, the chisel, the square, and the compass had illuminated their lives and inspired their moral improvement. Their numbers had dwindled for a long time under the suppression of the old regimes, and the fires of the calamity nearly finished them off. Yet, a select few had survived to emerge in the new world.\n\nSurrounded by ruins, the survivors once more had need of the traditional skills of masonry. The craft of constructing great edifices was in high demand, and the survivors of that Lodge used their working tools - so lovingly preserved and replicated over the ages - to revive the operative traditions of Freemasonry. While circumstances forced masonry to once more focus on the practical aspects of its trade, the masons looked forward to a day when the world was enlightened enough to return to speculation about the Divine in the hallways that birthed them."

Its leadership cared not for divisions of race, which they believed was the primary cause of the catastrophe that doomed the Old World to extinction. It would gather its members together to form polities across the great sea. These city-states welcomed in all those seeking shelter from the ravages of the war, as long as they were willing to pledge allegiance to the Legion, their new fatherland.\n\nThe legionaries and their league of cities would endure as a powerful force in the new world.

The skies were dark, the crops rotted in the field, and those who spent too much time outside were riddled with tumors. Unsurprisingly, the pious rural folk turned to God for deliverance. Even those most paranoid about the threat of fallout braved the brief trek outside to their local chapels.\n\nBut even then, they were fraught with problems. When Father Guillermo keeled over and died-whether from old age, radiation poisoning, or disease, nobody was sure-the townsfolk initially did nothing, expecting the bishop to send a replacement pastor for the parish. But then a horrible realization dawned on them: there was no bishop left. There was likely not even a Pope. The seat of Saint Peter was vacant, and the literal seat was incinerated in nuclear fire.\n\nAll the priests in the area gathered together in the Fiore family's barn, the only space big enough to hold them all. When they emerged, they proclaimed a young and charismatic priest just recently ordained, Father Lorenzo, as Pope. Rather fittingly to the apocalyptic nature of his election, Lorenzo had chosen Peter II as his regnal name. Of course, the Holy Father insists that since the end of days has already happened, it symbolizes the rebirth of the Church in the face of trials and tribulations."

Seeing them packed into boats large and small as the Jerman flying machines swooped upon them like hungry birds was harrowing, but he knew that they would always escape in the end, to fight another day. He knew that at the end of the story, they would always find their way home, to the city that looked a lot like the ruins out east. If this was made of moving photographs, like someone had told him once, then maybe this story was even true?\n\nThe voice became more enthusiastic and triumphant as the story drew to a close. "While these men live and breathe, Britain is safe! The enemy will never pass!" The moving pictures showed the men smiling, waving and eating food as loud music played, and the image faded to show a fluttering pieces of fabric with an eight-limbed cross drawn on it. He didn't know what that picture meant, but he'd seen it drawn on lots of things while exploring ruins and looking at old books.

Far more than the volcano at the island's centre, the raiders on their ships of metal made life a never-ending trial of misery, hungry winters and fruitless harvests. Their island's history was one of devastation; first, the great deluge had come, washing away all traces of civilization on the coastline. A century later, from the same direction as the first great waves, the raiders had arrived in their long, fast ship, bristling with guns that could destroy a village from beyond the horizon. From their steel stronghold far distant from the shore, they could strike forth at a moment's notice, razing a village to the ground before pillaging its entire harvest in a matter of hours. When they came ashore, they came with gleaming weapons far more deadly and accurate than the antiquated wooden rifles passed down among the scattered farming families.\n\nBut one day, as the lookout in the tiny village of Tantillo reached for his brass horn to warn the villagers of the vessel he had spotted rounding the bay, a long, low whooshing filled the air. Craning his neck to look skywards in the direction of the sound, he saw something glimmering in the midday sun: three triangular objects, fashioned of metal and moving at an impossible speed. In mere seconds they had streaked through his entire field of vision, bypassing the village and bearing down on the ship. As the whooshing grew to a deafening roar, something streaked down from each shape and struck the vessel amidships with a trio of explosions, just like the ones that had torn apart a dozen villages. When the smoke cleared, the vessel was rapidly listing and gushing a black liquid into the sea, while individual raiders abandoned ship to flail in the tainted waves.\n\nWhen the sentry looked back up, the metal shapes were little more than dots in the pale blue sky, soaring ever higher until they disappeared into the clouds.

After spending some time to gaze reverently at the pale sky, the farmer shook himself out of his contemplative mood and set to his work for the day.\n\nAt noontime, with the sun high above his head and beating upon his neck, he paused in his labor to stretch his legs and eat his lunch. He walked a little ways to his favorite spot to eat on his land, a mid-sized pond that had begun its life as a crater from some long forgotten war. As he ate his meal, he reflected upon the crater, and upon the war that caused it, and upon the Disaster. There was no one left who had actually lived through the disaster, and there was also no longer anyone who remembered anyone who had either. Everything the farmer knew about life before that event came from stories he had heard from his parents as a child, who had themselves presumably been told by their parents, and back through the generations. He wondered what those people who had caused such destruction that none could even tell how that destruction had been wrought had lived. Perhaps they had all lived in luxury, never knowing toil at all, and this disconnection from the process of life was what caused them to destroy themselves. Or maybe they had lived so fiercely and barbarically that such destruction seemed to them as perfectly normal. Who could say? These questions were interesting of course, the farmer thought to himself as he retuned to his fields, but were hardly a real concern of his. No, he would concern himself with feeding himself and his family.

From this chest he pulled forth two ancient bindings of what my father taught me is called 'paper' in the High Tongue. The elder stepped over to the table and opened the bindings and let me examine their script. I could not read any of it, for they were written in the Old Runes. The elder explained to me that the first binding was a collection of the prophecies of the Time of the Gods, and that the second was a record written down by the ancestors of our tribe soon after the Great Fire. The elder admitted to me that he was unable to decipher all of the script due to the age of the bindings and his own imperfect understanding of the Old Runes. I have written the elder's words exactly as he said them to me.\n\n"In the Age of the Gods there was peace upon all the lands, and fire served man instead of killing him, and the light of the city of the gods, Germania, stood like a shining beacon at night through the beautiful magics of Valhalla. There was however, an angel who was not content with this peace, it was a spirit of madness and evil. The angel rallied about him legions of horrible demons to make war upon the gods of Valhalla. He was a tempter of men and angels alike, and was called the Father of Lies, for not even his own legions knew of his true goals. It was his fire that destroyed mankind, his warped pride that has smothered the light." I was greatly troubled by the Elder's words, but he counseled me with wise words.

Curiously, none of the locals dared to venture any closer than thirty paces from it.\n\nIntrigued, the intrepid young Ben set forth towards it, even crossing a rather precarious, decrepit bridge across the river. This was against his better judgement, considering that the bridge looked like it would collapse if a stray bird landed on it.

Men would be resting or huddled around fires, speaking of past glories and pondering deserting, when the screech would burrow its way into their ears. Screams would ring out, as would shots. Men would turn on shadows and fire, or scuffle with those they could not see, and several of their own would die in the process. And the song always, always followed them wherever they went, though there were always a few differences to the tune.\n\nSometimes, they would kill the composer and stop the music, only to be accosted by them again, the tune never stopping.

Sometimes, they walked right past. Other times, they'd give me another story to tell.\n\n"My father was like you." One man'd say as he passed me a few pieces of bread. "He used to 'stage-fight'.

Anything for bread. In the mornings, I'd walk around waving a sign and yelling "FOOD FOR STORIES!" At night, I'd rest on a mat, keeping as good a watch as I could for thieves. I used to have a blanket to go with the mat. Now someone else has my blanket.\n\n"FOOD FOR STORIES!" I kept yelling. Men and women passed bread. I told jokes, they laughed. I told stories of Emperors and heroes and Olympians and they listened. They smiled. I acted. Occasionally I ate like a king. Occasionally my stomach growled for weeks. "Food for Stories." I'd whimper.\n\nYet, after a few months of this, it became plainly aware it was worth it. At least, to them. Repeat customers, kids in need of a laugh, people for miles. I sang. I danced.

Where was God? Where were the angels? Where was the promised reward? All of the 'purifications', 'sanitations', all of it. For nothing!\n\nA growl came from his throat as he looked around. Everything was falling apart so quickly. Cities vanishing within clouds, police on the streets beating everyone they could find, and absolutely none of it sat well with him. Blood caked the roads. Screams roared through his ears, along with the sirens.\n\nAll the things that he'd done. All the things he'd lived through. All of it for a god who didn't seem to be there.

Two against five.\n\nA shot rings out.\n\nThree against four. Three against seven. Five against six. More shouts. More angry people. Good. Eight against three. Eight against two. Twelve against one.

Five hundred men against thousands, perhaps even millions one would think when they could observe the marching legion from the Duke's tower.\n\nThe siege ended when the Duke's messenger left his fortress, however. To the surprise of all, the young Duke demanded a trial by combat to decide the day. A knightly duel between honorable men, which was why the request was so odd. Never known for his honor, and never having made a name for himself with his sword, none knew what the Duke de Epine was thinking when he sent the message. Perhaps he simply, in a rare moment of mercy, wished to spare his men?\n\nThe duel began at dawn, four observers--two from each opponent--watched on as the Duke and the Conqueror met on the field. Armor glittered, and after a short conversation, the Conqueror raised his sword and charged with a mighty cry.\n\nAnd then the Duke fired.\n\nNone had seen a weapon of its like for centuries, but there it sat in his hand. A museum piece, no doubt found in some ancient vault, but functional nonetheless. With its bark of thunder and a blast of light and smoke, the Conqueror fell to the ground, a hole through his helmet.

In a pot of gold inlaid with bronze swastikas must be burned an effigy of the Fuwher that contains in its construction three thimbleful of potent Toxica-powder and a quarter measure of a Morphean infusion. This will summon the spirit for 88 minutes, in which time it shall answer any questions you ask of it as long as you never contradict it, forget its title or fail to compliment its artwork.\n\nIn the case of a Summoner seeking victory in war or a bountiful harvest, it would behoove them to summon the greater Nahseean Goren the Vast, prince of consumption and master of the rod. To do this you must take a piece of artwork that was stolen by force and ruin it by covering it in rich, oily food and drink. Then you take a rod of bone and silver and turn to the four corners of the Earth, in each one invoking the rite of Laibons' Room (See previous chapter)\n\nOnce that is done, you may ask Goren for victory on the field of battle, but they will only accept if you offer them a sufficient amount of currency to consume (note: Fake currency will do as long as it is of sufficiently high quality).\n\nFor a Summoner seeking the destruction of their enemies, even at a cost of their own life, it is possible to call upon the aid of Hymmlar the Black. This is not advised! As Hymmlar is second in power only to the Fuwher and infintely more volatile! To summon him you must burn all your possessions except those you can carry in a sunken cauldron of concrete, while chanting in the ancient tongue of the Nauseeans. Once this is done, the Summoner may wreak their vengeance, but beware! For any harm you do shall return to you ten thousand fold!\n\nSome protection may be gained by summoning Hymmlar from a subterranean sanctum, but even this is no guarantee. After all:"

United against the seemingly unstoppable threat pouring in from the north, every fiefdom from the Epcot Kingdoms to the Marlin Narco-Barons united at the ancient fortress of Castle Sandmarkes. A thousand banners raised together, as many tens of thousands more came pouring over ancient bridges and over the decaying roads of a dead empire.\n\nThe battle that followed would fall into the annals of legends.\n\nOver ten thousand died upon the walls of Sandmarkes. Horses screeched and the ground shook for seven days as mighty trebuchets launched ancient bombs at the fort. The ground for miles was choked with corpses and the rushing bodies, and the seas were filled with ships as the armies of the Great Reformer clashed with the ramshackle fleets of the Florides. Above the carnage, what may have been the first air battle in over a hundred years occurred.

His armies broken, they rushed over the northern swamps back to their petty kingdoms, where infighting had already begun again.

Since that day, the two had experienced an inexplicable but almost natural longing to ride the heavens as the old ones did.\n\nTheir work lay before Korren now. The motor engine, a technology only recently reclaimed from the ravages of time, rumbled from within its innards. Four canvas wings, fashioned together by Debyra's own hand, stretched out ready to catch the whirlwind. And in the cockpit carefully designed by Korren over countless sleepless nights, Debyra lay flat on her chest, playfully teasing her brother's endless fussing - though an undercurrent of nervousness colored her tone as well.\n\nThe time was finally upon them. Upon the Peaks of Copper in the land of the Great Lakes, their machine prepared to take flight. Korren stepped back, praying to the Supreme that his sister be delivered safely to their shared goal, just as Debyra began to throttle forwards. The machine rattled towards the steep cliff edge, and like a tottering infant it hurtled off into the sky. Korren drew sharp breaths as he began to fear an error, a misjudgement, some missed and crucial detail that would send his sister careening to her doom.\n\nBut it worked. By the blessings of the Supreme and the Holy Lamb Korren watched as his sister soared. It was but for a few seconds, but as she tasted flight for the first time in countless generations, Debyra's cries of joy echoed out across the fields. Racing to catch up with the machine as it landed roughly but safely upon the ground, Korren embraced his sister, knowing that while much still needed to be done, they had made the first step towards taking back the sky.\n\nFor a brief moment, Debyra had the sensation of being watched from above.

The people of the desert, in ancient times so bitterly divided over land, resources, culture, and class, had at last begun to come together to create something entirely new.\n\nNot all was peaceful--bandits still roamed the sands, and the desert was as hot as ever--but the young nation survived. It spread across the deserts of what had once been called southern Arizona, creating a new language, new tools, and new artwork. An independent national identity emerged, for a fledgling young nation.\n\nThe greatest discovery of all was the ruins of a city, right underneath the sands. The people of the desert settled there, in the ruins, and resolved to rebuild it. They would keep building on the pattern of the old, until the city was greater than it had ever been in life. They would finish the great work their ancestors had spent their lives building, and create a new home for their new people.\n\nTo this task they applied themselves wholly, and for generations they labored, and their society grew. Using the tools left by those who came before, they learned once more of science, mathematics, art and beauty. The ash and dust that had once covered the city's streets and buildings slowly faded away, and eventually the lights and signs would once more illuminate the night skies of the desert. The people of the Sonora gazed upon their work with awe, and christened it with the name their ancestors had given it, named for a being that would always rise from the ashes of its death and begin anew. One day they would fall, they knew, but they also knew that life would rise from those ashes, and that was a comfort."

He wasn't content to fear the unknown, he didn't want to live in ignorance anymore. He would find the east, and see its supposed terrors for himself.\n\nAnd so the young man found himself a crew. It was not so difficult these days as it once had been; large ships and smaller canoes regularly ran along the coast, transporting goods, and many of their crews felt the same wanderlust he did. He searched for a time for a suitable ship, and in the end one was built with the aid of the local elders and the blessings of the holy men. And so they set off.\n\nTheir spirits were high at first. The wind was in their favor, and the mythical east was surely only a few days away. When a week passed and they saw no land, despair slowly began to creep into their hearts, but still they pressed on. They had to know what was out there, even if it killed them.\n\nA month passed, then another, and their food stores were beginning to wane.

And so they pressed on, though their stomachs ached and their throats grew dry.\n\nWhen all hope seemed lost, one of the sailors waited until the dead of night and crept his way to the bow, thinking that if only he threw himself off the ship, his misery would end much sooner. He had put his foot on the railing when his eyes widened, and he ran backwards, shouting "Land! Land! I see land!"\n\nBefore the boat could lay anchor on the coast of this new, strange place, canoes had already disembarked and brought the explorers to the green shores.

Together, these champions of mankind were said to defend the villages of the innocent and burn the camps of the evil. They weren't gods. They weren't even real, everyone knew that. Yet the stories were beloved regardless.\n\nThese stories united the shattered remnants of the toppled leader of the Free World in their hope, and ever so slowly, people began to wonder about what could be, to dream of a better future. At times it seemed like there wasn't a village you could enter without seeing children dashing to and fro, swinging hammers or makeshift shields made of bundled sticks.

At first, many survivors in the north feared the dead, telling their children stories of vengeful ghosts and ghouls that would steal them away in the night. Beware the dead, they would say, for their unbeating hearts are filled with jealousy for the living, and will gladly drag you down to hell with them.\n\nBut this strange new tradition said otherwise. It spoke of a day where the dead returned to Earth, but not to avenge themselves upon the living. No, the dead returned to view their descendants with gentle smiles upon their faces, to see the world's progress since the end.\n\nThe custom had many names. The oldest spoke of it as 'dia de los muertos', their children called it the Day of the Dead, and their children after them called it The Day the Dead Walked.\n\nRegardless of the name, the peculiar tradition spread throughout the north. Once a year, every year, the people would celebrate those that no longer walked the Earth with them, giving them food, offerings, and telling stories of their exploits: celebrating the lives they had, not mourning the deaths they suffered.\n\nWithin a matter of decades, every year on the anniversary of The War, the people of North America celebrated those who had perished so tragically in the flames.

Some said he was a warlock and could open portals to Hell itself, some said he was a brilliant scientist who had harnessed the power of the very Sun, but the eldest of Mountazhnia said the man was merely lucky, and had stumbled upon a treasure trove of weapons from an age long forgotten.\n\nThe fear of these weapons kept the people in line, and the terrible warlord took advantage of this, declaring himself the king of Mountazhnia, ruling with an iron fist. If any spoke out, or even showed the slightest dissent, their own villages would tear them apart out of fear of the King and his great weapons.\n\nAfter years of suffering and torment, finally, the dam broke. First one man stood outside of the King's fortress, rake in hand. Then another man joined him - and another. Eventually, hundreds - thousands stood outside the gate, waiting for their demise. But nothing happened.\n\nEmboldened, they stormed the fortress, and on that day, the "King" of Mountazhnia was brought down, his claims of unstoppable weapons proved false."

 RAD_NA_14.desc: "It was a marvelous thing, the city of Freigh was. It stood almost impossibly tall and wide, a steel backbone surrounding it, spires jutting to the sides of the thing, and glass spires stood almost impossibly tall. It was a marvel, and the story residents told of its origin was more marvelous still.\n\nThey would say that in ancient times, the city had been a great boat, transporting the greatest riches of the land across the seas. They said that it had been, even then, a marvel of the world, and that its name, Freigh, was a testament to its great majesty.\n\nBut greatness cannot last forever, so the story told. One foul day, the seas and skies began to boil, and the great ship's crew was thrown overboard in the storms that raged. They said the ship sailed, directionless, for a great many years - until it struck the shores it now rested on.\n\nFor centuries, the ship would be a fascination to the local tribes. Some built their homes in it, some worshipped it, and some tried to emulate it - the ruins of these imitations can be seen today, albeit at the bottom of the sea. But the city of Freigh was born from these attempts, as slowly, but surely, civilization thrived in the ruins of the once great beast. Perhaps Freigh would never grow as strong, or as mighty, as the Empire State whispers spoke of, but still, the culture and legacy of the half-sunk ship would last for centuries."

The radio in the hospital room played, smooth quiet jazz - it was all perfect. The beginnings of a family.\n\nThen perfection came crashing down. The smooth jazz, in a heartbeat, cut to static - then a buzz.\n\n"ATTENTION," it blared in a monotone voice, "ATTENTION. This is the Emergency Broadcast System. Take shelter immediately. Take shelter immediately. This is not a drill.\n\nRepeat: This is not a drill. An enemy attack is being launched against the United States. Take shelter immediately and stay tuned to this frequency for further instructions."\n\nThe nameless child woke and began to sob, sooned joined by his mother. The man's heart leapt into his throat. Not now. Why did it have to be now? He slumped into his seat, cradling his head in his hands for a moment. He knew she couldn't move, and he knew he would never leave either of them here.\n\nThe mother whispered quiet assurances to her son with no name as the father slid into the bed, wrapping his arms around his wife and son, tears streaming down his face.\n\nThe child cooed and giggled at his parents' faces, and as his hand curled around his mother's pinky, a blinding flash set the world ablaze.\n\nYears later, scavengers would find the silhouettes of a man, a woman, and a child in the ruins of a hospital."

The people of the Homestead lived simply and peacefully, but in a manner quite unlike most tribes. There was no trade, and no leader. The people, as one, decided their goals and decisions, and all in the Homestead were said to contribute to their farms freely, and would freely receive their food in return.\n\nThe Homestead was said to be formed from the sons and daughters of an ancient priesthood, the Leyftis, who once championed a great struggle for their way of life to be adopted across the land. They had failed, in the end, but their memories lived on in the Homestead, so the story goes.\n\nFor years, the Homestead provided a home, food, and work for the disparate groups of the north-east, tales of their strange way of life attracting curious visitors and critics both, and the Homestead welcomed all.\n\nEven after the Homestead one day fell, the name would live on, and even today, long after the last member of the Homestead's children's children's names have been forgotten, their hopeful, strange, beautiful way of life lives on."

As he lifted himself from his bed, he instinctively reached for the light switch upon the wall near his bed. As he flipped the switch, the lights did not react. The power would have been out from yesterday, he figured. As James threw on a quick set of clothes, the knocking upon the front door sounded off once more.\n\nImagining that his attention was being demanded quite urgently, he briskly ventured to the door, opening it wide to greet whomever was making the fuss upon his doorstep. Expecting to see a local, James was shocked when he was greeted by the faces of two complete strangers, a man and a woman. Before he could so much as utter a simple "Good morning", the couple chimed in. "Please, do you have any fuel? Any at all? We'd be completely in your debt!" the man said in a dangerously maddened singsong. "Well, not much I'm afraid. The gas station is just down that-a-way, about a ten minute walk. I think they sell jerry cans at the shop there, if you're really in a pinch." James replied in groggy, sleep-fresh tones, pointing towards the gas station. "You don't think they're already out?" replied the man. James, confused, sleepy, and wanting no more of this annoyance, finally relented. "Wait here, I have a bit of fuel." he said, as he disappeared to his garage shed.\n\nReturning with a metal jerry can half filled with gasoline, the strangers began to direct him to their dry vehicle. He realized that they had been stranded upon the highway. Typical. As the highway rounded into view, however, what he witnessed was far from typical. The highway was a scene of chaos. Hundreds of vehicles, as far as his eye can see, lined the road motionless, as dozens of individuals proceeded between the vehicles on foot. His mind failed to comprehend the scene of utter madness that had overtaken his quiet small town."

The children excitedly hush in anticipation of the old man's stories. Stories of a world long gone. Stories from when an old man was but a young boy.\n\nThe old man begins, as even the adults start to gather behind the children, intrigued by tales of a world much different than the one they inhabit today. He begins with his usual talk of great cities of stone and steel, where millions would coexist in peace. Modes of transportation so swift that any distance could be undertaken in mere hours. Yet despite the commonality of these stories, they never quite lose their allure.\n\nThe old man continues to describe great commonwealths and councils who would effectively manage thousands of humble villages and great cities alike - once or twice he calls them the strange name of raypubliks. He then speaks of a great evil across the seas, which sought to enslave all of mankind. He tells of legends he was taught as a young boy. Legends of heroes who would travel to lands far across the seas to combat the forces of evil. His face grows dark, as he speaks of the great lights upon the horizon as his mother and father ushered him to safety, far from the great settlements, as they were destroyed by the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe children sit silently in a mix of wonder and fear. The old man's face lights up with joy once again, as he assures the children to have no fear, for the evil men were vanquished in the same fires that consumed the settlements of old America. As he continues to recount the stories of his childhood, the old man begins to stutter off, as his speeches transform into tired mumbles. Age and weariness reclaim his mind.

Yet, despite all they have encountered, nothing compared to the great tower in the sea.\n\nAs the ship caught sight of the tower, it was naught but an odd shape upon the upcoming horizon. Drawing little more than mild curiosity, the ship and her crew continued to sail forth, drawing closer to the structure. As they did so, they were transfixed by the growth of the towering figure upon the distant waves, indicating a structure of colossal size. What could possibly be so large so far off at sea?\n\nThen, finally, the tower came into plain view for the sailors, who had to crane their necks upwards to take in the tower's sheer scale. A grand structure, sanding impossibly in the deep blue sea, towering above the size of any ship. The tower did not float, but was rather supported in the air by gargantuan legs sinking indefinitely down into the depths of the ocean. More intriguingly, structure appeared to carry several smaller structures resembling a metallic settlement upon its platforms, but the platform could not be reached without excessive effort and delay.\n\nAs the ship and her crew later arrive in port, they talk vividly of their discovery. Much to their shock, others claimed to have heard similar stories. They say that tens of these structures overlook the oceans of the world, built by those who came before. Yet none can agree what purpose such giant sea structures could have possibly served, or how they were built. The sailors debate these great towers of the sea into the long hours of the night, never quite coming to an answer."

With several aggressive pulls of a cord, the generator roared to life, emitting a steady whir. Not far off, a set of lights flickered to life, brightly illuminating a grassy yard upon which an intimate gathering of men and women sat beneath the light, alcoholic drinks in hand.\n\nAs the power brought the yard to life much like the daytime sun, a music player was hauled over to the gathering and in turn connected to an electrical outlet. As electricity was fed to the device, loud, upbeat tunes began to emerge from its speakers. The group reveled in the euphoria of the music, and the memories it brought. Memories of a world seemingly without woes. Memories of an easier time. For one last moment, the hardships of the world could be forgotten, as they faded away like the passing of a dream.\n\nThe group erupted in laughter as jovial stories from a world now lost were shared. They continued to down their beverages with unusual speed, enjoying the few they had remaining. There were little more to go around.\n\nThe tune on the music player changed, and a woman of the group greeted the song with a dance. With several of the group singing along with the familiar lyrics, the others joined in on the dance. Laughter sounded off once again as the short moment seemed to extend into an eternity.\n\nThe night dragged on as the sky glowed with the unobstructed shine of the distant stars. Empty bottles lay scattered upon the ground as the group sat now in silent conversation, reveling in the final moments of the old world. The lights suddenly dimmed, and came back to full brightness again near immediately after, as the music player grew quiet for a brief moment in tandem. The generator audibly sputtered and choked upon the other side of the yard, as the group were once again met with their reality, like vivid memories of a forgotten nightmare. As the generator offered its final cough, the lights flickered into indefinite darkness. Finally, seconds later, the music offered its final notes, and the group sat under the silent starlight once again."

 RAD_NA.21.desc: "Since time immemorial, a humble kingdom in the northern plains had relied upon barter as basis for its transactions. Few found the necessity for much else; after all, one can often find a fair exchange for their goods and services locally. As the humble kingdom expanded her domain, however, and as more trade flowed both into and within her own borders, hard currency had become no longer a luxury, but a necessity. Yet they lacked the means to create such currency -- how, then, could one hope to radically shift the economy of their realm?\n\nMen find a way in time, as with all things. A system was devised consisting of three metals: copper, iron, and silver. Laborers worked day in and out, melting down the metals into moulds in which small, round discs are formed. For years the toils continued, with heaps of coins of all three stored in preparation for their debut.\n\nLong after the proclamation declaring these coins as legal tender, the kingdom soon found itself having become the nexus of the "Coinage Trade". Men became merchants day by day with the influx of wealth and goods across great distances which the trade had brought about. What was once a humble kingdom has since become what many in the wastes dream, but cannot accomplish: a beacon that awe warlords and kings throughout the land with its glimmering splendor."

Yet, in the peninsulas of the maritimes, a new settlement grew upon one such ruin. What was initially settled for its bountiful fishing grounds and fertile farmlands became a sprawling agglomeration of fisheries, farms, and trade ships from all over the land. The settlement tasted more success as generations pass, and its borders thus came to envelop the ruins of yet another old city, its name long forgotten to time.\n\nPeculiar walls and collapsed structures of stone and steel litter the landscape of the outer city. Near as common are grassy lots, occupied by collapsed edifices of unknown purpose. Farmers' fields tangle through these ruins such that archaic structures stand awkwardly between budding crops. Despite the seeming inconvenience brought by the peculiar tango between ruin, none would dare to attempt to remove these pillars of the Old World, to erase its stony remains.\n\nAs the city flourished throughout the years, merchants and travelers who traveled from far and wide make special note to visit its outskirts and hinterlands, where these ruins remain standing. They say it is as if one is caught between two distinct periods of time: with one foot in both Old World and New World at the same time."

He'd forgotten things -- his name, his hometown, his mother and father, a lot of other things. It hurt to think, to jog his aching head, but he remembered two things.\n\nThe man recalled he was a musician, playing tunes in lots of places with a guitar, and that he wrote a song. He had plans in store for it, planned to use it to sling himself into fame and fortune. That dream ended when a nuke wiped his city off the map in -- God, that was just a few days ago. Or weeks, months.\n\nHe'd forgotten a lot of things, but the words came out of his mouth as naturally as breathing. The first lines let loose coughing and hacking, and his fingers tripped over themselves trying to follow. Somehow bits of his energy returned as he sang, and his tiptoes began tapping to the beat. Eventually he sang with the loudest voice he can muster, hitting the right notes, crystal clear, and his hands thrummed just like they had when he played in cool nights with old friends and faceless strangers. For a brief moment, the musician was in a lively bar, and not out to die alone.\n\nThe burst of energy didn't last for long, and he felt his strength weaken just in time for the song to draw down. Puffy, tear-filled eyes looked up and saw the greens of trees, the rolling clouds and the afternoon sunset. He felt gentle wind. He heard soft birdsong. Everything was peaceful now. As his consciousness faded for the last time, the musician smiled softly."

The group, comprised of adventurous spirits from various settlements and fiefdoms along Saint Lawrence's waterway, searched for a great artifact believed by some to be long lost to time, and by others to be a foolish legend that never truly existed.\n\nThe legends hold that there was once a great lord by the name of Stanley. He is told to have governed across all lands imaginable by man, from the great ocean of the east to lands far west of the untamed forests. Tales tell of this great lord and the lavish games he threw for the people of his empire. The citizens would arrive in droves to witness the combat within Stanley's magnificent arenas, watching as the men would brawl and bloody one another for the crowd's amusement. It is said that the lord had commissioned a great chalice of pure silver, the size of which rivals that of a grown man, to be awarded to the victors of his games.\n\nAfter a weeks long journey, the group arrived at their destination. It was a grand ruin, believed to possibly be one of the emperor's great arenas. The imposing nature of the edifice certainly lead the group to believe the rumours, even if the building had mostly been reduced to rubble.\n\nFollowing a long search, one member of the expedition spotted a suspicious glint beneath a rather dull pile of rubble. With the help of some other adventurers, he was able to clear away enough rubble to identify what appeared to be a large metallic object. Within minutes, the entire expedition was working on the rubble, hopeful that they had finally found their treasure.\n\nThen it emerged. The great chalice of Lord Stanley, from beneath a heap of rubble. The group marveled at the grandeur of the object. Before long, arguments erupted within the expedition as to where the great artifact should be kept. None could agree upon which settlement most deserved stewardship over Stanley's chalice.

The mythos of the group stretched all the way back to the times of old, where the Associated Leagues of the ancients had birthed their noble line to pit them in an endless battle against other such groups in the pursuit of the gods' favor. The ancient tales would be of little interest to most, however - the order's feats in the modern age would be a legacy unto themselves.\n\nIt is said that as the Fall was in motion, the Steel Men had been locked in a fierce duel with their ancient rivals, the Cowmen of Dallas. Yet as the world burned around them the two foes joined forces for a time, to aid the men of the fallen city of Pitt. Men and women were granted shelter in the colosseum that had played host to their duel, from the mobs and thieves and fires and floods surrounding them, and from that day onwards the Steel Men would vow to fight for the people in a world gone to darkness.\n\nClad in their black and gold regalia, the Order fought against those who had rejected their humanity in the wake of the end, protecting the weak from those who would seek to exert their will over them. Many of those they protected would come to join their ranks, and the Steel Men would grow into a formidable fighting force. Their legend would only grow; mothers would tell their children bedtime stories of the Men's defence of the Apple from mighty behemoths, fathers would inspire their sons with the tales of their assault upon the Vikings in the northlands. Men became heroes, heroes became legends, and in time the scum of the continent would come to dread the day that they learned that the ancient Steelers were coming for them.\n\nLike most legends, their story would come to an end. The Mad King of Michiana - not yet fully known for his lunacy - would play a most devious trick upon them, and lure them into a trap where his men would slaughter their forces to a man, though not before they inflicted ten cuts for every blow dealt to them. In the end, only treachery could bring the mighty warriors to their graves, and the dead would be remembered in glory forever. Countless knightly orders would invoke their legacy, legitimate or not, and tales of their deeds and courage would be told for countless generations."

Pushed until there was nowhere left to run and slaughtered without abandon, those who survived were either forced to take up the conquerors' masks of language and habit or be cast into prisons called "reservations," where their masters could freely abuse them and deny them a share of the land's bounty.\n\nBut in the end, the greed of the conquerors and their like-minded rivals became their undoing, and the world was reborn in the Seventh Fire. It was not without cost, for the oppressed burned as much as the oppressors did. But when at last the smoke cleared, the empire the masters had built was in ruins, and the gates of their prisons lay open. Gingerly, carefully, memories of the tragic past still burning in the back of their minds, the first men of the continent stepped out into a new world.\n\nSome scattered to the winds, looking to find a new place for themselves in an uncertain future. But others remembered where they had come from, and decided that the time was right to reclaim what had been lost. They willingly walked the trail that their ancestors had been made to walk in blood; this time, however, they were not going away. They were going home.\n\nNone of them knew what would happen once they returned to their old lands. Would they find hope, renewal and peace? Would they be able to restore their ancestors' legacy or be forced to build a new one from scratch? Would they return to being rulers of the lands, or would they be contented with living in a more equal harmony with the others?

The growing of squash, corn, and climbing beans in rotating cycles. These crops work in harmony with one another. The maize provides a tall plant for the beans to climb up. The beans enrich the soil with nitrogen. The squash covers the ground to prevent sunlight from allowing weeds to grow, and further retains moisture in the soil and deters pests.

He lent his aid to King Martyn Luther to both free the people from chains and to drive the greedy Romans from the church. He was attacked and mortally wounded by two men hiding in a theatre and on a grassy hill, and yet he still rose again to push for liberty and justice for all the people of the land. He represented truth, freedom, emancipation from slavery and the unity of man throughout all nations. All this and more would be attributed to the figure, who would simply come to be called the Emancipator.\n\nThe years and the elements would slowly wear away at the monument. From time to time, orders and societies would emerge that would attempt to keep the old stones maintained. Men would travel from all over the continent to see it, make offerings and give thanks, even as the old world faded into myth. Time claims all things, however, and as the ages wore on the statue would become more and more degraded, with the head being stolen from it sometime during the later period of the Kolumbyin Republic. Eventually, the statue itself would be lost in a great fire, crumbling to barely recognizable rubble under a pile of collapsed scaffolds.\n\nA great wonder of the world was lost, but the Emancipator's legacy lived on in the hearts and minds of men. At the old site of his ancient shrine, only a portion of the epitaph remained, eternally proclaiming its sacred decree."

 RAD_NA.32.t: "Los Luchadores" # Hooked Up
 RAD_NA.32.desc: "Through action, man becomes legend; through the passing of time, legend becomes myth. Long stretches of time have passed since the world ended, and the heroic actions of men before and during the terrible catastrophe are now enshrined as beloved myth.\n\nOne such myth began in the wastes of old Mehica. Law and order had collapsed as soon as innocent cities fell prey to the terrible bombs of empires long gone. Civilization collapsed in the chaos following the exchange, and with it the securities many have taken for granted. Those who survived were left to the tender mercies of cruel, evil men, who jumped at the chance to profit off of the battered land's misery.\n\nBut silver lines every gathering of stormy clouds, no matter the shade. Like knights come to rescue the beloved princess, heroes stepped up against the reign of chaos and anarchy that had gripped their homeland. Wearing colorful masks of blues, whites, and reds, these "luchadores" earned fame and the people's undying love as they battled banditos and thugs with the secret art of "La Lucha Libre".\n\nAsk an old abuelo and they will tell you of the luchadores' exploits with the excitement of children eight times their junior. Of how El Santo singlehandedly ended the Tres Marias with his legendary Slam-of-Choke. Of how Mil Mascaras defended Ciudad Rosas from rogue vaqueros by delivering devastating planchas from great heights. Of how the infamous Blue Demon, warlord of the Rio Norte, redeemed himself by forming a "tag team" with El Santo to defeat Comandante Anna, thus bringing lasting peace to all of Mehica. Tall tales, an outsider may say, but they swear to their family name: everything they said was real. They were sure of it.\n\nThrough action, man becomes legend; through the passing of time, legend becomes myth. Tales grow and shrink in size as they pass from generation to generation -- the feats of many may instead become the feats of one. But these men did indeed exist, if with exaggerated exploits to their names. Perhaps one day, the tall tales that have honored their exploits will spur men into action when Mehica calls for aid once more."

Children grow into adulthood into elderhood before they depart to the Reverse Side. In twenty-year stretches, more of the past is reclaimed, unearthed, and eventually reused.\n\nIt began when a city in Turtleland rediscovered the speakpole: a nifty little piece of Old World technology that, so the Reclaimers said, uses vibrations in the air to send messages to another piece of Old World technology called the speakbox. Convenient for communicating with other people from distances away, they were envisioned.\n\nThen the Reclaimers found an unusually well-preserved collection of "speakards" in Excavation Site MO-12. Pictures of well-dressed young men and women line their clearhard surfaces, with names like "Bob Dylan" and "The Beach Boys" hanging above their heads. Someone noticed that, placed carefully onto a speakbox's carrying slot, the speakards fit perfectly well.\n\nMany times in human history had accidents resulted in monumental changes that altered its course. In this case, what happened was nothing less than a flowering of songs from mankind's better times in the present. Through this accident an integral piece of mankind's collective culture, once forgotten, now finds new life in an age of wonder and hope."

Frisco had the great arched road that, in the distant past, had linked its two halves together.\n\nKelymbia had its monuments to unsung heroes, Windyville had Wrigley Coliseum, a hundred towns across the continent had fragments of the Old World that made each unique in their own way.\n\nN'awleens had an underwater city.\n\nNo one knew how, when, or why, but the small community of several thousand that entertained ships from all over the Great Big Gape lived on a fraction of the land it -- well, "used" -- to be. Governeur Abraham was stupefied himself when the Oceanmen made the find with their newest underboat. The swampfellas who had lived in the fringes since Lord knows when did have their stories of Great Floods and black magick from the End Times, but until now they were brushed off as ghost stories passed around campfires.\n\nThe photofilm of a great metropolis, claimed by corals, fish and seaweed after years of isolation, made headlines all over Turtleland. Those with the money suddenly found themselves on a charter boat for N'awleens, where divers of all sorts eagerly wait. Treasure hunters and archaeologists battled for seats in river barges and barques. Overnight, N'awleens became a holy site for daredevils with courage in their hearts and adventure in their minds."

Within ornate walls and statues of marble did the men of the Old World preserve all that they knew -- their techniques, their machines, their arguments and beliefs -- that those who survived the chaos to come can better restore the tattered world they will leave behind. Soon their vision came to pass, and their words held true: where all else turned to rubble, their founts of knowledge stood strong.\n\nAlas, while the Ancients were wise, they were full of hubris also. Surviving the miseries that follow their passing was not enough. No, they wrote their knowledge with their own tongues, sure to turn into ash as years become decades and decades become centuries. Perhaps only those who decipher their recondite letters and words are worthy of learning their secrets; whatever the case, these founts of knowledge instead became the idle, enigmatic curiosities of the civilizations that have sprung forth around them. Countless thousands across the land have tried their hand at uncovering the Ancients' knowledge, and just as many leave with the shame of failure... if they ever leave at all.\n\nAs time matches onwards and men grow above the shadows of the Old World, the secrets that lay behind these founts will surely be unveiled.

Their loyalties to one another are as fickle as the summer breeze; allies become enemies and enemies become allies from one season to the next. This was the state of things then, and so will it be the state of things tomorrow... at least, they thought it will. One disagreed.\n\nIt is said in the old chronicles that a man of will and charisma suddenly appeared in the courts and halls of the Great River realms. There he preached of peace and unity, appealed to the sensibilities of his hosts. Why must brother fight brother, peasant work and toil in fear of untoward reprisal, father bury his family wholesale? The path to prosperity, he proclaimed, lay not through fire and sword, but through hearth and spade.\n\nResponses varied from ruler to ruler. Some were seized with bursts of anger and ordered his arrest. Others refused to grant him entry, as word spread of his exploits. Few made show of entertaining his words; even fewer welcomed him with open arms. Those who did became subject to more visits from the enigmatic man, until finally they each received an invitation.\n\nHistory would tell us that from the meeting, its details lost to time, emerged an alliance of mighty and powerful nations that sought to establish order along the Great River. Their exploits in war became the matter of legend, as did the mercy of their rule in peace. Villages tasted safety for the first time, trade along the river's waters skyrocketed, and its old vagabonds and malcontents learned to live fear 'til the end of their days.\n\nThough its strength would rise and wane and disappear in cycles, this coalition will be held in great regard by the generations who grew under its aegis. For many their coming marked a seminal moment in mankind's long memory, where the New World finally pulled itself out from the ashes of the Old -- for wherever hoists the white torch of fable will be blessed with the chance to live free and prosper as the Ancients did."

John entered the shattered, ruined Church; its crucifix had fallen, pages of songbooks lie scattered about the floor, and no petitioners stood to pray their hearts away. John sat down in the pew, pistol in hand, and wept. No songs colored the dusty air of the Church, only the quiet sobs of a broken man and the roar of distant fires.\n\nJohn placed the barrel of the pistol in his mouth, tears streaming from his eyes. His finger found itself on the trigger, when suddenly, quietly, a rapping came, echoing through the darkness. A jet black bird hopped over to his feet, pecking at the floor. John pulled the pistol from his mouth. This was not the end. This was a sign from God.\n\n--\n\nJohn walked into the Church, as he had hundreds of times before. Huddling around the old barrel in which a dying fire soberly glowed, he sighed. A harsh new world required sacrifices.\n\nHe held up the photograph of people he now barely recognized, names long forgotten in his broken mind, and tossed it into the embers. On cue, a tapping came at the window. The Raven stood straight, itss head cocked. It screeched and flapped its wings. John paid him no mind. There was no point to heeding the Raven's counsel; the picture was aflame.\n\nJohn entered through the rotting wooden doors of the Church, as he had thousands of times before, a limp figure on his shoulder. Laying the corpse down beside the blackened fire-barrel, he picked up a brick and smashed the dead man's skull open.\n\nThere came a scream from the steeple, and the Raven swooped down past the pews. Landing beside him, it screamed a second time, before flying through a shattered window into the starless night.\n\nJohn simply stared out the window, the sign of God gone forever.

I just wrote that. 10 years of ash and soot and cold. I don't think it's ever really occurred to me that I would survive this long. I'm not sure I ever wanted to.\n\nThe boy grows bigger and more capable with each passing day. I've taught him how to read, roughly; he must know how to read maps and signs to navigate through the remnants of a world he never knew. I find myself lagging behind, my old frame giving way to his vigor. Unfortunately, I have not been able to teach him some skills, such as marksmanship, as we have but 10 bullets left.\n\nI can feel myself becoming stretched as time goes on. I worry about everything. About our food. Our shoes. Our life expectancy. Most of all, I worry about the boy's future. Not too long from now, I will be gone, and the boy must know to care for himself. He is not ready.\n\nRegardless of how awful I feel, I must carry on. This boy is the light of a new generation. He and his kind will be left to create a new world from the ashes of my old one.

In the weeks and months following the cataclysm, ships ranging from the size of dinghies to that of battlecruisers, beached themselves on the world's coastlines. Their reserves of gasoline quickly emptied, and they were left adrift at the mercy of the ocean currents.\n\nOnly the few ships that did not require petroleum remained at sea for more than a season. Old sailing ships, and submarines that harnessed the power of the atom. These, however, did not last either. Their food ran low, and they seldom had the manpower to 'requisition' what they needed from the hands of others. So, the sea people died, or fled to the comfort of soil, as so many millions had before them.\n\nThere was one ship that did not have these problems. It had all the necessities to remain at sea: atoms for energy, steel for a strong hull, and manpower to take what they wished. It's true name was unknown to its victims, despite a fearsome reputation. Just the false name that rang out all along the old Western Coast. A name that struck fear and anxiety into any hoping to rebuild in the Western Coast: the Dread Carrier.\n\nFor decades following the apocalypse, the Carrier with a forgotten name attacked, seemingly at random, all along the coasts of America. Whispers passed that the fearsome ship was controlled by an immortal captain, who guided it through the bombs and fire. He sits in a bridge of riches, filled to overflowing with food and water and Old World wine. His underlings are fiercely loyal, well fed, and scrupulously clean.

The most recent "foe" to be destroyed.\n\nIn recent years, the Bluegrass had grown fat and rich and complacent, but also exceedingly cruel. What was once an order of knights riding out through the Riverlands now resembled the brutish and savage Kingdoms of the Deep. Another city to sack, another vault to plunder, another village to raze to ash. It wore down upon a man, and Daniel grew tired.\n\nHe and his horse-brothers rode into the town, firing smoky muskets and swinging sabers down at those unfortunate enough to be in the open when the raid began. Cutting down a man in the street, Daniel rode up to a small house on the edge of town. Hitching his horse, he readied himself to take its valuables, and stepped inside.\n\nThe already small shack had no furniture visible, aside from a single chair, and a few bedrolls. Smoldering embers glowed in the fireplace, giving a dim orange hue to the entire room. In the corner, however, stood a woman with a small babe at her breast. Daniel froze. He did not want to kill this woman.\n\n"Is there a back door?" he asked. The frightened woman nodded. "Run," he continued, "just run as fast and as far as you can. Flee into the woods, so my brothers don't see you."\n\nWithout a word, the mother sprinted out of the room, presumably towards a back door, and through that, to a place far far away.

Unable to control himself, he began to run towards the streaking object. As terrified onlookers ran and screamed for their lives, Keith sprinted towards his perceived salvation.\n\nSuddenly, an immense, awesome flash of flaring light overcame Keith's vision, and he was blinded. He did not care, for none who see the face of God shall live. Standing blindly in place, arms outstretched, he recited the verse to all who may hear it, "And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

It had been less than two hours since the White House was evacuated. Clyde, her husband, was gone, likely killed beneath rubble or turned into dust. All she was President of anymore was dust and a hundred million dead souls.\n\nWithout a word, she motioned for the guards to leave; she needed to be alone.

Find some bright side to this mess. She pondered for a moment, and realized that notion disgusted her. No, she would not speak to the nation. There would be no President to speak.\n\nReaching into the desk at which she sat, Smith retrieved a pen, paper, and a 1911 pistol. She always carried personal protection. Now it would achieve the antithesis of its purpose. Laying out the paper on her desk, she wrote a single sentence, placed the pen down, and pointed the pistol's barrel at her temple.\n\nAs the shot rang out through the Presidential Bunker, Secret Service kicked in the door of the President's office to find no killer, only a dead woman and a sheet of paper.

The Peacemaker brought together the people of the valley, showing them what they were doing to one another. He showed them the fields in which they buried their dead, rows upon rows of the aftermath of mothers burying sons, who themselves had interred their fathers, who had most likely mourned lost brothers.

Stupid, stupid decision.\n\nThe chanting druids dragged him closer to the water of the Glowing River, its namesake luminescence long since dimmed but no less deadly than it was long ago.

Once he drank it, he began his captivating narration.\n\n"Once, the freezing islands of Kanada were desolate, only ruled by the invaders from the south. As little as they liked to admit it, we roamed free, with little restraints. But our point of greatest glory came after the End, for while the rest of the world burnt down in flames, we thrived. One man, though, did the impossible... Where others saw a bleak future and no hope, he saw an opportunity. We never learnt his true name, but everyone called him the King.\n\nThe island of Kiqiktalukk was a barren land, not one that many saw as precious. The King, on the other hand, believed in it, and gathered the most powerful team of loyal soldiers. With no one to stand in the way of his dreams, the bases for an Empire of the North were slowly laid, piece by piece. Few would learn of the news for the first years, but the legend would spread, further and further, and all of Kanada would learn it. The King, through power and diplomacy, united everyone under his flag, and it seemed that there was nothing stopping him."\n\n"So what remains of his Empire?", asked one of the man's listeners. "Does the King live on? And how did you learn about this?"\n\nThe old man laughed. "No one can be sure if the Kingdom survives. The north is not a hospitable environment, and getting information, not to mention people, out of there is difficult.

This new world required new ways of thinking, new ways to find the real truth embedded beneath the skin. And where else better to discover the human psyche in this strange new world than in the marauder gangs that now dominated the wastes? The madness of organized violence, bloody and raw and fresh, would be unparalleled amongst his colleagues - and hopefully jet him into local fame.\n\nRaoul would go undercover in one of these gangs, seemingly joining up as a new budding member, in order to write about their lifestyle and how these violent men fit into today's times. It would be the piece that would best describe just what kind of world people were now living in. Before he was discovered as a fraud and was promptly stomped for his trickery, Raoul had managed to put a finger on just what drove these groups. Writing about it in his now infamous column, he stated the following:\n\n"The modern outlaw marches through life to the rhythms of some drum I could never hope to hear. They live on something that only those cut off from society, who have seen and lost it all, could live on. They call it The Edge, there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The marauders are the logical conclusion of the logic the bombs delivered us when they went off. Whilst we may dismiss them for their violent ways, the gangs are a logical product of the culture that now claims to be shocked at their existence. The bombs, and thus ourselves, are responsible for our current situation; it is actually these gangs who fight against this horrid status quo for any kind of hope for our future. We exist - but they are the only ones here who are truly alive.""

The most important of these images was the giant piece of artwork on the side of a building that had somehow survived the war, which the people called "The Face of the Great Hero Revolutionary".\n\nAccording to local myth, the unnamed being had fought off the destroyers of the island for long enough for a few of the inhabitants to survive the obliteration and now lived on through the image on this building. The island inhabitants would frequently make pilgrimages to the striking image, paying respect to the being who had apparently saved them from complete and utter destruction.

For many years, it seemed that they had been right, as the secrets of flight were lost, and the grounded aircraft of the LoftLin, the last clan of aviators, rusted away in obscurity.\n\nAnd then he came - the Visionary.\n\nHis name, lost to time, was never remembered - perhaps, as he once said, it did not matter just who he was. What is remembered in tones of hushed awe however, is how he arrived. He swept into Jose's Town, born aloft by a flying machine built from scrap, scattering onlookers with its noise and bluster. With a spark in his eye, he dismounted, bearing a locked chest. A chest, he said, that would allow all of Mankind to once more master the air, and never need to fear it again.\n\nHe bore the mantle of the Nasa, he said, the ancient air-born rulers of the stars above in the times Before. The treasures he had recovered from their ancient, fallen citadel in the Florides would bring the people of Tejas to fly once more - to conquer the stars themselves, as the Nasa had.\n\nThe peoples of Jose's Town, even after the passing of the Visionary, would learn to venerate the Nasa, and recover their ancient doctrine. From the Visionary's chest, passed down from Director to Director, they learned of heavier-than-air flight - of arcane equations and the laws of aeronautics, of metallurgy and safe flight regulation.\n\nAnd so, on one day in the hot summer of Tejas, attended by the priests of the new Nasa and a thousand spectators, the first jet engine of the post-atomic age screamed through the sky once more."

It was permanently tuned to a music station, of course (Big Joe didn't like to hear people talk), and played nothing but rock and roll all day every day, filling the silence as Big Joe set to work each morning.\n\nOne of those mornings, Big Joe's radio stopped working. He gave it a good smack--that usually worked to make it play again--but this time the problem didn't seem to be with the radio itself. He tried checking if anything else was playing, but couldn't find anything but static in every station he knew about. Shrugging, he figured he must just be out too deep in the woods. Nothing to be worried about. He inspected another candidate tree, decided it was good to go, and set to work prepping it to be cut down. He still had a long day and night ahead of him before he headed back to town tomorrow night."

 RAD_NA.73.desc: "The lands fertilized by the Peace River were always a place of calm and quiet. It is believed that throughout its existence, no war was ever fought in or over these lands, even as their farmland is some of the most productive in the world. It is fitting, then, that when the end times came, and so much of the rest of human civilization was scarred or extinguished by that pyromaniac's dream, the lands of Peace River were spared. The inhabitants continued on mostly as they always had, calmly making the most of the warm season to produce the greatest bounty of the Earth that they could from this prolific soil.\n\nA few changes were necessary, though. The political organization that had governed their society fell apart as a result of the physical destruction of most everyone involved in it. In its place, a new sort of social structure was developed, one that was perfectly suited to the conditions and the culture of the land it governed. A cooperative of farmers, trading crops and equipment amongst each other, and eagerly taking in migrants from more devastated lands to work the fields for fair pay. When the cold winds came and made the land unusable, everyone would come together to keep themselves warm and breathing all winter, sharing fuel, blankets and company to maintain good spirits throughout the stolen half of the farming year. And once the thaw came, it was right back to work, keeping the society of Peace River industrious, prosperous, and above all: peaceful."

As deadly and insufferable as other men can be, the most common thing to hurt and especially to kill a man is his own stomach and its unending hunger for food. While it's all well and good to have the idea of making yourself some food--everyone knows the basic idea of farming--it's another thing to have enough good land under guard to be able to devote yourself to tending it, and to have all the seeds and equipment needed for it to be productive enough to be worth defending. That's where Mr. Farrow and his contracts come in.\n\nIt's not for everyone. There's drawbacks, sure. The adventuring life appeals to some, wandering around trying to find some place that's worth staying. The smart ones find that place as soon as they can, through, and Farrow Farms is it. There aren't any assholes coming to try and steal your stuff, there aren't any crazy assholes coming to try and destroy your stuff, and there's everything you need to make farming actually worth it. Some folks would say that having to work twelve hours a day every day and not being allowed to leave is a dealbreaker. Those people can have their freedom; I'm happy having my life. Food to eat, water to drink and men with weapons to keep me safe is worth working.\n\nBesides, Mr. Farrow's son seems like the nice sort, the type of guy to lower the working day to eleven and a half hours once he takes over from his old man. Wouldn't that be something! I just hope my own son ends up being as hard a worker as I am. I'm gonna need the food he brings in once I'm too old for all this farming."

Told to have first been carried out in the old days, before the world's end made this land of theirs frigid and unsuitable to civilized life, the people eking out a meagre living from this tundra carry on this custom in memory of what once was possible. In this most frozen and inhospitable of environments, at the beginning of the cold season, every year, the people of this wasteland strip themselves of their warm furs, take to an open spot in the ice... and go swimming.\n\nThere is no self-destructive intent amongst the revellers. They proceed into the deathly cold waters with a sense of glee, confident that their compatriots will be there after they have emerged from the ice water to hold them in a warm embrace and save their lives from the shiver. Many amongst the number of those who participate do not even hold in their hearts the meaning of the ancient ritual they undertake in. To some, their plunge into the water symbolizes their determination to outlive the winter, to brazenly face the cold and emerge alive again at season's end, just as they did from a frozen lake at season's beginning. To others, it is a foolhardy gesture of personal strength, proof that they are local to the region, and that their living here has given them the fortitude to survive this trial.\n\nFinally, to the most insane among those participating, it is an act of recreation. Some of these bizarre people insist that they participate in the plunge merely for fun, seeing neither historical nor symbolic significance in this semi-suicidal act of self harm. They are the ones who smile the widest when they emerge from the water, and who laugh and strike poses as their bodies are lost beneath the white waters beneath the ice, minutes away from death should their friends fail to save them. It is this attitude which most permeates the site of the ritual, turning this event of much archival importance into little more than a jovial game to play with friends. Truly, the people of the northlands are a strange folk indeed."

The library had happened to be on the other side of few sturdier buildings from the direction the bomb landed, so the interior wasn't all that damaged. Most of the books were still readable, and the furniture inside was comfortable too. It was a great sort of place for an erudite like him to live out the end of his days.\n\nThe old man had always needed to wear glasses, and his eyesight had grown even further in his elder years. Thankfully, his corrective lenses were still intact, and he was effortlessly able to read the words of all his favorite tomes. Or, he was, until after he finished reading his first novel. As soon as he had to lean over to take a new book off the shelf, fate cruelly ordained that his frames fell from his face and onto the floor. He cried out in despair, taking the shattered glass into his hands, nearly blind without it why must life be so cruel, there was time now!\n\nThen, a thought came to his mind. There was an optometrist down the road. Shakily returning to his feet, the old man stumbled his way to the eye doctor's place, using his hands to help feel around and navigate his way there. Once inside, he grabbed the first test pair he could find on the wall. They weren't quite right for his eye, but they helped his sight just enough to find a pair that suited him better.

For one conservative family man in a region known by the mysterious name of 'the Panhandle', this dictatorial authority came from having enough friends with enough guns to keep the riff-raff away.\n\nThis benevolent self-style king of what was once a small Texas town, now called simply 'the Hill', ruled over his demesne with both a fist of iron and a glove of velvet. He treated his subjects to backyard barbecues, and the justice he administered to wrong-doers was neither cruel nor unusual, typically amounting to restituting the damage of one's crimes in payments of beer and propane to the victims.

He'd never had much of an education, and quickly found that the easiest way to get something for himself was to take it away from someone else. In other words, Jesse was a burglar, and it happened to be that he was in the middle of burglarizing a wealthy man's home on the day the world went mad.\n\nThe place was loaded with rich trinkets, like these sorts of places always were. The rich didn't like hiding that they were rich, and this man in particular obviously quite enjoyed showing it off. Jesse's bag was already full of a few month's wages worth of loot when he stumbled upon the holy grail, the homeowner's most prized possession. He wasn't quite sure what it was yet, but it had to be extremely valuable: why else would it be locked away behind a solid metal door in the basement? Luckily, Jesse was handy with a lock, even a good one, and it didn't take him more than fifteen minutes to get the door opened. Unfortunately, the moment he swung it open and stepped foot down on the first step leading into the basement, he heard another door open: the front door. Fuck.\n\nLocking the solid door behind him, Jesse snuck down the stairs, trying to be quiet. He thought the old man would be off on the town at this hour, like always; why did he have to break his routine on the one night he was getting burglarized? Jesse figured he could probably take him, but assaulting and maybe having to kill a man in his own home was the kind of crime that would get the police chasing him down like a hound. His best bet was to hide down here, wait for the man to fall asleep, and then sneak out again once it was safe. As fate would have it, though, the homeowner was in quite a rush. Jesse heard loud footsteps moving across the house, as though the man was running. He wondered what the urgency could be, and then heard the footsteps get closer. The man seemed to be heading for the basement! Panicking, Jesse took out his knife, switched off the lights, and found somewhere in the room to hide so he could ambush the man when he came down. There wasn't much down here, strangely, just a storage area filled with food and medicine, and a plain bedroom. Jesse slid underneath the bed, and that was when he felt the ground shake, as though an earthquake was going on. Only, there were no earthquakes in Maryland."

She was his father's husband, the aunt to his cousins; a coworker, a friend, a person like anyone else. An extra tear ran down John's cheek, for the sake of all the others who'd lost her and were not still alive to grieve. He he took a step back, composing himself. He began to examine all the other tombstones in the graveyard, sitting alongside his mother's. There were hundreds of them, thousands even. So many families rocked by the loss of a loved one, so many sons left without a mother.\n\nThere was so much death here. It had always been a sombre place, back before everything changed. Now that the world had gone to shit, it felt chillingly normal. There were as many corpses buried beneath John's feet as most anywhere else in the world where people stood the day the bombs dropped. Yet, despite this, it still felt sacred. It was still quiet. It reminded him of a time when death was not so ubiquitous, and when standing on someone's ashes was something sanctified, instead of something standard.

It was a cool night, just windy enough to keep the bayou's bugs away, and the sky was clear and full of stars that lit it up like a painting. The water was calm and silent beneath the boat, and Marty was more at peace than he could ever remember. It was a perfect night to forget about the state the world was in.\n\nEarlier in the night he'd watched the sun go down, back when a different bottle of his had been empty. Now, looking up at the night sky, he felt introspective, thinking about all the mistreatment he'd been giving his body every day. He hadn't eaten a proper meal in a few days now, just the snacks he had stashed aboard the riverboat. The drugs probably didn't help him either. Or the booze, for that matter, but that he knew he'd never give up. It was every day that he found himself worrying about the state he was in--more often than he worried for world, actually, even though he knew that it was doing worse than he was, the bender he was still on be damned.\n\nHe leaned over the edge of the boat, reading the lettering on the side upside down. Marty probably wasn't in the right state of mind to be able to figure out what something written upside down said right now, but thankfully these were the words he had committed to memory: 'Cajun Queen'. He laughed when he read them, an old song he'd always loved coming to his mind. It made him happy at first, but then he remembered the way things were when he had last listened to it. He tossed his empty bottle off the boat, waiting to watch it splash into the murky water below before he headed for the boat's controls. It was time to sail away from his heartache again."

Whether it was blackjack or the races, anywhere he could find a place to bet his money, he did. There was just one problem with all that, besides the moral laxity required of Jack to conduct himself in such a way: he was a god awful gambler, and had quickly found himself entirely out of money, and deep in debt.\n\nNow, for all his incompetence as a better, Jack was quite a sly man. He'd found ways to keep the loan sharks off his back for quite awhile, spinning a different yarn to each one of them about how he'd pay them back soon enough. One he told he was close to having enough and would just need his next month's paycheck (he didn't have a job). To another he was about to accept a sizable inheritance (he didn't have any family). To a third, he offered a favor he never thought he'd have to conduct to earn himself some leniency. Every day he washed his hands an extra time to clean off the guilt of that favor.\n\nNow, though, Jack was out of favors. He was out of excuses. He was also still out of money. The loan sharks were all angling for a different one of his limbs, and Jack knew he'd have to skip town if he wanted to keep himself all in one piece. He was about to make his escape on the day the bombs dropped.\n\nIt all worked out quite well for Jack. When it all happened he had the good luck to be in his basement scrounging for some useful trinkets to pawn for cash before he took off. He stuck around in there for as long as he could before ascending into the post-nuclear wasteland above, finding it just safe enough to quickly make his way out of above ground. The thought occurred to him as he journeyed, suitcase in tow, that his loan sharks probably died along with the work.

Headed by charismatic preacher Robert Chambers, the fringe cult split from mainstream Evangelical Christian churches as a result of its belief in the imminent apocalypse. The Brotherhood became mildly popular in the state in the years preceding planet Earth's thermonuclear obliteration, proclaiming that the anger of God would rain down from the sky in the form of hellfire, targeted against mankind for its toleration of interracial marriage.\n\nOn the day the world died, Robert Chambers was conducting a sermon in his church in rural southwestern North Dakota, teaching his flock that as long as America continued to be a country of miscegenation and social disharmony, it would not be spared the fury of God. The day's first prayer was not yet finished when American nuclear missile silos, located only a scant few miles away from Chambers and his church, were activated, sending their weapons up and into the sky far above the devoted. It took until the beginning of that day's final prayer for the retaliatory warheads of the Reich to arrive within range of the church, detonating their payloads a short distance away from the Brotherhood of the End, at the site of the now empty American silos. Of the attended, only Robert Chambers himself, gazing in the direction of the congregation, towards the open doors of the church behind them, was able to catch the blinding flash of their annihilation.\n\nHe interrupted his prayers for the occasion, shielding his eyes and exclaiming excitedly, "I knew it!"

He had his trusty bow already at his side and an arrow in the other hand, ready to be fitted and fired for the kill at any time. It would only take a few more steps to be in the optimal range, but even so, the experienced hunter took his time to avoid scaring his target. As he carefully moved into the final position, his foot caught on something, something heavy, and he fell ignominiously onto the hard ground. The Buck bolted.\n\nThe hunter grunted in agitation, then turned around to examine what had caused him to fail in his hunt. At first all he saw was the same leaf-covered canvas the rest of the ground appeared to be, but as he began to sift through the piles of now disturbed foliage, his hands found purchase on a most peculiar instrument. It was very oddly shaped, with what appeared to be a grip of some kind towards the back, a long tube extending outward from the front and a curved block of wood from behind. He had never seen anything like it before. Out of curiosity, he brought it up so that the block rested on his shoulder. It felt surprisingly natural, but the hunter still had his doubts about the odd object. In front of the handle was a curved lever of some kind. With some apprehension, the hunter pulled it back.\n\nAn explosion deafened his hearing as a force pushed his entire body backwards several feet. He stumbled and dropped to his knees, his limbs shook like plants in a storm. What was this contraption? He looked toward where he had pointed it, and his eyes widened in shock as he observed that in a tree that had been in the same direction, a smoking hole had appeared. It seemed that this unusual creation had some sort of power to destroy at a level even his bow couldn't match. But so what? It was clumsy, far too clumsy for a hunter of his skill. The noise it emitted had likely alerted all living creatures within the forest, and what use was a weapon that fought back when used? A most unhelpful tool indeed, it seemed to this veteran hunter."

It was thanks to the selfless act of that now almost certainly dead man that he was able to evacuate his Sunday school program. And now, one of those children was missing.\n\nHe ran down the school's hallway as fast as his old legs would carry him, praying with each step that he would find the boy in time. Another student had told the Bishop that James had gone back for something. Was it worth dying over? Obviously not, but the boy was only six after all, nuclear war wasn't something someone his age would easily process. He had almost given up when he found the child, standing nervously in the doorway, seeming as lost and out of place as a frightened calf.

Also unlikely.\n\nHis search continued to net him more oddities, more smothered fires. A further day of searching found him at the entrance of what he guessed to have been an automobile factory. As he opened the door tentatively, he held his gun up, ready for any lurking man or beast. The gun clattered to the floor, its owner forgetting all about it as he stood, mouth agape, at the last thing he would have expected. It was a garden, grown in the crumbled floor of the factory was a well tended garden. It was more than just a natural reclamation of nature, he could sense that. Someone had spent countless hours to create this. A garden of green within a garden of crumbling concrete and rusting steel. He did not enter into that garden, it seemed so pure, almost holy.

Still, this forlorn, tattered group marched on, staking everything on a whisper of a rumor of a legend. A New Canaan.

In those six days, two of the group had passed from hunger, giving up their rations for the remaining children, a last act of heroic sacrifice.\n\nThe sign was dilapidated, only a few letters were visible, an 'S' here, a 'C' there, nothing more than those small clues. But it wasn't the sign that mattered; it was who was under it. Standing directly under the sign was a man, the gun in his hand pointing down to the ground passively.

He tried to search for some meaning in the madness as a second and then a third evil cloud appeared in the distance, but nothing came to him. No deeper meaning, no inherent truth or noble wisdom on the nature of man.

In a marvelous display of the magic the Templemasters loved to fawn over, the object was able to contain a memory of a long dead Ancestor, and if this vessel really was from the time just before the Sundering, then it was possible that the voice of a man hundreds of years dead was about to be heard.\n\n"...as stated previously, as captain of this ship, I was given direct orders to fire my nuclear ordinance.

I understand that this is a futile gesture, even if we disobey the order, other missiles and bombs will already be well on their way. Nevertheless, I can not participate in this madness..."\n\nThat was all that could be recovered from the Black Box, perhaps the magic had waned in strength over the years. What confused the Aquisitioner was the reference to 'nukes', some type of spell possibly? The Templemasters had never said anything that would fit with that theory, on the contrary, they had always claimed the Ancestors had ascended to a higher plane that only devotion to the Temple could replicate. Even if he could not understand all of the message, it seemed to contradict the Temple's doctrine significantly. He would need to investigate further, and then what?

In his personal fiefdom of Virginaland he worked his armies hard and his slaves harder still. A coward and a bully, he would not have been where he was without his personal supply of Fire Spear, strange objects that were prized across the lands of Usa for their ability to utilize the power of the Before to lay any opponent to waste. Through clever tricks and deals, along with outright theft, the Baron had managed to accumulate a large stash of these powerful artifacts which he used to exact tribute and to police the slaves in his territory.\n\nAlways the type of man to personally abuse those he had power over, the Baron was fond of personally overseeing the slave labor he had mandated, and although he was outnumbered hundreds to one by those with every desire to see him as a corpse, the awe-inspiring power held by even one Fire Spear caused them to keep their resentment in check.\n\nIt was on one of these sadistic excursions that the Baron's luck finally came to a spectacular end. As he accosted one of the "underperforming" slaves, as was his usual, the recipient of his abuse decided that living in such a situation was bearable no longer. Fist connected to jaw, and the Baron tumbled backwards with a stream of curses and profanity. As he pulled himself back to his feet, he leveled his Spear at the defiant slave. The other slaves let out a mix of gasps and groans, already beginning to mourn the death of their rebellious brother. The Baron smiled defiantly as he activated the Spear and... nothing. The Spear did not smite the slave at all, who stood in equal measure surprised and furious. More attempts to activate the Spear failed; he did not notice the others forming a circle around him. It dawned on the Baron that he was in a very unfortunate position, but before he could attempt to flee, they had hold of him."

The crumbling ruins of what was once civilization, of buildings said to have reached the clouds, added a bland mundaneness to Fred's excursions that made the long walks a tiring experience on both body and mind. Doubtless any other person, whose heart and soul was not thoroughly committed to this appointed task, would have given up long ago. But not Fred. His mission was not done for any selfish material need or narrow-minded short-term gain. It was for the history of his people, and what the future entails for them.\n\nMother told him, once, that there was a time when people of their ilk faced unthinkable terror at the hands of so-called "civilisation". That people like himself, his Mother and Father were discriminated "others" in the old world. But this atrocity was said to have come to a dramatic conclusion before the bombs dropped, before the slate was wiped fully clean. That people had made their last stands, written about their struggles for the whole world to see.\n\nBefore she died, Mother had given him one simple task to grant him much-needed purpose in a lonely and scorched Earth: to find the works of those who challenged the barbarity of past civilisations and ensure their brutalities never happen again. She had taught him well -- he was granted had a list of people whose works he needed to find. One day, she said, he shall teach the histories found in these books to future communities and, through the power of memory and reclamation, bring hope to those who had lost it.\n\nSearching through the rubble was an exhausting process that bore little fruit. All he had found in his travels so far were a myriad of items, some he recognised from his mother's education, yet many more simply incomprehensible. However, just when all seemed fruitless, he at last found what he was looking for in a drawer pried open. It was the first time he had found an item on his mother's list. A sudden burst of ambition coursed through Fred's veins as his hands felt the front cover; finally, he had done Mother proud. The rest will be found in due time, and by God they will be read.\n\nThe book was slightly tattered, but Fred could read its title clearly. Its bold print marked a clear set of eye-catching words.

 RAD_NA.92.t: "Nature Endures" # Hooked Up
 RAD_NA.92.desc: "Ages ago, humankind fought an unending war with the very nature that it inhabited. The humans of the world in those ancient days would use and abuse the environment around them for their own depraved ends, caring nothing for the disastrous consequences their selfishness wrought-both for themselves, and for the other living, feeling beings around them. Mighty, verdant forests were cut down and burned to smolders, innocent animals of all kinds were tracked down to be savagely murdered, and great holes were carved out of the Earth by our simple-minded, primitive forebears, in a useless search for the worthless treasures they thought could be found beneath their feet. Evidently, whatever treasures they found were not enough to save them.\n\nThis age of war that scars our history was called 'civilization', and the Old Mothers tell us that it lasted hundreds of years, entire generations of humans living and dying only to be used as soldiers in the unscrupulous designs of the great foe that led humanity in that era: industrialists. The industrialists waged their campaign of civilization against the forces of nature with cruelty more extreme than any human alive could imagine; in the span of one lifetime, a landscape as far as the eye could see could be changed from a state of perfect equilibrium under the rule of nature, into a hellish nightscape of civilization. Where once stood a tranquil forest, all that would be left would be patches of grass, imprisoned and kept alive by their human masters as a symbol of status and prestige. So decadent were the industrialists that they would pride themselves on which of their kind could imprison the most nature, competing with each other over who could be most spiteful as to dementedly torture the greatest quantity of what was once undisturbed woods. Some of these sickening fiends would seek even greater perversions, turning nature itself into a tool of propagating civilization, perverting nature's gifts to sustain the disease of civilization. These most hedonistic and toxic acts went by a name that only the most brave among us deign to speak aloud: agriculture. The Old Mothers tell us that this unholy rite was what first brought our people away from the true path, and it is this depravity above all others that must never be repeated again.\n\nOf course, the effete and extravagant rule of the industrialists over humankind could not last. Their civilization system was too unstable and too dependent on the bounty earned by its conquest of nature to ever achieve the balance needed to last the ages. As civilization reached a critical mass, holding as its possession more of the Earth than was left for nature, the loot from further conquests became insufficient for civilization to sustain itself. The industrialists turned on each other, fighting with and sometimes even intentionally killing other humans over which method of conquering nature was most efficient, and how Earth's remaining riches ought to be divided. This infighting, the Old Mothers say, was the last act that ended the age of civilization. Using the weapons they fashioned for themselves from the hellish, arcane powers beneath the surface of Earth, they turned on each other and destroyed one another's industry, forgetting their common cause against nature and allowing the mother of Earth a reprieve from the industrialist banditry.\n\nMost of the humans who did not perish returned to nature, and would in the coming generations be educated by the wisdom of the Old Mothers. Teaching us to live off the land and to respect our fellow inhabitants of Earth, the Old Mothers brought us back from the brink of extinction, enabled by nature's grace to keep us alive. So great is nature's love for us that even after we would come as close as we could to slaying her, she could forgive us, and allow us to continue to hold a humble place in her great kingdom. Nature has given us mercy, the Old Mothers say, and we would be wise never to follow down the same path again that had once brought us so close to our end as a species. For, if we do, nature might not extend the gift of mercy a second time."

The poor girl was nearly spent but butter was liquid gold in these times. Not a drop was going to waste.\n\nThe Nussbaums understood life was hard for the "English" nowadays, but a hard life was the only life they'd ever known. They never knew the power grids of the world had failed until panicked English came to tell them. Same went for the cities going up in rubble. The crop failures, the cancers, those had hit their community hard, but all they had to do in the end was scale back. The furniture trade struggled for a while with the tree losses, but resilient pines in red forests had adapted and the business was starting to come back to life.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest change, and the worst to hit the English, was that hard work suddenly became far more valuable than it once had. But for the Nussbaum's and their community, hard work was all they had ever known. Since their forefathers had been expelled to this continent in ages long past, their days were filled with hard work. Only sleeping, eating and praying would ever interrupt their labors.\n\nWhile studying his Bible with Sarah that night, he reflected on a passage in Proverbs: "He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding." The English followed many such men. Charming suits that preached a world of hatred. They thus received in turn what they asked for. As for the Nussbaums, they tilled this earth then and now.

That legacy, that great tradition of scholarship, never faltered, even as the world was Cleansed. Even now, The Holy Kingdom produces the only art worth even being aware of in all the Great Sands.\n\nDuring my time in the Holy Kingdom, I was under the tutelage of the Pact of the Rat, a group descended from His disciples, dedicated to upholding the great power of the Music of the Lounge. I was selected from a young age to learn and spread His wondrous music across the Great Sands, and beyond.\n\nAnd that, child, is why my skin is so tan; my hair so dark. I come from the land where the sun reminds us daily of the Cleansing as its light scorches the sand. The land where the Death Riders made their final stand in the days after the Cleansing. I am not from here, this land of cold winters and colder hearts. You call it Nunangat; I call it Hell frozen over. But I am thankful that the priests sent me to your people. They have given me the most wonderful opportunity to spread His good word to this land of ice and snow. Child, know this. So long as there is music, so long as there are people left to make music, His Holiness of the Lounge will be there to watch over us. You may not take His message into your heart this day, but you will take His music into your ear. Hark, child, and strike drum. Today is the day you hear His word for the first time."

In the chaos of the present times, it seemed he could not even do that. They had, one by one, been taken ill over the course of the weeks, with only a few young members of the family now remaining on the mortal coil. The memories of their relatives became more and more forgotten by Adam's children with each passing day. It was too much to take, to see - to know - he was starting to forget what once was. Yet he could not stand for it. He would not stand for it. As Adam awoke from his slumber and attempted to shake off the hangover, he set himself on a mission. To travel back to his family home and find remembrance.\n\nWhat he saw there, when he finally arrived, saddened him deeply. A brightly coloured house once stood on those grounds. Now, it was little more than rubble and ruins. Adam ignored his quailing heart, forcing himself to an unnatural calm. His family's legacy was at stake here. Gritting his teeth he forced himself to dig through the rubble with his bare hands in search of something... anything! He clawed and he scratched through the rubble, his hands bleeding in search of some kind of item. When he finally found something, he could barely contain his joy.\n\nBuried deep in the rubble was a photograph that now lay in Adam's bloody hands.

White gravestones gradually disappeared under the green and brown of the ground their graves had been dug into.

It was small, near the coast and seemed to contain some very impressive albeit unusual examples of pre-Imperial architecture. The style, as you know, favours high, round windows and curves decorated with non-Euclidean geometries.\n\nThe people seemed amicable enough, though wary of strangers in a way that suggested not the cool fear of a typical Roader but the hot, sharp fear of a mangy dog who hears the twang of an arrow in the distance.

 RAD_SA.5.desc: "Nobody in the village called him by his name anymore, simply "el Último." The last one. After Doña Ramirez died twelve years ago, he became the only man in the village who knew what life before the Great War was like. Although he was born and raised in the village, he had left it several times when he was a young man. Whenever the children would ask, he would always tell of the cities he visited: Oaxaca, Querétaro, Veracruz, he could spend hours describing the sights and sounds to the little niños. But their favorite story was the time he traveled to Ciudad de México and his father bought him ice cream from a street vendor. That was the story that always got the kids riled up, and they would grill him with questions late into the night: what did it taste like? How did they keep it so cold? Do you still have the wrapper?\n\nBut now, the children would hear his stories no more. El Último passed away in his sleep last night. His many friends and family were gathered in his house, holding a wake for him in his small parlor. While they knew that he lived a long and happy life, they could not shake the feeling that there was something momentous and uniquely tragic about his passing."

It had sounded so great back home, as he had regaled them with legends of a land that escaped the bombings; a "Paris of the Tropics", as he called it, which had been untouched by the flames of war. It was a city in the middle of an entire continent no one hated enough to destroy, and if the men came with Bissonette, it would be theirs to plunder.\n\nAfter an arduous voyage, they had reached a tropical shore. By slowly hacking through the jungle, they battled their way up the great river. They reached a dilapidated small settlement, San Tar Aim. The few inhabitants left in that place signalled, in a language a shipmate from the lands once known as Iberia partly understood, that the great lost city they searched for was a long distance ahead. Therefore, they pressed on, battling currents and terrible tropical diseases along the way. For many miles, the only thing keeping the men from turning back was the fear that the way back was longer than the way forward. However, after all the struggling, and with only a quarter of their original expedition left, they made it.\n\nIt was beautiful. The city was far from full, but there was not a ruin in sight. The land was green with palm trees and crowds gathered to meet the strangers arriving on their shore. The bewildered and beleaguered expeditioners were received in open arms, and were quickly tended to with a great feast shortly after their arrival.\n\nThey came to this place, Man House, searching for plunder to take home. To their shock, what they sought was freely given to them. They learned then that they didn't need to take what they'd found home, because they had found a new home.\n\nFrom then on, the men decided, instead of coming and destroying the town, to stay and help the city. After all, who would want to leave paradise?"

Families slain, towns torched, brothers slaying brothers -- and for what? Competing interests? Old grudges? Few understood the cause for violence, as a generation was embroiled in a reality of raids and murder in a senseless war between two settlements.\n\nYet as one generation passed, and a new generation disgruntled with conflict came to lead, the age of war began to give way to one of thaw. The raids came to a halt, and the deaths came to a near stop. With this mending of relations came a renewed era of growth. No longer did the farmers have to fear for their crops. No longer did the merchants have to take extensive and expensive protection measures to ensure their safety in their travels.\n\nAfter much effort, the two settlements grew ever closer. Conflict came to a halt, as the bonds between these long-separated brothers began to strengthen. Bonds evolved into official ties, as the governing bodies of the settlements continued to integrate their societies.\n\nAnd with a handshake, a confederation was formed. A unification of settlements under one purpose. Those who were once so embroiled in conflict, now joined together as partners in a union. Their confederation would become a model for so many, as others sought to take part in the benevolent union of cities. As the union grew and its borders expanded far beyond the confines of the two settlements, the bonds between the brothers and sisters of the two cities grew ever stronger, and not even the long march of time could break the bonds between them."

Though some errant cities and airbases in the region tasted the flame, the calculations and strategies of the great powers' generals had seen little benefit in scorching the remote and useless lands of the barren mountains. And so the slopes went untouched, feeling only the gentle sun-kiss of distant thermonuclear blasts.\n\nAnd in time these mountains would become home to a mighty kingdom.\n\nThe people of this kingdom had once been called 'Sherpa', the people of the east. In a world gone to flame, nobody knew what exactly they were to the east of, so the name would ultimately become obsolete. They had once been scouts, nomads, traders, using their centuries of experience with the mountains to eke out a living amongst the more settled folk. It would be these skills that would transform them into the rulers of the heavens.\n\nUnconstrained by the old states that kept them down, the Sherpas would create a nation that linked the two sides of Asia separated by the great mountains, utilizing their unique knowledge of the mountains to guide traders through otherwise impassable terrain. As wealth from the other new kingdoms flowed through their lands, the Sherpas became the dominant force in the mountains, driving trade and commerce across the continent. Their markets became forces in their own right, and then competitors, and finally behemoths of trade greater than the sum of their rivals.\n\nAt the base of Jomolangma, a great capital would be built that would cement the power of the men of the mountains. In time, they would cease to be known as the people of the east and would take the name that most of the envious nations would call them. They were therefore and forever known as the Nāmpa - the people of the sky."

Every man has his own name for these taciturn idols: Protector, They-Who-Watch, Aringara. Whatever the moniker, the empire reveres them as its patron gods, its guardian spirits come to protect them from their abodes in Paradise.\n\nHow fate has twined this great people and their protector-idols together is a tale handed faithfully from father to son, generation to generation, eventually written down in oldensheet by the empire's first scribes. Though time and human fault have muddied the finer details of the story, its broad brushstrokes remain universally the same:\n\nIt is said that their ancestors, once members of a great many tribes, sought refuge from the Crimson Days in a tiny island. As blues became whites and reds from fire and blood for a hundred days and a hundred nights, the island remained unblemished by either. Its people rejoiced at their good fortune; when they sought the cause, all turned to tall, stern visages made of stone. Ancient power, its old elders said, seeped from their chiseled orifices, effusing the island with a powerful barrier that steered volcano-arrows away from the island. Thus did the people craft facsimiles of their guardians, so to bring their protective powers with them.\n\nAges have passed and civilizations born of this tiny island have since risen and fallen, but gratitude for their forebears' protectors remains strong. One cannot walk the streets of Moaiaki without tiny heads of wood, stone and metal gazing at them from houses and shops.

More than the labor of men's hands, or their riches, traditions and ideas are made of sturdier material than otherwise sturdy creations. One such tradition, born since the days of the First Emperor they said, unfolds before his eyes.\n\nAt last, the golden pavilion had opened, unveiling the pristine visage of his liege. They all bowed in reverence to the last man. His Majesty stood up and calmly stepped forth, old paper on hand, before unrolling it and delivered a simple address.

Since the early days of the old world this had remained unchanged.\n\nUntil, that is, the new world laid claim to their home.\n\nVast populations of a previously unknown people flooded into the fertile coastal lands in search of a new home - and a new home was what they found. They arrived in such numbers that they quickly came to dwarf the local population. Simply referred to as "The Outsiders" by the locals, their strange culture rapidly hold of the lands. Within a brief matter of time, entire cities had been established by these people, as the vast fertile lands began to be cultivated by their farmers.\n\nWithin the blink of an eye, a civilization all but alien to the locals had popped into existence.

And when the people were once more sufficiently numerous, Pestilence would resume his walk amongst them.\n\nIt would begin in the southern jungles. Men would fall sick and feverish, dying horribly days later from open lesions that would not cease bleeding no matter what. By the time those further up the trade route heard the terrible tales, they too would already have fallen ill. Before anyone realized what was happening, the disease spread far and wide. People lay dying in their homes, at their businesses, in the streets. Even Nihon and the distant Indus did not escape the wrath of the plague, burning through urban and rural climes, through rich and poor alike. It would come to be known as the Red Silence, and to all the nations it was as if the world was coming undone once again.\n\nAnd just as quickly as it came, the Silence would fade away. The dead would be given their due respects where possible, and once more society would rebuild. And this time the destruction was not absolute, for disease can kill a nation's populace but it might leave untouched the nation's institutions. For a time, food would be numerous, wealth would be redistributed, and even the common serf would find himself time to stop, sit and consider his place in the world.

With nothing but the clothes on his person and the sack on his back, he ventured a great distance along winding paths of stone -- just as the elder instructed.\n\nLam-ang's tribe was one of many hundreds scattered across the Seven Thousand Isles. They had their own memories that run far before the day Kaptan had struck the Old World in His righteous anger. As the blue sky flashed orange and thunder clapped where there were no clouds, searing heat torched the barriers that had kept old grudges at bay. Countless moons had passed since the Kamatayan brought the past to an end, yet the peoples that now live atop its corpse seemed insistent on bringing its dead conflicts with them.\n\nWith the need to wage war comes the need for food and weapons, and with the need for food and weapons comes the need for strong men. For Lam-ang's tribe, only the strongest would suffice, and so the elder decreed: any boy who wishes to become a man must first journey to the Karaang Gubat and retrieve a relic of the elder's choosing. Only when he returns with it will the elder acknowledge him as a man of the tribe. Lam-ang was tasked to find a banner of blue and red, with yellow stars on a field of white.\n\nEventually, after traversing hills and streams and dense brush, he finally found the Matandang Gubat. None of the songs prepared Lam-ang for the sight before him: what he thought was an old village was instead tall pillars of stone and metal as far as the eye can see. Brushing aside the last vestiges of fear and doubt, the boy began the arduous task of finding the proof of his manhood among the ruins his ancestors had left behind."

The Old Man is grouchy in the manner of all convalescent elderly, but there is work to be done: the tea-stand must be set up, the leaves and water boiled to the right temperature, the banner unfurled.\n\nWhen the young girl is bored with the Old Man's calls to clean this or that, she sneaks off, as she is wont to do, into the woods. Once or twice she has found great silvery rust-red machines in the wilderness, with faded insignia on them in blood-red and white. But what they were meant to build or destroy she cannot tell. Today she finds nothing, so she heads to a clearing on the edge of a hill: there she has found something new to watch.\n\nThere is a great space in the plain below, and on it lies a tangle of twisted white and grey stone and metal stretching in all directions, rectangular and messy. Traces of jagged stone still show in places in the ruins, and the roads still retain their blackness. In the skyline there are one or two jagged fingers, and the girl likes to imagine that she is there, in the fingers' vast spaces, touching the sky and flying in the great-wings the Old Man tells her about when he is drunk. But the plain of scrambled-wreckage never comes to life, and she heads home at dusk. Whatever this once was, it is dead as picked-clean bones now.\n\nShe passes a road sign as she returns on the broken road, fingers the sign's strange pattern, and wonders what Y K HAM 25 KM means.

The monks whispered that the creatures on the other side of the sea had barely been human in the first place - what was the point of trading with near-animals?\n\nHe settled upon the creative use of mythology to persuade the Lordship of the expedition's importance. With the merchants he had agreed to pool funds with, Miyazaka and Mitsu, the young merchant appeared at the Province Court with a set of very expensive scrolls. All were pre-War, and all were written in the strange flowing set of characters whose interpretation had been lost to time. Some suspected it had something to do with the strange shapings of names in the tongues of the land, and how some namings with the same meanings were said in entirely different ways in court or marketplace. This was Ishiguro's lead: the Lordship was many things, but above all he was curious.\n\nThe Lordship listened patiently to the merchants' promise to return not just with wealth, but with the keys to understanding where the Forgotten Words had come from - and the power that came with reclaiming forgotten names. He agreed to fund the provisioning and the armaments for a convoy of five ships, to be sent to the lands beyond the Southern Diamond.\n\nMonths passed. Ishiguro now sat on the deck, watching the emerald landline in the distance grow ever closer. Details magnified and clarified, and became rivers and mountains and the sparkle of life.

The mood of the men of the great institute was ecstatic as their Divine Heart came alive, its essence sustained by a carefully choreographed disintegration of the elements. The power contained within was comparable to that of the gods, enough to sustain the entire realm perhaps, enough to usher in a new golden era of peace, knowledge and progress for a thousand years and more.\n\nAs the men cheered, an almost imperceptible chill came over one of the researchers. An ancient, unbidden ancestral memory of a power that promised peace but brought only suffering unto untold ages. The man shuddered at the implication of the power that mortals had now been granted. Could men be trusted with the power of divinity? Did they even deserve it? And even if they did, would they use it wisely?\n\nAnd yet where there was fear, there remained great hope. Hope for not just the islands that were their home, but for every man, woman and child of the earth.

The slopes were covered by pockmark-like craters, while the eastward edge suddenly caved away close to the peak, as if a giant had taken a jagged bite out of the mountain itself. The pristine snow capping the summit accentuated the wounds gouged into the mountain against the cloudless sky.\n\nThe shrine priests had said ruefully that the mountain was the broken spirit of their ancestors, the Japanese, before the spears of light and flame had fallen from the sky, turning night into brilliant day and then an even longer twilight. Presumably, the spears had also defaced the mountain, scarring the spirit of the ancestors in the priests' legends and myths.\n\nFrom time to time, the villager would wonder what the mountain and world looked like when both were still whole. Relics of that time could be found just beneath the surface of the ash plains: a broken blade here, a cylindrical metal skeleton there, or the husk of a treaded iron tortoise, asleep in the soil. Many would bear a set of characters that the priests translated as "IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY, TAKIGAHARA GARRISON."\n\nThe villager shuddered. Despite its utopian abundance, the world that came before didn't seem to be a particularly enviable one, if its inhabitants devoted so much time and energy to killing each other. How perfect could the spirit of a people so consumed by war actually be?\n\nNo, the mountain was what it had always been. If it was the spirit of the villager's ancestors (and by extension, the villager himself), then any mention of scars or brokenness rang hollow. It was certainly not flawless - the giant's bite was too obviously unnatural - but it had weathered what terrible cataclysm that had annihilated his ancestors. Where only rusting relics bore witness to the warlike hubris of generations past, the mountain continued its stark repose, forever changed by the world's passing but renewed in its wake.\n\nIt was a clear winter's day, bordering on the cusp of spring.

When his friends turned their back to go play with junk and his parents went off to work in the fields, Xue would ply travelers for their stories until they finally broke and spilled their tales. Often, they would be mundane. A friend they knew disappeared in the sea to the east, or they knew someone who knew someone who had seen terrible things in the old palaces. The usual old stuff. Occasionally, however, Xue would hear someone talk of the west, and of the empires unknown, and of men with five eyes and four fingers.

He brought the man back to his family's cottage, where his family took him in, feeding him until his cheeks were no longer hollow and mending his strange clothes. As he rested, Xue began asking him a torrent of questions. Where was he from, who did he travel with, and what laid in the west? The man gave simple answers. He came from a great desert, over the mountains and on a road thousands of li long. Xue was fascinated, and the man was happy to oblige him.\n\nEventually, of course, the man had to leave. Xue begged and pleaded with his parents to let him go with him, but they needed their son on the field. When the time came for him to leave, Xue snuck out of the house and followed him down the side of the trail, hiding in the trees. When he was far away enough from the house, he made his presence known. The traveler was not surprised; adolescence had instilled foolish actions in him, too, when he was Xue's age. Nevertheless, he was not one to turn down such a boy, and let him follow along. The father awoke that morning see his son's bed empty. He knew where Xue had gone, and the family mourned. Even if he was not dead, he was as well as such.\n\nThe boy, on the long road over the mountains, witnessed palaces of the gods of an unimaginable size.

 RAD_EA.17.desc: "Another day, another mission the islanders impose on themselves, to save a few poor souls. Ever since the great explosions on the Big Seven, the islands unfortunate enough to be attacked by a mysterious force, the heroic crew had done nothing but work night and day for the good of the archipelago.\n\nThe job was simple. The journey began from the base, and the small fleet of wooden rafts based on traditional designs set sail before the sun rose. It was not hard to make them, although by the time resources got scarcer. Navigation techniques were well-known; they were spread in the Ocean millennia before everything changed, and the great explosions would not change that. Once they headed out into the sea, they simply had to reach an island and rescue as many people to bring to the safe havens they resided in. However, this day was different.\n\nAll the crew was tired as they approached one of the Big Seven. Sweat ran down their bodies, and waves crashed on the small boat. The weather was bad, real bad. It was not a good way to launch the largest operation yet, a rescue mission in one of the Big Seven themselves. Despite that, the sailors continued, and reached the coast by the afternoon. For hours and into the night, they would work endlessly, with their goal to evacuate as many civilians as possible. They boarded the large rafts made for them in panic, and screams could be heard as they fled the smoldering ruins, battling to get on the boats first.\n\nBut the boats were not enough. The island was big, and before the fires the foreigners had made it into a bustling town, one that could not be carried across the waters of the sea. The locals who were not quick enough broke into tears as the boats departed, with the captains making vague promises to return. But they never did. The island remained in isolation for centuries, and no one would be coming to save them."

People had begun to lose count of the days ever since the great mutiny that expelled the vessels commanders.\n\n"No Gods, No Masters comrades. We are our own people out here on the free territory that is the seas!" The Captain said rather excitedly. The rest of the crew gave out some polite applause as per usual and then got on with things. There was almost a certainty amongst the crew that the man who deemed himself captain of the vessel, after the officers overthrow, had little to no clue what he was actually going on about. He seemed to have just borrowed some slogans from a book he managed to pick up somewhere, in order to give himself some kind of authenticity.\n\nHis likely bullshit rhetoric about "the true freedom of the seas" did not however, raise the ire of the crew. The wannabe revolutionary was far better than the God-forsaken officers who wanted the crew to carry on with "wartime activities" as if it weren't plainly blatant that the war was over. The so-called Captain was also a damn good navigator and was entrusted to keep the crew going in search of food and eventually, one day, find a place to settle down. Home seemed long gone now, with most of the men aboard the ship deciding to move on with their lives. Thus, with there being no better choice soon arising, they all followed the Captains lead deeper into the ocean.\n\n"It's a true life of freedom we seek fellow comrades." the Captain said once more to the rather bored looking crew. "With ourselves at the helm, no-one can ever hope to destroy what we have created here.""

 RAD_EA.19.desc: "Riku led a lonely and meaningless life. He would dress up each day in a bland, dark grey suit to make his way to a job he hated that contributed nothing meaningful to society. His career was stalled, trapped serving under a boss who had only been promoted above him because of nepotism. His free time, which barely existed, consisted mostly of napping and going for walks in the park; walks in which Riku would look solemnly upon the happy people playing with their dogs, lamenting that his basic apartment did not allow any pets. Riku was depressed, and all he wanted was the kind of love and companionship a small animal could unconditionally provide.\n\nThat all changed when it happened. Riku was in his shower at the time, crying silently, and all he felt of the nuclear apocalypse was the ground shaking beneath his feet. Assuming it to be a minor earthquake, Riku didn't even leave the shower for another ten minutes, savouring the time he had to mourn the death of his soul. When he did finally finish his evening shower, getting dressed to the sound of his neighbours being entirely too disruptive with their yelling, he took a sleeping pill and went to bed to dream about a better life.\n\nIn the morning, it didn't take him very long to notice the world had ended. The crowds that always filled the street with cramped bodies were gone, and also most of the city was covered in scorch marks and burnt skeletons. Riku had only one thought on his mind: if society was dead, surely his apartment's no pets policy no longer applied? Deciding to take the risk, Riku searched the town for a pet shop, and found one with a neglected looking Shiba Inu sitting in the window, as if waiting for him. He hurriedly took the animal home, and was not bothered for bringing an animal into the building a single time, only being interrupted once by some woman begging for help with her son. Riku did not care about her son, Riku only cared about his dog. He opened the door to his apartment, the confused looking shiba puppy struggling in his arms, and let it free to run around the place. He closed the door, felt happy for the first time in many years, and watched the dog curiously explore his new home."

Some bandits had been causing trouble with the village over food and water, and when the village rebuffed them, the bandits came in with everything they had. Suddenly, if the stories are to be believed, he appeared to halt their sack of the defenseless community. They thought they could push right past him. They were mistaken.\n\nFrom there the tales of the man's exploits spread like wildfire. He drove off bandits in the Western Badlands; he braved the perilous journey across the Northern Mountains to deliver medicine to the sick children of a remote village, and some whisper that he even killed the tyrant Emperor of the South with his own hands. Whether any or all of these tales had any merit, the spirit of the people was inflamed. From every corner of the Islands, old oppressive orders began to collapse. The Southern Empire shuddered and came crumbling down, the Bandit King of the West was assassinated by a group of his own slaves, it was if the defiant spirit of that one man had woken the people to the power they could wield if only they were to stand strong against evil.\n\nPerhaps this brave hero was only a myth, invented to give an explanation for spontaneous and unexpected change, as myths often do. And yet, if one listens to the gossip of the local village square or market, one may hear about extraordinary feats of bravery and valor in the face of oppression and cruelty from around the Islands. This gossip will be poorly sourced naturally, heard from a friend of a friend, but they will have many things in common. It is always a single man, always a people in need of a savior, always a great threat vanquished as if by magic. Maybe it is all just a series of stories told by those with nothing better to do, or maybe..."

As he turned the dials over and over, barely even waiting to here the static anymore, he thought about all that he had witnessed and been a part of in his long and eventful life. He had fought in the fiercest theatres of the war with China as a colonel; he had helped capture the Pacific islands as a newly minted general. He had seen the devastation of history's first nuclear strike as a seasoned division leader. The bomb. That image had stuck in his mind. He remembered everything about it so vividly, as if he was being deliberately mocked by his own memories.\n\nAlthough he would never admit it to anyone else, the general had always been somewhat ashamed by the need to rely on such a weapon to repel the Americans during the war. A weapon requiring no skill, required no courage, no effort at all to use. It would be with weapons like that, he thought as he poured out a cup of saké, that humanity would bring an end to itself.\n\nWas all of this some type of divine punishment for their greed? He would not be surprised if that theory turned out to be true. Such things had happened before after all. Did the gods not defend the Japanese people when the Mongols attempted to invade centuries ago? That time, favor had been on their side against a greedy and unrelenting foe, but this time... He drank the last of the saké and sighed deeply. Perhaps this was a kind of justice, in a sense, for all of their collective crimes.

At the time, Captain Akihiro Hashimoto had received his orders with only the greatest reluctance and hesitation, but in the end did his sworn duty.\n\nNow he looked out over a cove, at the center of which his former command was grounded, waves gently caressing her steel hull in the early morning light. This was to be its final resting place: an obscure southern island chosen for both its large size and lack of toxic pollution.\n\nHashimoto observed closely from his elevated vantage point as the work took place. People - 112 from his complement, plus the 41 rescued from an adrift freighter they had come across during their months roaming the sea - were being ferried ashore on small liferafts. Following them would be supplies, and eventually material. Already a party was being organized to search the jungle that lay beyond the beach for a place to settle and any other inhabitants, whether they be natives or the remains of an outpost.\n\nBefore that, however, Hashimoto knew there was something he must do. Turning his back to the cove, he approached a small ditch he had finished digging minutes earlier. Stacked haphazardly from the bottom were dozens of flags and shoulder patches, all emblazoned with the Rising Sun. Thoughts swirled in his mind -- thoughts of his family, his home, his comrades, his friends -- as he stared at the pit. All of them were almost certainly gone by now, scattered to the winds like the nation he had once served.\n\nSomberly, Hashimoto gave one final salute, then struck a match and dropped it into the ditch. Flames ate greedily at the gasoline-soaked cloth, and in an instant the dozens of little suns were consumed by scorching heat. He stared, silent, into the fire for several seconds more; then, slowly, he picked up the shovel and gasoline canister he had used and made his way back down to the beach."

Children from the village run around playing with sticks and jokingly barking orders at each other. Waving around 'swords' with their imaginations, acting dramatic and fighting amongst each other. A 'game'. A war game. There was a time when he was younger he would have thought of it as such a thing. Waving around swords, barking out orders- For a moment, he is caught up in the past once again. Caught up in the noise of screams and explosions, caught up in the smells of smoke and flame, caught up in the colors of soot and blood. The old man pauses for a moment, water filling his eyes before he removes it.\n\nTwo steps towards the children before they pause their play. Many are already aware of his eccentricities. However, he does not berate or scream or roar. Instead, he points to his own sword.\n\n"Hold it like this. Your stance. Like this." He begins, as he holds his own blade with one hand and points to stick with the other. It is no longer a game. Hours pass. Stick meets stick. Slashes, parries, a few small cuts.

For if the world truly was at its end, if the men in higher stations had decided to throw the world away, then was blind obedience truly what mattered? He had a wife. A son. Two people he had barely made time for, two people he had moved aside in adherence to duty, honor, and all of the things he had been told made him perfect. Made him a man. And now, they were going to die because the cause he had fought for, bled for, had sent men to die for...\n\nWas all for nothing. All of it was for nothing. All the jingoism, all the horrors he had perpetrated in the name of peace, all the young men he had shouted at and beaten and berated until they became good soldiers- nothing.\n\nFor a moment, the deserter composed himself as he stood at the doorway to his house. For an hour, he consoled his wife and told her everything that was to come.

No particular military objective was given, unlike when the atomic bomb was used against the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. The only clear goal that Captain Watanabe could see were the deaths of as many civilians as possible.

After all, if they were pressed they would herald the end of humankind.\n\nHe crumpled up the order and stuffed it in his pocket.

Ever since the raiders had left him at the monastery gates they were the whole world to him, he never left and he hoped he would never leave.\n\nSome men didn't, they stayed in the monastery, farming and meditating on the holy texts until they died and were thrown outside for the sky to take. But Chaag was a good boy, he knew his place. Every month a man had to join the raiders and in return they left the baby boys. It was the nature of things, the way the world worked.\n\nWhere did the tributes go? No one knew. Some said they were eaten by the savages. Some said they were offered up to the sky god and his burning demons. Others said they were just let loose, made to walk the steppe-wastes until the ghosts found them, or worse, the Russians.\n\nBefore he left the monastery, the elders shaved him and washed him, wrapping him in a clean robe. It was meant to be a day of glory and honor, but Chaag felt like a man being prepared for his own funeral.\n\nChaag ate one last meal, before he bowed before the painting of the Buddha and left for the gate.

Perhaps they believed what the elders said, and wished the honor was theirs not his.\n\nAt the gate the elders were swaddling the babes in saffron clothes, but on the back of a horse sat the vision of his nightmares.

The fear that one day there would be an agent from the Emperor, one smart enough to see through the metaphors and symbolism. On Ikitsuki they worshiped one God, and he did not need a palace on Earth to live in. For years they had hidden it behind a great fortress of mystery and misdirection, but no longer. Now, at the end of the world, they are free.\n\nThey approach the island now, a spire she did not remember appears first, bright and beautiful.

Now it's just Ling and I, playing in the night, so very far away from my home - and so very near to death.\n\nLing laughs, her face a pattern of shades and brightness. I feel the sudden, unaccountable urge to kiss her, and so I do. Her lips are tart, with a hint of bitterness - lipstick, perhaps. Now she pulls me away from her face gently, like she's back at her father's pottery-shop moving vases, and she whispers, her face cast in serious lines. "Are you sure your friends from the Army will mind?" I nod, smiling. It makes very little difference now. The Kwangtung Army, as of the first launch of tactical missiles from bases in Harbin, has ceased to exist as a functioning force. My friends, if they are lucky, have already melted into the struggling transports back to Kyushu. Those who are not...\n\nI do not consider myself one of the unlucky ones.

I hear the dull whistle of something roaring into the sky, towards the forests ahead of us. I whisper the old poem: "My life/Came from dew/And melts like dew./All of Naniwa/Is dream after dream."

A smaller figure, no less dressed, kneeled in front of him with his head bowed.\n\nBehind them, and in front of the host, rested a lumbering behemoth of steel. It stretched the span of a dozenfold horses, separated into sections tethered to one another by large nails. Trophies and writing adorned its well-oiled sides: tattered banners of defeated, curses in their native tongue, the names of fallen warriors and the honored dead, skulls and bones strung together with cords of hemp. Old men in the robes of monks scatter wisps of incense throughout its length, chanting mantras to their ancestors and gods. None dared to interrupt them as they performed their sacred functions.\n\nThese lands were not spared by the flames of the Purification, yet the steeds of steel with which its peoples built their great cities, and the tracks which these traveled, miraculously remain. Capable of carrying a thousand men across a hundred leagues in speeds faster than any horse, they became the prized possessions of great warlords who now roam the dry plains. Owning one such steed was an honor reserved only to the strongest of K'uan-dong, who had acquired them through many wars spread across many years.\n\nThe monks had completed their rituals when the old warlord rose up, beckoning the knelt man to come closer.

The elements beat upon the ranks like a slavemaster's cruel whip, dragging weakened men with them as the days and months pass. Starvation dealt a second blow, for there was nothing to forage in the harsh hinterlands. An army dwindled into a thousand, then a thousand into a hundred. Eventually, only he and a handful of guards remained by the General's side.\n\nHis final moments remained like a clear film reel on the back of Li Chuang's mind. Shaky hands gently shoving a worn, bloody copy of the Little Red Book onto his chest. Bloodshot eyes filled with tears, struggling to hold his gaze.

So died then, alone but for Li Chuang holding him upright, the father he never had.\n\nBlinking away tears and breathing deep, the little red devil tended to his filial duties. He gently laid his father onto the poor grave, soiling his trousers with the earth he had dug. Claps resounded in the forest, heard by none but its creatures.

Beneath them were the White Yi, men who were free, yet common. At the bottom of this structure were the slaves. These unfortunate souls were once foreigners, kidnapped and forced to till the soil for generations. Sweat coated their brows and whips broke their backs, all while the Black Yi would sit in their manors, chattering to each other over tea and dim sum.\n\nYet, when pillars of smoke smothered the sky and men melted to ash, those few left alive in the Southwest had no choice but to huddle together in the manors for shelter. The Black Yi had to till what was left of their fields themselves. All surviving hands were needed in the new world. No one needed the whip to work; the fear of natural death was enough to drive them forward. Everyone left was able to eat their simple meals communally in the old manors, and bunked in them too.\n\nFor generation after generation, this was their way of life. Over time, the people slowly began to forget which among them was once a Black Yi or a White Yi or a slave. After even more time passed, they struggled to remember what "Black Yi" or "White Yi" even meant. Everything the survivors had on their farms was shared in common, and human beings were not among the shared property.\n\nOne thing they never forgot, however, was that the Southwest belongs to the Yi.

A Yi was anyone who devoted himself to the freedom and survival of those around him.

Amassing a grand army from all of his subject peoples and nations, he marched to meet the still-forming coalition in preemptive combat.\n\nThe battle promised to be legendary; thousands of men readied themselves to face the enemy, as generals huddled in tents, carefully planning their strategies and tactics for the coming struggle. Yet, as the battle came to action, little of that planning would be put to use. The conqueror was swept off his horse by a conveniently placed arrow, perishing upon the field of battle before the first shields had even clashed. As swiftly as his conquests began, they were undone. His armies scattered and fled, and the lands he once conquered celebrated their freedom. Hardly a conqueror's dream."

But it went away as soon as she turned to the road -- the very big playground was waiting for her! She smiled as she strolled the path she put to memory.\n\nChen found it one time when she headed home after running an errand for Old Man Li. Behind the Great Forest, he said, was a lake with no fish, no land and no grass. The town's fishermen stayed away because they thought it was cursed, because why wouldn't a lake have tasty fish and tall grasses? But Chen was a curious child, and so she trailed off the cracked path home and went off into the lake beyond the Great Forest.\n\nThey were right, the lake didn't have grass or fish. But it did have something better than all the fish and grass in the world combined!\n\nChen shook with glee, her laughter bubbling into giggles, as she dodged branches and swiped past leaves and jumped over rocks. She was getting close. Finally, she neared the edge and felt the rough not-land on her feet. Chen's eyes widened as she looked ahead. There it was!\n\nThe playground was just as big and long as she remembered it. It laid right next to the edge of the lake, where the not-land met the water, and had -- she counted, one, two, three -- big funny looking boxes with fingers. A ladder hung down to its curvy bottom, which looked like a red belly.\n\n...Okay, it didn't look like a playground at all. But it's wide and spacious and had lots of knick knacks she hadn't seen before. And it's all hers, too!\n\nWith another small pang of guilt for not reminding Mama and Papa, Chen trotted off to the ladder, thinking of all the new things she'll find in her own little playground."

Its vivid whites and browns, flashing silver and gold when struck by sunlight at a certain angle, withstood a thousand thousand sunsets with neither dent nor scratch. Its lhakhangs and statues remain standing, and with them and many others centuries of culture from the days of the Three Great Dharma Kings. One can say whatever they will about the Buddha's teachings, but none can deny their innate fortitude against tragedies wrought both by man and nature.\n\nThe same cannot be said of the Dalai Lama.\n\nReincarnations of great bodhisattvas they may be, but the spiritual heads of Tibet remain tethered to the mortal coil by flesh and blood. Both burn easily in nuclear hellfire, which was what purportedly happened to the fourteenth of this sacred line. No one precisely knew of the circumstances involved, and no one dared to pry. What mattered most was that the Roof of the World had suddenly lost its guide; should this state persist in these uncertain times, the structure as a whole becomes more prone to collapse.\n\nWith the current chaos, assembling the High Lamas on the direction their search shall take is an exercise in futility. They have communities to assuage, temples to maintain as the world ends before their eyes. Hope remains that the fifteenth Dalai Lama may be found before Tibet is engulfed in crisis, though many fear that the window of opportunity shrinks by the day."

Management always insisted there was no money to replace it.\n\nWhen the three men got there, a small crowd had already gathered. The elevator doors were shut, and the operator in his little shed was pacing back and forth. Ruogang settled down to wait, he figured someone topside would fix the elevator at most he'd be down here for a few hours for the mechanic to drive up to town.\n\nIt did not take hours. They tried the telephone, the speaking tube and they even tried shouting up the shaft. No answer ever came back. No answer except for the patter of rain.

They all knew what acid water looked like.\n\nWeeks went past. The boys died first. Some men went off into the far tunnels, never to be seen again. After day three they ran out of light. After four they ran out of food, but then when the boys died they weren't quite so short. Ruogang didn't eat. In the dead of night, he assumed, for night and day had run out a while ago, he took himself to broken shaft. He looked up, seeing what might have been stars, or might have been sunlight poking through the elevator building. He picked up a broken bucket, half full of the burning rain.

But sometimes, he wished he had died right there. The next day, his injuries were deemed as not requiring emergency aid, and he was released from the town hospital so that others in dire need could be helped. That was when he truly witnessed the destruction of the place he had lived in for the entirety of his life, for all forty-six years of it. No one from his close friends and family had survived, including his wife that had gone to the marketplace that morning. Rumours spread that a dangerous chemical was poisoning everything in the area, the air, the water, the ground, and the people.

Each vote was scripted and rehearsed before being presented to a lucky crowd. Rituals consumed every moment of the elite's life. They were left no time to care for the concerns of their subservient or of administrative matters. The act was eternal, the theater the very essence of life. When a great epidemic swept through the land, the stage only gained more pomp, the costumes more jewels, the actors far more dramatic. The gods must reward them for more.\n\nEach elite was consumed more and more with the great ritual of writing, memorizing, and performing a script. Each was drilled into their heads.

Yet, nothing could have prepared the inhabitants for the utter destruction that the final war would bring upon them. Whole cities reduced to rubble and hundreds of millions of lives extinguished in an instant. To those who survived, the world they now inhabited was so accursed they almost wished they had perished.\n\nMany would make a great trek west. They had heard that in the farther flung reaches of the Middle Kingdom, there were cities and societies that had been left untouched by the great bombs. Pilgrims would regularly pack their things and make a perilous journey westward, crossing imposing mountains and mighty rivers in search of a new home. Some would give up and settle at various points along the great river. Some would make it to the intact ruins of abandoned cities and rebuild anew. And along the way, pilgrims would trade with those who had given up further behind, in the hopes of one day helping those who would one day venture where they feared to tread.\n\nThe ancients had referred to a similar route to the West as the 'Seelk Road'; though none knew what 'seelk' signified, the name itself remained as a new trail of outposts flickered into life on the ashes of a long-forgotten past."

They thought that the being or beings they gave praise to here would make their lives easier, would protect them from harm, or perhaps would simply grant them a new life after their current one ended. They were wrong, and the destruction they brought upon themselves serves as proof.\n\nThere is no god. The people living here in this temple know that fact now. They know that the world is bleak and capricious, and that life is entirely meaningless. They know, and they refuse to let it get to them. They refuse to wallow in sorrow simply because there is no ghost in the sky looking out for them. They are wise, and they understand that the end of the world did not come from a cosmic plan. Rather, it came from bad decisions by stupid men. Bad, stupid decisions that they would never repeat.\n\nThey had purpose now. They travel out from their homes each month, in search of another altar to a god that never existed, to use it not for worship, but for shelter. When the month was up, they would destroy it; knock down whatever kept it standing and watch it crumble and fall. They had been going at it for so many years now. So many temples torn down, so much of past ignorance destroyed. They would keep on going until nothing was left, until nothing remained of these monuments to the sort of idiocy that ended the world. Maybe when all the temples were gone, the suffering brought on to the world by faith would stop punishing humanity for its superstition. Until then, it was time to be on the move again."

When these scraps are sufficient for the powerless and destitute to sustain themselves, or when they are fooled into believing they hold power and that their master is their friend, they will remain calm and peaceable. But when a poor man's stomach tells him that he is starving, and his nose tells him that the rich man above him has food, hell hath no fury.\n\nSo many millions--billions, maybe--had died. So many more were blind or bedridden, reliant on whatever living friends and relations they might have left to help keep them alive. The 'war', if it could be called that, had ended so quickly, and yet its ramifications would be felt for thousands of generations. There had never been a worse calamity to befall mankind. To all those weakened by hunger, whose every loved one was dying of the same, things that might otherwise have been unthinkable to them became sensible and rational in this new order of things. The nuclear apocalypse had muted their sense of morality, and mutated their relationship to dynamics of power. Specifically, they no longer respected the men who had it, the men who had caused this, and they did not care if they lived or died to take what they needed. If they didn't receive it they would die anyway.\n\nThe local administrator wasn't actually Chinese. He was a Japanese man, a settler, who moved over to run this quarter of the country with his extended family, after China's subjugation. Some people had spread rumours he was hoarding food in his estate out in the country, and a few hundred men had arrived at his gates to investigate those rumours. Things got rowdy. The guards shot first, and then things went downhill from there. The walls were climbed over, the gates opened, the crowd stirred up by the hostilities of the men who resisted them. Some people swore they smelled food. What happened when the riot arrived at the front door of the house could not be described as anything more than a massacre. A few bags of rice were found, and ripped open and fought over, but they wouldn't sustain very many lives for very long. Meat, though, was the most ultimate of luxuries in these times, and there was plenty of meat to be found inside the estate. When a poor man's stomach tells him that he is starving, and the world around him tells him that morality doesn't exist any more, the denizens of hell would balk at the sight of what he would do."

Yet the demoralized soldiers of Bashu State surrendered to the last, refusing warlord Shi Qi's desperate pleas to fight to the end. The battle for the City of Ashes, once a stronghold of a long-forgotten regime that had ruled Jiuzhou, has ended.\n\nWhile his troops celebrated their great triumph and spent their spoils of war on drink and wench, Gao Guanlin climbed Simian Mountain. The night's canopy had already blanketed the sky, its starry spots gleaming bright. Across all of Jiuzhou, from the banks of the Pearl River to the Great Wall, the souls of many warlords and their men burned with blazing light -- just like the stars in the endless void above.\n\nBut Jiuzhou was no mere void, one of many that now dot a world ruined by old fires. Jiuzhou was civilization itself, birthed in the fertile soil of Zhongyuan, forged through a thousand thousand years of monumental pain and anguish and triumph. The bond of this eternal struggle and the rule of Emperors created something far different from the concept of "nation". Gao Guanlin was not a philosopher or a historian, but one thing he was certain: The very concept, the very word known as "Jiuzhou" told of an idea greater than any cause, race, tongue, faith, or man.\n\nThe warlord turned to the east from Simian Mountain's peak. On his way alongside Yangzhe River was a "Xiang River United Army", the host of yet another powerful warlord. To the north his scouts report his ally Dong Junfa being assailed by Xie Dongsheng. Gao Guanlin can send part of his army to assist him, but will leave his rear guard vulnerable to incursions by Hou Yong. He sighed. Even after victory, hard decisions remain.\n\nBut the warlord had made peace with himself long ago. He might fall to poison, age, betrayals, or battles... they did not matter. In the end, Jiuzhou will be made whole once more -- either with him at the helm, or with him left forgotten in a shallow grave."

Life was hard, but they got by.\n\nUntil a self-titled bandit king came riding in one day. On a black horse he rode, and in his hand was an ancient weapon. The village wizard called it a wand, a metal rod twisted and infested with thunder demons from the mountains of the east. Wherever the king directed it, people died and animals fled from the howl of the thunder-wand.\n\nFor seven seasons the village suffered beneath the bandit king. The people had no time to negotiate with the river spirits, and the floods destroyed their crops. Desperate and starving, some of the people of the village became the slaves of the king. The men beat their neighbours into submission, whilst the women served him and his bandits in unspeakable ways.\n\nUntil one day, a rider on a white horse came to town. He was clad all in steel, black and red like the flames of the sacred oil. On his shield he bore a white dog, howling to a black sun on a red field. By his side was a long, straight sword of antique make and in his eyes their was burning ice.\n\nHe told the village he was a Knight of the Mad Dog, and he was here to liberate the village. The villagers wept with joy and followed the knight the camp of the king. The bandits rushed the knight, but with speed and disdain he cut them down, until only the King remained.

The Grandmaster of the mad dog knights met with the Queen of red Nam, and his Bifo priests read ancient inscriptions of protection from the ministrations of their Theory-shamans.\n\nThere Grandmaster demanded the Queen submit to the power of the mad dog and allow his howl to banish the Hanjian demon from her realm, but lo the Hanjian twisted her heart against him and she laughed at his justice. With divine rage he drew his sword, but her guards used dark trickery to slay him where he stood.\n\nEnraged by this, a champion of the mad dog challenged the Queen to a duel of honor, yet so cowardly was her court that only a humble farmer who had followed them for seven days agreed to fight him.\n\nSurrounded by trees, the farmer and the knight fought, one with steel and skill while the other was clad in sack-cloth with a wooden cane. You may ask, dear listener, who would win? But you, like the champion, did not know the secret power of the farmer, for he was an ally of the forest, and at his words it sprang to life.

Sultans and princes raised banners old and tattered in the service of a vanished dream - but the precise contours of that dream had been lost in the harsh dawn of the Burning. One story, as intense and bitter as a bad dream, was preserved. Songstresses and silk-weavers whispered and retold, whispered and retold, whispered - and retold. And so the dream came to life, becoming a popular myth-legend spread in the same folk-theatre circles as the Mahabharata and the Red Plays.\n\nThe story, in its thousand variations, went something like this: Long, long before the present time, in the days when men lifted silver wings and mated with the stars, the Great and Terrible Queen Durga arose, an agent of chaos in a land rent with strife - her seductive promises beguiled the Court into submission, and the ones her words could not reach, her Dark Agents cowed into silence. It was said that her reign brought the entirety of Hind to its knees, stifling the tongues and words of men with arcane orders, killing the Sikhs and Muslims in their temples, seducing the farmers into working for her designs. Some stories recorded that she had tamed the Power of the Sun herself, bringing horror-fire upon the Earth as a gift to her enemies.\n\nMost saw it as a cautionary tale, but as is customary with these stories, some took it as a prophecy. Eventually a warlord arose in the lands far to the West, where the Great Indus touched the sea. His conquests stretched from the Indus to the wetlands of Bengal, and in his consuming arrogance he dared to take upon himself the True Name of Durga, the name that none dared speak. It was a step too far, even for the most loyal of his retinue. The Emperor Indira Gandhi, Second Of His Name, was killed in his sleep in the tenth year of His Reign by Sikh bodyguards angered by His insolence.

In the chaos that swept Jai Hind as the cities torched, the forces leapt upon each other, a frenzy of violence echoing through the poisoned air.\n\nPosterity has forgotten the name of the Free general who, in his wisdom, gave the order to cease fighting and focus the arms and effort of the men still alive to keep the villages safe from raiders and famine. It was a sentiment many on the other side of the Bengali border agreed with. And so the two set their arms aside and began the quiet, painful task of healing the world.\n\nSlowly order came like sense to a drunken head, in fits and starts and aches and pains. Village by village submitted to the rule of the Guards, as they were now known, for security and for the skills the Guards' considerable civilian retinues offered. Brickworks, navigation, the lost arts of medicine. Flowers grew in barracks and rifle ranges converted to terraced fields - rusting hangars and planes and bombs were disassembled for their parts.\n\nEventually the Guards themselves forgot their origin. But for reasons unknown even to them, for centuries after its purpose had been forgotten, two members of the elite Guards would march to each other at the bustling capital city of Checkpoint, wave their swords at each other, and salute a tattered flag upon which could be seen, in faint imprints, the stitched-together pattern of two vanished nations.

Panicking, Nayyar's clique prepares to cut their way out - and are cut down by trigger-happy Army men. Conversely, the Abbas convoy barely makes it to the outskirts of the city before they are torn limb from limb by the hungry poor. Kapoor's limousines, well-stocked with fake visas and real guns, make it the furthest - they are about 350 miles from the city when their convoys at last break down. The passengers set out on foot to the safety of the mountains, one by one dying from exhaustion and disease and despair, until Kapoor himself walks into the desolate wilds and is never heard from again."

Mobs and panicked crowds ripped through the countryside and tore up the old world, and in places which dared to resist, the men who struggled to hold on to the scraps of knowledge they held were tied to the machines they guarded and set afire. Sometimes, mercifully enough, they were simply killed for their pains.\n\nA branch of the Indian Film Society, huddled in expeditious refuge in a village in Gujarat, was caught more or less by surprise. With their charity film-screening events permanently on hold, the group was stranded far from the cities (which were, in any case, torched-out shells) and lacking in supplies. In a desperate attempt to ingratiate themselves with the restive locals, they offered something invaluable: access to their vast collection of Bollywood films, all on handy tapes stored in their belongings. The village accepted, and as the famines and the Black Winter hit the small village the watching of film became an accepted outlet for stress-release and entertainment.\n\nSlowly the tapes failed, one by one, and as generations grew and died the equipment itself became lost to time despite the efforts of the film crew's descendants to maintain the machines. Even so, the ritual of watching a blank screen with the projectors reverentially set up and the spools of lovingly preserved tape had become almost religious. In time, it became an actual religion, and as the descendants of the villagers grew to become a prosperous trading outpost, the prince of the fiefdom enforced the new faith upon the inhabitants of the city - meditating upon a blank screen and sculptures of boxy film-projectors became the subject of intense piety, sacred scriptures and many, many wars."

With cunning he turned his enemies against each other, one by one, breaking their armies against each other as a sailor breaks the wind, until none were left to oppose him: then he marched into the Eastern Forts and the Silent Cities as a conqueror. Those who knelt before him lived. Those that did not were thrown into moats by the hundreds. The Raja extracted a cruel price from the lands he ruled every year, calling every village to send him a man or woman for his enjoyment: if they did not entertain him (which they invariably ceased to do after a couple of weeks, no matter what they offered in flesh or gold) he would execute them. For years this went on, murder after murder, as lambs sent to a slaughterhouse.\n\nA poor village that had recently fallen under the sword of the Raja sent only one man, an aged man nearly incapable of walking. The Raja laughed uproariously at the sight, preparing to execute him and everyone else in the village for their audacity. But the Old Man, knowing the Raja's heart, asked the Raja for a week alone in his quarters, where he would teach him the Sacred Teachings of the Prophet Rao. For a week the two meditated together, seeking wisdom in the Liberation of the People from The Eternal City - the Old Man recited the Scripture of Rao chapter and verse from his tattered village education.\n\nAt the end of the week the Raja walked out in the same body, but with his heart forever changed. He tore his rags before the Court, called a meeting of the lords of the land, and there he forsook his crown. As the empire collapsed behind him, the Raja, now a commoner, took up the robes of saffron and red - he undertook a pilgrimage to the village from whence the Old Man had come, and there he spent the rest of his life preaching the Teachings of Rao, and the Liberation of the People, to the commoners he once abused."

The Perfect Dialectic of Men came also unto us through the Prophet Rao, and in His wisdom he taught men the Way to remain unto the Krita Yuga, that all men might be pure, equal and unyoked from the chains of kings and princes.\n\nBut those days are gone. Treta Yuga, the age of evil, entered Bharat Hind with the mocking name of Empire: white-demons stalked the earth ravaging the land and plundering the riches of the Mother. In their place came Devils - tyrant-princes with great magicks and demons spawned from lands far to the East and West. Finally, the Great War, the Mahabharata: a horror-cleansing of the horror-world, nightmare fires lighting men like candles in their swarming hives. Now all is lost and the Kali Yuga surrounds us. But the Prophet Rao alone offers us a way out.\n\nIt is midnight, at a time only the Elders have foreseen in their ritual chanting and their Consultation of Theory. Our numbers are few, but hundreds of us cluster around the Ganges, in groups of three or four. The Prophet Rao calls for a Revolution of the People through bloodletting and sacrifice - not others' but our own. We prepare our wrists: the knives are clean and sharp, honed for ritual, not for killing. The blood seeps rich and thick into the water of the Ganges.\n\nOne of us loses the strength as I watch, fainting from the loss: I hear shouting as the gurus and the guardsmen of the city rush to us, shouting in anger. For such a profanity against Bharat Hind, we will be executed within the week. But I feel no fear as I am dragged away from the river, still protesting weakly.

Our numbers dwindling, our people starving, our lands burnt into broken ash, all melted into chaos and despair. Even the Scriptures were lost to us, that of Sarvakar and Golkawar and the Palis, all gone with the burning of precious oldpaper for fire or in accidents.\n\nA Teacher, one of the last of his kind, led us across the great dying plain that girdles the Ganges like a priest's belt. The hundreds of us that were left followed his lead through fire and flame, fighting off bandits at night and walking through burned towns by day. It is said some of our kin are still born deformed from the dark magick seeping through the Black Lands we traversed. But we survived, and at last the Teacher called us to halt near a great marbled building: even seared by the flames of the Burning, it was beautiful in our eyes.\n\nAs the Teacher lay dying, racked by great gouts of blood-coughing, he called us to hearken unto the inscriptions of the Dome: to learn the inscriptions and its language by heart, and to take the Dome itself as the new Heart of Hind. How could this, he reasoned, be anything less than a divine temple, built in forgotten ages by holy men to worship our God?\n\nThe Teacher is long dead, and his tomb forgotten, but we of the R'shtri Swaysvak Sanh - the name must remain even if its meaning is lost - have not forgotten his teaching. We have mastered the Arabick, surely the purest, most beautiful language of the Bharat Hindis, and upon the marbled frame of this Ta' Mahal we are building Jai Hind once more, pure, Indian and free of foreign influence.

As the parades of his accession drifted past his stage like clouds past a mountain, King Nayr watched the Kingdom unrolled before him. So many united in a common cause - from the heights of the throne, who could tell Brahmin from Untouchable? Still, he knew the politics of the Court forbade him from making such a statement. There was too much to lose, the crown far too ponderous to tolerate such a subtle blow.\n\nFortune came in the form of the Bandit-Kings: Kerah and its merchant-city sisters fell before the ravages of the Tyrant Nameless And Terrible. No longer would Nayr have to remain silent: he issued a call to arms - and the Untouchables rose up to defend the King, aided by Nayr's personal moneys and armaments, including precious Oldworld magicks in the Places of Study. The Untouchables proved themselves fierce as tigers in combat, breaking upon the Tyrant's armies in bloody foam. They pierced through to the heart of the army itself, dragging him from the iron-chariot he rode. At the end of the battle, watching the masses fall away leaderless towards the calving North, King Nayr raised the Untouchable Generals' hands high in victory.\n\nThat day the ancient walls, built so high and so wide in Tam'lnadh, began to crumble, and centuries after Nayr himself had expired they had eroded to the point that no-one could quite recall what Untouchables had even been, other than a guild of warriors unchallengeable in battle and humble in victory.

Excepting the recruitment of the occasional orphan or stray beggar from the village's periphery, there was no real body of witnesses to comment on their comings and goings: if you were in the Buddhas, you stayed in the Buddhas.\n\nOne day a little boy from the village decided to sneak into the Smiling Buddha's main encampment, working his way in from the dense forest-canopy that surrounded the camp. As guards marched in and out of the brick-red complex, badly discolored in places with what might have been the application of mismatched paint, the boy watched the routes they took. A strategic opening presented itself, and he slipped into the workings, ignoring the rusted-over sign over that forgotten door: RADIATION HAZARD WITHIN FACILITY.\n\nHe came before a vast array of blackened plastic and glass signs, worn thin and brittle with disuse. It was not hard to imagine, as his father had told him, the lights blinking on and off in the tens and hundreds, although only oil-wicks were left to light the vast room. He was still watching the signs and the black surfaces when the guards came for him, wearing peculiar heavy suits and armored masks.\n\nThe boy took weeks to recover, coughing up blood and losing most of his hair; it took the efforts of the entire village to extricate him from the hospital-prison the Buddhas had left him in.

He wasn't an observant Hindu, thankfully enough, but the Priests would no doubt raise hell if they found out.\n\nWell, it wouldn't help even if he raised queries about it now. Elder Srinaga wanted the Document handled and put into the Reliquaries as soon as humanly possible - from what Ashgar was given to understand, this invited a great deal of laxity into what the Priests would take in terms of material as long as the Documents were recorded. Hopefully the Elders would take a piece of errant parchment in stride - just to make sure it wasn't immediately obvious, Ashgar made notes to the next Scribe to cure the cowskin after his inscriptions, making its origin less obvious.\n\nNow, for the Document itself. Most of the records had been lost with the Burning and the Deluge, but this copy was still in fairly good working order. Perhaps it had belonged to some old prince-minister or warrior and so avoided the chaos that claimed the cities. Certainly its contents commanded respect from the Elders to the extent that they had been willing to part with a fair sum of coin to write it. Well, if his employers demanded it, who was he to refuse?\n\nAshgar prepared his quill, tapping the inkwell a couple of times, and began to write.

Bitterly he swore on the name of his ancestors that he would find the traitor-bloodkin responsible for this treachery, but before revenge could be plotted the Project took immediate precedence. For the fifth time in a decade the great Street-Map was assembled from its carefully preserved fragments (why had the Old Ones put such priceless knowledge in such fragile paper sheets? God only knew how they had protected their works of art) and Nu Delhi was plotted out to the last detail, on a carefully handcrafted table made for just this purpose.\n\nThe writings and the street-plottings contained within were added to the Street-Map in annotations of ink, made on side-scraps of paper attached to the main corpus. This was not, however, the main problem. The real issue was one of resource constraints: with existing stonecarving and masonry manpower and supplies it would be insufficient to simply keep relying on the donations of the local Prince, and in fact even the brick and stone deposits they had in reserve were no longer sufficient to accommodate the revised demands. Something would have to give.\n\nAjay's eye was drawn to the local map, for in the past his Household had discovered a few precious quarries and oldtech deposits by scrutinizing the surrounding region. When the Great Fires came they destroyed much, but they had not scorched all the offenders of the Gods off the earth. Perhaps some of them remained to be dug up and sold, or to be used. At least that was the logic the Great-Father of the Clan had used when he began the process of restoring the city, so many decades ago.\n\nAjay's gaze caught something: a dot, obscured by mold and dust, with the markings DELHI on it. A city of the Old Ones, so close to Nu-Delhi, named after the same city he was trying to restore: this could only be the hand of God himself! Leaping to his feet, he called for his master-scavengers to assemble, already preparing the scavenging crews.

For the most ancient of texts that survived the fires spoke only of a few of these beings, such as the elephants, the tigers and the peafowl. Of the great lyon and the fearsome heppo and the elegant zeehorse and all manner of other strange and wondrous creatures, the texts maintained a brooding silence.\n\nThe only explanation lay in the legends. It is said that the gods revealed themselves to their most faithful of believers, and tasked them with the role of the Keepers. They were commanded to build a great menagerie of all the beasts of the earth, even those from beyond their lands. A special place was crafted for each animal, styled after their homes so that their hearts would not grow longing to return. For a time, men of the old nations would come to see their realm and gaze in awe at all the bounty of the earth. And then - for reasons unknown - the world was plunged into a thousand years of darkness.\n\nAnd yet the Keepers did not stray from their sacred task. Through the struggle and the pain, they protected their charges from the forces of the shadow, and from greedy mortals looking for a feast. Even through the worst times the animals grew yet more numerous, and when the light of rebirth finally shone back upon the earth, the Keepers released their flock back into a world that was once more ready for them.\n\nIt is said that the gods still smile upon those who protect the beasts of the world in times of hardship.

My life had a clear structure, consisting of meditation, study, and chores. My days were consumed by the routine, although I believe that it taught me something new every day, about the monastic life, so that I could teach the wisdom of Buddha, just as he had to his disciples. Yet I only understood it fully on the day the world was set on fire.\n\nI remember that day perfectly, for it was so ordinary and then suddenly so horrifyingly different. From the mountain perch of the monastery, I watched as the cities in the distance exploded and burned. I saw how the villagers rushed up the mountain to seek shelter, lest death came for them in their homes too. I saw all of this, and I ran from it. I was so terrified that I lost all sense of direction. When I finally stopped, I looked up to find that I had wandered into a cavern. Right in front of me, was a tiny statue of Buddha, flanked by two lit braziers.\n\nHad the monastery been destroyed behind me, leaving with me as the last human left? So overwhelming was my fear and despair that I must have fainted. Surely, I had died and was waiting to be reborn. But instead, I watched the rise and fall of empires, through the eyes of mighty kings and wretched labourers. I lived as four good men and as four evil men. I ended the world and then I tried to save it. In the myriad worlds I wandered in, I felt the pain of life cut short, and I felt the joy of death postponed. Last of all, I saw Buddha walk the cracked and ruined Earth, with a lotus sprouting with each barefoot step he took, until the Earth was restored to verdant splendor. He turned his head to smile at me, before I awoke on the cavern floor.\n\nOne of the other monks found me not long after and guided me back to the monastery, quite untouched by the fires. The devastation beyond still saddened me, but I could already see the new world starting to grow, in the hearts of all mankind."

This vast expanse was not the homeland of Arjun, the emperor's family having come from far to the east, from whence the powerful warrior Arjun led his army in its westward conquest all the way to the unending sand in the farthest west. This whole land Arjun made into his own, and left the world to marvel upon its size and upon the hundreds of thousands of men living within it.\n\nArjun conquered this expanse at the tip of his talwar, and this blade that he wielded became the symbol of his office as emperor. When Arjun waged his last campaign against the chariot people and met his first and last defeat, he did not bring the talwar along with him, the blade being kept in his palace, built at the confluence of two small rivers with water that flows green. Arjun's death at the hands of the chariot people was blamed on his conquest proceeding without his holy sword, and so all those lords who had bowed to him and now sought to take over his kingdom converged on his palace. There the greatest of all battles was fought between their armies, ending more lives than all of Arjun's conquests ever had. The twin green rivers of the palace grounds were masked by the red of the blood that was shed, and when the last living vassal of Arjun, the victor of the battle, went to the rivers to wash off the blood from the blade, the waters only stained the talwar red for all time.\n\nThe last lord wielded the talwar in public, to show to the people of Arjun's kingdom that he was the conqueror's heir, that the sword rested with him. But the people remembered their conqueror's sword well, and his talwar was not a red one. Arjun had been merciful in his conquests, and had not taken his weapon to the people of the farms and sullied either his blade's colour or his soul's sanctity with the taking of innocent life. And so the people did not know of their emperor's sword to ever be red, and they knew the last lord was a cutthroat and a liar. The last lord had killed all their masters, and Arjun was gone, so the people returned to their oldest ways, living in peace and simplicity, and remembering for all time that any man whose sword is red is not to be followed."

 RAD_IN.25.desc: "Ages ago, in a less holy time, the river of the goddess Ganga was constantly defiled by the people that lived along it. Buildings of industry would spew deadly liquid waste into her waters, turning them black and sour. The poor would carelessly deposit their refuse in it, dirtying the goddess with their rubbish. All of this, and still the men in charge did nothing to keep the goddess' waters clean from human pollution. It was a time when humans cared not for the needs of the gods, and disrespected them on a whim.\n\nOurs is a better time. The wiping of the slate that ended so many innocent lives also had many upsides, and one of them was an end to the abuse suffered each day by the goddess Ganga. The river Ganges is now as pure and live-giving as it has ever been, and the waters of the goddess run as clean and tranquil as they ever have. Those few alive who still reside on the Ganga's shores respect her as they always should have, assigning her their thanks for seeing to their survival of the great fires that scorched the land in that time long ago--and the trials that followed them. Respect and reverence for the goddess Ganga has never been higher, and if faith in her should ever falter again, may the fires return and clean her banks from polluters once more."

He could have kept running as everyone else had, he could have ignored the sobs and cries of the caught woman. Once he had made it to the shelter, he could have come up with any excuse he needed to assuage his guilty heart. He had not done that.\n\nWhether it was pity or guilt or genuine compassion for the dying woman, he wasn't sure. He supposed that it made little difference at this point. More nukes had been sent flying by now, and the shelter had probably already been closed. He was going to share in death with this poor soul. He grasped her hand and squeezed; she squeezed back, although with much less force. There were worse ways to die than giving comfort to someone in need of it, he thought and he sat down beside the woman.\n\nShe panted raggedly, erratically. Not much longer now. Between ever more feeble attempts to draw breathe, the trapped woman wanted to know why he had stopped to stay with her in his final moments. He wasn't sure himself, and admitted as much. She asked him if he was aware that she was casteless, he responded that he had not known that, and that he didn't care. She began to cry the kind of tears one cries when they have finally been awarded decency after having it so long denied. If only, he thought to himself, if only it did not have to come in circumstances like this.\n\nHis act would never be known; both he and the woman met their ends in the inferno that subsumed the globe. If the story could have been told however, if only it could have been recorded and shared, in some far distant future, perhaps he would have been called a man truly worthy of Enlightenment."

 RAD_SEA.1.desc: "The AS Anzac was fleeing an engagement in the West Polynesian region when the signal went out heralding the end times. Despite the crew's shocked disbelief and pleading with the divine for it to be a false alarm, radio silence quickly followed, and the distant flash of a nuclear warhead over the horizon confirmed the fate of all the other ships in the AO. The Anzac drifted alone.\n\nIt would have been understandable for the crew to give up then and there. For them to find the nearest island and try to make a life for themselves there. For them to simply throw themselves overboard rather than live in the hellish world the bombs had built. Instead, only one singular thought ran through each of their minds: Home.\n\nWhat transpired next would make a tale for the ages. When a trip to Auckland in search of a navy base revealed only scorched ruins, the ship would instead embark for New Caledonia in search of Japanese fuel. Instead the crew would be captured by remnants of the IJN, and almost lose their lives if not for a cunning deception and escape from captivity orchestrated by the captain. Alas, the escapade would lose them the Anzac, scuppered by the last of the Japanese shells. Not to be deterred, the crew would spend nearly a year fashioning a New Anzac from wood, canvas and other materials found on the island.\n\nBack on the seas, the men pressed on. Sailing north to Vanatu and then west towards Papua, they would many years hopping from island to island, battling crazed Imperial soldiers, cannibalistic natives, sirens, the Kraken and all manner of other beasts - or so the stories would say. But regardless, the crew would never lose hope of seeing the great Down Under once again. And one bright sunny day, long after the last fires of the end had gone out, they would finally land in Cape Melvine amidst verdant corals and sandy shores.\n\nThe sagas would never really focus on what happened after. Some would return home to whatever remained of their families, in the hopes of providing some semblance of a future for them. Others would wander, and find whatever living could be had in the new Australia. And a few who had come to love the sea that had been their home would simply take the New Anzac and sail back out, never having to set foot upon the cursed earth again."

The dust kicked up from the road had caked his windscreen, and he was buggered if he was wasting his gas on wipers more likely to fall off than clear his view. Trips like this were always risky - Straya was vast, and the towns that were left were separated by thousands of miles of baked earth. He had planned this one carefully, rationed their water, but the lost tyre on the scrublands had cost them valuable time. He craned his eyes - could it be? God yes, a building - he must be here. He eased his foot onto the brake, preparing for the long business of stopping a hundred tonnes of machine.\n\nSamson stretched his aching limbs as he clambered out of the cabin and took in the cargo he was hauling. The three trailers were hitched to a mighty tractor cabin that bore decades of slow wear - but she kept going. Them in the Before sure knew how to build machines, and his father had taught him how to keep her running in thick and thin. It had been his lifeline - and now it was all of theirs.\n\nA small crowd had gathered in response to his arrival. Their leader, a tall aboriginal fella, stepped forward. "What brings you to Mparntwe?" he asked brusquely, in a thick accent.\n\nSam furrowed his brow. "Nothing. I thought this was The Alice?"\n\nThe man snorted. "We do not use your names anymore. This is Mparntwe."\n\nIt meant nothing to Sam either way. "Well whatever it is, we're just passing through. We need water, though, as much as you have."\n\nThe negotiations continued long after - the aboriginal, who seemed to be the only one who spoke English, appeared to show some sympathy after he was explained their situation. They hauled open the doors of the first trailer. The people crammed inside gasped at the sudden burst of light that illuminated their cramped home. They were packed like sardines, some twenty of them and everything they had ever owned, crammed into a metal box.\n\n"We at Perth yet, da?" Sam shook his head. "Not yet. Got us some more water. Make it last." The boy was already snatching at the flask he was holding, and ran back to share it with the grubby, dust caked children that had become his friends in the darkness.\n\nSam spared a few dribbles of water to clear the dust from his windscreen, not that it would last. The Great Western Desert was the last obstacle between them and the coast. The old trader had told him about Perth, that it had escaped what happened to Canberra and Sydney and all the others. He had no idea if it was true, but they had packed up and left all the same. The hope was all they had."

 RAD_SEA.3.desc: "The islanders were dying. The land had become infertile, whether from the actions of gods or the actions of man. The great, old trees, were rotten solid, so no boats could be built to escape the island. The great vessel that lay on the south end of the atoll was rusting. The entire prow had cracked apart. It was certainly not seaworthy. Yet, it was the islanders' only hope. They were to starve, or they were to sail. And the ocean beckoned.\n\nEach man, woman, and child united to mend the boat and to install hundreds and hundreds of oars. After years of progress, the taro no longer grew, but the boat was finished. It still rusted, and a large chunk was missing, but oars a dozen feet long protruded into the water. A specially constructed crane applied pressure, and it was off, into the sea. The men, no longer stranded, danced with joy. Onto the sea they cast off, in search of another island. The first they sighted was infested with snakes. One could hardly step onto the beach without one shooting out of the sand. The next island was overpopulated. It was as if they had returned home to an alternate reality, one where they had never had a boat to escape their home. The people there were starved. They only had so long left. However, the boat was full. No refugees could be taken. So it moved on, deeper and deeper into the endless ocean. Some say it may have reached salvation, an oasis in the middle of a salty sea. Some say it perished. It was never quite sea-worthy."

But they would not have to wait long for such a leader to emerge from the ashes of their destruction.\n\nAs the land was picked clean, a great man took the new islanders back to the sea, uniting them into a great seafaring tribe that would sail from island to island, gathering survivors. Eventually, their maritime dominion would stretch from Guinee to Bandachee, sweeping up the sickly and threadbare settlements of the land and teaching them the ways of the ocean, which provided sustenance and freedom so scarce on the ruined and barren earth. The people, grateful to their savior, would erect monuments in his honor in all of the places where he landed.\n\nThough the great leader would pass away eventually, his heroic exploits in the islands would not soon be forgotten. His empire would linger on for generations after his passing, and many would strive to emulate his example. None would succeed."

Merchants, kingsguards, all would notice the hulking mass of rusted steel. In other words, the thieves intent on relieving Mushtarri's Society of the Altar were running a fool's errand.\n\nEven so, he expected the B'orists to make a terrible fuss about the unexpected loss, and he prepared his statement in skin-parchment carefully. He emphasized that the Altars (more were being found each year, dredged out of pits in the lands to the South) represented not just the Birth-Forges and the Engines of Creation the B'orists believed they were descended from, but a slender connection to the Oldworld - a terrible, irretrievable loss for the whole of Mankind.\n\nPositioning his next words very carefully - B'orists were known for their emotional fragility and occasional bouts of violence - he commented that given the rich body of knowledge stored by the Monks of Moz'bik on this type of Altar was sufficiently comprehensive to understand its value, both as a Divine connection and as an artefact. It was known, for instance, that this Altar was called by the oldname "tanque", and that it fired "kanons", although what precisely those kanons had been or what they had used for their quivers no one could tell. He ended by pleading for time and patience, in hopes of an eventual solution.\n\nHe got his answer in the vivid descriptions of the Altar-Breaking. A group of ruffians from far in the Southlands had placed upon the Altar mounds of gunpowder-canisters, in a village sympathetic to their villainy, and chanting vanished slogans they had detonated the Altar upon a pyre of explosive death, taking themselves with it.

It was hard work, with all the rock formations and the tough terrain, and everyone could feel the exhaustion, but they knew they were close.\n\nJacob placed the final obstacles, and brought the wooden planks over to the beach. The weight was too much. He could not take it anymore. He dropped the materials, and he stumbled and fell on the scorching, golden sand of the coast. As he looked at the sea while still, he thought of this entire project. He knew the government was too divided and weak ever since the Event, and the Great Protection Project was nothing more than a distraction, a work of glory and pride for the country. In fact, they were looking to isolate themselves from the world forever and the great fortifications would help deter any invaders or, in the worst case, fight them back. The world after the Event was scary, they said. Allies were few, yet enemies were plenty, and no one could know if the Event could repeat itself, like some legends said it would. For the government, the only solution was to look inwards.\n\nJacob got back up. It only took a few hours until the sector was finished, and with it all of the Wall.

But for the herdsmen living in the largest desert on earth, wasteland had been their home long before the apocalypse. Their stories were always about struggling against the malice of nature and humanity, and after the apocalypse this would only continue.\n\nsAfter the detonations another tribe managed to trudge into the desert, arriving from the south. They hoped to find a little piece of oasis for themselves, if it existed for them to find. The desert, however, showed little mercy toward these newcomers, for she knew that their ways, the ways of roaring machinery and fireballs, were responsible for what happened to the world. In the end, the last survivor of this tribe, sitting alone in the boundless void, laid his head to rest and lost himself in his last nostalgic dream of a dead home.\n\nsA drum of hooves woke him up as he was drifting away. When he opened his dazed eyes, a group of local herdsmen had gathered around him and were whispering in a language that he had never bothered to understand. Then he found that some were pointing at the old swastika-shaped medal on his chest, and their expression quickly changed into disgust. They would want revenge, he thought, for their burning homes, shattered families and all the other sorrows they associated with that symbol.\n\nEventually, the herdsmen fell silent. The eldest one walked up to him and stared at his desperate face. After a moment of dead silence, the old herdsman put his right hand on his old uniform and tore the medal off. Then, a young child approached him, with a water pitcher in his hands.\n\nsThe pilot and the herdsmen never spoke a word to each other that day, but for the rest of his life, the old pilot always claimed that he had heard the most beautiful hymn of the desert in that moment."

As the "civilization" of old faded into myth, many of the peoples of Africa agreed that its demise was for the best, for it had brought nothing but horror and misery.\n\nThere was also rumor of another weapon. Perhaps not as lethal, but just as wicked. They called it the Devil's Breath. And while the other weapons of old became legend, the Devil's Breath remained very real, lying deep beneath the sulfurous earth, waiting for a new master.\n\nIn the lands of Zanzibar, over a dozen tribes fought a bloody, constant battle for control of the Swahili Coast. Their war had lasted for generations, with no side being able to gain the upper hand over the other. The warriors of each tribe fought with many weapons; spears, blades, even a few of the firearms from before the End. Though they fought ferociously, none had the power to break the deadlock.\n\nThen one day, the Warlord Kiira found it, buried in an ancient fortress of the Old World.

The mighty forces of his enemies sputtered and died in agony as the fumes of Hell swept battlefield after battlefield.

Whatever the cause, these people are known to assault and harass the shipping of all cities and tribes from Kibris to the Wall, their small, agile ships easily outmaneuvering and overcoming the huge cargo vessels of the more industrious inhabitants of the Middle Sea.

 RAD_AF.14.desc: "After the bombs fell and the fires washed the land of nearly all of its flora and fauna, the tribes of the Congo basin sought to carry on with their existence, returning to the days before the Europeans had come to their rainforests and savannahs. The Congo Basin itself, once the central hub for the region, had become a great sea of pollution that slowly killed the world around it. Its toxic waters spread like tendrils through the rivers of Africa, bringing decay to the soil and illness to the people. The tribes of the Basin departed, hoping to find places untouched by hellfire and rot where they could settle down, safe from the terrors of the ruined world. One tribe, its name long forgotten to the ages, traveled north-east. It was said that their ancestors had come from a land that straddled a great river, which stretched up to the very north of the continent. And so, seeing no other option the tribe set upon a journey sure to be long and arduous.\n\nPredatory animals were seldom a problem, as fire kept them away from tribe's camp. Other tribes did not cause trouble, for in those times all humans suffered the apocalypse's fire and through it a kinship was forged, the true killer was starvation. Food was scarce, no matter how far the tribe traveled from the tendrils of the poisoned basin. Water was precious, more so when it had to be boiled to cleanse the worst of its impurity. For months they traversed the rainforests and plains, their numbers dwindling all the while, but just as hopelessness might have set in a peculiar sign restored their courage. A cold, yet welcoming breeze guided them eastwards towards sloping, terrain. The breeze grewer stronger each day, and the terrain more mountainous, until finally opening up to reveal a great, green valley below. For the first time in too long, the tribe ate well. They slept beneath the towering mountains and marveled at the snow-capped peaks lit so brilliantly by the moonlight, the first snow they had ever seen in their lives. It is said that their descendants live in the valley to this day, and that the mountains beneath the moon are just as beautiful as when their ancestors first saw them."

His column had been trudging through the desert for near three months by the time his body sank into the dunes -- the Colonel had been unwilling to allow them any rest or respite as they marched only to what he called 'home'.\n\nNone of the hundred men who had escaped the Kuwait base's nuclear annihilation were ever seen again, lost to sands or sickness long before they could reach the Mediterranean Sea. But by chance or fate the young private had his body covered in the desert sand before it could decay or be ravaged by a hungry vulture. There it would remain, first for decades then centuries and finally millenia: when even old Roma itself was little more than a memory.\n\nBut what is hidden cannot remain so forever, and as the deserts became the focus of empires and states once more, the Private's body was uncovered by an aspiring archeologist. His uniform was threadbare, only tattered cloth, his weapons rusty but still intact, his bones bleached by endless years of sun. But it was the locket that caught the archaeologist's attention, and after seeking permission from the museum for which she worked the enterprising young woman undid a lock rusted shut by the ages, and found something truly unprecedented.\n\nA small photograph of a young woman, intact and untouched. Black of hair and dainty of features, thousands of years dead, yet her likeness remained intact for all the world to see. Perhaps it was fitting that such a picture survived the end of civilization while others did not."

He knew much of the world that had existed before the end of days, perhaps more than any man living thanks to the archives his madrassa had once held for safekeeping. Yet even so and despite the many things he had seen in his long years, the Mufti was astounded at the size of ruins, dwarfing even the mightiest fortresses of the Italie in the north.\n\nBut despite the ruins size and state, the Mufti could see little evidence of the fires which brought down the old world. The historian within him could only wonder what had driven his ancient forebears to abandon such a place, a curse perhaps? Or a foe that could not be defeated? The reasons for its abandonment ultimately did not matter, since without the shelter that the massive series of caves and carved stone buildings provided there was no way his caravan of refugees would survive the week.\n\nThe Mufti and his followers did not stay overly long, gathering their strength within the ruins for only a month before setting out once again in search of a permanent home, one they would eventually find in the distant future. The only sign of their inhabitance of the old ruin being a series of minarets erected so as to pray. But the tale they told would spread knowledge of this strange mystery of the ancients far and wide.\n\nItalien Legionari would pass it by on raids towards the holy cities. Traders and pilgrims alike would mark it as a waypoint on their journeys across the orient.

Without their Caliph however their faith is shattered and disunited, and it is unlikely our foes the Desert Foxes can sway them from our side. Indeed, the Italien have ever since their conquest by your honoured grandfather been loyal servants of your house, the horsemen and men at arms they provide in tribute have been part of many a successful campaign and even to this day they man the border forts of the silted channel.\n\nBut oh Sultan of Sultans, be wary of the Italien lest they grow too influential in their dealings within our realm. Never must a single of their Ceptina's rise too far above the others and be a potential threat, nor must they be allowed to solely guard the palace, lest you or your sons find yourselves at their mercies one day.\n\nAs the clerics of old said, keep your allies close, and your enemies closer."

But even though the impact was lessened by the time the apocalypse started the lions of Africa were barely clinging to life in the outskirts of their former ranges.\n\nIn a curious turn of fate however, the nuclear apocalypse that spelled doom for so much of humanity also represented the salvation of the big cats, a few lean years aside much of their range was now human free. Unnoticed by mankind, the lions began to reoccupy their former range, from the scattered Afrikaner territories in the south all the way up to the Nile Delta. It was to be there on the shores of the Red Sea that a single, minor event that had not happened in millenia occured.\n\nA pride of lions twelve strong moved across the silted up canal that had once been the most important trade artery in the world.

They discussed their homes, their families, the land which they called home, and they discussed trade between their two fledgling nations.\n\nThose from the north had much livestock, and they lived on a beautiful oasis, the likes of which were envied by many throughout the Lyvan. The tribe of the south, however, lived on fertile land, and, though they were sometimes short on water, could grow large amounts of food, and their weavings and dances were also envied by the people of the Lyvan.\n\nIn the past, they had been great enemies; for generations they had fought and died over the smallest scraps, and sometimes even less than that. But the tribes now knew that in spite of all of their differences, the same red blood ran through their veins, the same love for their families filled their hearts, and the same hope for the future permeated their very souls. The violence would end today.\n\nThey clasped each other's arms, embraced one another, and swore on their families that they would no longer war over the smallest scraps of food, but instead protect and feed one another. They were now a family, in their own way.\n\nThe peace could not last forever, everyone knew, but the memory of this day would not be forgotten. For years to come, the two tribes would work together to feed their families, build their own towns and cities, and protect the land they all loved so much.\n\nAnd so it was that the Ya'srael and the Pa'lestin tribes made peace, after so many years of heartache and despair."

Hussein stared aimlessly into the distance - his sight having been taken long ago - as he idly poked at their campfire with a stick.\n\n"Jadda Hus?" Masud piped up, sitting up from his slumber. "What was life like? When you were my age?"\n\nHussain was silent for a moment. Memories, both traumatic and pure, flooded his mind's eye, and he spent a moment contemplating. Finally, he replied, "It was better, and worse in ways. We had more to eat, a house to call our own. We had a lot of things. But there were bad things as well." "Italians?" offered Masud, innocently, eliciting a chuckle from Hussein.\n\n"Yes, I always did hate their constant marching. They took a lot from us, though they were no different than many who came before. That's one thing that's better now. There's nobody else above us, see? We are our own people again. But..."\n\nHis mind's eye filled with an almighty flash, total and all encompassing, along with a memory of searing pain followed by darkness. He absent-mindedly rubbed at the burn scars on his arm.

A silence fell between the two, and Masud returned to his stargazing. Alone with his thoughts, Hussein contemplated the past that had been taken from them, and the future that lay ahead.

Yet life is not a kind mistress, and one day the life of Fatima was changed forever when she looked upon the skies. Hanging like angels, and making a noise like thunder were six flying machines. Moving faster even than the falcons that Fatima raised for the mayor to hunt with. But these machines were not angelic in purpose, and from their bellies they dropped fire and death. The street where Fatima had walked after her wedding day was incinerated, the mayor and his palace were obliterated, and even the camel racing tack was scorched by great plumes of fire and metal.\n\nAt first Fatima could do nothing but stare in horror, until a small buzzing noise emerged from over the horizon. Faltering a smoking, juddering in the air, was Old Jabal and his flying machine. With fire of his own he struck down four of his foes and sent the other two fleeing to the west, yet during the battle he was struck, and when the village reached the place where his machine had come down, they found it intact, Jabal smiling, unmoving in his seat."

Imam's salt-and-pepper beard had grown more salt than pepper by now, and he walked with a limp as old men do.

The young man remained confused: again with the Allah. Who is Allah? But Mama called for him suddenly, and Imam urged the young man to go.\n\nMore years passed, and the young man became a grown man. Imam no longer left the tower, so weak had he become. Still, he refused to take the medicine the villagers offered.

Still, it was inevitable that they would be forced to deal with the consequences of such an extraordinary event sooner or later, as they well knew even if none vocalized the thought. They predicted this correctly, although none of them could have possibly imagined their point of contact with the after effects of the destruction of civilization would play out the way it did.\n\nIt was perhaps a week or more after the band first encountered the refugee who relayed the grim news that they came across the boy. His parents had evidently taken him in an ill-conceived attempt to flee the danger by heading into the relatively safe desert. They had not managed to make it very far at all though, and the parents in question lay dead around the small child, as if they intended to shield him in their final act.\n\nFor a group like the band that lived in the harsh environment of the desert by remaining as efficient as possible with all advisable resources, the idea of taking on a non-productive, attention requiring new member was downright dangerous, and yet, looking at the child, the head of the band felt moved to his core. In this time of great suffering for all mankind, it did not matter in the least that the child was not their own, it made no difference that upon his head sat a yarmulke, or that the band was all Muslim.

Are you so foolish as to think that we will ever have anything in common with the sedentary peoples of Arrak and Ayran? We are nomads - conquerors, not the conquered!\n\nMy warriors and I come for you, Kyzyl Khan! For your betrayal of Great Tengri, we shall cast down your idols, burn your wheat-fields and turn your palace into another smouldering ruin to be numbered amongst the thousands that litter the land! Nothing shall remain of you! You may have your vaunted farmlands with which to feed your men, but the Black Horde needs nothing more than guns and blades of iron to tear your pitiful realm to bloody pieces! Face me, if you dare!\n\nSo speaks Cherna Khan, Warlord of the Black Horde and Khan of Ayran and Arrak!\n\n(Found scrawled on a stone tablet in the ruins of the old Ayranian capital)"

 RAD_ME.20.desc: "If only the people who lived in the generation of the Flood and the people of the World Before had given tzedakah, they would not have perished.\n\nThose words had been drilled into Moizhe's ears more times than he could remember. His mother always said that "Charity is the greatest mitsvoh." What exactly a mitsvoh was, no one really knew. All that mattered was that their ancestors had believed in them, and thus they were important - the men in the World Before hadn't remembered that lesson, and for that they were punished with the Flood. Now all his tribe - the Hisrelites - could do was wander in the desert.\n\nThe oldest members of his tribe told him stories about the World Before when he was a child. This land had a different name, long ago. The people called it the Levynt. It was said that they had great machines, melted from iron and rock, that could carry you anywhere you wished. They could even master the winds and fly across the world. Moizhe wasn't sure if it was true, but what was undeniable was that the World Before had existed. He had seen the ruins himself.\n\nIt was those in those ruins where his tribe found themselves now, face to face with another struggling family. At first, Moizhe was scared of these outsiders. He wanted nothing else but to leave them to starve. Who were these people to ask for his tribe's hard earned food? He was shocked at first when his mother gave them food, shocked still when his father did the same.\n\nThen he came to something of a revelation, there in the dunes. They were all in this together, weren't they? In the end, they were all human. And so Moizhe found himself brought before a hungry child, and he knelt before her and offered half of his dinner for the evening - a date, one of the few he had ever found. As the little girl smiled at him, he found himself understanding the meaning of the word mitsvoh at last."

With my steeds of iron, I conquered the riverlands of Arrak, laying down the yoke of the Red Horde from mountain to sea. On this very spot, I received the submission of the peasant folk, who swore eternal fealty to the bloodline of Momush Khan, First Khan of the Red Horde.\n\nLet it be known that I was terrible in battle, yet magnanimous in victory. Those who submitted to my rule have prospered as never before. Not even in the Years of Dissolution, before Great Tengri unleashed fire upon this unworthy earth, did the land of Arrak know peace and tranquility such as Kyzyl Khan has imposed upon it.\n\nLet it be known that even the fallen cities betwixt the Twin Rivers are part of the domain of the Kyzyl Khan. The blood of Momush Khan does not fear the dust and ashes left behind by those judged unworthy to walk upon Great Tengri's sacred earth. The sages and shamans were in accordance that the poison spirits who once blighted the land had passed on, fleeing before the Red Horde's advance. In their wake lay a trove of treasures bestowed by Great Tengri, a blessing for his chosen son: guns, mechanical steeds, and enough food to feed the entire Red Horde for a decade! Yet, let it be known that Kyzyl Khan was no petty warlord who acted in pursuit of wealth - he shared the fruits of Heaven with the people of the riverlands, that they might recognise the just and pious nature of his rule.\n\nLet it be known that it was here, at the crossroads of the world and among the ashes of empires, that the Red Horde found its home. Here, the fires of war were tamed to forge an iron-wrought peace, hard-won and well-deserved. Here, Kyzyl Khan decreed that the time for battle had passed, and that Great Tengri's approval had finally been earned. Here, the world began again."

Drifting down the Nile, towards the north, he would trade what little he had for what little they would give. He settled in a little rebuilt village, just north of the first cataract. In time, he would create a family, and a lineage.\n\nHis descendants would float down the same Nile. His son grew to be a hardy young man, and he departed from the little town to the settlements farther north. There he met a young woman. They had three daughters. One was a stillbirth. The other died of malaria just before she became a proper woman. The final one looked south and wished to take the occupation of those before her. She returned to the little village that her grandfather had lived in and watched as the laborers toiled to build a palace, with pillars and swirling friezes that told stories of the gods and the ones before them. At the plaza, she bought the work of these skilled craftsmen. The village was more than just a village, now. Perhaps the woman could sell them for more past the cataracts.\n\nSo past the cataracts she went, into the ancient land far south. The people there were strange and disfigured, of multiple heads and singular limbs. They were the stuff of nightmares. The first of her family to be literate she kept an account.\n\nOn her return to the homeland, she passed on the texts to a group of children, who asked for her to teach them of the lands and of reading. In time, more came to teach the children, and more learned men and women spread stories of lands afar. In time, the most esteemed university in the Old Crescent was founded."

 RAD.1.desc: "Long after the world as its people knew it changed forever, some where determined to find a new home. As the days and months passed in the Ruins, rumors spread of what happened to the people who lived there. Diseases and changes in the body, they said, and those who lived far from the land had no such problems. The residents of the Ruins had to leave in search of a better habitat.\n\nThe most cunning immediately prepared for departure. Those who wanted to leave did so, leaving behind them the Elders, the older generation who did not believe that it was worth it to leave. Soon, they found different Ruins, and settled yet again. But they were not so lucky, and diseases plagued the group. Yet again, they left, but in whatever Ruins they settled in, it was the same story, with few changes. Some thought that perhaps they were wrong all along. The only solution was to abandon all Ruins, forever.\n\nYears later, a caravan of traders from the Elders went further than ever before. They reached the mountain, where, after months of a hard journey, they finally met civilization. To their surprise, though, the group was not alien; they spoke the same language, and had the same customs. They were one and the same. In an act of solidarity and love for them, they decided to leave their settlement behind forever. However, some of the Mountaineers, as the original settlers had been named, were not so keen on the idea. One night, after a long streak of drinks to forget their hard life, a group of the Mountaineers grabbed their guns under the inflammatory speeches of their leader, claiming they were infected with the Plague, and headed for the mountainside. As they knew too well in these last few weeks, that was where their new "friends" had set up camp. The next day, news would arrive of a massacre on the refugee camp. Some were just too afraid of their horrible past coming back to haunt them."

All that could be seen in their faces were their eyes, which only demonstrated their brutality through their look. Within less than a minute, the entire building had been cleared and the group had confirmed that no one was in there. What seemed odd for such a suburban house was that there were practically no useful resources in it. No matter how hard the bandits looked, and how many items and furniture they turned upside down, they were all gone. But there was no sign of anyone else breaking into the house earlier. All their questions were answered and their suspicions were confirmed when a sneeze was heard.\n\nOne single sneeze was enough. One member found the trap door hidden in plain sight, and quickly picked the lock which held the secret chamber closed. Two men went down the hatch, and what they found was a gold mine. Loads of supplies, from food to equipment and a first aid kit. And there, sitting innocently in a corner, was a man. It was dark, so he was pulled out and thrown against a wall, a rare rifle pressing on the back of his head. The chief himself was ready to fire on him.\n\n"We could use someone like him." The voice was heard from the back, by one of the younger bandits. "To survive that long, literally for months, in a makeshift bunker, you need some skills. And, for a man in his 50s, he seems surprisingly fit." The chief looked back at the man, and exclaimed: "Join us, or die!"\n\nThe man hesitated for a second.\n\n"Give me the mask" he replied."

 RAD.3.desc: "The object was found just outside of the village, when the workers dug out a space to bury their waste. The villagers called it "the Tube", for its unusual shape they had never encountered before. It was a long cylinder, with two large extensions that looked like wings. When they broke the door they found only after hours of searching, its interior was revealed. The seats with weird shapes were torn out of the floor, broken down and used in the village. The cloth covering the windows was used for fabric, and the metal was melted by the local smith. He was quite proud of the tools he made, and he even made some toys for the children.\n\nThen, one day, as he was helping take apart the Tube for its useful materials, a young boy saw something no one else had seen. A door. At the front of the interior, a door could faintly be seen, despite all the dust and erosion. The boy pushed it, and it swung wide open. His jaw dropped as he looked at the room he had discovered. Thousands of buttons, levers, and even some weird rectangles with no use could be seen on every wall and table. But, in the end, the space was of no use. Within a week, the Front Room was empty, all of it vandalized.\n\nThe years passed, and the Tube became useless, nothing but a chunk of metal. And there were even talks of it being entirely melted, but that discussion stopped abruptly, when a raid by a nearby warlord destroyed the village in its entirety. It was burnt to the ground, and those who could fled to wherever was possible. But one family would not let their heritage go that quickly. A man, once an innocent child that had discovered a special section of the Tube, and his family, entered it as their settlement was in flames. Being a safe haven in the temporary chaos, the family set up a new house. They stayed quiet, completely silent until the army left. And when they did, all of the Tube and its surroundings were there for them to enjoy."

It was not a comfortable bed, like those that he had experienced before the Atomic War, but a makeshift one, uncomfortably placed between the dozens of others in the large empty space of the complex. However, he was not ill, nor did he have any medical problem, aside from the mild doses of radiation.\n\nHe was awake before anyone else, as it was still quite early in the morning. Trying to keep quiet, he slowly moved his limbs and tried to get up and leave the bed. He exited the room, and thought of what that room was before the Atomic War. Likely nothing more than a basement, or a storage space for equipment and resources. But now, as people from all over the city flooded the complex, there was no choice but to fit many there. Mark saw a window, and peeked under the curtain covering it, letting a few bright rays of the morning sun flood the hallway. Chaos reigned down in the streets, as military vehicles fought rioters, and innocent civilians tried to reach the hospital.\n\nHe went down the stairs, and as he did so, he could hear the first voices from the main floor below. Doctors rushing to move and give instructions, and people screaming and crying, afraid of their lives. When he reached the floor, this was further confirmed. He struggled to move through the "refugees" flooding the hallways. He reached the secretary's office, and asked if he could leave. Her reply was "Are you serious?", but on a second thought, she wouldn't mind one less person in this chaos "You could, if you wanted. But can you lend us a hand right now?" she added. Mark thought about it, and immediately asked for instructions on how to help. He knew that by the afternoon, he would be out of this place.

For 8 minutes, the traffic had not moved one inch on the highway. 8 minutes and 1 second. 2 seconds. 3 seconds. He looked outside. As always, cars could be seen for kilometers ahead. Near him, a fistfight had broken out between two strangers. One of them pulled out a gun, ending the argument quickly. Then, he saw some people taking the insane decision to abandon their cars, and make a run for it on foot. Insane, right? Or was it?\n\nHe quickly opened the seat's door. He took the backpack of supplies he had brought with him, and started running. He ran along the road, occasionally stepping on vehicles, and did not stop for any reason. Those who watched Michael lost track of him when he slipped through the dense trees, heading for the forest.\n\nRunning was getting exhausting. With every step he took, he felt like a giant carrying his entire weight. He continued running, not stopping until the dark covered the sky, and the night set in. However, surviving these 8 hours of darkness in the woods was not as simple as Michael thought. Animals were easy to fight with a Swiss army knife and a torch; other humans, not so much. Exhausted and injured, he eventually sat down under a tree. He stayed there, until the sun finally rose over the horizon. Except it was not the sun, but a device of destruction. The view of the explosion would surely be majestic, but would only last for a second before causing complete blindness. Instead, Michael waited patiently for the shockwave to come, just like last time, and it came, throwing him down. Once that was done, he knew there was only one option.

As soon as the small box was handed to the local government, the two best past-seekers in town were called. Under their watch, so many ancient objects had been unveiled, and so many secrets solved. Surely they could figure out the function of such a small and simple item.\n\nWhen they received it, the past-seekers were perplexed. For hours, they tried to solve the riddle they had been given, but to no avail. After almost a week, there were no results, and it seemed as if the black box would remain a mystery forever. And that was when the most elderly person in the town came to the rescue. The 80-year old was the grand-daughter of a local warlord, who himself was member of a generation of scientists. When she was a child, she would hear stories about such mysterious devices and their function.\n\nShe met the past-seekers, and the three got to work. Eventually, they cracked the secret: it was on the inside. Of course, opening the belly of such an object seemed difficult, but anything was possible if one was cunning and used the proper knife. Unfortunately, opening the Box up only made things more difficult. An endless bundle of strings, small rectangles and metal parts appeared before their eyes.\n\nIn the end, the riddle of the Box was never solved. However, the children of those who spent years on trying to solve them inherited their knowledge, and their children did as well.

Even the oldest of the town's inhabitants had passed away peacefully, and there was no one to relay the experiences from before the Event. And so, it was slowly forgotten. But one small town had the luck of re-discovering it.\n\nIn the area around the central square, a box was discovered in the ground. While some did not pay much attention, those who did soon saw how precious it was. Once it had been opened, it was a window into the life before the Event. Most had no idea of how that was, but all the information they could have asked for was in there: the way of life, culture, technology, even what some guessed were texts and images regarding politics and foreign affairs, but that they could not comprehend. A handful of objects complimented the rest of the content. The box was opened publicly in an event at the local school, and all the residents were happy to attend. The next weeks would be dominated by the "History Craze", as all everyone ever cared about was the past they had discovered. And, as time passed, that knowledge would be relayed and forgotten, like dust in the wind. But the town would make sure to leave its own mark in history. A few days after the discovery of the box, the mayor celebrated the creation of the town's own "Box for the Future", to be buried and not opened until much later in the future. And in the same spot where the original box had been discovered, a new one took its place, as a guide of history for generations to come."

Above all of that, though, beyond the world that man created and then destroyed, artifacts of humanity still survived, intact. At least one was still functioning.\n\nR4O was the fourth and final in a series of Earth observation satellites, the "Reconnaissance & Observation" line, launched by the United States for dual military and scientific purposes in the 1960's. The satellites proved entirely worthless in doing anything but alerting the White House that certain destruction was imminent once the missiles started shooting, but it would be their observation capacities that would prove more useful to mankind, long after the concept of military utility became moot.\n\nThree of the four, along with most artificial satellites around Earth, would cease functioning after the apocalypse occurred, and eventually come crashing down to the surface in a blaze of fire. R4O's course was expertly placed, however, and most importantly of all, the remote station back on the surface that fed her instructions was both automated and escaped the blasts unscathed. When billions of men and women died on that fateful day, R4O kept right on watching them. It watched thousands of lights that once illuminated the blue marble at night die all at once, the millions of people who once relied on them dead and gone. But it also saw something more interesting. Something more inspiring.

It saw the greatest and worst of man's works melded tighter into one terrible, beautiful cacophony of sights and sounds and smells. It looked upon the despair and sorrow and horror of a world turned completely upside down.\n\nBut within its all illuminating, all seeing vision, it also saw the triumph and perseverance of humanity. It saw the survival, the heroic sacrifices, and the will to live no matter the challenge. It saw the plants as they looked up in response to its call, it heard the singing of birds and it saw the animals who emerged from their dens as if, with its coming, the fear of all consuming, irreversible finality had left with the receding night.\n\nAs the scattered remnants of the human race saw its arrival, they were filled with a new courage and reassurance, for even after all that had happened, the dawn had still come to banish the black night."

A cosmological oddity soon lost to the ravages of time.\n\nIt started in different ways, in different places, and some took longer than others. But the first commemorations of the old world began a year to the day after the bombs fell - give or take a few sunrises. In Germany, the shattered remnants of battalions would hold mock gun salutes for their fallen brothers, only conserving their ammunition to face the horrors of the end. In America, priests and their flocks found whatever safe places they could to plant hundreds of crosses, to honor the fallen patriots. In Japan, shrines were constructed from scrap metal and rubble and whatever other detritus could be scavenged, to bring peace to restless spirits.\n\nIt was ad hoc, at first, and the people only gave it their effort if they could afford to take time away from survival.

In Britain, survivors would lay out poppies and wreaths of whatever other flowers could be found in memory of the ghosts of Albion. In Russia, men would meet on the day to drink to the memory of the lost sons of the motherland. From the Americas to Oceania, from the depths of Africa to the far reaches of Asia, the dead would be honored.\n\nEven as the last vestiges of the Old World became myth and the memory of what exactly was being commemorated was forgotten, cultures continued to mourn what was lost. The Empire State would devote parades and poems to the ancestors lost to the ancient flame. The Muhlar tribe would hold a great hunt every year on what they believed to be the day of the end. In Zion prayers would be held within the dome of the Third Temple to give blessings to the ancient dead and thanks for their own survival.\n\nOne day, a man would set foot on the moon, and find an ancient, bleached flag.

In that moment, millions of scientists, and historians, and archeologists sat mouths agape, as what was once a fairy tale passed down from time immemorial sat as if in defiance of these new interlopers.\n\nCarefully they removed the flag, and replaced it with their own.
