 SWI_Federal_Council: "Federal Council"
 POLITICS_FEDERAL_COUNCIL_FULL_POWERS_DESC: "In one of its many peculiarities, Switzerland does not have a head of state, instead their representation is collectively vested in a council of eight. These eight politicians are elected from the Swiss legislature, from varied parties and regions. Though the Federal Council may hold a diversity of background and political opinion, its members must abide by any policies the council has decided on, encouraging compromise and consensus. Nonetheless many criticize the council's opaque operations and the way more unorthodox views can be subsumed into a moderate consensus.\n\nThe Full Powers Regime is the nickname given to the coalition that has ruled Switzerland since the outbreak of European war in the 1939, and took on emergency powers. What started out as a continuation of Swiss consensus politics within unprecedented times has now turned into widespread surveillance, political repression, and erosion of democratic norms are now commonplace. While the FPR is composed of a varied coalition of the FP, KKP, and SP, in practice it maintains a conservative politics representing the interests of businessmen and the military. Moreover economic malaise in part caused by the acquiescence to Italian economic domination and austerity policies have made them deeply unpopular. Many hope that the FPR's days are numbered, but their sheer power and influence remain a formidable obstacle."

 SWI_Paul_Chadet_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Swiss Confederation, Head of the Department of Home Affairs\nPaternalistic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LIt is perhaps fitting that the prime mover of the borderline-authoritarian clique running Switzerland's liberal democracy would be a man of equally baffling contradictions. Despite his lifelong membership in the FDP Paul Chaudet has always had a close association with the right wing. Entering politics in the fight against a hated wine tax, he forged an alliance with the agrarian fascist pressure group, the Ligue Vaudoise to secure its repeal and the everlasting gratitude of wine growers across the land.\n\nHis idiosyncratic policies served him well in the conflict averse realm of Swiss politics, eventually leading to his election to the Federal Council. In the almost decade since assuming office, Chaudet has consolidated the power of the Full Powers Regime and oversaw years of austerity and repression. But just like so many years ago, sometimes it takes hard choices to serve the common good.§!"
 SWI_Fritz_Grutter_for_desc: "§YHead of the Federal Political Department\nProgressive Liberalism§!\n--------------\n§LAs a lifelong member of the Socialist Party, Fritz Grütter saw firsthand the systematic repression his party faced for decades. It is then unsurprising that Grütter considers the entrance of SP into the Federal Council to be the shining achievement of his career. However, many in the party see the price to enter the mainstream as being far too high. His participation in the suppression of labor and the austerity policies of the Full Powers Regime that made him an extremely divisive figure on the left. He now faces the increasingly powerful contingent on the left who want to throw out the current coalition in its entirety. As foreign minister, Grütter was obliged to sign the hated Treaty of Lugano. Many hope that in the closed door negotiations, he offered at least a token resistance.§!"
 SWI_Henry_Schmitt_eco_desc: "§YHead of the Department of Finance and Customs\nClassical Liberalism§!\n--------------\n§LDespite his modest upbringing in Geneva, Henri Schmitt's charisma and intelligence made him one of the most dynamic voices for the FDP in local city politics. His rise to the role of federal councillor, despite only being 33 years of age, has been seen by many as a cynical attempt to improve the Full Powers Regime's reputation with the alienated youth.\n\nThe young councillor has quickly set to work trying to prove his critics wrong. Under Schmitt's leadership the Department of Economic Affairs have been developing a plan to diversify the Swiss economy away from Italian control by attracting investment from the OFN and Sphere particularly in the realm of tourism. Whether this will be enough to turn around the fortunes of the increasingly unpopular Full Powers Regime in the eyes of voters remains to be seen.§!"
 SWI_Ludwig_von_Moos_sec_desc: "§YHead of the Department of Justice and Police\nNational Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LFrom his early days as a judge to his rise to power in the KKP, the preservation of the Swiss way of life has always been at the forefront of Ludwig von Moos's mind. Entering the Federal Council in the aftermath of the Alpine Crisis in 1956, Von Moos has overseen the slow shift in Switzerland towards a police state with the Regime's increasingly draconian approach to law enforcement and surveillance as well the sponsoring of various paramilitary organizations. Indeed many fear von Moos's creations have gained a life of their own, forming a shadowy network of extralegal soldier spies bending Switzerland to their will.\n\nWhile von Moos's commitment to liberal democracy may be up for debate, his drive to see Switzerland come out of the 20th century in one piece has never been in question.§!"
 
 #Ideas
 SWI_Reigns_of_the_Full_Powers_Regime: "Reign of the Full Powers Regime"
 SWI_Reigns_of_the_Full_Powers_Regime_desc: "Coming into power in response to the outbreak of WW2, the Full Powers Regime has ruled for over two decades. Building on precedents in the Swiss constitution, the FPR have utilized emergency powers to preserve a strict vision of Swiss security. They have cracked down on any perceived opposition in the name of national security. Also controversially, the FPR have centralized power in the hands of the Federal Council in a shift away from traditional Swiss federalism.\n\nMany aspects of Swiss democracy have been eroded in order to enforce this status quo. Surveillance, secret police, and corruption are rife, but many have begun to tire of this eternal emergency and the regime faces threats from across the political spectrum."
 SWI_Scars_of_the_Alpine_Crisis: "Scars of the Alpine Crisis"
 SWI_Scars_of_the_Alpine_Crisis_desc: "Switzerland only narrowly avoided German invasion in the Alpine Crisis of 1955. Still, the trauma of the fall of Liechtenstein and the threat of Germany are omnipresent. The aging General Guisan initiated a massive military expansion, including widespread fortifications and the training of paramilitary "stay behind" armies to continue resistance after occupation. Yet some of these forces have begun to take on a life of their own, exerting influence far outside the realm of the military."
 SWI_Perchtas_Final_Hunt: "Perchta's Final Hunt"
 SWI_Perchtas_Final_Hunt_desc: "Switzerland, once the financial powerhouse of yesteryear, has been drowned in the wake of the new Europe. The '55 German embargo threw the Swiss economy into freefall, crashing its banks and leaving the state bankrupt. Soon after came the signing of the Treaty of Lugano with Italy, forgiving Swiss debts, but putting the economy under the control of foreign oligarchs and eviscerating labor. The economy shows little signs of recovery, and the people grow angrier with each passing paycheck."
 SWI_National_Tapestry: "A National Tapestry"
 SWI_National_Tapestry_desc: "Owing to its origins as a self-defense pact of autonomous farming communities, Switzerland is a confederation in every sense of the word. Significant power is delegated to local Cantons and Communes. In order to keep their ramshackle collection of nationalities and polities afloat, self-governance and compromise pervade the institutions at all levels. While this system might hinder change and face challenges from modernity, it has helped the Swiss to maintain a modicum of stability and unity."
 
 #Events
 SWI_ITA.1.t: "A Stranger in Bern"
 SWI_ITA.1.desc: "Bern smelled worse than usual, Fabio Bertralli thought to himself as he hurried down the cobblestone street. Just as he felt he was adapting to life in Switzerland, the garbageman would decide to go on strike again. Indeed, they were among the few professions for which striking had not been outright banned in recent years - one of many conditions that had led his father's business to establish a new office here. Sarrano SA was the leading biotechnology firm in the Empire, and it was only natural to move to take advantage of the greener pastures of the Alps with its borderline criminal tax breaks and benefits for Italian businesses. Passing by a derelict bunker, Bertralli noticed a gaggle of vagabonds huddling together for warmth. All good things had their price, he thought.\n\nFinally reaching his office, he was struck by how the ornate architecture of the old business district clashed so drastically with the gaudy signs for Italian corporate offices. This feeling was only enhanced by another unwelcome sight; a graffiti message on his firm's door rattling off a list of anti-Italian remarks. Sighing, Bertralli walked into the office, where he prepared to greet Adelaide, the handsome woman he had just hired as secretary. But then something caught his attention, an alien but pleasant smell than the streets, that of a piped tobacco. "And just who, my dear, is interrupting our early morning chats," he asked.\n\n"He didn't say. I may have misheard, but he mentioned wanting to speak with you about something related to industrial applications for anthrax." she replied nervously. An odd choice of conversation, Bertralli thought. He made a turn towards the hallway, where emerging from the shadows with nary a creak of a floorboard was a bespectacled man with a bushy mustache and finely tailored suit.\n\n"I apologize for coming unannounced, Mr. Bertralli, we have much to discuss." Before Bertralli had time to respond, the man stuck out his hand and spoke in Germanic tinged Italian."
 SWI_ITA.1.a: ""It's a pleasure to finally meet you, my name is Bachmann, Albert Bachmann.""
 
 SWI_ITA.2.t: "Something Wicked..."
 SWI_ITA.2.desc: "For the past week, walking the streets of Bern, Fabio Bertralli could not shake the feeling that something had gone horribly wrong. The signs were subtle at first; the looks of paranoia of pedestrians as they shuffled by without eye contact, the sense of looming dread. Everyone had heard the rumors of imminent chaos in the halls of power, but there was no news, no pronouncements, only deathly silence. Soon after were the disappearances. The leftist agitator in the town square, the homeless beggar on the street corner, the student in the café, his dear Adelaide, it was as if with each passing day, the city was consuming its former inhabitants. Whether it was fear keeping them away or worse. Bertralli could not say. Then came the strangers. Men from out of town in distinctive uniforms, some wandering the streets menacing passersby, others holing up in bunkers and bomb shelters preparing for... something.\n\nBertralli breathed a sigh of relief when he reached his destination without a hitch, a gentlemen's club in the heart of the city. Walking in, he was again struck by the quiet. The few patrons seemed to be huddled in corners, whispering among each other. Then he saw him. Seated near the window staring off into the gray overcast, was Albert Bachmann. Noticing him, Bachmann turned and raised his pipe, smiling at Bertalli and motioning for him to take a seat. "In thirty-seven hours, our mutual friends will be making an announcement. I thought you deserved to be made aware ahead of time."\n\nBertralli sat down, a cold bead of sweat passed down his cheek. "What has happened, Bachmann? What have you done?" Bertralli sputtered.\n\n"You flatter me, my friend, We all had our role to play, including you." Bachmann replied, filling two glasses with a dark red liquor.\n\n"To what end?" Bertralli said, shivering, as Bachmann raised his glass in toast."
 SWI_ITA.2.a: ""To the only end that matters. The salvation of the Confederation.""
