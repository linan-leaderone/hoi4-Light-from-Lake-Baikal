 ### IDEAS ###
 DST_OST_focus:0 "Dethrone the Pretender"
 DST_OST_focus_desc:0 "Stahlecker comfortably sits upon his Rigan throne, unrightfully swept from Drechsler. Such a usurper grows only more legitimate, and thus only more dangerous, for each day he continues to draw breath. As such, all efforts are focused upon crushing Stahlecker and his merry band of traitors. The rest of the circus can wait."
 DST_BLR_focus:0 "Crush the Traitors"
 DST_BLR_focus_desc:0 "Vituska and his separatists plague our easternmost extremities, terrorizing us from the border of Moskowien, and if they have their way, all the way to Riga. A strong message will be sent that separatists will not be suffered. We shall put down the Belarussian uprising at once and make sure the traitor Vituska hangs."
 DST_MST_focus:0 "Silence the Liberals"
 DST_MST_focus_desc:0 "Andreas Meyer-Landrut and his ramshackle uprising of liberals and students ravage the cities of central Ostland. If we are to ever have peace of mind again, an example must be made of such ne'er-do-wells. We shall ensure that the liberal riff raff never again finds the will to cause disorder in our streets again."
 DST_JST_focus:0 "Burn the Fanatics"
 DST_JST_focus_desc:0 "The fanatics of the SchutzStaffel will stop at nothing to tear apart the fabric of the Reichskommissariat. Not even defeat will silence those radicals. We may only rely upon complete and total destruction to quell this treason. If we must salt the earth to ensure that these men never again crawl from the shadows, so be it."
 DST_UPO_focus:0 "Contain the Partisans"
 DST_UPO_focus_desc:0 "The only measure effective in bringing an end to the indiscriminate murder of Germans throughout Ostland at the hands of partisans is unrelenting force. With all fire focused upon Kovner and his partisans, we shall surely triumph in due time, and once again bring safety and security to the Germans settled throughout Ostland."
 DST_last_push:0 "The Final Push"
 DST_last_push_desc:0 ""
 
 ### NATIONAL FOCUS ###
 DST_the_rightful_heir:0 "The Rightful Heir"
 DST_the_rightful_heir_desc:0 "Lohse is dead, but there is no time for Ostland to mourn. Threats have arisen in every direction, from rivals for Lohse's legacy to Belarusian peasant uprisings to men from the woods hell bent on revenge. Whilst the others who claim the title of Reichskommissar are either limp-wristed pencil pushers or SS dogs under the pay of Burgundy, only Drechsler has the steel to put down these rebels and restore Ostland to its place as the vigilant border guard of the Reich."
 DST_appeal_to_the_berserkers:0 "Release the Berserkers"
 DST_appeal_to_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Like the Norsemen of old, Germans have spread their culture across Europe with fire and sword. The Wiking blood still flows through our veins, and it is in defending our homeland that we will release its strength. They struck fear into the hearts of our enemies with their furious berserkers, and we shall raise a division to hold that berserker spirit in their hearts. Whilst our enemies are either ill-trained peasants or lions led by sheep, our shield-biters will always prevail."
 DST_a_gun_under_every_blade_of_grass:0 "A Gun Under Every Blade of Grass"
 DST_a_gun_under_every_blade_of_grass_desc:0 "Not one step of soil can be lost in this battle for Ostland's existence. Every town occupied by the partisans provides more peasants to join their cause, every step back from the traitor forces an unconscionable humiliation. Every German must be armed, for this is their fight - and those few natives we can trust as well. With a rifle behind every tree, a mine under every road, our enemies will fear to tread on our soil."
 DST_penal_latvian_divisions:0 "Penal Latvian Divisions"
 DST_penal_latvian_divisions_desc:0 "The Balts occupy a peculiar position in the racial hierarchy, neither pure like the Aryans nor unworthy of life like the Slavs. This has served them well enough that the labour camps are filled with Latvian criminals and dissidents, diligently working for the benefit of the Reich, being spared to work another day. Whilst no doubt they are filled with pride at serving their superiors, the battlefield calls for them.\n\nThe front lines always need bodies, and while Balts may not display Aryan strength and discipline, a body is a body. Put a rifle in their hands and point them towards the enemy, and they will keep shooting so long as they feel the whip on their backs."
 DST_conscript_lithuanian_germans:0 "Conscript the Lithuanian Germans"
 DST_conscript_lithuanian_germans_desc:0 "The Germans in Litauen are lucky enough to be far from the front lines, the native Lithuanians mostly resigned to their subservient position. We cannot allow this to suppress the German fighting spirit however, for this is a war for the whole Volk. Even if they must be dragged from their farms, put a gun in their hands and send them to the frontlines and they will soon overcome their passive tendencies."
 DST_stahlecker_goes_first:0 "Stahlecker Goes First"
 DST_stahlecker_goes_first_desc:0 "Final victory remains impossible when the German population of Ostland is divided amongst itself, and the instigator of this division is the pretender Franz Walter Stahlecker. So long as he claims the title of Reichskommissar, German will fight German, all while the men from the woods wreak bloody havoc on the sidelines.\n\nStahlecker's death is the only solution. A concerted push to break his front lines and storm his headquarters will be all we need to assert our rightful control of Ostland."
 DST_a_message_to_the_world:0 "A Message to the World"
 DST_a_message_to_the_world_desc:0 "Riga has ever been the centre of German civilisation in the Baltic, and has continued that legacy as the administrative centre of Ostland. Whilst in the hands of Stahlecker it was a symbol of the chaos that reigns Ostland - now that it has finally been retaken, it is a message that the time of chaos is over.\n\nThe Reichskommissar is intent on showing this to the world - all the Reich will know there is only one authority in the east."
 DST_against_the_traitor:0 "Against the Traitor"
 DST_against_the_traitor_desc:0 "Michal Vituska has long outlived his usefulness. While he performed a vital role in maintaining tolerable relations between the natives and German colonists, he has apparently used this same role to build up his underground movement of White Russians. Now that the chaos of civil war is upon us, his fighters have made their bid for regional dominance.\n\nIf Vituska is permitted to remove White Russia from Ostland, countless German settlers will find themselves under a vengeful partisan state and cut off from the protection of their Fatherland. Vituska and his army must be destroyed."
 DST_the_question_of_the_waffen:0 "The Question of the Waffen-SS"
 DST_the_question_of_the_waffen_desc: "Vituska built his power base while conducting the Reich's work with his Black Cats, his own all-Belarusian Waffen-SS unit. Now he is one of the most dangerous men in Ostland, and virtually every Belarusian division once loyal to the Reich has now defected to his cause. Defections have been reported from smaller Baltic units too, not only to the White Russian movement but to Abba Kovner's own United Partisan Organisation.\n\nLithuanians, Latvians and Estonians are considered by most of the German population to now be of questionable loyalty, and many worry about constantly having to look over their shoulders for comrades who may stab them in the back when the time is ripe. A decision must be made about the native Waffen-SS. This fear cannot stand."
 DST_target_the_students:0 "Target the Students"
 DST_target_the_students_desc:0 "Andreas Meyer-Landrut has been nought but a nuisance since he returned to Ostland. His stint in Poland evidently gave him some degenerate ideas, and he has spent his hoarded wealth and copious spare time spreading these ideas to the good youth of Ostland. Foolish ideas like democracy and equality have caused them to take up arms for the demagogue, while he lines his pockets with looted wealth. We must be cruel to be kind, and cut out the infection before it spreads to the rest of our misguided children."
 DST_lock_down_the_cities:0 "Lock Down the Cities"
 DST_lock_down_the_cities_desc:0 "While Wilna and Minsk are ours once more, the students simply will not shut up. Despite confiscating their arms for our own use, Meyer-Landrut's ideals remain in their minds. They have proven innovative in their methods, laying improvised explosives and blocking roads to hinder our forces. Many even continue to take to the streets to protest against their own liberation. This can continue no longer.\n\nIt will take many men, but we cannot tolerate insubordination. The cities will remain closed until further notice. We will see how long until the liberals stop complaining and start begging."
 DST_end_the_SS:0 "Bring an End to the SS"
 DST_end_the_SS_desc:0 "The SS have been a third column undermining the Reich for too long. While most of Himmler's fanatics have been confined to Burgundy there always remained those members who seemed to have earned "Faithful Heinrich"'s displeasure, stalking throughout Germany and no doubt reporting on our every move. Now their true loyalties have been confirmed.\n\nIf Himmler's zealots take Ostland they will subject it to unspeakable horrors, not to mention executing everyone in our government in a suitably horrific manner . These weeds must be dug out and destroyed, before they wreak irreversible havoc with their Burgundian ethics. It shouldn't be too hard to follow the trail of bodies."
 DST_scorched_earth:0 "Scorch the Earth"
 DST_scorched_earth_desc:0 "No longer does SS-black stain the map, but Himmler's dogs continue to roam the countryside. They refuse to see the hopelessness of their cause, and slowly but surely they draw their plans against us. They refuse to acknowledge their reality, and in their home of Dünaburg where the heart of their corruption lies is a den of criminality, iniquity and sabotage.\n\nWell, so be it. If they do not want to surrender we are under no obligation to be generous. A bullet for everyone aiding the Black Sun will solve our terrorist problem, and provide for us some much-needed peace of mind. Lettgallen will burn before the dubious SchutzStaffel are permitted to plot freely again."
 DST_strangle_the_partisans:0 "Strangle the Partisans"
 DST_strangle_the_partisans_desc:0 "For twenty years, a monster has lurked in the deep woods of Byelorussia. Every few years, some brave hunter and his party set out into the forest to hunt this most dangerous game, only to quickly find they themselves were the hunted. Those few who ever escaped claimed to have slain the beast, presenting trophies to prove their valour, but mere weeks later more corpses would be found to disillusion them of this fact. The men from the woods go where they please; do what they please; kill whom they please.\n\nAbba Kovner is not dead, and many insist he cannot be killed. This reputation is what has made him the most feared man in Ostland, and his organisation has the blood of thousands of Germans on its hands. Generalplan Ost is incomplete, and Kovner is living proof. Time to finish the job."
 DST_expand_the_camps:0 "Expand the Labor Camps"
 DST_expand_the_camps_desc:0 "The United Partisan Organisation is shattered, its members either scattered to the four winds, stagnating in a cell or mouldering in the grave. Finally the greatest threat to German dominance in Ostland has been eliminated, and the gentle hand of government can be placed over the peasants once more.\n\nNaturally the partisans cannot be allowed to continue to spread their subversive ideas to the rest of the natives, so for their own good they must be confined and put to work. Any metropolitan German would be welcome for the job security to be found in Maly Trostenets - how many can boast they held the same job their whole life?"
 DST_the_final_push_against_degeneracy:0 "The Final Push Against Degeneracy"
 DST_the_final_push_against_degeneracy_desc:0 "Victory is but a hair's breadth away - separatists, partisans and traitors flee before the strength of the Reichskommissariat, and in most of Ostland's towns resistance is a dirty word. Like a stain, however, resistance clings on, fighting our attempts to assert control with an almost pitiful futility. One push will be all that is required before the whole rotten structure comes crashing down."
 DST_looking_to_the_colonies:0 "Looking to the Colonies"
 DST_looking_to_the_colonies_desc:0 "Peace has been restored. Abba Kovner finally fertilises the dirt of the land he defended, Michal Vituska's treachery has been repaid twelve times over, and every would-be Reichskommissar has been disposed of with great prejudice. Now Ostland can return to its position as the Reich's model colony. A peaceful land, a quiet people. This has always been Drechsler's goal, despite the brutal methods he has been forced into taking to achieve it.\n\nCome and see."
 
 #EVENT

 DST.20.t:0 "The Waffen-SS Question"
 DST.20.d:0 "As the horrors of the Ostland Civil War exploded with the region's continued collapse, betrayal was widespread. The non-German divisions of the Waffen-SS turned tail and fled to the slimy Vituska, who embraced their strength and resources with open arms. The question remains how best to deal with these untermenschen traitors. There is no questioning their value as skilful and experienced soldiers, but can we risk treason against the Reich breaking out among their ranks yet again?"
 DST.20.a:0 "Their expertise is necessary for Ostland's stability. Let them serve us."
 DST.20.b:0 "We shall never work with subhuman traitors. Purge them all!"

 DST_partisans_imprisoned:0 "With the partisans rounded back up into labor camps, and their murderous threat subdued, German families across Ostland may now rest easy."
