USA_south_african_war_category_desc: "We're here not only to save Africa from the tide of fascism and to kick some Nazi tail, but also to draw our line in the sand, to let it be known that no more Nazi expansion will be tolerated. Moreover, American interests are certainly served by our presence in South Africa, from its strategic location to the resources it can offer. This war must be won.\n\nAmerica has a number of options to help win the fight against the Reichskommissars. We can target specific enemies with strategic plans, bolster our South African and other OFN allies with funding, equipment, supplies, and more."
USA_south_african_war_domestic_category_desc: "We must be careful. The American people are demanding that we succeed, and betraying that expectation would be disastrous for everyone involved.\n\nThough the war is a popular one, this is the first major land conflict that the United States has gotten involved in since the Second World War, and it is important that we do not squander this chance to rekindle the spirit of resistance against Nazism among the American public. For this purpose, we will run a large media and recruitment campaign to make sure that anybody who might be reluctant about this war will understand and grow to support the morality of our cause."

USA_SAW_Armoured_Offensive_tt: "Our military boasts a modern and capable armoured fleet, from personnel carriers to might main battle tanks that can go toe to toe with anything the krauts might field. We must utilise these to punch through the Schild lines and bring about an end to this war.\n"

### Domestic Tooltips
USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt: "§FThe number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war, and depletes by the hour. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to crank up the draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly be troubled by this decision, but we must accept the consequences if we want to continue the fight.§!"
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt: "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt: "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt: "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt: "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt: "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt: "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt: "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_bring_back_our_guns_tt: "This war is just not going in our favor, but we don't want to lose everything we have here. We must buy back the guns we loaned to our South African allies. This action would diminish whatever hopes our allies have left, but it would show the American public that we intend on ending the war soon."

USA_SAF_WAR_Insurgent_Decision_Category: "The African Nightmare"
USA_SAF_WAR_Insurgent_Decision_Category_desc: "We have won a great victory for democracy in South Africa, but our work is far from finished. While the German army is defeated, remnants of their forces still fight on. In addition, many local warlords have established their own forces, and would like nothing better than expel us from their lands. Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term. Whichever approach we take, the public demands that our young men return home soon, and leave a stable continent behind. If we fail to satisfy the public, we will surely suffer at the polls."

USA_Fatigue_Cooldown: "The Scars Heal..."
USA_Fatigue_Cooldown_desc: "Every two months, divisions of our boys return home to America, on their own legs, in wheelchairs and in caskets. The war was a long, bloody one, whose impact we may feel for decades. For now, the families can get some closure, alleviating some pressure back home.\n\nIt would be wrong to say all is well, for many of these young men left something back on the African jungles... something they may never find again."

There is plenty of strategic advantage to be gained here, along with the vast amounts of resources that Africa has to offer. But there are also numerous insurgencies that are still ongoing, from rogue German guerrillas to native Africans who resent our continued presence. If we find ourselves drawn into yet another quagmire, even those who supported the initial war may become dissatisfied.

There wasn't, anyways, until now. This.\n\nWhile the Krauts flail, though, we need to take action. We haven't had this good a shot since '41, really, and I intend to fight until the last for freedom, no matter where it may be. We've never had a real victory to claim since the Great War, and I will be the man to change that, no matter the goddamned cost. If anyone can put down the deranged delusions of those Brownshirts, I will be the one to do it, even if it has to be in South Africa of all places."

Now, how our Generals didn't foresee this becoming an issue is almost shocking, yet here we are again, cleaning up a hell of a mess we shouldn't even have. The only issue is going to be to build up all the ports, bases, airports, and a thousand other things, I'm sure.\n\nThe one thing the historian pundits will ever talk about when it came to the last war is logistics, you know, logistics we won and lost on, logistics of England, logistics of Asia, logistics of logistics.

We aren't going to blow the hell out of the Nazis if they're up against a bunch of asses with guns!\n\nLaird and some fellows from across the OFN talked about passing another resolution at the next Security Council meeting. They want a unified command structure to streamline the war effort and avoid miscommunication, and some of them floated Westmoreland as its commander. We'll introduce it, we'll pass it, and we'll turn this goddamn war into an example for future generations."

We're going to push back this joint aerial assault by the German cocksuckers no matter the cost.

They're tough sonsofbitches and all for what it's worth, but we need to fix this before the Nazis grind them up.\n\nMcNamara compiled his mathematics—no, statistics, whatever the hell he does—and his reports all say that military infrastructure is a goddamn mess.

The particular area of fighting provides the potential to secure a port for military aid to our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: Full-scale warfare has broken out in northern Colombia between the government, the fascist state of New Granada, and our allies in the Colombian Revolutionary Union. Said department is home to a large port which would help supply our partners with material aid.\n\nSuch material aid would help them someday control the entirety of the country and establish a friendly regime in the state. Furthermore, the potential acquisition of the department and its port by New Granada, or the retention by the central government could prove advantageous to our enemies in Asia and Europe.\n\n(TS) COURSE OF ACTION: Additional armaments and supplies through friendly Venezuela are prepared for transportation to help our allies in their aim to secure control. Successful operations would allow for the discontinuation of the costly supply route for the more favorable port."

USA_colombia.2.t: "Report on the Colombian Civil War"
USA_colombia.2.d: "TOP SECRET [GetDateText]\nFROM DIRK HOLDEN\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\n(TS) POSITION: Contacts in the URC have confirmed their acquisition of the port of Cartagena. This development puts us in a better situation to supply our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: After recent escalations over the last few days in the Civil War in Colombia, colloquially known as "La Violencia" Members of the Colombian Revolutionary Union or URC in the fighting have managed to gain control of northern Colombia and with it, its large port in Cartagena.\n\nCartagena, founded in the 16th century is home to modern docking and unloading facilities that prove more efficient than our current supply routes through Venezuela. This development presents a promising and advantageous situation for future operations in the country.\n\n(TS) ADDENDUM: With this new situation, further shipments and aid are prepared to be sent to the URC. In the case of even greater escalation, troop deployment is now possible through the port. Other new operations may present themselves to be available as a result of this development as the situation evolves."

USA_colombia.3.t: "Report on the Colombian Civil War"
USA_colombia.3.d: "TOP SECRET [GetDateText]\nFROM DIRK HOLDEN\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\n(TS) POSITION: Reports from inside the URC and from US Navy ships in the region conclusively indicate that the URC have lost the recent series of skirmishes in northern Colombia. With this loss, they have been forced to evacuate their foothold on the Guajira Peninsula and to flee across the border into Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has declared its intention to provide safe harbor to any civilians and URC personnel fleeing combat, which has boosted the waning morale among our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: These events are a serious detriment to our interests in the region, and are a major blow to the URC in the Colombian Civil War. The strategically critical port of Cartagena now lies beyond our allies' grasp, and their only holdout, however strong it may be, is now in the distant southern reaches of the country.\n\n(TS) ADDENDUM: Given the severity of this new situation, our strategy must be subjected to a sweeping reevaluation. I would advise immediate relief for URC troops in the Guajira Peninsula from the Panama-based naval command, as well as a rapid shift towards providing material and quality aid to their compatriots in the south via Venezuela. Destabilization efforts in other Colombian regimes should be ramped up as well to ensure exploitable openings arise within a reasonable time frame."

USA_HCW_bunker_down: "§YBunker Down§!"
USA_HCW_bunker_down_desc: "Whereas previous efforts focused on eliminating the PPLN insurgency throughout Haiti, political polarization has made our current approach impractical. Instead, our forces will prioritize building strong points of government influence where US-Haitian troops will launch a definitive anti-PPLN extermination campaign."
    USA_HCW_change_war_priorities: "§RThis will change our priorities in the war, making withdrawl impossible and set Haiti on the course for massive escalation so that we may draw the rebels out.§!"
USA_HCW_prepare_transition: "§YEnd War Time Procedures§!"
USA_HCW_prepare_transition_desc: "Anticipating our victory in the Haitian Civil War, preparations must be made to transfer critical peacekeeping operations to Haitian forces. This transition will lay the foundation for Haiti's maintaining its security, but anti-rebel operations may suffer as the transfer completes."
    USA_HCW_bring_war_to_its_end: "§YThis will shake up control in every state, its advised that the government have a significant degree of control before proceeding.§!"
USA_HCW_force_coalition: "§YForm Coalition Government§!"
USA_HCW_force_coalition_desc: "The pro-government coalition has exhausted all other alternatives short of abandoning Haiti entirely and is ready to negotiate with the PPLN. Under the terms of this agreement, a transitional government would assume power ahead of new elections and draft a new constitution.\n\nWhile this may allow the United States to save face in the long term, conceding a coalition will inevitably be considered a defeat."

USA_HCW_withdraw: "§YWithdraw§!"
USA_HCW_withdraw_desc: "While the United States has yet to abandon its commitment to Haiti entirely, the intervention has proven stagnant and increasingly unpopular at home. So long as the United States builds up the Haitian government strong enough to beat the rebels alone, America will have nominally succeeded."
    USA_HCW_leave_haiti_tt: "§gThis will begin the long and complicated process to cut our losses in Haiti.§!\n§RWe will not be able to stop withdrawal once we start, any attempts to take steps back from the process will be§! §Vradically unpopular.§!"
USA_HCW_transfer_air_facilities: "Transfer Air Facilities"
USA_HCW_transfer_air_facilities_desc: "Transferring American and OFN airbases to Haitian ownership will increase Haitian air capabilities while reducing costs for the United States. The Haitian Air Corps may not fully utilize these bases' long runways, but their new ownership will undoubtedly assist anti-rebel operations."
USA_HCW_transfer_supply_dumps: "Transfer Supply Dumps"
USA_HCW_transfer_supply_dumps_desc: "Instead of retrieving the large amounts of munitions, equipment, and provisions stored at bases in Haiti, the United States will transfer its supply depots to the Haitian government to support operations against the rebels."
USA_HCW_guarantee_air_support: "Guarantee Air Support"
USA_HCW_guarantee_air_support_desc: "American troops may be leaving Haiti, but the USAF remains on standby to support the Haitian government through any of its anti-rebel operations. Whether a precision strike or a B-52 raid, American airpower may turn the tide for Haiti's government."
    USA_HCW_resume_bombings_tt: "§RThis will resume the bombings.§!"
USA_HCW_large_scale_personnel_training: "Large Scale Personnel Training"
USA_HCW_large_scale_personnel_training_desc: "Withdrawing American soldiers must be replaced in more significant numbers by Haitian soldiers, who must be trained, supplied, and commanded in operations previously carried out by American forces."
USA_HCW_initiate_troop_surge: "Initiate Troop Surge"
USA_HCW_initiate_troop_surge_desc: "The American withdrawal has not gone as planned, and it has become necessary for the United States to re-intervene in Haiti's civil war to prevent a total government collapse. This action could discredit future withdrawal efforts and keep the United States fighting until the end."
USA_HCW_increase_troop_deployments: "Increase Troop Deployments"
USA_HCW_increase_troop_deployments_desc: "While the United States remains committed to withdrawing from Haiti's civil war, conditions may require a temporary troop reduction halt to support government operations against rebels. This move could save the Port-au-Prince government but could also derail American withdrawal."
USA_HCW_decrease_troop_deployments: "Decrease Troop Deployments"
USA_HCW_decrease_troop_deployments_desc: "American troops are leaving Haiti at a fixed rate, but expedited troop withdrawals will surely increase public goodwill towards our policy here. Early departures may harm the government's ability to fight rebels but would be popular at home."

With an admitedly magnificent show of combined air-ground operations, Trujillo's spearhead punches through Haiti practically unopposed.\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost. The Haitian government, with our support and that of the Organization of Free Nations, has decided to stand and fight. We must do everything in our power to prevent Haiti from falling to Trujillo, or at least buying enough time for us to properly mobilize, deploy, and launch a proper counter-offensive."
