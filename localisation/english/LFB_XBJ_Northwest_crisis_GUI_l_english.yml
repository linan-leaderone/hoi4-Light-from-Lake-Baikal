XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_0:0 "In Mongolian, 'Alxa' means 'land of many colors.' But when you overlook this area located in the westernmost part of the Mongolian Plateau, all you see is the color of dust—deserts and gobi, segmented by rising mountains into irregular pastures. This has been the most common scenery here. Since ancient times, this ancient plateau has shown signs of human activity, but for thousands of years, this place has been sparsely populated, with nomads coming and going, and agrarian peoples struggling to establish themselves in such harsh conditions.\nUntil the 20th century, the situation remained largely unchanged. Rather than saying the Ma family 'ruled' this place, it would be more accurate to say they treated it as a buffer zone, separating the prosperous Hexi Corridor from the vast grasslands. The collapse of the Ma family's rule had little impact here, just like the unchanging gobi; no matter how the outside world changes, the people here will continue their ancient way of life."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_1:0 "This is a barren basin on the plateau. For a long time, the residents here have been struggling against the harsh natural environment with their wisdom, barely maintaining a livelihood. Although the underground is rich in various mineral resources, a veritable treasure trove, this fact is little known. The most common human presence on this vast and desolate land are herders driving small herds.\nAfter the Northwest Crisis, the tranquility of this place was also disrupted. Some refugees have crossed this area, seeking a more stable Xinjiang. The sight has caused the locals, often organized by religious sects, to shut their doors, with villages barricading themselves for self-defense. Given the distance from the center of chaos, the society here can still be described as stable, but undoubtedly, the scales are quickly tipping towards disorder..."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_2:0 "As an important node on the Silk Road, since the Han Dynasty, Jiuquan has been a trade hub in the Hexi Corridor, where commerce has spurred cultural exchange and integration. But today, aside from the half-buried Mogao Caves under the yellow sand, there is no trace of its past prosperity. The Silk Road has long been severed, and the Ma family's development of the Hexi Corridor focused on the eastern part. Thus, during the peaceful post-war years, the Jiuquan region has slowly declined. Young people eager to make a name for themselves have left for the east, while those remaining continue their ancient way of life...\nThe Northwest Crisis did not significantly affect this place. However, with the increasing numbers of refugees and bandits, life here is slowly but steadily sliding into the abyss."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_3:0 "This once-prosperous ancient city, once painstakingly developed by the Ma family into the economic center of the northwest and even northern China, has now become a wasteland. The mad dogs unleashed by the Japanese Empire occupy the ruins of Lanzhou, and from there, they launch horrifying sweeps, determined to demonstrate the Empire's resolve to crush all resistance. Every day, supplies from Tokyo cross the oceans, traverse Manchuria and the lands of the Republic of China, and reach Lanzhou, accompanied by countless determined warriors. In the barren mountains and rivers of the northwest, the Empire's advance seems unstoppable...\nNow, the only thing blocking their westward march is the stubbornness of this land—the resolute northwest men refuse to surrender, scattering across Lanzhou's fields, doing everything they can to delay the Japanese army's progress. But for the imperialistic dogs, resistance only provokes increasingly severe retaliation. The battles to clear out guerrillas have turned into brutal massacres, and even the most compliant civilians cannot escape the fate of slaughter. Unless the last drop of blood is shed, this land will not submit, but given time, the Japanese army will ultimately find the most efficient way to achieve this end."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_4:0 "Xining, as the wealthiest region in the northwest besides Lanzhou, was once a safe haven for countless Han refugees. After the war, under the Ma family's management, it became an ideal place for investment. Japan's advanced technology provided an inexhaustible boost to economic growth, and the large number of displaced people ensured a sufficient supply of cheap labor. Together, they created the astonishing 'Northwest Miracle.'\nHowever, the Japanese army's boots shattered the bubble of economic prosperity in the northwest. They occupied Lanzhou with overwhelming force, turning Xining, just a hundred kilometers away, into the frontline of resistance. The people of Xining are paying a huge price to resist the increasingly powerful Japanese onslaught. Behind the bullet-riddled ancient city walls, every household keeps their doors tightly shut, hoping to hold out one more day under the enemy's fierce assault..."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_5:0 "Yushu's fate mirrors that of the northwest as a whole. Yushu, transliterated from Tibetan as 'ruins,' is said to be the birthplace of Queen Jium, a figure in the Tibetan epic of King Gesar. Located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this area is mainly inhabited by Tibetans. This place has long been a focal point of conflict between Qinghai and Tibet, with clashes involving thousands of people occurring over control of the region.\nSince the signing of the 'Qinghai-Tibet Treaty' in 1933, Yushu has been firmly under the control of the Ma family. As the southern frontier of the Ma family's regime and the forefront of the Qinghai-Tibet conflict, it was once dotted with outposts and arsenals. But now, as Qinghai descends into chaos, much of the military equipment originally intended to maintain Ma family rule has fallen into the hands of local monasteries or landlords. Under the banner of self-preservation, they are organizing their own armed forces. But who knows whether these Tibetans, who were already dissatisfied with Ma's rule, have other plans?"
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_6:0 "The Hexi Corridor, located west of the Yellow River and between the Qilian Mountains and the Badain Jaran Desert, has always been a vital link between Central China and the civilizations further west. The ancient Silk Road brought flourishing trade to this area, while countless wars and migrations made this region a melting pot of diverse cultures.\nIn the early 20th century, the Ma family inherited the burgeoning Islamic sects of the Qing Dynasty and established firm control over Qinghai. After the war, as the transportation hub of the northwest, the Hexi Corridor prospered alongside the Ma family's territory, bearing a significant amount of trade. However, in just a few years after the Japanese invasion, it became the front line of fierce battles. In peacetime, the flourishing trade had already bred numerous bandits, and in this time of widespread fear, their presence poses a significant threat to the stability of the region."
XBJ_NWC_Getregioninfo_7:0 "After decades of silence, no one expected that a fierce socialist revolution would break out in the seemingly unlikely Xinjiang. Today, the Xinjiang Liberation Zone still faces severe internal and external challenges, unable to fully support Qinghai, but as comrades bound by destiny, they will still do everything they can to assist in our cause. Xinjiang is our solid backing, and the beating heart of the Chinese revolution. We must defend it at all costs!"

To achieve this, first click on a region and dispatch an investigation team to reveal the local chaos level.\nThe first progress bar in the bottom left represents 'Chaos.' It describes the level of disorder in a region. If §Rmore than two§! regions fall into disorder, efforts to restore order in Qinghai will be declared a failure.\nThe second progress bar in the bottom left represents 'Progress,' which has three main stages to measure the current progress of actions in a region.\n\nIn the Northwest Crisis, there are two unique resources: 'Food' and 'Work Groups.'\nFood can be used to execute decisions that can significantly reduce chaos. §RFully restored regions§! will provide food each month. Food can also be allocated from Xinjiang by §Rconsuming large amounts of political points§!. In the crisis-stricken Qinghai, food is a §Rprecious§! resource, so manage it carefully.\nWork Groups are composed of experienced party members. Implementing any reforms in the Qinghai region requires occupying a Work Group. When conditions are suitable, we can request the dispatch of more Work Groups from Xinjiang. Except for the §RCentral Work Group§!, all Work Groups need time and political points to be formed and transferred.\n\nThe reforms in Qinghai are a race against time. We must seize every moment to implement as many reforms as possible and restore order in the regions. We must be fully prepared for the §Rinevitable Japanese invasion§!."
