 POLITICS_Neil_Blaney_ULS_desc:0 "Born during the climax of nationalist agitation in 1922, Neil Blaney's life has been spent advancing the ideal of a united, catholic Ireland. Whether on the fields of Ulsters as a lieutenant, or as the youngest member of the Dail in 1948, Blaney remained steadily committed to Catholic Nationalism. While his radicalism and rural mannerism made him anathema to the urban voters, something that preemptively ended his ambitions to become Taoiseach, Blaney's loyal countryside following gained him sufficient political clout to turn him into "the forever minister."\n\nUnfortunately for the people of what was once Ulster, the forever minister's portfolio is the "Ministry for the Northern Counties," the de facto governorship of the former Northern Ireland. Forged in the fire of the conflagration that brought the area under the control of Dublin, the "Northern Counties Special Zone" was originally a temporary administrative unit tasked with bringing the region in line with the rest of the island. However, as integration stagnated and the German garrisons that guaranteed stability were withdrawn in the wake of the economic crash, the NCSZ became a ticking time bomb. The man that Eamon De Valera chose to defuse it was none other than Neil Blaney.\n\nShortly after taking office as Minister for the Northern Counties, Blaney resolved to end the unionist problem with a method he learned in Germany. Overnight, the NCSZ became a regimented amalgamation of the different paramilitary militias, garda forces, and army units Blaney used to smother the Ulster Resistance and their civilian supporters under a shower of bullets. To his republican base, Blaney became nothing less than the savior of Irish unity. His success in Belfast, moreover, has revived his interest in obtaining Ireland's highest office."
 
 POLITICS_James_Kelly:0 "Brigadier James Kelly joined the Irish Defense Forces shortly after the end of the Second World War, right as the influence of German military advisors began to take root. Owing to his brilliant performance, he was sent to Germany for further studies, before returning to Ireland and being assigned to Military Intelligence in the tumultuous Northern Counties. The posting put him in close contact with the Fianna Fáil political establishment, and after the German withdrawal a few years later, with Neil Blaney.\n\nWhile the Irish army became increasingly bloated as a consequence of German advisorship, a desire to maintain unemployment low, and the need to keep order in the Northern Counties, Kelly climbed the ranks with record speed. By 1960, he had become deputy chief of staff for Military Intelligence in the Northern Counties. Although initially identified as one of the officers who supported Blaney's use of paramilitary groups under the belief he was acting on the orders of Lemass, he rapidly developed misgivings about the Citizen Guard. At first, he protested against their counterproductive methods, but soon began to suspect that something was off with the organization at large.\n\nWhile Blaney attempted to put a stop to his investigation, Kelly and his connections in the Abwehr uncovered the truth about the R-IRA on their own. Released shortly after his arrest when it was revealed that he believed himself to be following orders from the government, he hurried to restore his reputation by presenting a plan to decapitate all terrorist organizations and restore order on behalf of his fellow officers.\n\nNow that his plan has been successful, Kelly can start to deconstruct Blaney's byzantine administration and replace it with something more conducive to stability. That, in any case, is what he told Seán Lemass. For while he would have liked to keep his promises, Lemass's stated intentions to reveal secret documents which could well implicate him in the initial contact between the IRA and Blaney. The undesirable prospect of his military career unfairly ending in disgrace has led to him making arrangements with fellow officers, which could well end badly for Ireland..."
 
 POLITICS_Ian_Paisley:0 "For Ian Paisley, the revelation of collusion between the Irish government and the IRA was the final straw. He knew that the rotten papist structure of government, unfit to rule over the industrious protestant peoples of Ulster, would inevitably oppress the true servants of God. Nevertheless, the extent to which Blaney's administration collaborated with the paramilitaries sent him into an uncontrollable rage. He had tried to be reasonable, for eighteen years he attempted to negotiate in good faith, but no more, not after learning that his people were terrorized and murdered with the consent of papist authorities.\n\nAfter chaos engulfed the Northern Counties following the assassination of Seamus Twomey and the purge of the garrison, Paisley resolved to carry out the one thing that would put an end to the chaos: Free Ulster from its catholic problem, permanently.\n\nNow that papist incompetence has allowed him to take rightful control of the land that King William liberated two hundred years prior, Paisley can put his plan to establish a magnificent monolith of protestantism in Ulster, which will be free to rejoin its British brethren in the near future.\n\nWith total control over the Ulster Volunteer Force, Paisley intends first to protect his new protestant regime from the inevitable southern reaction, and once he has succeeded, to purge it of the elements he has marked for destruction. He knows it won't be an easy task, for he remembers the advance of the Germans in 1944, when he fought on the losing side, but for God and Ulster, he will give his best to make sure it doesn't happen again."
 
 POLITICS_Seamus_Twomey_ULS_desc:0 "It took Seamus Twomey almost three decades, but at last, his plans are succeeding.\n\nAfter growing up in the soul crushing poverty of a 1920s Belfast Catholic neighborhood, Twomey resolved to change Ireland's future in such a way as to ensure that everyone of his fellow countrymen could live free from poverty and unemployment.\n\nThe first obstacle to this vision the young nationalist encountered was British rule over the Northern Counties. While he joined the IRA in order to end it, it was ultimately German guns which brought about a united Ireland, to Twomey's horror. Escaping the confines of a prison ship when the Wehrmacht entered Belfast, he set about rebuilding the organization as an anti-German front. Alongside Cathal Goulding, he resurrected the IRA organization, and begrudgingly accepted a loosely defined "Irish Marxism" as the group's official ideology.\n\nWhile his terrorist campaign to drive out the German garrison from Northern Ireland was largely ineffective, the ultimate withdrawal of the occupiers, largely a consequence of the West Russian War, was attributed to the Republican Army. The resulting popularity boost was strengthened by the Irish political establishment's immutable policy of collaborating with Germania.\n\nTwomey, still determined to free Ireland from foreign influence, was in want of an arsenal large enough to let him do it. It was then that he resolved to create his master plan: To cheat Blaney out of his own guns by creating a paramilitary group ready to serve his own goals. In the meantime, Twomey was more than happy to suppress Protestant unionism. Now, however, the years of waiting have come to an end."
 
 POLITICS_Terence_ONeill:0 "London born Terence O'Neill, son of Arthur O'Neil, who had the dubious honor of being the first member of parliament to be killed in the first world war, has always been a man advocating peace and cooperation. As a young man he advocated respect towards the local Catholic Irishmen from the government, and later, when Ulster became the Northern Counties, he spoke often and at length of the cruelties that had been inflicted upon the protestants after the annexation, all while still refusing to condone a violent solution to the special situation. To some he was seen as a 'collaborator' as he worked for years within the Irish political system, but he never compromised on his ethics while he did so.\n\nWith his conciliatory attitude, and credibility among both the Catholics and the Protestants - it seems likely that Terence O'Neill is the perfect man to heal the wounds of the Northern Counties."
 
 POLITICS_Sean_MacEoin:0 "Ireland: divided once more. The fault of this national humiliation lies with the incompetent administrations that used the Defense Forces as the repository for the unemployed and gave away its wealth to Germany. A situation this dire called for a man who could stand above politics and save the country from civil war, that man was Seán MacEoin.\n\nFor MacEoin, the dismal performance of his beloved armed forces in the Northern Campaign proved too much to take. Knowing that the loss of Ulster was bound to push Ireland deeper into the arms of foreign powers, MacEoin decided to put a stop to the neverending subjugation of Eire to foreign powers by launching a coup with the remnants of the IDF. Now that he controls Ireland - or what is left of it - all that MacEoin intends to do is restore the professionalism of the armed forces, before he can turn over the country to an elected authority, sometime in the future."

Dozens, if not hundreds of armament depots are spread out throughout the territory of the Northern Counties, providing ample supplies of weaponry to the Auxiliaries, which over time have evolved into protestant resistance groups, known under the umbrella name of the "Ulster Volunteer Force"."
