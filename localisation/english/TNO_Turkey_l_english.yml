 POLITICS_ISMET_INONU_DESC:0 "If Mustafa Kemal was the father of the Turks, then Ismet Inönü is their Godfather. What could suffice, to describe the life of the man whose very whims have defined the policies of nations, armies, and empires?\n\nBorn to a Kurdish father in Smyrna in the year 1884, and faced with the weight of an empire collapsing all around him, Inönü served the Ottoman army with distinction in Yemen, in Rumelia, and under Mustafa Kemal himself in the war of liberation against the old empires of Europe. Ismet was a man truly committed to seeing the Turkish nation rise restored from the ashes of the caliphate, and quickly rose through the ranks of the new revolutionary guard until he was no less than Atatürk's own right hand.\n\nTensions had always existed between Kemal's strident pragmatism and Ismet's uncompromising will, and burst into sparks on numerous occasions in the past. Today, with the days of the Ghazi confined merely to memory, many claim that the old Vizier has overstepped his limits. That he had sold the nation to her enemies, that he had turned it against the very principles it was founded on. But those claims were nothing; Nothing save for insults to the very legacy of Atatürk.\n\nIn his long tenure as President of the Turkish republic, Ismet Inönü has pursued a single aim with a single mind: the survival of the Turkish state that he had helped found from nothing. When the State's interests called for détente with the Fascists, he had followed them. When they demanded the jackboot and the butt of the rifle, he heeded them. Through the great trials of the past three decades, he marched on: Battered and bloodied and slandered - but never beaten.\n\nThe state that stands today is a testament to the man's political ability and above all to his uncompromising will. A great Turkish state: one that will remain great, no matter the cost."
 POLITICS_CEMAL_GURSEL_DESC:0 "A nineteen year old teen lays dead\nUnder the sun in the mornings,\nUnder the stars in the nights.\nOn Beyazıt Square in Istanbul\n\nCemal Gürsel is a tired man. He has been tired for a very long time. The crown of Turkey sits upon a weary and worn brow of man approaching his seventeenth year. For his nation, Cemal would give everything; he has given everything. When asked to serve above and beyond the call of duty for most men he already surpassed that expectation. And yet he is called once more in service of a coup that he does not believe in.\n\nBut the blood is spilled. A boy lays dead with a school book on his hand. On one hand a dream that never started. Cemal understands that democracy in Turkey may never recover. He cannot allow that to happen. Democracy must return. He did not serve his whole life, he did not survive malaria under the British, he did not fight in the furnace of the Independence War to be broken now.\n\nThere is no other path for Cemal except forward. The same choice he had in the desert, against the Italians and Ba'athists. Though he may wish now never to have emerged out of that goddamn desert with the task ahead of him. The only way is forward. For Cemal can trust no other man to resist the temptation to snuff out the flame of freedom forever. Those who have died in this damned coup, those who will continue to die from its aftermath, must have died for something. Cemal will make sure that happens. The only way is forward."
 POLITICS_BEHICE_BORAN_DESC:0 "Behice was born the youngest of three siblings to Kazan Tatar parents in Bursa, 1910. After completing primary schooling she enrolled into the American College for Girls in Istanbul. With adept skills in foreign languages and a scholarship from the University of Michigan, she completed her academic education with a PhD in sociology in 1939. Afterwards she accepted an Associate Professorship at Ankara University teaching foreign language, history and geography.\n\nBoran had an interest during her professorship in writing political papers. Though at times called a Marxist, her writings never garnered the attention or condemnation from İnönü's administration despite leftist leanings in the texts. But when the Second General Inspectors were established in 1956, Boran could no longer remain silent and spoke out rather harshly against the act. For this she was imprisoned for 32 months.\n\nWhen her sentence ended, Boran formed TIP which failed to garner enough votes to challenge CHP in any meaningful way. It did, however, lead to an alliance with Türkân Akyol and the formation of DYP. Boran does not believe that there can be a worker's revolution in Turkey but instead she advocates for trade unions being the vehicle to shift Turkish politics further to the left."
 POLITICS_CELAL_BAYAR_DESC:0 "Mahmud Celâleddin Bayar was born in the coastal province of Bursa, to a family of Bulgarian Turkish migrants. Immediately bright, the young Bayar enjoyed a promising career in banking after finishing his education. The political turmoil borne out of the First World War soon drew him and many other like-minded men towards the political world; Bayar served as a representative in the Ottoman parliament before finally joining Mustafa Kemal Pasha's revolutionary circles as an attorney and civil adviser.\n\nGrowing into a talented and respected politician during the days of Atatürk's Kemalist revolution, Bayar emerged as the pre-eminent advocate for a more flexible and capitalistic policy of Etatism. Indeed, many of the Republic's early success can be attributed to Bayar's programs. This did not earn him the love of the decidedly interventionist İnönü, and the two of them oft competed for the position of Prime Minister under Atatürk's presidency, before he was eventually expelled from the CHP alongside three of his allies in the later years of İnönü's tenure for daring to criticize the CHP's blatant neglect. Bayar was encouraged to found his own party instead, leading to the birth of the first Ulusal Demokrat Parti. This was a move that proved immensely successful: For he now stands proud as the third President of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nPromising the people democratic reform and a liberalized and rejuvenated economy after decades of stagnation under İnönü's CHP, Bayar's party has nonetheless been accused of populist leanings, and even of steering away from the principles of Kemalism. - a case strengthened by Prime Minister Menderes's notorious rabble-rousing rhetoric, and the fact the DP itself had only won the election leading a coalition of right-wing groups with dubious Kemalist credentials, and well-known ties to the wolves.\n\nBayar himself has steered clear of such accusations intending to provide a firm hand that will lead the Republic to her rightful place as a modern and prosperous Turkish state."
 
 POLITICS_AHMAD_BARZANI_DESC:0 "Is compromising your ideals the only way for the Kurdish people to reach for a once thought impossible dream of self-determination? It seems like it is.\n\nSheikh Ahmad Barzani once lost it all at a young age: his tribe having launched an insurrection against the Ottoman authorities in his infancy, he was not even an adult when his father, grandfather and a brother were executed for their defiance of the Sublime Porte's yoke. It wasn't until the 1930's, after a short exile in Turkey, that Ahmad himself led the various Kurdish tribes against the Iraqi government and their British puppet masters alongside his younger brother Mustafa.\n\nOne would've thought his war was a hopeless cause. But by the end of the 1950's, when the Republic of Iraq found itself at war with the Triumvirate, Barzani swiftly took control of his homeland by fighting for the Turkish forces and taking advantage of his liaisons within the Turkish political scene. The Sheikh now sits on top of a throne made out of the bones of Kurdish freedom warriors, listening to a sweet tune coming from Ankara which tells him what to dance to..."

 TUR_economic_stagnation_desc:0 "Failed German projects in the Mediterranean and along the Euphrates have seriously damaged our economy after a period of prosperity. To complicate the recovery, German and Italian companies are less and less willing to invest in Turkey, the former due to its ever-worsening political and economic situation, the latter due to our precarious alliance: reforms are needed, and quickly, or the Turkish economy might fall even harder should a crisis arise.."

 TUR_italo_turkish_tension_desc:0 "The Triumvirate is on its deathbed, and the "loving" relatives are mostly cheering for the agony to end. With relationships between Turkey and its former Italian ally at an all-times low, several nationalist politicians have resurrected the old Turkish claims to the Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes and Thessaly, in the hope of bolstering national morale - and their own popularity.\n\nDespite this nationalistic revival, there are many who express worry, or outright fear, for the potential consequences of such claims. Italy is - after all - the most powerful country in the Mediterranean, and despite its overstretched forces, there is no guarantee that they won't find the strength to fight..."
 TUR_inspectorate_generals:0 "Legacy of The Fifth and Sixth Inspectorate Generals"
 TUR_inspectorate_generals_desc:0 "The Fifth and Sixth Inspectorates were government commissions tasked with extending Turkification policies to the lands acquired after the war, mainly the new provinces in the Caucasus and the Levant. Despite their efforts, they only managed to create more problems than they were actually able to solve: the Fifth Inspectorate simply deported Armenians and Kurds from the Caucasus to the Levant, while the Sixth was only able of replacing a colonial administration with a Turkish one, leaving rural areas de facto abandoned to themselves.\n\nNow, unrest is rising across all newly-acquired provinces. Despite harsher and harsher methods - which are slowly turning even peaceful locals against the government - dissent and separatism are constantly growing, and the military police is unable to keep them under control: reforms are needed for something to change, and even then, it is not clear whether the change will be for good, or for worse..."

The Istanbulite earned his spurs in the unstable world of the thirties, taking part in numerous missions and naval attachés across old Europe and quickly becoming fluent in the language of diplomacy. The end of the war sealed all chances of any career in the Navy. Instead, he earned prominent postings as an ambassador to Turkey's allied states.\nA veteran of the Triumvirate's paradoxical procedures and present ever since its founding under Inonu and Mussolini, Korutürk's appointment as Prime Minister has reoriented Turkey's vision outwards, towards its dubious allies.§!"

Serving With distinction in the Ottoman army during the First World War, Gürsel was captured by the British in 1917 and learned French if only to spite his captors, before returning as a seasoned commander to lead new Republic's militias in the Turkish War of Independence and the Turkish Armed Forces to victory in the Second World War. A capable and popular member of the President's cabinet, the old General is adored by the public and the military in equal parts.\n\nSo far, he has used this influence to disseminate one message:\nA strong and professional military, dedicated to serving the Turkish state - and the Turkish people.§!"

Born in 1906 and graduating from the University of Ankara in 1931, Ferit Melen is a staunch proponent of state intervention in the economy, one of the 'six arrows' of Kemalist ideology. A nationalist and life-long civil servant, he was instrumental in shaping the modern Turkish economy; This has made the Minister of the Economy a polarizing figure to say the least, with criticism from both the left and the right:\n criticism which has only strengthened his faith in the thought of Mustafa Kemal, and tempered his nationalism into a dogmatic orthodoxy.§!"

 turkey_faction_skeleton.1.t: "CHP Government Petitions for OFN Partner Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.1.d: "It appears fortune favors us as we have received word that the İnönü government is seeking a diplomatic realignment towards the free and democratic nations of the world, having recently petitioned us to grant them OFN Partner Status within the alliance.\n\nThe Department of State has been paying close attention to Turkey's situation since the Triumvirate dissolved. Their loss in the Italo-Turkish war has forced them out of their previously neutral outlook and while defeat has lessened their prestige, they are still a powerful regional player in the Middle East, allowing us to extend our reach greatly.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the governance of prime minister Gülek and President İnönü, their economy is in strong shape and their military is one of the finest in the region. The democratic, secular and progressive values of the Republic are an excellent fit for the ideals of our faction, ensuring a strong level of cooperation in the future with our current member states.\n\nOur representatives are unanimous in approving their application, with even our most isolationist members agreeing that declining Turkey's petition will only push them into the arms of our enemies, a grave folly in the Cold War."
 turkey_faction_skeleton.1.a: "Welcome to the free world!" 
 
 turkey_faction_skeleton.2.t: "CHP Government Petitions for Sphere Observer Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.2.d: "The whole of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in elation today as we have received word that the İnönü government is looking to join our alliance as an Observer.\n\nUnder prime minister Gülek and President İnönü, Turkey is slowly regaining the prestige it lost after its defeat in the Italo-Turkish War as its economy has experienced an impressive recovery from its previous malaise. The defeated Turkish military is also still one of the most powerful forces in the region and a valuable boon to us.\n\nLooking at things in a wider geopolitical context, Turkey joining our Asian family also allows us a crucial territory to project our power into the Balkans, the Middle East and to a lesser extent, the wider European continent. Our businessmen would also certainly be grateful for the opportunity to tap into fresh markets.\n\nAfter weighing up these benefits, our cabinet is unanimous in approving their status as an Observer to the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Declining such an application would only leave their country vulnerable to the ruthless Western powers."

 turkey_faction_skeleton.3.t: "CHP Government Petitions for Pakt Observer Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.3.d: "It appears our old ally, Turkey, has finally decided to reject their adolescent ways of neutrality and embrace our alliance again as the İnönü government has finally come to its senses, recently submitting an application to become a Pakt Observer.\n\nThe Turks' defeat in the Italo-Turkish War has firmly destroyed their foolish notions of becoming a superpower, however, they still remain a regional power in both the Balkans and the Middle East. Their military's martial prowess still can't be denied even after its loss as it ranks among the strongest in the Middle East.\n\nFurthermore, the CHP government has made great successes in improving their economy from the malaise it was once in, providing us with a strong trading partner once they enter our alliance. Their entry into the Pakt would also bring us one step further toward solidifying our rightful place as the masters of Europe.\n\nFor all these reasons and more, even our most stubborn ministers who continue to hold grudges over the Triumvirate's creation can't deny the strengths Turkey would bring to us. As such, agreement to allow Turkey to join the Pakt as an Observer is unanimous, lest our craven enemies try and seduce Turkey away from us."

 turkey_faction_skeleton.4.d: "We have just received excellent news from Turkish diplomats that they intend to change their geopolitical outlook to move towards the free world as their application to become an OFN Partner draws close to submission.\n\nUnder prime minister Menderes and President Bayar, the Republic of Turkey has taken great strides in reforming its stagnant economy since the days of CHP hegemony and their bitter defeat in the Italo-Turkish War. The UDP has freed the Turkish people from autarky and has made phenomenal economic gains with its free-market-friendly economic policies, a very appetizing environment for our companies.\n\nFurthermore, the ideals of the OFN fit very well with the liberal democratic policies of the UDP, making them perfect for cooperation with our constituent member states and allowing us to increase our reach to the center of the world. And of course, the powerful Turkish military will only add to our worldwide defense of democracy.\n\nOur representatives are unanimous in approving their application, with even our most isolationist members agreeing that declining Turkey's petition will only push them into the arms of our enemies, a grave folly in the Cold War."

 turkey_faction_skeleton.5.t: "UDP Government Petitions for Sphere Observer Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.5.d: "It would seem affairs in the terminus of far western asia have unexpectedly turned out in our favor. Despite the damage from the Italo-Turkish war still smoldering in the desert, the Republic of Turkey, under the heading of new Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and President Celâl Bayar, have approached Japan in the hopes of securing an economic partnership with the Sphere.\n\nThis is nothing surprising to the leadership in Tokyo. Turkish plans to liberalize their markets are well known, as is their desire to secure some sort of an alliance after the Triumverite's collapse. The new government might be earnest in their desires to reform Turkey into a true democracy, but they still realize the OFN would not represent their interests as well as we us, who have been similarly spurned by our former Axis partner in Rome; the Turks know we are the most committed towards combating European hegemony, whatever reservations they might have towards our worldview.\n\nThat having been said, initial talks with Ankara have proven fruitful. The Republic of Turkey will mightily prosper with access to the markets of the East, just as we are sure to benefit from having an ally on the Mediterranean at our beck and call. Perhaps now, with their former ally from two world wars firmly within our influence, the belligerents in Germania will understand our commitment to our cause."
 turkey_faction_skeleton.5.a: "An alley on the Bosphorus is a worthy one, indeed."

 turkey_faction_skeleton.6.d: "The incompetence of our former partner in Rome is seemingly without reprieve, as now one of their former partners, and a former ally of the Reich, has come to us in the hopes of renewing an old alliance. The Turks have been trying to rebuild themselves after the carnage of Triumvirate Collapse, licking their wounds from the Italo-Turkish War.\n\nNow with the new administration under Adnan Menderes and Celâl Bayar, they look to open their markets in search for a new political alliance. Given our shared history across two world wars, it only makes sense for the Turks to attempt detente with Germany; as repugnant as their commitment to democracy is or however bitter we may feel with their alignment with Rome, their position on the Bosphorus combined with their grip on Mesopotamia is too tempting a deal to turn down.\n\nAnd so with the stroke of a pen, the Reich finds itself allies with Istanbul for the third time, the Republic of Turkey now formally granted observer status within the Einheitspakt. With this new alliance comes maritime access to the Black Sea, which will allow Germany direct trade routes to Kaukaisia and Moskowien. Almost as important is the return of one of the Reich's oldest martial allies into the fold once more, serving as a counter-balance to Italian interests in the Arab world."

They have turned the de facto one-party state into a flourishing progressive and democratic regime that fits excellently with the ideals the OFN upholds.\n\nOn the more pragmatic side of things, Turkey is a thriving regional power in the Balkans and the Middle East and possesses a very capable military, offering us power projection in these valuable Cold War territories. Furthermore, their thriving economy will make them an excellent trading partner for all OFN member states wishing to do business with them.\n\nOur representatives are unanimous in approving their application, with even our most isolationist members agreeing that declining Turkey's petition will only push them into the arms of our enemies, a grave folly in the Cold War."
 turkey_faction_skeleton.7.a: "The torch of liberty glows a little brighter today." 
 
 turkey_faction_skeleton.8.t: "Turkey Junta Government Petitions for OFN Partner Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.8.d: "To say the Islamic world has seen better days is an understatement, being torn between Italian colonial interests and the interference from Germania and Tokyo leaves little room for nation building. This is true even in Turkey, whose identity as the example of a modern Middle Eastern nation has itself been put through the crucible. But lucky for us, this might have gone in our favor.\n\nThe recent unrest in Turkey has almost seen the Republic collapse, almost going the way of the empire that died giving birth to it. But now, the Turkish military has stepped in to formally restore order; the new leadership in Ankara might seem cagey to outside eyes, but the leaders remain committed - or so they claim - to the secular and progressive ideals of Mustafa Kemal.\n\nThis might well be the reason why they've come to us, petitioning the OFN for Observer Status in the hopes of warding off incursions, diplomatic or otherwise, from either Europe or Asia. The OFN has already sullied its reputation for supporting authoritarian regimes to combat Pakt or CPS encroachment abroad, but any ally against imperialism is a welcome one, and the junta in Turkey is no exception.\n\nWith this in mind, the leadership of the OFN has formally welcomed the Republic of Turkey on with full Observer status. With the Turks' military track record being what it is, one could not ask for a better ally to keep tabs on our enemies in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, access to the Dardanelles and the Black Sea gives a crucial strategic choke point and an easy corridor into Nazi controlled territories in Eastern Europe. This might well prove to be a major victory for the OFN, one that might shift the balance of the Cold War for the better!"

 turkey_faction_skeleton.9.d: "It would be impolite to assume Asia is lacking for sterling military reputations of the same caliber as the IJA, but the era of Chinese or Oceanic or Indian military dominance has largely been relegated to the history books. Pockets of distinction still do appear from time to time, and one such distinction on the far western peripheries of Asia wishes for an audience with the proctors of the East.\n\nThe Republic of Turkey has been plagued with a hefty share of difficulties, both external and internal, seemingly without end. But in light of recent unrest following the Italo-Turkish war, the officers of the Turkish military have reasserted order. Despite initial worries over the coming of autocratic excesses, the new leadership remains committed to maintaining the democratic principles of the late Kemal Atatürk.\n\nPerhaps it is little wonder then that the Turks would seek an alliance with the far east; Ever aware of Europeans interloping on their own sovereignty, they wish for the protection of nations utmost committed to ensuring their independence from the western powers.\n\nWithout hardly a moment's pause, the Empire of Japan has granted the Republic of Turkey Observer status within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This will surely prove an absolute windfall for the cause we represent; Asia now has a beachhead sitting right at the mouth of southern Europe, one that will serve as a perfect springboard for countering German influence along the Mediterranean. Furthermore, with access to Turkey's vast mineral wealth and integration into the Asian economy, there is scarcely any downside for either of our proud nations."

 turkey_faction_skeleton.10.t: "Turkey Junta Government Petitions for Pakt Observer Status"
 turkey_faction_skeleton.10.d: "Our own efforts to combat Italien grip on the Mediterranean has been a regular source of ire for the Third Reich, even after the collapse of the Triumvirate seemed to herald the decline of Rome. But fortunately for us, such dire straits for the Italian Empire can be made, as they often have been, to prove beneficial to our rule.\n\nIn the wake of the Italo-Turkish War, domestic unrest fused with foreign subterfuge to nearly cripple the Turkish Republic, leading to the rise of the military regime of the armed forces; a last ditch attempt to preserve Mustafa Kemal's vision of Turkey as a nation of modernity and progress. Much like their Ottoman forebears, many nations abroad seek to exploit the current weakness of the Turkish state for their own ends.\n\nIt is for this reason they have sought to rekindle the alliance between our nations, as it had been across the two world wars. Certainly, we carry no small amount of culpability in helping to undermine Turkey for our own gain up until now; contemporaries in geopolity with those who would seek to undercut the Reich for similar purposes. But their request for Observer status within the Einheitspakt would grant us an old ally in the east against further Italian intercession that we can ill afford to reject.\n\nAnd so, for the third time in our history, the soldiery of the Reich and the soldiery of Anatolia shall march as comrades once again as the Turks rejoin our sphere. Whatever our contempt for their commitment to Kemalist westernization might bring, the Turkish army is among the most formidable their region has ever produced. A mirror of our previous expeditions together is already visible to us; an old, familiar feeling, half-hidden beneath the marching rumble of a thousand iron-shod boots."
