### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ABBA_KOVNER_DESC:0 ""We will not go like Sheep to the Slaughter."\n\nThese words have defined the entire life of Abba Kovner, the leader of the loose confederation of partisans known to him as the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye. From the presses of Germania, papers roll, telling of the evil deeds of Judeo-Bolshevik terrorists: of the graves dug for innocent men, women and children. A devil in the skin of a man, Goebbels would claim.\n\nBorn in 1918, Kovner grew up in a world that despised him and his family for the simple reason of their faith and culture. As a local leader of the Marxist Zionist youth group HaShomer HaTzair, Kovner watched anxiously as the sparks of the second World War exploded to an inferno - and in 1942, as an influential man in the Vilna Ghetto, became one of the first to correctly determine the sum of German antisemitism: the total physical annihilation of Europe's Jews. Kovner refused to go quietly into the night; unlike the local leaders of Vilna's Jews, and instead led his young partisan group into the forests outside of Vilna - calling themselves the Nokmim - the Avengers.\n\nKovner was not under any delusions of grandeur over his position. It was a hopeless war. The best he could ask for was to show the world that he, his friends, and his comrades had taken a stand against immeasurable odds - all attempts at justice had, however, faltered. The sympathetic officers in the Wehrmacht were executed for treason - the officers he assassinated were always replaced. Every slave camp that was liberated and destroyed only served as fertile ground for the next to be constructed. Even upon the West Russian War, between the assassination of Willhelm Keitel, the conspiracy with Ponomarenko, and the SS's coup- no justice was gained. The earth became littered with bodies, Ponomarenko and Keitel among them, united in their insignificance.\n\nEven after all these long, bloody years, Abba Kovner is still not the monster that Germany assumes him to be. He is not a mythical slaughterer of innocents nor children; rather, he is a Dybbuk: a vengeful spirit in the skin of a man, heart aching for justice.\n\nPerhaps there is no justice left in this world - perhaps there is no justice for the millions sent to their deaths.\n\n§RBut there shall be Nakam.§!"

POLITICS_FRANZ_STAHLECKER_DESC:0 "At a quick glance one might assume Franz Walter Stahlecker is the stereotype of a Nazi official. His story seems to check every box, fighting in the First World War, serving in right-wing militias during the chaos of the Weimar Republic, and joining the NSDAP when it became clear that Hitler was poised to seize control of the nation. Indeed, Stahlecker's career path within the party seems to be a model of the mid-level bureaucrat's journey, climbing the ladder of postings, accumulating a long but uninteresting resume. It was not until the Second World War that Stahlecker seized his chance to make an impression.\n\nPlaced in command of Einsatzgruppe A, Stahlecker led the SS through a campaign of genocide across the territories that would become Ostland. Stahlecker made sure his soldiers killed more Untermenschen than any other group in the hopes of earning further promotions. It worked, and Stahlecker secured his place in Ostland's administration. However, his ambition exceeded his reach, and Stahlecker spent the next decade stuck in his position, struggling to advance. Even abandoning the SS after their failed coup did not win him any friends.\n\nNow, Ostland has fallen into chaos, but Stahlecker does not despair. Where others see disaster, he sees opportunity. The power and status he has craved are finally up for grabs, and he will stop at nothing to seize them."

POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_JECKELN_DESC:0 "Europe's engines of mass extermination did not disappear following the introduction of the pan-European slave economy, no, they only went into disuse, sitting and churning along for rightful hands to reactivate them. The hands of Friedrich Jeckeln are rightful hands indeed, ragged and worn-out from the good days, when the engines were fired and the Lebensraum cleansed. But those good days are over now, and in the place of mass extermination there is a new, supreme monolith of racial triumph Ostland's wing of the Schutzstaffel gropes towards. The "Crusade for the Purification of Ostland". It is Ostland's victory over the Untermenschen, it is the victory of National Socialism as National Socialism should be, in Burgundy's image. This will be Jeckeln's final death-blow to the rotting structure, yet who is Jeckeln to be the restorer of Aryan purity to Ostland?\n\nFriedrich Jeckeln is a man without the limitations of morality. He is a man willing to undertake whatever actions necessary to end all threats to the Aryan race, real or what he thinks to be real. Inventor of the "Jeckeln System" during World War Two, a process of human "sardine packing" in order to more efficiently exterminate Untermenschen, it is clear Jeckeln is willing to exceed all drawn-lines. Humanity is nothing to race. Yet, who is Jeckeln the man? Who sits on the Hochmeister's throne?\n\nOn the throne there is a servile, weak and feeble creature. A slavishly devoted follower of Nanzig's every command. Jeckeln searches for any chance to fulfill his careerism, for Ostland is but a step to him, but not to the rest of Ostland's SS. In Ostland there are police leaders, Waffen-SS Landsknechts, officers, soldiers and mariners, personal cliques, Oberabschnitt Ost exiles, Burgundians and bureaucrats and any other number of SS men. This hydra of leadership pulls Jeckeln in whichever way they wish him to focus, and he has no option but to dance to their tune."

POLITICS_OTTO_DRECHSLER_DESC:0 "Look on upon an older gentleman, curled up by the fireside in his blankets and his wheelchair. A veteran of World War One, a faithful servant of the Aryan race in its efforts to expand across the Reich's Lebensraum. In the fires of the first World War was he forged, for life is war. Drechsler took up this reality, codified it into a way of life and took up the mantle of the warrior from his wheelchair's bounds. The war tore his leg from his body, but it taught a life-long lesson to the old soldier. If the war will never leave you, then perhaps it isn't supposed to.\n\nDrechsler did not adopt this identity, but grew into it after years of philosophizing on warrior culture, the traditional roles of the genders and social-Darwinism in government. He has been called the "Philosopher-King" for his politico-military theories on the concepts of nationhood, and how society itself can be molded in the crucibles of conflict and evolution towards ever-greater horizons. A specific, all-encompassing theory of his has gained traction above all others: the idea that Untermenschen withhold the urge to rebellion within their blood, and that so long as the Reich maintains peace, this urge will only cultivate and expand until the Reich is left broken by its own ungrateful state of sloth. Life may not be war, but it could and should be, so says the ever-prattling old man. But who listens? Who follows? Who is this man without authority? Look no further than a clique of war-starved, heads-in-the-clouds militarists and war criminals. Drechsler's little "war-masters". Those who do the dirty deeds of commanding the troops, ordering the massacres and reprisals, dehumanizing opponents and the civilians who follow them. While Drechsler writes his thoughts, extols his vision, his men do war and all that doing war entails.\n\nThis man is no general, no diplomat nor commander of men. But he can speak and he can think, and so long as he is able to exalt his wars and lionize those who fight them, paint his struggles as something heroic, poetic and mythological, then may the battle for ever-lasting glory be his and his alone forever."

POLITICS_ANDREAS_MEYER_LANDRUT_DESC:0 "From the basements crying out with rock 'n roll, to the university students downing reefer upon reefer in communal clambakes, and the street-bound rebels swearing their allegiances to new evolutions of anti-fascist thought, the next generation has arrived to Ostland and they won't let you forget it. Their blood runs in the gutters, the swastika's hooks have cracked their ribs and made them spit bile. The Reichskommissariat deigned them degenerates, Bolsheviks and race traitors, and beat them down once the buds of insurgency sprouted. But even though the administration could not envision it, their will triumphed. Whole metropolitan areas were overtaken by rioting youths, following in the footsteps of a world which has never existed. Journalists, utilizing what few media outlets exist in Ostland, spread news of their movement and pushed it into overdrive. The fascists tried their damnedest to beat back the tar pit into which they were being swallowed, transforming Vilnius into their personal slaughterhouse. But oh, what fools those butchers were.\n\nAnd yet, the success of the youths was restrained by the realities of leadership. A fog of neons can hardly be called on to arrive at once, let alone organize or take up positions in a hierarchy of command. That is, until he arrived.\n\nGold watches, sunglasses of silver trim, gelled-back hair and a fit suit to match his ego. A playboy? Perhaps. Andreas Meyer-Landrut is a product of old Baltic German society, and yet, also a member of the new radical and charged generation defining Ostland's future. Born a rich boy to a family of industrialists, Meyer-Landrut has inherited a very important position, cutting deals between Siemens and the Reichskommissariat's administration. Himself a multicultural man, raised by a Russian nanny and taught to speak both German, Estonian and Russian as a child, Meyer-Landrut could only feel pain at the sight of Ostland's slaves, begging for mercy in the same tongue as he. He has been a student of law ever since (backed by his own, independent studies into Slavistics), and one of the most well-connected reformers to exist within Ostland. From this position he has gained the backing of the youths, but more importantly, of pragmatists, businessmen and Baltic Germans across Ostland. The coalition he oversees may be shaky, but Meyer-Landrut thinks himself able to be the torchbearer of liberation, no matter how his flames transform on the journey."

POLITICS_MICHAL_VITUSKA:0 "In this man's heart there is a fire, a signal of walking the righteous path. But this is no path, and it is not righteous. Vituška, charmer, man of culture, climber of the rungs to power. At the end of this ladder is Ostland, yet Belarus too? At Vituška's back is a nation, those souls clamoring for autonomy, independence, retribution against their slave-masters. Vituška has done the impossible, formed a coalition of hardline, Germanophobe nationalists and collaborators too, united the hopes of Belarus behind his smile and wit. This was not Vituška twenty-years ago, and in truth, it still is not.\n\nVituška was but a collaborator in the 40s and 50s, not just of Germany but the SS too. Back in those days, Vituška was on the frontlines of the "war against Judeo-Bolshevism". No man could organize more raids, oversee more massacres, stuff more Untermenschen into burning barns than he could. But, the Jewry left for the woods and Vituška did not follow. He awaited the sun to shine down upon him, for the promotions and celebrations to follow in his steps. None of it ever came, but a new opportunity would allow him to catch the attention of his masters, surely. The Ostland Crisis washed over Belarus, Jews, Bolsheviks and partisans breaking out all over. Vituška and his Black Cat commandos forced them northwards, into the Baltics and out of Belarus. Championing his "mastery in terror" as having saved Belarus, the world seemed to be Vituška's and promotion was imminent. Yet, fate conspired against him again. The German administration, seeking to split the Belorussian nationalist movement, snubbed him of promotion and the Belorussian collaborators clapped along, their positions protected from Vituška's ambition.\n\nNo one but Vituška knows how Vituška clawed his way back to prominence. First, Vituška's own cousin died and the Black Cats were once-again unified. Then, the head of the Belorussian collaborators died, and the collaborators were walking in-step with him. The presses printed his name, yet everyone seemed fit to ignore him. It is ignorance no longer. Fear, for Nemesis strikes as he strikes."

POLITICS_HINRICH_LOHSE_DESC:0 "If one was to take a look at all the Reichskommissariats of Germany, they would not find an impressive sight. Most of the Reichskommissariats are falling apart at the seams, disloyal to the Reich, or simply unprofitable hellholes. However, one among these squabbling puppets stands out as a true jewel of Germany. Reichskommissariat Ostland is a mostly calm, profitable, and somewhat Germanized state, and it was all because of one man: Hinrich Lohse. A veteran of the Great War, an early devotee to the Party, and High President of Schleswig-Holstein, it was no surprise when Lohse was appointed to the job as Reichskommissar. From there, he managed Ostland loosely, delegating much of the necessary work to his most loyal and competent subordinates. This strategy has borne much fruit, as Ostland is one of the most Germanized, most profitable, and most stable Reichskommissariats. As long as these men had Lohse to control them and act as figurehead, this system worked.\n\nHowever, bad health gets the best of everyone, and over the last few years Lohse has slipped away from the spotlight more and more. With him goes his uniting presence, and those under him have understood this. With Lohse's already loose hand growing more and more limp, those subordinates who once served loyally now begin to eye Lohse's seat with a growing hunger.\n\nAs Drechsler, Stahlecker, and Meyer-Landrut bicker with one another, Kovner's attacks grow more and more bold, and Vituska and Jeckeln watch and plot behind closed doors, one can see the clear cracks in the system. The people of Ostland can only hope that either Lohse recovers or a compromise candidate is selected as his replacement, lest chaos and blood flow through the streets of Riga."

#Focus descs
 OST_finishing_touches:0 "Finishing Touches"
 OST_finishing_touches_desc:0 "The last five years have been busy for the Ostland administration. Headed by Hinrich Lohse, Ostland has seen some dramatic changes to the countryside. Cities are now larger, thanks to the lure of new, better paying jobs in the factories. In Estonia, impressive harbors to facilitate trade near completion, while the rest of the region overwent modernization in all sectors.\n\nWhile the economy has grown to impressive heights, Germanization has proceeded decently, or at least until the economic crash of the 50s. Likewise, Ostland has been plagued by native partisans for the better part of two decades now, economic prosperity not enough to get the rebels to come out of the forests. To top it off, we need to keep an eye out on factionalism in our administration.\n\nThe coming days must be navigated carefully. Ostland is finally reaching her potential, but the country is still rife with low levels of discontent. We must navigate the partisans and politics of our nation with equal caution."
 OST_keep_the_peace:0 "Keep the Peace"
 OST_keep_the_peace_desc:0 "Little known to the vast majority of the people in Ostland, we have an impressive database of known partisans, leaders, and most importantly their families. There are many partisans who live off the grid, and are for all intents and purposes, out of our hands. However, their families are not.\n\nWe have an... "understanding" with the major resistance groups. Their leaders know that we hold their families' lives in our hands. Therefore, they "understand" that touching our industrial complexes or major government facilities means brutal retaliation. As long as the government doesn't collapse, the informal agreement will continue for the foreseeable future."
 OST_estonian_harbors:0 "Estonian Harbors"
 OST_estonian_harbors_desc:0 "Much of Estonia's industrial development has been focused on building up the port facilities. The new ports tighten the connection Ostland shares with the Reich; allowing trade to flow much quicker and in massively increased volume. The ports however, are nowhere built up to their full potential. We can make a large investment to massively expand the harbor and increase our links to the Fatherland.\n\nIn addition to the economic benefits, conservatives in our country will be pleased with these developments and the increasing economic cooperation with the Fatherland."
 OST_attract_siemens:0 "Attract Siemens"
 OST_attract_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens AG is one of the largest corporations in Europe. Investing in everything from agriculture to computer electronics, they are an economic powerhouse in their own right. Attracting their interest and industrial expertise could be a great boon to our economy.\n\nWe will attempt to get Siemens to invest in Estonia, a region that could use the economic boost. To really get their attention, we will offer tax breaks and land, selling it for next to nothing! If successful, the boost to our economy would be massive. A refusal, however, would be embarrassing, leading to a fall in popularity for the conservatives there."
 OST_educate_the_workers:0 "Educate the Workers"
 OST_educate_the_workers_desc:0 "In Estonia, we have been blessed with a sizable workforce and a good industrial base to work from. Over the years, Germanization has overhauled these factories, and many of them are on par technologically with factories back in the Fatherland. There is a problem, however.\n\nThe local Estonian population simply does not understand how to use our machinery. Be it linguistic barriers or just a general lack of know-how, our worker base is woefully inadequate for industrial work. Therefore, we shall implement an education initiative to get our working population up to speed on modern industrial standards."
 OST_latvian_partisans:0 "Latvian Partisans"
 OST_latvian_partisans_desc:0 "The traitorous partisans in Latvia have been a thorn in our side for decades now. While they do, for the most part, leave our industry and administration personal alone, they have been continually pushing their luck. Ambushes on truckers, trains full of supplies, assassinations of police officers, and even the intermittent killings of Germans must be stopped! Or... lessened.\n\nKnown members of the Latvian resistance will be rounded up. Their known camps will be raided and burned, and rounding up family members of these traitors is currently being considered. The bastards WILL play nice with us, or pay a heavy price."
 OST_alter_the_deal:0 "Alter the Deal"
 OST_alter_the_deal_desc:0 "Our plans have been put into place. Our men have found several exposed bases of operation in use by the partisans in Latvia. We will smash when the time comes, which will be soon. Their brazen acts of aggression need to be stopped; we can not sit around letting the local police deal with them any longer.\n\nThe plan is to quickly strike a decent number of their hidden bases across Latvia to show them that we mean business. We won't act brazenly as to destroy the status quo, but our show of strength should be more than enough to put the Lativans back in their place. Everything looks fine on paper, and we aren't expecting any reprisals, though some in our administration fear retaliation."
 OST_strengthen_local_militias:0 "Strengthen Local Militias"
 OST_strengthen_local_militias_desc:0 "Militarists in our administration have proposed shaping up the local militias, particularly in Latvia. The militias, they argue, are not up to German standards. Undisciplined, many locals join the groups for the benefits and pay it provides, but are unwilling to take actions against partisans or other unruly non-German Ostlanders.\n\nOur staff want to send professional advisors to oversee the militia's training. Hopefully with some extra discipline the militias will be able to keep their local regions secure and reduce the strain on our armed forces."
 OST_lithuanian_integration:0 "Lithuanian Integration"
 OST_lithuanian_integration_desc:0 "Of all the peoples that inhabit Ostland, the Lithuanians have been the most accommodating to German rule. Lithuania boosts the highest rates of native Germanization and the lowest number of partisan incursions. All in all, Lithuania is a model of German success in her colonies, and the Fatherland rewards its loyal subjects.\n\nIt is time we finish our Germanization efforts in Lithuania. Investments will be poured into the region. New factories and roads will be built, infrastructure will be improved, and the people will be incorporated into our administration as official citizens."
 OST_request_further_military_integration:0 "Request Further Military Integration"
 OST_request_further_military_integration_desc:0 "The armed forces in Ostland are quite sizable. We have enough men in our own army that we don't need to rely on reinforcements from the Fatherland every time a crisis breaks out. The issue with our army is that it is divided.\n\nAll of the colonial administrations in Ostland have their own separate armed forces that indirectly answer to us, which has created a nightmare in the Wehrmacht's chain of command. Taking a small step forward, we will attempt to integrate Lithuania's army into our own forces under our direct control. Lithuania, being the most stable and Germanized region in Ostland, is the most likely to accept the proposal.\n\nIf this pans out well in the end, we will increase militancy throughout the region and bolster our forces. However, if the plan falls through, it will be proof to the conservatives that the status quo is the correct path for Ostland, increasing their influence."
 OST_promote_povilas:0 "Promote Povilas"
 OST_promote_povilas_desc:0 "Our administration, though well armed and manned, lacks high ranking officers to coordinate our divisions on the field. Although we could simply request some higher up to be transferred over from Germany proper, the administration favors a more "local" solution.\n\nPovilas Plechavičius is a native Lithuanian who has long served the Reich and our military as an able and loyal officer. With decades of experience, he is a natural choice for promotion. Not only do we make one of our own local officers a general, but this will show the natives that loyalty and hard work will be rewarded. His connections with his fellow Lithuanians should also not be discounted off hand; he could prove to be extremely useful."
 OST_belarussian_doubts:0 "Belorussian Doubts"
 OST_belarussian_doubts_desc:0 "The Belorussian collaboration government has always been... strange. The region is home to a divided Russian population, German settlers, and other ethnic minorities. Not much in the way of information comes out of the region; the local government keeps mostly to itself, preferring to handle its own affairs with as little intervention as possible. While this isn't an issue in of itself, it is frustrating that our administration does not know where the collaboration government stands politically; whether they support the conservatives or the militarists in our government.\n\nOur administration needs a clear answer, one way or another. Answers so far have been ambiguous and noncommittal, for whatever reason. If we are to solidify our rule and know where we stand with the Belorussian collaborators, we most know what they think. We can not afford a wild card to bite us in the side; we need a definite answer."
 OST_meet_with_vituska:0 "Meet with Vituska"
 OST_meet_with_vituska_desc:0 "The best way to figure out where exactly the Belorussian collaborators stand is to be direct. We will arrange a meeting with Michal Vituska, the head of the Belorussian collaboration government; face to face. Ideally, the confrontation forces him to commit to one of the factions in our government, and finally start some more regular interactions with our administration.. Surely Vituska wouldn't be foolish enough to affirm indifference when confronted..."
 OST_subvert_the_council:0 "Subvert the Council"
 OST_subvert_the_council_desc:0 "The Belorussian government has undermined our authority for far too long. Vituska has run Belorussia like it is his own personal fiefdom. He has blatantly ignored many of our attempts to Germanize the locals, does not coordinate well with other region's militias, and authorizes the construction of factories and infrastructure at his leisure and personal gain, all without our permission!\n\nAdmittedly, Vituska's governance is excellent. The government in Belorussia faces very little partisan activity, and even without our guiding hand has built an impressive industrial base in the region. Regardless, his blatant disregard of us must not be allowed to continue with impunity. If he wants funding, he'll have to play nice with us. Our military reforms can be partially implemented in Belarus to increase our influence in the local militias. We can hamper the flow of goods to and from the region. We will make running that administration a bureaucrat's worst nightmare; a paperwork hell, and we'll continue to do so until Vituska and his men get the point.\n\nThey work for us, not the other way around."
 OST_jeckelns_return:0 "Jeckeln's Return"
 OST_jeckelns_return_desc:0 "Friedrich Jeckeln has returned home. He has been away on an "official state visit" to Burgundy for several months to discuss SS affairs. In all reality, we had no say in who got to go, and frankly, we didn't care; it meant one less fanatic for us to deal with. Jeckeln being absent from the Kommissariat was pleasant and gave the suffering smallfolk some much needed respite.\n\nJeckeln rules the eastern province like a dystopian dictator, using the SS as his own personal terrorists and boogeymen, so with him gone our administration and the locals got some respite. His return from Burgundy has been dreaded; Jeckeln is more ruthless than ever. The SS are starting to more resemble Dirlewanger's Brigade than proper German soldiers, and Jeckeln only encourages them to brutalize the undesirables with no tact or attempts of Germanization. We need to reign Jeckeln in before he completely destabilizes Lithuania... or worse."
 OST_replace_drechsler:0 "Replace Drechsler"
 OST_replace_drechsler_desc:0 "Drechsler has served our state admirably for decades. As a security minister, he has worked many tireless nights to combat the partisan plague that afflicted us for so many years. It is a shame, but politics is forcing our hands.\n\nWe shall dismiss Drechsler with full honors from the ministry, replacing him with Jeckeln. Naturally, the militarists are going to be furious, and Drechsler himself will likely not be happy. For the good of the state though, we need to end Jeckeln's reign of terror in the south and move him to Riga to keep him close to our administration and under our control. If nothing else, the conservatives in Lithuania will appreciate our actions. At least our influence there will increase."
 OST_investigate_the_southern_camps:0 "Investigate the Eastern Camps"
 OST_investigate_the_southern_camps_desc:0 "For too long the SS has operated with impunity in Ostland. Thousands of natives have disappeared throughout the years, sometimes even reported kidnapped or abducted. Although we normally wouldn't care about natives going missing, even with witness testimony, a number of German settlers, usually vocal reforms, liberals, or folk who criticized the SS in some manner have simply... vanished.\n\nMembers of our administration, backed with intelligence from a few local informants suspect that many of the missing people have ended up in the exclusively SS run concentration camps in the south.\n\nThe camps need to be checked out. The SS can not simply abduct whoever they want without our permission. The camps are ours, and we are going to send an armed delegation to investigate just what the hell is going on. The SS will be furious, but fuck them, its time they learn their place in OUR Kommissariat!"
 OST_landruts_protests:0 "Landrut's Protests"
 OST_landruts_protests_desc:0 "The industrialists, lead by Landrut have stirred up anti-Nazi sentiment in Talinn. There are currently hundreds of natives (and even a few Germans!) taking to the streets to demand better treatment of citizens and more rights for non-Germans.\n\nThe industrialists are playing a dangerous game; but it seems Landrut has a conscience after all. We could sit down with him and offer some token reforms, pay some lip service and go on our way. On the other hand, we could just crack down on the protests and call it a day..."
 OST_the_talinn_university_massacre:0 "The Tallinn University Massacre"
 OST_the_talinn_university_massacre_desc:0 "The industrialists have challenged our authority. They have issued an ultimatum, and are going to try and use the people against us. The rest of the Reich watches us closely, waiting to see how this will play out, and we will not look weak.\n\nThe Heer will be deployed. We will break up the protests and rallies, close the meeting halls, and arrest anyone who resists. If people get out of line, we will not hesitate to issue shoot on sight orders. The SS will even be useful for once. We'll task them with rounding up the ringleaders of this little insurrection so we may... deal with them.\n\nNaturally, reformers in Germany will watch with horror and object as we crack down on the protestors, but this is the price they and those rich bastards pay for civil disobedience."
 OST_sit_down_with_their_leaders:0 "Sit Down with Their Leaders"
 OST_sit_down_with_their_leaders_desc:0 "Landrut, the industrialists, and the many protests have forced our hands. Though we may not like it, the best course of action for us to take is to swallow our pride and hear what grievances they have with our administration. Though it may be simpler to just send in the army, these protests prove that there is widespread dissatisfaction throughout Ostland. Listening now and offering some token reforms to improve the situation could save us a lot of grief in the long term. Unfortunately, conservatives throughout Germany will not approve of our tactics, but we must do what's best for Ostland."
 OST_prepare_the_military_parade:0 "Prepare the Military Parade"
 OST_prepare_the_military_parade_desc:0 "In preparation for the Führer's visit to our shores, we shall organize a demonstration of our material might!\n\nAll of our Panzers must be present! Do we have jet planes? Of course we do! They'll fly in formation over our men! The Heer must be present in formation for the Führer's arrival; anything less would be a disgrace!\n\nThe militarists approve, you say? You're damn right, they better approve. Why the hell aren't they helping? Get to work!"
 OST_plan_the_tour:0 "Plan the Tour"
 OST_plan_the_tour_desc:0 "Nothing short of a grand tour should be arranged for the Führer's visit to Ostland! Only the finest food will be fit for him. He should travel in luxury! By train? Limo? Why not both? Of course, he will see the finest, modern factories in all of the Reichskommissariats! Our marvelous new harbors deserve to be seen by his eyes as well! Then, we will proceed to the beautiful countrysides, stopping to observe our successful Germanization of Lithuania. Following that, we can show the success of the native ruled lands; Belerus in particular before ending in the historic German city of Riga to display our cultural heritage!\n\nWe must do whatever we can to convince our Führer to make this state trip. Him doing so would greatly boost our standings in conservative circles, and would lend even more legitimacy to our administration."
 OST_invite_hitler:0 "Invite Hitler"
 OST_invite_hitler_desc:0 "Our plans have been set. Hitler's tour route has been decided on and transportation has already been arranged and is on standby. The entire country is preparing for the Führer's arrival; all that we need to do is officially send the invitation to the Reichstag.\n\nAll that we can do now is wait. In all reality, the decision of the Führer is up to Hitler's successor. Hopefully, our relations with him are cordial, lest our invitation is declined. The fallout of such an embarrassment would be severe."
 OST_the_strongest_army:0 "The Strongest Army"
 OST_the_strongest_army_desc:0 "In the east, our army stands second to none. We have based our command and army structure on the Fatherland's, and the quality shows. Our Heer suffers no rivals; no rebel or partisan dares to stand up to the might of Ostland's Wehrmacht. The streets are quiet and peaceful, the countrysides are under our control, and even the forests seem deserted of hostile activity. Other Reichskommissariats look upon us with envy; for we have by far the strongest army in all of the Reich's colonies.\n\nTruly, our army is the best!"
 OST_the_best_industry:0 "The Best Industry"
 OST_the_best_industry_desc:0 "Our industrial investments throughout Ostland are finally paying off. The fields and mines of Belarus produce plentiful raw materials for our factories in Estonia. Our educated and experienced workers then manufacture quality goods in our modern industrial facilities. The goods then flow from our new rail lines and roads to our major harbors. There, our shipping transports wait in port for their loads, sending our goods all throughout the four corners of the Pakt.\n\nOur economy is the envy of all Reichskommissariats. No one has our output, our efficiency, or our quality. We simply have no equals, our industry is simply the best."
 OST_the_model_colony_focus:0 "The Model Colony"
 OST_the_model_colony_focus_desc:0 "Through our hard work, RK Ostland has become the Reich's model colony. No other Reichskommissariat can claim such economic success or growth. No one can deny the ongoing success of Germanizating the local populations; in this regard even Böhmen Mähren looks upon us with envy! We have an excellent army, which is well organized, supplied, and supported by numerous well trained militias.\n\nWe have labored long and hard to make Ostland a shining jewel of the Reich. We have accomplished much during our tenure, and it is from our efforts we are able to reap such large rewards. The Fatherland must be proud of us."

 OST_Restoring_Order:0 "Restoring Order"
 OST_Restoring_Order_desc:0 "The degenerate tide has risen. Inhuman scum and ranting madmen alike have fractured Ostland to satiate their perverse lusts for power, coalescing sycophants of all stripes around their petty causes. Unless we strike back against this vulgar treason, everything that the late Lohse and his rightful successor Stahlecker have worked for will be destroyed. We must rally all the loyalists in the administration and the military to our banners, and only then shall triumph befall us. Order must be restored!" 
 OST_The_Last_Soldiers:0 "The Last Soldiers"
 OST_The_Last_Soldiers_desc:0 "To be betrayed by one's racial brethren is the greatest pain of all. Those who deserted us for Drechsler and Meyer have burned us all with their vile actions, but we cannot wallow in our anguish while they wreak havoc throughout Ostland. Soldiers still loyal to Stahlecker, the brave men who proudly display the Swastika and embrace the true values of National Socialism, must be roused to action against the treacherous scum yapping at our heels. Unless they return to our ranks, those cravens who abandoned the legitimate heir of Lohse will be annihilated."
 OST_The_Last_Bureaucrats:0 "The Last Bureaucrats"
 OST_The_Last_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "Is the pen mightier than the sword? Such a statement is folly, but the necessity of bureaucrats cannot be understated. These pen-pushers are integral cogs in the machinery of state and ensure the sustainability and prosperity of Ostland; as such, it was a heavy blow to Stahlecker when the snivelling little worms who allowed themselves to be seduced by the lies of Meyer and Drechsler slithered away from our administration. In times of war, all officials must be utilized to their maximum capacity, and the numerous skills of our most loyal bureaucrats must be harnessed for the Civil War effective immediately. Dissent and divergence from Stahlecker's war plan will not be tolerated. When a cog is put in its rightful place, all it can do is work."
 OST_A_United_Front:0 "A United Front"
 OST_A_United_Front_desc:0 "The pens of the bureaucrats and the guns of the soldiers are crossed in glorious unity! Now that the remaining men of Ostland's administration and military have pledged their utmost loyalty to Stahlecker, focusing their full attention towards winning this Civil War, our united front will face no more internal division. The skills of these faithful men must be harnessed to drive the traitors and their evil ideals out of this Reichskommissariat, or else the house of cards that Lohse and Stahlecker worked so hard to build and stabilize will collapse into nothingness."
 OST_Fortify_the_North:0 "Fortify the North"
 OST_Fortify_the_North_desc:0 "The liberal rat Meyer and the Slavic hordes of Kovner and Vituska have split our loyal forces in two, keeping the land controlled by Stahlecker's administration separated from each other. Transference of personnel, arms and other supplies between these two areas is almost impossible.\n\nWhen the great burden of sacrifice is placed upon the weary shoulders of a leader, it is his immediate actions that determine the greatness of his character. Stahlecker is a man of strength, with the wisdom and fortitude to decree that difficult decisions must be made in these dire times. Therefore, to ensure our absolute victory, Stahlecker has determined that the majority of our resources be used to fortify the north and protect it from collapse. If the north falls, so too does the only ray of hope for Ostland's future."
 OST_Defend_Riga:0 "Defend Riga"
 OST_Defend_Riga_desc:0 "We have fortified the north, and now we must fortify its capital. The capital of Ostland and central base of our strategic operations is the city of Riga, where Stahlecker and his most trusted advisors concoct masterful plans and issue necessary orders. Riga is, without question, the most important target for the scum we fight against; nothing would wrench victory further away from our grasp than the loss of this city to one of our many enemies. For now, the defence of Riga is our utmost priority."
 OST_Gathering_Men:0 "Gathering Men"
 OST_Gathering_Men_desc:0 "We need more men. Boosting our conscription will provide reinforcements for our many divisions, but soldiers alone will not win this war. It is the ideological purity and valiant comradery these new conscripts will bring to the battlefield that will determine who unites Ostland. The bloodthirsty Slavs fight for revenge and hedonism, while the traitorous Germans fight to betray our precious values; for them, defeat is inevitable. For us, once we have gathered men who fight not just for Stahlecker but the Reich as well, victory is guaranteed. The odds may be stacked against us, but we shall prevail."
 OST_Give_Them_Arms:0 "Give Them Arms"
 OST_Give_Them_Arms_desc:0 "Loyalty and courage alone cannot drive our soldiers to victory. A soldier is nothing without his weapon, and our fresh new army divisions will be little more than meat shields if they aren't well-armed. Knives, grenades, handguns, rifles, machine guns - we must secure as much as possible for Stahlecker's troops. Break open the armories and distribute the weapons!"
 OST_A_Strong_Army:0 "A Strong Army"
 OST_A_Strong_Army_desc:0 "Our conscription has been boosted, bringing an influx of freshly trained soldiers into the armed forces. Our new divisions have been fully armed with the weapons necessary to triumph in the many skirmishes and battles to come. Stahlecker and his administration now boasts an impressive army, the mightiest in all of Ostland, which shall crush our enemies like roaches under a boot. We shall not falter on our march to victory!"
 OST_Fight_for_the_Reich:0 "Fight for the Reich"
 OST_Fight_for_the_Reich_desc:0 "Hinrich Lohse, appointed by the late Führer himself, gained a reputation for managing the most stable and prosperous Reichskommissariat in eastern Europe. It would be foolish to deny that Lohse intended for Stahlecker to be his legitimate successor, which is a true testament to the latter's loyalty. Stahlecker represents the continuity of Lohse's regime, and therefore of National Socialism itself; to fight for him is not just to fight for Ostland, but to defend the Reich, to protect our beautiful families, and to preserve the Aryan dream worldwide."
 OST_Old_Prussian_Traditions:0 "Old Prussian Traditions"
 OST_Old_Prussian_Traditions_desc:0 "Despite the Aryan blood running through their veins, our enemies are not truly German. Their treasonous sentiments cannot be permitted to win, in battle or in mind. To fight against them, it is time we bring back some traditional means of warfare.

This dedicated National Socialist, a hardworking bureaucrat and vocal adherent of the conservative wing of the NSDAP, stood firmly by his beliefs in the face of Civil War. Such devotion to the Fatherland and the Aryan Race should serve as an inspiration for our troops.

Those German bureaucrats and soldiers who were seduced by the manipulation of Drechsler, Meyer and even Jeckeln have tainted their Aryan blood with their foolish actions... however, any foe who desires to join our side shall be forgiven and accepted.

Stahlecker has greeted the war's end with relief, but now he must focus on stitching this Reichskommissariat back together and wiping out the last vestiges of dissent. With enough dedication, Ostland can be rebuilt into a strong and unified bastion of Germanization in Europe. Long live Stahlecker!"

 OSTL.31.t:0 "A House of Cards"
 OSTL.31.desc:0 "Generaloberst Franz Bäke felt his chest tighten like a vice as he stomped down the corridor with a purposeful stride. Two guards lounged casually outside the door ahead. They saw the approaching security minister and snapped to attention, clicking their feet together and raising their arms high in salute.\n\n"Get out of my fucking way!" the officer barked, thrusting the door open as the two guards leapt aside. Bäke stormed into the room and saluted the man sitting before him. His heart felt like it was going to explode. "Heil Hitler!"\n\n"Heil Hitler," the man behind the desk replied, his sallow face startled. Bäke was struck by how dramatically the bureaucrat's hair had thinned out since the outbreak of the Civil War. "How fares our house of cards?"\n\n"Reichskommissar Stahlecker," Bäke panted heavily, "we have received many troubling reports. Jeckeln's little fiefdom in the south has completely cut communications with us. At first I assumed they'd sided with Drechsler, but our spies in his camp claim they've also lost contact with the SS. Jeckeln is clearly biding his time, calculating which side to thrust his support behind."\n\n"That snake hungers for power," Stahlecker muttered, his monotonous voice just as bland as the suit and tie he wore every day. "Don't fool yourself into thinking he'll choose a side. Any further information about the rise in partisan activity?"\n\n"Our reports suggest an even greater increase in activity over the last twenty-four hours. With Ostland torn in half, I imagine the partisans are mobilizing for a major terror attack."\n\n"Time is against us, Generaloberst," Stahlecker said, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "I am the rightful Reichskommissar of Ostland, no matter how many lies the traitors spew. Drechsler must be crushed swiftly and brutally. If we don't restore stability back to Ostland soon, I fear this house of cards will collapse into a burning heap of madness and cinders.""

OSTL.1.t:0 "The Model Colony"
OSTL.1.desc:0 "As the year 1962 dawns on Reichskommissariat Ostland, the Reich receives the usual report they do every month from their model colony. Germanization continues steadily onward, factory complexes remain some of the most able in the Reich thanks to the careful supervision of industrialist Meyer-Landrut, and progress has begun with a lasting ceasefire between the central government in Riga and the various ethnic and religious partisan groups in the forests and other outlands.\n\nUnlike many, this report is not a lie, and Ostland remains the most stable and peaceful colony in the entire Reich. Perhaps even more stable than the Reich itself. Some, however, have suggested that this Germanic paradise is actually built on a poweder keg, and that the fuse is burning.\n\nOstland is in all ways and manners a German colony and has grown to perfectly mirror the Reich's many strengths. This, however, means Ostland has grown to inherit the Reich's weaknesses as well.\n\nMuch like in the homeland, Ostland has become increasingly polarized between multiple factions. Jeckeln and the SS are in constant battle, though so far only figuratively, with Drechsler and his militarists in Latvia battling for the favor of Reichskommissar Lohse for control of the colony's military forces. Meyer-Landrut has slowly fallen under the wing of Albert Speer in Germany and has begun to advocate for liberalization and freedom for the nation's slaves, even more loudly than Speer himself. With utter control of the colony's industry and a wide-spanning series of connections, he is absolutely immune to any action against his reprehinsble views. Stahlecker, a true Bormannite and close advisor of Lohse, advocates for the continuation of the status quo and continual calm. In the shadows of all of this, Vituska and his Byelorussian Council continue to strive for further and further autonomy, and whispers remain that Abba Kovner, Jewish terrorist who the garrison has reported dead sixteen times in as many years, is still in the forests. Waiting to strike.\n\nOnly one thing is for certain, the colony will remain stable as long as it has the Fatherland's backing and Lohse remains in power. It's the 60s now! They'll certainly be nowhere near as tumultuous as the 50s!"
OSTL.1.a:0 "Hopefully the 60s doesn't become the Decade of Discontent!"

OSTL.2.t:0 "The Reichskommissar Fades"
OSTL.2.desc:0 "Gauleiter Hinrich Lohse has served faithfully ever since the establishment of Reichskommissariat Ostland. His regime has shown massive progress for German interests and while the Reichskommissar has never been the strongest leader, choosing to serve more as a figurehead than an actual leader and leaving actual running of the colony to his underlings, this has brought about much economic and social movement that most of the Reichskommissars of the Reich could never truly boast.\n\nHis loose manner of rule had already allowed for schisms to form in the colony, with the main power struggle being between the fanatical militarists under Otto-Heinrich Drechsler and the pragmatic conservatives under Franz Walter Stahlecker.\n\nHowever, in recent years the Reichskommissar has quietly faded from public life. This has meant that his capacity as figurehead for the colony's government has also begun to fade, the office of Reichskommissar seemingly having taken its toll on Hinrich, and the matter of who will succeed him as Reichskommissar is still undecided.\n\nThe key to the end of this struggle thus does not lie in the favor of the Reichskommissar, but in the collaboration governments of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus. But with these governments constantly competing for funding from the central government in Riga it remains to be seen if it's possible to unite them all under one singular person."
OSTL.2.a:0 "A storm is brewing."

OSTL.3.t:0 "Litzmann's Flight"
OSTL.3.desc:0 "At the behest of the government of the German Reich, Karl-Siegmund Litzmann has left Reichskommissariat Ostland for the grandiosity of Germania. Litzmann has served the Reich dutifully as the General Commissioner for Estonia, and his summoning has been interpreted by some in the Ostland administration as a potential promotion.\n\nBorn into the shadow of his father, the Lion of Brzeziny - a respected general known for his valiant efforts commanding infantry during the First World War - Litzmann was determined to make his mark on history. His tenacity and dedication led him to rise through the ranks of the SA until his eventual appointment as Estonia's General Commissioner.\n\nLitzmann's departure may signal some disruption in the Ostland administration. A figure of unity and competence, he has long been considered the inevitable successor of the ailing Hinrich Lohse. His age, however, has called into question the viability of such an appointment - Litzmann is, after all, two years older than Lohse.\n\nHis trip to Germania may be nothing out of the ordinary. It may also, however, herald a change in direction for the future of Ostland. If Litzmann is no longer in the running for Reichskommissar, Lohse's eventual successor will become a mere matter of speculation."
OSTL.3.a:0 "We wish Herr Litzmann a safe flight."

OSTL.4.t:0 "The Reichskommissar is Dead!"
OSTL.4.desc:0 "Tragedy has struck the Reich. Hinrich Lohse, the Reichskommissar of Ostland, peacefully passed away in his bed in the early hours of the morning.\n\nHaving proudly served as the Gauleiter of Schleswig-Holstein, Lohse was appointed to administrate the newly established Reichskommissariat during the Second World War. Under his stable leadership and administrative prowess, Ostland became a model colony for Germanization, securing Lohse a place in history as one of the Party's most diligent comrades.\n\nUnfortunately, the ailing Reichskommissar had suffered from illnesses relating to the heart since the 1950s, which most doctors have attributed to stress and fatigue. Only in the last few months, however, did Lohse's health begin to rapidly deteriorate. Despite the weakness of his body, Lohse's mind remained sharp as ever; in his final bedridden days, he set about the task of appointing a successor and ensuring a smooth transition in leadership.\n\nTo no one's surprise, Karl-Siegmund Litzmann, the General Commissioner for Estonia, was selected to be the new Reichskommissar. Litzmann's business in Germania is to be swiftly concluded, and he is to be immediately flown to Riga. With the passing of such a prestigious torch, Ostland will no doubt continue on its path to greatness and ascend into a new golden age."
OSTL.4.a:0 "Good luck, Herr Litzmann."

OSTL.5.t:0 "The Destruction of HFB 320-6"
OSTL.5.desc:0 "The entirety of Ostland was shaken to its core as the news broke that morning. While soon to be Reichskommissar Litzmann had left from Germania the day before, he would never land in Riga.\n\nWhile footage of the event was strictly censored and kept from public eye, it still seemed to leak to the masses not long after the event. Pictures of the scorched remains of the flight strewn across northern Ostland, of rescue workers desperately picking through the remains of both flight and crew. Of Ostland's last hope being extinguished as soon as it had appeared.\n\nBlame for the leaks has fallen on Meyer-Landrut, anonymous tips having placed them on an agent tertiarily linked to his group of youth militias, though the whistleblower killed himself before capture. This has been lost in the flurry of other accusations however, as the blame for the event has solely fallen on Stahlecker's lap.\n\nReports have already filtered in that the plane was shot down by an anti-air rocket launched from an emplacement in a military camp loyal to Stahlecker, the plane having apparently been mistaken for a Swedish bomber flying too close to German airspace despite repeated warnings. It is not entirely sure how, exactly, this was possible, but all investigation into the matter has been lost to the politics.\n\nWith the death of Litzmann, any hope for a united Ostland has been extinguished. While the Reichstag has received a flurry of requests outright begging for a new replacement soon, it is doubtful the politicians will grace us with another pick."

OSTL.6.t:0 "The Crisis of Succession"
OSTL.6.S.desc:0 "The humidity of the room hit Stahlecker like a hot wave. He wrenched off his foggy glasses with a soft curse and slumped down into his chair. Recent events had torn the rug from under his monotonous life and sent him sprawling into the unknown. Despite the blame of Litzmann's crash being assigned to everyone, from student militias to partisan terrorists, it had been left to Stahlecker to clean up its political aftermath. As if this hadn't complicated matters enough, the government of Ostland had decided to appoint him as the new Reichskommissar. Stahlecker was no fool; he knew that, unlike Litzmann, his succession had not been universally accepted.\n\nThe door burst open. Theodore Fründt stormed into the room with a pale face, followed by Generaloberst Franz Bäke. "Reichskommissar Stahlecker!"\n\n"Have you come to fix the air conditioning?" Stahlecker muttered, loosening his tie.\n\n"Drechsler has declared martial law around Latvia," Bäke said stiffly, his bulging eyes betraying his otherwise stern expression.\n\n"What?" Despite the heat, Stahlecker's blood ran cold.\n\n"He's disputed your appointment," Fründt replied hastily. "That madman is starting a fucking civil war. Our army is already mobilising."\n\n"Shit." Stahlecker wiped the sweat from his forehead and leant back in his chair, his mind racing frantically.\n\n"There's more..." Fründt continued. "The Reich is refusing to send aid. I fear something drastic is about to happen over there. We've been abandoned.""
OSTL.6.D.desc:0 "Otto-Heinrich Drechsler had always liked Litzmann. Of course, the Commissioner had retained a dullness inherent in all German bureaucrats, but he was a man willing to listen to everyone's perspective. As the son of a general Litzmann had always harbored an immense respect for the military, unlike those smug fools like Stahlecker who derided and rejected Drechsler at every opportunity. Drechsler could have easily climbed through the higher ranks of power in a Litzmann government. He was almost certain of it.\n\nBut Drechsler was not destined to be a follower. Litzmann's death, as tragic as it was, now served a greater purpose. The Ostland government had finally come to their senses and declared Drechsler to be the new Reichskommissar. As he stared out the window at the morning sun, a large mug of steaming coffee in one hand, a sense of gleeful anticipation filled him. There was much work to be done.\n\nThe door behind him slammed open. Drechsler flinched. He turned around to deliver a furious rant until his eyes settled upon the solemn faces of Günther Pröhl and Generaloberst Freidrich-Wilhelm Müller.\n\n"What is it?" Drechsler asked nervously. His heart began to pound faster.\n\n"That worm Stahlecker!" Müller spat. "He's rallied his forces in Estonia. He's preparing an attack against us!"\n\n"He's disputed your appointment," Pröhl said bitterly. "That little weasel is about to trigger a fucking civil war. We've already mobilised the army."\n\nDrechsler's mug slipped from his grasp, shattering on the floor in an explosion of ceramic and scorching black liquid. "Fuck!" Drechsler cried, his voice breaking. He cleared his throat. "Have we alerted the Reich of this treason?"\n\n"They're refusing to send aid," Müller replied. "Something monumental is about to happen over there. We've been abandoned.""

With our brave men resisting these brutes, Drecshler has now initiated a full-scale assault of the city.\n\nCivil war has come to Ostland.\n\nThe fighting's longevity has been matched only by its intensity. Gunshots and explosions can be heard throughout Riga as soldiers pour into the streets, grenades fly through the air, artillery fire pounds into buildings and tanks roll down the roads. Innocent Civilians and soldiers alike have been brutalized by Drechsler's men, whose desperation to serve the forces of radicalism have led them to fight for the cowardly militarist.\n\nWith our barrages and explosive traps, they will not stand a chance. Drechsler and his sabre-rattlers will be hanged on the spot, and soon Franz Walter Stahlecker will secure his rightful place as ruler of Ostland."

OSTL.8.t:0 "Wilna Revolt"
OSTL.8.desc:0 "As the situation in Ostland continued to degrade, and the last grips of the Reich became ever looser, those who would before be afraid to speak their displeasures grew bolder. Where before one would scarcely dare to criticize Germania or the Reichskommissariat leadership for fear of seeing the inside of a prison cell, or perhaps worse, those quelled voices were finally raised.\n\nAs order degenerated, dissidents brought chaos. The voices of reformists bolstered by the liberal students grew ever louder. Within days, the streets of Wilna, always a hotbed of liberalism and a thorn of the side of Ostland, were packed with reformists and students. The protests had no specific list of demands. No manifesto. The only common platform that those packing into the streets of Ostland shared was an end to the corruption and oppression of Nazism.\n\nProtests soon turned to riots, as the overstretched Wilna police forces, stranded without support, were forced to concede block after block to the protests and riots. As dissidents roamed unimpeded throughout the city and surrounding dependencies, one could scarcely claim that the region was a possession of the Reich. Despite all appearances however, this was no riff raff of anarchists, looters, and never-do-wells. They were not without a benefactor.\n\nThe movement which had spiraled into riots and rebellion had been bankrolled and supported by one Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a business mogul known for his grand commercial and industrial successes throughout Ostland. Following the collapse of Reich control in Wilna, he wasted no time in affixing himself as the figurehead of this ragtag movement. With the support so "generously" provided by Meyer-Landrut, and with a lack of a greater goal in the movement, most were largely accepting of this new demagogue.\n\nMeyer-Landrut has since declared the formation of the Vereinigte Ostlandliga, rallying reformists and liberals under his banner with the hopes of taking Ostland by force of arms."

Andreas Meyer-Landrut, businessman and outspoken liberal, has gathered support in Wilna and declared his conviction to depose the so-called "legitimate Reichskommissar". Decrying the brutality with which Wehrmacht and SS troops have treated the former lands of Belarus and the Baltic, he insists on equality before the law for both German settlers, Slavs and Balts.\n\nVereinigte Ostlandiga, as he styles the new state, will stand against the oppressive German imperial regime. The revolters in Wilna have pledged their own allegiance to his banner. While they may not have the support of the Wehrmacht or the SS, landrut's money and revolutionary fervor may give them the strength to take on any comers."

Amidst the militarised egos of Stahlecker, Dreschler and Jeckeln, a new tragedy emerges in Lettland.\n\nJakobstadt, old Jēkabpils to the natives, has been one of the most shining beacons of German blood. A successful demonstration of what Lebensraum means, the city is now home to thousands of good citizens of the Reich, working and thriving in the true spirit of what many hope might become Eastern Germania. This jewel of Lettgallen, it seems, was too shiny a trophy in the chaos of our present situation, and the vengeant Jew himself, Abba Kovner with his 'United Partisan Organisation', has seized control of the defenceless city. Reports are coming in from across the region that Germanised settlements are being ransacked and burned to the ground by these rogue militants.\n\nThe horror does not stop there. Lettgallen's capital, it seems, was only the beginning of the UPO's efforts. It is quickly becoming apparent that it is an infantile centre for what Kovner sees as a wider campaign.

All ears in attendance were fixated upon the upcoming announcement that Vituksa was soon to make. It had been weeks since the people of Ostland had received proper information from their government, which was rather jarring to minds that were so used to the frequent spoon-fed information given to them by the Reich. Vituksa might not be the Führer or the Reichskommissar, but as far as the people were concerned, this was the next best thing.\n\nVituksa stepped in front of a microphone, wired into several radio stations across Ostland, ready to broadcast across the crumbling Reichskommissariat.\n\nHis voice boomed, amplified across the plaza in which the people gathered, as his voice took to the radio waves. He immediately declared the Rigan administration to be detrimental to Ostland, speaking of the horrors that the people were forced to endure due to widespread political infighting. Throughout his words, however, he was notably cautious to navigate around direct criticism of the institutions of the Reich.\n\nRegardless of all his caution, what Vituksa proposed remained still nothing short of treason. He announced with great enthusiasm the establishment of a Central European Council. A governing body under which the native Belorussians would lead and the German settlers would cooperate and be voiced as equals.\n\nDespite all his cautious wording and deliberately conservative speech, the crowd erupted into a joyous frenzy. Cheers and chants echoed across the plaza for hours. Could this be true? Would the Belorussian people finally be free?"

After much inaction, he has finally broken his self-imposed vow of silence and declared war against the both sides of the civil war.\n\nIn a grand speech to his many SS followers, Jeckeln declared both Stahlecker and Drechsler to be traitors to the National Socialist cause, human scum who deserve to be hanged high for their treason alongside their friends and families. After praising Heinrich Himmler and the insane system imposed onto Burgundy, Jeckeln stated his desire for complete control of Ostland, no matter the cost.\n\nThe Schutzstaffel's fiefdom in the south has finally broken away, and the future of this civil war is set to look bloodier than ever."

Whilst such autonomy, if granted, might hurt the public image of Riga, as well as degrade our control over the White Rus, it would nevertheless make the council quite content, and stave off most risk of non compliance.\n\nThe question remains, who do we send forth to negotiate with Vituksa? To ensure their contentment, only a prominent member of our administration will do. With such, Drechsler and Stahlecker would be the most suitable candidates.\n\nWithout a doubt, Drechsler is hot headed, and will surely turn the conversation around upon the council rather than offering concessions with open arms. Yet, perhaps this is what we need to secure a tough and favorable arrangement with the Belorussian council?\n\nOn the other hand, we can send Stahlecker. We can trust that, should we send him forth, he will do as told by Riga to the detail, and little else. The Belorussians would certainly be pleased by this. Too pleased, perhaps, as they may take our open offerings as a sign that we are willing to concede more."

Confidence was indeed high. That was, of course, until the headlines reached Riga.\n\n"Siemens Reveals German Manufacturing Expansion Plan" read headlines, accompanied by pictures of the CEO, Ernst von Siemens, delivering the announcement. Several Gauleiters back in Germany were surely overjoyed by such tidings, but Lohse was not. He, as well as many others who drafted investment plans, had genuine hopes for a successful bid. Such hopes were now gone quicker than dust in a steady wind.\n\nThe investment plans for Estonia are now little more than a fruitless diversion. It would be folly to carry them out now, as surely the capital required to conduct the investments would now be better suited elsewhere."

This is a mistake, but only indicative of one of our battalions, and a trial that should have been easily overcome. Were it so easy...\n\nAmongst the discord, a Wehrmacht Officer decided to pay the little gathering a surprise visit, checking up on Ostland's efforts. What he saw, perhaps rightfully, shocked him, and we can expect the news to be returning to Germania sometime within the next week.

But today, the news that Vituška has met with Heinrich Lohse destroyed all their hopes.\n\nThe details of their meeting haven't been revealed, and all others know is, this is a secret meeting between those two and Lohse didn't tell any of his advisors before. But no matter what they talked about, they have, according to the public announcement, made great progress and agreement on many "important issues about the future of Ostland", which is the last thing Drechsler and Stahlecker wish to see.\n\nFor now, it's clear that Vituška and his Belorussian government won't choose a side in the political struggle of the colony, making the future of Ostland even more unpredictable.

Besides him stand Heinrich Lohse, Otto-Heinrich Drechsler and other important figures of the Reichskommissariat Ostland.\n\nNo matter what the German official media says, Hitler's declining health is not a secret for almost everyone in this world. Many have noticed his slightly quivering hands and glassy eyes. However, seeing the soldiers pass by and salute in unison, the Führer's eyes shines slightly again for a while. Perhaps it reminded him of old times, when he led a bitter Germany out of the dark age to become masters of this world. Oh, how excited he and his followers were at that time! How great would it be if time could just stop at those days!\n\nAs the Führer reminisced of his memory of the old days, the roar of tanks and airplane snapped him back to reality. Yes, the army of Germany, at least of Ostland, is still as strong as they were decades ago. "Impressive," he whispers to Lohse and Drechsler in a low but appreciating voice, "Much... impressive." A strange thought appeared in his mind, a sudden urge to draw this spectacular scene. Perhaps subconsciously, he reached out to the air and waved his hands, as if he was drawing on the canvas, surprising his companions.\n\nRealizing Hitler cannot stay any longer due to his ailing health, Lohse immediately asked Drechsler to give a final speech as an end of this parade today. As Hitler left the parade, many noticed what seemed to be tears in his old eyes."

Broadcasted live on television, everyone in the German Reich saw the beauty of Baltic coast, the strength of Ostland's army, the prosperity of their cities, the productivity of the factories and the spirit of their people.\n\nBefore the Führer left Ostland, he had a personal meeting with Hinrich Lohse and Franz Walter Stahlecker. Hitler praised Lohse for the achievements of Ostland, but then expressed his concern about whether the Reichskommissariat can be as stable as they are now in the future. Stahlecker seized this opportunity to persuade the Führer that, more supporters in both Germania and Ostland were needed to maintain stability here. Hitler made no promises, leaving both Lohse and Stahlecker somewhat disappointed.\n\nThe Reichskommissar gave a final speech as an official conclusion of the Führer's tour, he declared that only under the leadership of the Führer, Ostland has accomplished many great achievements, and the people of Ostland will continue to serve the Reich's cause no matter what happens in the Future. With the thunderous applause of the audience, the Führer laboriously waved his hand to the crowd and left to the airport, marking the end of his short but meaningful tour in Ostland."

Maybe it's the local officer, who thoughts he is wise enough to handle the situation on his own, but only leads to such a disaster in the end; maybe it's just one single soldier, who lost his temper when hearing the shouts from the students, shot the decisive bullet that blasted everything up; or maybe it's due to the students, who are too ignorant to ignore the weapons in the soldiers' hands.

Simultaneously the recently established council of central Europe declared its independence with the treacherous Vituska at the helm and declared a free Byelorussia.\n\nFleeing from his domestic enemies, Andreas Meyer-Landrut has assumed control over the city of Minsk and surrounding areas. Student militias are already rising up in his name, and conflict with the other rebels seems inevitable.\n\nAnd while all of this was happening, Friedrich Jeckeln and his SS made their move. SS units have seized the southern part of Belorussia, and have now declared that they will purify Ostland by any means necessary.\n\nThe remaining forces not committed to one side or the other have declared their loyalty to Franz Walter Stahlecker, who has announced that all traitors to Ostland will face the harshest possible punishments.

Hung from lamp posts and street signs, bits of them nailed to the doors of government buildings, entire barracks with nothing besides piles of butchered viscera to tell the tale of the soldiers who once lived there.\n\nThe Partisans were prepared for the revolution, and from the forests and swamps they came. In a lightning strike they overwhelmed those brave fools who tried to stop their glorious march, and began the process of torching and destroying any signs of the Germans, and hunting down and butchering those who had dared work for their slavemasters.

For each black car had the insignia of Jeckeln's SS, and no man was brave enough to stand in the way of this force.\n\nIt wasn't far from the capital that the motorcade stopped, an abandoned helipad once used by German aviators on test runs during the helicopter's first inception. It wasn't long before the reason for their stopping became clear, an SS helicopter looming ominously over the countryside like a carrion bird and settling down with the grace of one.\n\nOut of the helicopter came a man in a simple suit. An SS man, but not conforming to their typical norms. Not uniformed, not proudly saluting or marching out with the assurity that only Germany's finest and most dedicated normally did. This was a member of the Sicherheitsdienst des Burgunderführers-SS. Himmler's personal intelligence service in Burgundy, and a member of an elite and secretive organization that seemed to foretell doom more than any black cat or broken mirror.\n\nJeckeln's conversation with him was short, those of the SD-Burgund being known to use the fewest possible words to express their complex and oft mysterious desires. It ended with an envelope being passed, containing a letter signed by Herr Himmler himself. The instructions within were almost as brief as the conversation with the departing agent, but like the man's words, its meaning was clear.\n\nOstland was to be purified by force.

Assassinating key figures and leaving fraudulent evidence that incriminates one faction or the other. Turning the Council to his ends and ensuring that it established itself as a force to be reckoned with in Ostland. And of course, covering his tracks and ensuring that not a soul knew of his true intentions, or at least had no way to actually incriminate him. The tight rope of a non-German in power in a German colony is a perilous one, but it is one Vituska navigated with the grace and finesse of a circus acrobat.\n\nThe other half, however, was much more unexpected. Part of his mission involved sabotaging his own faction for his own gains. While on the outside looking in it would appear the Council is simply a tool for Vituska's own power, in reality it is one of many different personalities with many different views of what the future should look like. The removal of these figures would be key in Vituska's rise to power, and beyond that, convincing the Germans that many of their allies were in fact planning to betray them as Vituska had.\n\nWhether or not the evidence Vituska carefully planted was at all true did not matter, for the truth of things hasn't mattered for twenty years now ever since the German insanity began. What did matter was that Vituska had the soldiers, he had the will, and he had dragged the Council after him into his mad adventure. Ostland would be his. It would not be free, it would not be 'pure', it might not even be strong. But it would be Vituskas."
OST.10.a:0 "For Vituska!"

OST.11.t:0 "The War Begins"
OST.11.d:0 "While the various factions of Ostland had already centralized into various areas and small skirmishes had erupted across the colony, a state of war had not been officially declared and an uneasy calm had settled over Ostland. That calm was violently ended today as the forces of Drechsler engaged the forces of Stahlecker along their mutual border in what began as a small skirmish near a sleep German farming community but rapidly expanded until hundreds of men were spilling blood over what had rapidly become a blasted, barren battleground. This battle has triggered the other factions to make their own moves, and already reports are coming from across Ostland of mass violence and warfare as conflict truly descends. The Ostland Civil War has begun."
OST.11.a:0 "We will be victorious!"

OST.12.t:0 "The Riga Uprising"
OST.12.d:0 "It seems that our preparations for the uprising have paid off. In the city of Riga, our forces have managed to overwhelm the local garrison and secure the city for us. While they might not last long, if we are able to relieve them it would strengthen our position in the war greatly."

OST.17.t:0 "Leftist Militias Organise!"
OST.17.d:0 "After taking a few days to organize themselves, several leftist militias have reported for duty across our territory. Had we not united the left it seems that they would not have pledged their allegiance to us, but with Meyer-Landrut's charisma and the shred use of his various connections, this force has decided to throw in their lot with us."
OST.17.a:0 "We will put them to good use!"

OST.18.t:0 "SS Divisions Report In!"
OST.18.d:0 "Several SS divisions arrived at our territory today, after confirming that they were loyal to Jeckeln, they asked to be sent to the front. It seems that it pays to have friends in high places."

OST.21.t:0 "Jeckeln Proposes a Ceasefire"
OST.21.d:0 "The last thing that an officer in a military headquarter, even that of Meyer-Landrut, was to show was confusion. Pride, sadness, even fear were acceptable, for these were natural things for a military officer to feel and these emotions showed that whether a battle was being won or lost, it was being fought and fought to the full ability of the German Officer. Confusion, however, was a sign of failure. A sign of the chain breaking down. A sign that someone somewhere had failed to make proper sense or that the enemy had truly outwitted us.\n\nHowever, confusion was the only thing that could be placed on the face of the junior officer who received the radio message, and confusion soon spread to his commander and those in distance to hear his report.\n\nA message had been received from Jeckeln. Ceasefire. Alliance. Jeckeln was the ultimate evil to be fought and destroyed, a representation of all the evils that Meyer-Landrut has so dedicated himself to destroying. However, the offer is not an unwise one to make or to accept. Both Jeckeln's SS and our own militias form the smallest faction in Ostland, and even if this ceasefire is no doubt temporary, it could give us the chance we need to secure our power before finishing this once and for all."
OST.21.a:0 "We will agree, for now."
OST.21.b:0 "We do not negotiate with monsters."

OST.22.t:0 "The Ceasefire Breaks"
OST.22.d:0 "The inevitable has come. With the other contenders dead and gone, from the partisans to the garrison, only Meyer-Landrut and Jeckeln stand undefeated. The attack was not announced and the ceasefire ended with no ceremony besides the charge of SS tanks into our territory, but we were ready for the treachery. Units who had been staged to do the very same to the SS soon met Jeckeln's advance and matched it, and now all across the lines the battle has begun anew.\n\nIt is time for the strongest to rise to the top."
OST.22.a:0 "We end this. Now."

OST.23.t:0 "Renewed Partisan Activity in Ostland"
OST.23.d:0 "The death of the Reichskommissar seems to have been a catalyst for the various partisan groups that have been dormant in Ostland. All across Ostland reports are coming in of power lines cut, patrols disappearing and even open attacks on our garrisons. It seems that the idea that partisan activity in Ostland was over was overly optimistic at best and any hope for ceasefire utterly destroyed. How to solve the problem of these attacks is now a problem that the new government must deal with."
OST.23.a:0 "Damm them!"

OST.24.t:0 "Partisan Attacks in Ostland"
OST.24.d:0 "Several reports of attacks against our arms factories were reported today, the group of partisans claiming responsibility are the Free Sons of Estonia, and they have announced that they will not cease their attacks until Estonia is once again restored to independence and the foul invaders are driven off.

OST.27.d:0 "Our agents inside the various partisan groups in Ostland have reported that after several covert meetings, the various partisan groups in Ostland have decided to unite under a single banner, the United Partisan Organisation. While such news would already be cause for concern, the supposed leader of this organization is Abba Kovner. Kovner was a communist partisan who was apparently killed 23 years ago when the great war against the Soviets was conducted. He has reportedly been planning this move for 20 years, and we have no clue about what his greater intentions are."
OST.27.a:0 "Damm them!"

OST.28.t:0 "Stahlecker Campaigns for Unity in Ostland"
OST.28.d:0 "Franz Walter Stahlecker, an influential and close friend of the Reichskommissar has recently announced a new initiative designed to promote unity and stability within Ostland. While many may question the purpose of such an act, especially with the current situation in Ostland, Stahlecker has declared that all citizens of Ostland must act as one if they are to prosper in the coming years. Stahlecker has enjoyed a large support base within the government, and this recent campaign has only increased his popularity."
OST.28.a:0 "We wish him luck."

OST.29.t:0 "Stahlecker Meets With Vituska"
OST.29.d:0 "Michal Vituska, who served as the leader of the Black cats, a local collaborator unit working with the SS in Belorussia, has recently met with Franz Walter Stahlecker. Vituska holds a great amount of influence within the region of Belorussia and has been the face of native collaboration with the Germans for many years. Stahlecker has announced that he hopes the meeting would help the native Belorussians accept their new situation."
OST.29.a:0 "Hopefully he is successful."

OST.30.t:0 "Stahlecker Meets With Garrison Leaders"
OST.30.d:0 "Franz Walter Stahlecker has concluded a series of meetings with the local and regional commanders of the German garrison. While Stahlecker has enjoyed strong support from the government, the same can not be said of the military. While he is not disliked, many in the garrison prefer Drechsler to Stahlecker, and these meetings are seen as attempts by him to increase his support among the military."
OST.30.a:0 "We wish him luck."

OST.31.t:0 "Stahlecker Meets With Hinrich Lohse"
OST.31.d:0 "In the latest of a series of meetings, Franz Walter Stahlecker has met with the Reichskommissar himself, Hinrich Lohse. While Stahlecker has enjoyed a private friendship with the Reichskommissar for a long time, this official meeting is seen as a tacit blessing of Stahlecker's policies from the aged Reichskommissar. This has only served to increase his popularity across Ostland."
OST.31.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

OST.32.t:0 "Drechsler's New Military Aims"
OST.32.d:0 "Otto-Heinrich Drechsler, the general commissioner for Latvia, has recently announced that he intends to petition the government for the expansion of the military forces of Ostland. While Ostland has maintained a German garrison since its inception, a large military has never seemed necessary for the Reichskommissariat. Drechsler has even gone so far as to advocate for conscription in Ostland, an unpopular prospect in the colony. While Drechsler's petition has remained unanswered, we cannot continue doing so and must make a decision now."
OST.32.a:0 "Alright. Fine."
OST.32.b:0 "No, we do not need it."

OST.33.t:0 "The Army Conducts Military Exercises"
OST.33.d:0 "The army has recently started its yearly military exercises in Ostland, which are a series of maneuvers across the entire colony. While some have decried the exercises as a decadent waste of resources, Otto-Heinrich Drechsler has expressed pride in Ostland's armed forces."
OST.33.a:0 "An important endeavor."

OST.34.t:0 "Drechsler's Focus On Army Development"
OST.34.d:0 "Otto-Heinrich Drechsler has proposed to adjust the next five-year budget for Ostland to increase military spending. Drechsler has advocated for the expansion of the military for a long time and has demanded that the budget is adjusted so that expanding the army, navy, and air force is feasible. While Drechsler's proposal has met with little enthusiasm from the government, he has received widespread support from the garrison. With neither side willing to compromise, Lohse must intervene and settle the matter once and for all."
OST.34.a:0 "We'll adjust the budget."
OST.34.b:0 "We cannot make adjustments."

OST.35.t:0 "Demand For Increased Arms Production"
OST.35.d:0 "In what has become a typical demand, Otto-Heinrich Drechsler has demanded that several industrial projects within Ostland be put on hold in order to convert the factories working on them to produce arms for the military. This time his proposals have been refused outright, and Drechsler has announced his public dissatisfaction with the government."
OST.35.a:0 "We'll convert the factories."
OST.35.b:0 "We cannot afford to do this."

OST.36.t:0 "Stahlecker and Drechsler Clash!"
OST.36.d:0 "The differences between Stahlecker and Drechsler came to a head today after Stahlecker publicly decried several of Drechsler's military proposals. While the relationship between the two men could not be described as cordial before this, this event marks a new low in relations between them. Already their respective supporters have started to organize into groups, and many feel that conflict between the two sides might be inevitable."
OST.36.a:0 "Hopefully this stays under control."

OST.37.t:0 "Jeckeln Returns From Visit to Burgundy"
OST.37.d:0 "Friedrich Jeckeln, commander of the SS-Oberabschnitt Ostland, has recently returned from his official visit to Burgundy. Jeckeln served with distinction at the SS during the great war against the Soviet menace, and also serves as SS and police leader of Ostland. While Jeckeln is a controversial figure within the government of Ostland, with many viewing his connections to Burgundy with suspicion, the power he wields with his office is immense and discourages most open criticism.\n\nJeckeln was officially invited to Burgundy by Himmler himself several months ago and met with many of the high ranking members of the Burgundian SS. Jeckeln himself stated that the visit "Inspired him to continue to pursue the Germanization of Ostland.""
OST.37.a:0 "We will be watching."

OST.38.t:0 "Jeckeln Advocates for Increased Germanization"
OST.38.d:0 "Friedrich Jeckeln has renewed his campaign for the increased Germanisation of Ostland. Although Ostland is already one of the most Germanized Reichskommissariats, Jeckeln has stated that he would not stop his campaign until Ostland was fully German in all aspects. Jeckeln has petitioned the government of Ostland to accelerate its Germanization schemes by requesting even more settlers of "Pure" ancestry from Germany."
OST.38.a:0 "Interesting."

OST.39.t:0 "Jeckeln Announces New Purity Initiative"
OST.39.d:0 "Friedrich Jeckeln has recently announced his new purity initiatives within the garrison of Ostland. Using his power as the SS and police leader of Ostland, Jeckeln has started a thorough investigation into the ancestries each member of the high and mid-level officers of the Garrison. Anyone found to not be sufficiently "Pure" will be removed from command. The initiative has proven unpopular with the military, especially Otto-Heinrich Drechsler, who has publicly voiced his dissatisfaction."
OST.39.a:0 "Interesting."

OST.40.t:0 "SS Conducts Unauthorized Maneuvers"
OST.40.d:0 "As tensions grow in Germany and Ostland, the SS has been discovered to be conducting several unauthorized maneuvers in the southern regions of Ostland. SS leader Friedrich Jeckeln has said that the maneuvers were merely "remedial training" and "nothing to concern oneself about." Many in Ostland remember the attempted coup by Himmler and the SS in Germany many years ago, and the SS is being viewed with a new air of suspicion."
OST.40.a:0 "Hopefully this stays under control."

OST.41.t:0 "Meyer-Landrut Meets With Speer"
OST.41.d:0 "Andreas Meyer-Landrut has concluded his official meeting with Speer today. Andreas has served as a diplomat for Ostland for many years and holds considerable influence within the administration of Ostland. Ever since his entry into office Andreas has sought to moderate the policies within Ostland, and he has recently received the blessing of Albert Speer, who has encouraged him to continue his efforts in Ostland."
OST.41.a:0 "Interesting."

OST.42.t:0 "Subversive Literature Discovered in Schools"
OST.42.d:0 "Recent raids by the Orpo have discovered that subversive literature is present in a number of schools. The books, many of which spout communist propaganda, have mostly been found hidden away under floorboards or in secret compartments. While many have demanded the harshest punishments for the teachers and students involved, Andreas Meyer-Landrut has advocated for lenient sentences, while the verdict is still undecided, the government has proven to be reluctant to punish the "Aryan" students involved."
OST.42.a:0 "They will learn to obey."

OST.43.t:0 "Meyer-Landrut Lays Out Reform Plan"
OST.43.d:0 "During a press conference today, Andreas Meyer-Landrut has revealed his new proposal for reform inside Ostland. Included in the reforms is the lessening of the Germanization efforts, protection of native culture, and increased freedom of expression within Ostland. The proposal has been met with widespread disapproval from the majority of those in the government, but Meyer-Landrut's popularity with the students and reformists in Ostland sharply rose after the conference."
OST.43.a:0 "Preposterous!"

OST.44.t:0 "Student Protests Start!"
OST.44.d:0 "As storm clouds gather over Germany it seems that the unrest that so plagues the youth of the Fatherland has spread to our lands. Already several student groups have started protests across Ostland, most of them unifying behind the reform plan recently proposed by Andreas Meyer-Landrut."
OST.44.a:0 "Damm them!"

OST.45.t:0 "Students Clash With Orpo!"
OST.45.d:0 "The student protests across Ostland have recently erupted into riots as Orpo units attempt to quash the protestors. The protests have only increased in intensity after the attempts by the Orpo to silence them, and there seems to be no end in sight to the protests."
OST.45.a:0 "Hopefully this stays under control."

OST.48.t:0 "Victory in Ostland!"
OST.48.d:0 "The final remaining pockets of resistance from the vile German invaders were at last snuffed out today, as of now we have total control over Ostland. Our forces are now occupying the most heavily Germanized areas of the country, and any shred of resistance from the few remaining Germans in Ostland will be met with the harshest punishment available, we have suffered under their yoke for 20 long years, turnabout is only fair, the plans of Kovner can finally progress to their next stage after all these years."

OST.49.a:0 "Victory at last!"

OST.50.t:0 "Vituška Assumes Control of the Central Rada"
OST.50.d:0 "After the removal of the old administration in the Belorussian Central Rada, Michał Vituška has come to prominence in the Belorussian Central Rada. Michał Vituška is seemingly loyal to the government in Ostland and has worked as a loyal agent for the Reich all the way back in the Second World War, but being a native Belorussian Vituška may have subversive intentions. All that's for sure is that while Vituška may not work directly against us, he will most likely not be working in our favor, but cooperation may yield certain benefits."
OST.50.a:0 "Worrying."

OST.51.t:0 "Increased Funding for the Byelorussian Home Guard"
OST.51.d:0 "Vituška has come forward to the government with a petition to increase funding for the Byelorussian Home Guard. With the signatures of many Byelorussian Officials as well as military personnel, he cites the lack of equipment as well as funds for the 'burgeoning' amount of volunteers. Although he could have easily forged the evidence shown to suggest a need for an increase in budget, maybe expanding the Guard could decrease the number of battalions currently tied up in garrison, relieving our armed forces, especially considering the recent unrest in Germany."
OST.51.a:0 "Of course!"
OST.51.b:0 "It is against our interests."

OST.52.t:0 "Belorussian Auxillary Police increase their influence"
OST.52.d:0 "The local Auxillary Police in Belarus have recently expanded their executive powers in the region. The act seems more and more to be an underhanded move by Belorussian Officials to increase their local control. After Vituška's attempts at expanding the Home Guard, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Belorussians want to increase their influence and autonomy within Ostland."
OST.52.a:0 "Another attempt for autonomy."

OST.53.t:0 "Vituška requests increased Autonomy"
OST.53.d:0 "Michał Vituška, with little surprise, has directly asked the central government for increased autonomy for Belarus. All the moves leading up to the proposal made by Vituška have been to centralize Belorussian power to an alarming level, so the clear answer is to simply decline his proposal. On the other hand, while no elaborate explanations by Vituška could convince the central government that the benefit would be mutual, maybe giving a little autonomy away could lessen bureaucratic stress on the central government, while also appeasing Vituška for the time being."
OST.53.a:0 "Only for the time being."
OST.53.b:0 "We cannot concede any more."

OST.55.t:0 "The unexpected ceasefire"
OST.55.d:0 "Preposterous news reached us today, another rumor no doubt started by some bored soldier and spread through the loose lips and tongues of his comrades until it inevitably made its way to our leader himself. This rumor was to be discarded like the thousand others that filtered from the rank and file upwards, but to our infinite surprise it was soon confirmed by a radio message from the front.\n\nJeckeln and Meyer-Landrut, ideological enemies and polar opposites, had signed ceasefire and now fought back to back against the various other contenders. A move of desperation, no doubt, as the two smallest forces in Ostland unite in some form to defeat their enemies. The alliance is no doubt not one to last, but to say it has brought surprise to all of Ostland would be to understate it."

OST.56.t:0 "The Reichskommissar is Chosen"
OST.56.d:0 "In a shocking series of events, it appears the Fatherland has finally heard our calls. While the decision has been put off for months now, a message was received from the Reichstag itself proclaiming Karl-Siegmund Litzmann, former Generalkommissar of Estona, as the successor to Hinrich Lohse. This message has been received well by multiple factions, namely those of Drechsler and Stahlecker, both having expressed approval over the choice. Jeckeln's sabre rattling has also gone silent, and the various SS units across the nation have ceased arming themselves and appear to be waiting to see what will happen next, most likely awaiting for Litzmann's arrival to disarm fully.\n\nEven Meyer-Landrut seems to have ceased rallying the militias, the industrialist seemingly worried he may have overplayed his hand. Otherwise, the only contenders that seem unphased by this is Vituska and the Jewish partisans. Vituska has sent nothing to Riga and has not been asked for his opinion, as always, the toady merely sidestepping any possible accusation of treason as always. In the forests, the partisans have also continued their attacks, far too late to pull back and return to the cease-fire."

OST.58.t:0 "Determining the Security Minister"
OST.58.d:0 "In recent years, the position of minister of the security of Ostland has been left unoccupied. However, with the tensions increasing across the Reich, many would consider it prudent to formalize the head of the armed forces of Ostland. Two candidates have put themselves forward.\n\nThe first candidate is Otto-Heinrich Drechsler, who enjoys the wide support of the Garrison. He proposes to increase conscription in order to get our garrison back to a respectable size, however, another candidate has presented himself.\n\nFriedrich Jeckeln has deep ties to both the Burgundian and German SS and has proposed to focus on quality over quantity. Although he is not as popular as Drechsler, the Garrison would still be satisfied by his appointment.\n\nOf course, we do not need to appoint anyone to the position. Perhaps the power that comes with the position would be best kept out of the hands of these men."
OST.58.a:0 "Drechsler will serve us well."

 OST.204.t:0 "Jeckeln's Escape"
 OST.204.desc:0 "The car bumped down the dirt road, sliding on the loose gravel and muck. Jeckeln held on tightly to his seat as his chauffeur-turned-getaway driver did his best to drive the Mercedes as hard as he could. They couldn't be far from the border now. Around him, two of his personal guards- not Burgundians, he had seen to that- watched the forest nervously, their hands firmly gripping their rifles. They both knew that any threat to Jeckeln's life was a threat to theirs as well. In front of him, the bound native sat silently, terrified. Jeckeln would pity him if he wasn't just another Slav.\n\nBy some miracle, the car slid to a halt on the border unopposed. The next Mercedes sat untouched, ready to go- the only difference being that it was on the other side of the Ukrainian border. This particular smuggling route had, luckily, been left unguarded. As Jeckeln and his entourage exited the first car, they could easily hear the sounds of battle not far behind, as the remnants of the Ostland-SS made their last stand. Jeckeln sighed at the sound of his failure before turning around, blowing the captive man's brains all over the car's interior.\n\nJeckeln thought about what he had been supposed to do in the event of his failure-Report to a nearby helipad, enter a helicopter, fly to Burgundy to await his punishment. He wasn't dumb enough to fall for that. Instead, he'd taken two guards he knew weren't Burgundian, hopped in his car, and beelined to his secondary escape route. As he watched, his chauffeur dropped a brick on the gas pedal of the old car, firmly slamming it into a tree. Next, his guards dumped their magazines into the car's side, filling it with bullet holes. Finally, the chauffeur dumped gasoline all over the car, lighting it all ablaze with a single match. Jeckeln smiled as he stepped into his second car- his escape plan was complete."
 OST.204.a:0 "The madman escapes his dues."
 OST.205.t:0 "Jeckeln's End"
 OST.205.desc:0 "They couldn't be far now. Jeckeln gripped tightly to his seat as his Mercedes ripped down the road towards his escape. How did it all go so wrong? One moment, he'd been on top of Ostland, the main SS man in the entire Reichskommissariat. Now, here he was, fleeing his failure like an amateur robber. It almost made him sick, how badly he had failed- it was truly, truly embarrassing. Even Heydrich did a better job.\n\nThe car skidded to a halt at the foot of the helipad, and Jeckeln nearly leaped out. On the pad, a helicopter outfitted with the Burgundian swastika readied itself for take off, the pilot gesturing for Jeckeln and his entourage to enter. Jeckeln held onto his shades as he walked across the pad- the wind was nearly blowing them off. Of course, this was less an escape and more of a delay- Jeckeln doubted Himmler would be too pleased with his failure. In any case, thought Jeckeln as he stopped to adjust his shades, perhaps he could barter another chance out of the man.\n\nHe looked back up to see a rifle pointed at him.\n\nBefore he could run, bullets tore through his body, along with his guards and chauffeur. Jeckeln collapsed, his blood soaking the pad, mixing with the others as the helicopter lifted off and away from Ostland."

 OST.206.t:0 "Landrut's Escape"
 OST.206.desc:0 "Where had it all gone so wrong?\n\nThe thought pervaded Landrut's head as he walked, head down, to the makeshift runway. Perhaps it had been when his army had broken, falling back over and over again. Students were never the best soldiers, in any case. Bad decision after bad decision, and now here he was, leaving on the same transport planes he had carried so many others out of the Reich with. Perhaps it was when he decided to take on the role of the reformer. He could have kept his head down, made endless amounts of money off slave labor and cheap goods. It would have shredded his soul, of course, but he wouldn't be fleeing Ostland like a rat.\n\nPerhaps it had been when he got into this reformist business in the first place. If he had never touched politics, would he be here today? He'd be somewhere under Stahlecker, perhaps, or maybe Dreschler. Nothing great, of course, but he wouldn't be broke, humiliated, and barely holding onto his life. He'd nearly been shot dead escaping his office- a few minutes later and he would have never made it out.\n\nBut the time for reconsidering his decisions was long past. The plane rumbled off the tarmac as he gazed out the window, watching the land he'd worked so hard for recede behind him. Perhaps, one day, his dream would be achieved."
 OST.206.a:0 "The dream redirected."
 OST.207.t:0 "Landrut's End"
 OST.207.desc:0 "The sound of a door shattering is an unmistakable one, and it was what snapped Landrut out of his daze. He rushed to the window to see armed men rushing towards his office, followed shortly by the sound of gunfire. It dawned on him- he'd left too late. He was surrounded. With a curse, he ran back to his desk.\n\nHe found what he was looking for in the third cabinet to the left, after much searching and cursing. A Luger P38, made in 1942, armed with a single magazine. An antique. He'd never used it. He cursed again as he fumbled with the magazine, listening to the gunfire grow louder and the footsteps grow closer. Finally, he clicked the magazine into place, pointing the gun at the door. He let out a silent prayer as the footsteps stopped around his door.\n\nThe door burst open, and Landrut closed his eyes as he squeezed the trigger over and over and over again. He cracked an eye open when he realized nothing had happened.\n\nSlowly, he turned the gun to the side. The safety was still on. It was the last thing Landrut would recognize before a hail of bullets cut him down, slamming him against the wall with a thud. The pistol slid from his hands as his suit, once immaculately clean, soaked red with his blood."
 OST.207.a:0 "Landrut is dead, and with him dies his dream."
 OST.208.t:0 "Vituska's Escape"
 OST.208.desc:0 "Vituska had it all planned out from the start.\n\nWith his enemies closing in, he threw his next, best, and last plan into action. One of deceit and trickery, one which the other factions would only be able to look at in awe as it fired all around them. Body doubles, fake vans, false gunfights and fake deaths. At the end of it all, Vituska could only grin as he entered his car. It was the work of a Macchivellian genius, and he was certainly taking pride in that.\n\nAs he drove through the night, towards the border, he thought of his ambitions. Yes, they had certainly taken a hit, and perhaps his chances of controlling Ostland were doomed. That was certainly a shame. But Vituska was alive, and he was certainly not doomed. Soon enough, he'd be back, and that time, he'd be better prepared. Vituska would be the man in charge eventually, one way or another, even if it took him the rest of his life to manage it."
 OST.208.a:0 "Another page of history turns."
 OST.209.t:0 "Vituska's End?"
 OST.209.desc:0 "The gunfire cracked over Hans's head and embedded itself into the wall. He ducked back around the corner, cursing his luck. These damn Belorussians didn't know when to quit, did they? His squadmate motioned him back around the corner as he went to work, firing a few short bursts at the target. When the two heard a scream, they pushed up further.\n\nThe gunfire echoed off the buildings as they marched through, looking for their target. He couldn't be too far away now. Guns at the ready, eyes open for snipers, they slowly made their way down the street, looking for one man and one man only.\n\nA door opened on their right, and a man in a suit stumbled out. He took one look at the soldiers and began rushing down the street. Hans raised his rifle and cut him down- was that him?\n\nWhen the two men reached the body, they turned it over to check the face. Hans held a picture up to the dead man's face. He looked identical to Vituska, certainly, but was it really him? Hans shrugged and put an extra bullet into the man's head. Vituska or not, someone was going to pay for dragging him into this hellhole, and it certainly wasn't going to be him."
 OST.209.a:0 "He's out of the way, in any case."
 OST.210.t:0 "Kovner's Escape"
 OST.210.desc:0 "It wasn't supposed to end this way.\n\nKovner had always assumed he would either fulfill his dream or die trying. Not this. The van idled in the driveway, the noise of a distant artillery shot or gunfire exchange occasionally raising over the sound of the engine. He took one last look at the land he had spent the better portion of his life fighting for before he got in.\n\nThe van sped down the road, and Kovner's mind raced with it. He thought back to all the sacrifices he had made, all the friends he had lost. All of it was for nothing. Ostland would be crushed under some German or, worse, some German bootlicker, and the people there would still not be free, if only for a moment. The UPO had been their best shot at freedom. Without them to fight the Germans by, who would stand up for the natives trapped in Ostland? Not the Americans, not the Russians, and certainly not the Germans.\n\nThe thoughts continued to plague Kovner's mind as the van slipped over the Ostland-Moskowien border and into the pages of history."
 OST.210.a:0 "Another refugee of war."
 OST.211.t:0 "Kovner's End"
 OST.211.desc:0 "They had found them, finally. It had taken twenty years, but Kovner had to admit- the German dogs had really gotten him this time. By slowly wearing away his forces, splitting them apart, and somehow getting intel on his position, Kovner finally had to admit that it was over. His struggle against the Germans would die here.\n\nThe machine gun rounds shot through the air and cracked off trees and branches, sending them crashing to the ground. The thud of mortar fire combined with the crackle of rifle fire to create a sound not too dissimilar to hell. Kovner loaded his rifle- the one he had carried for over a decade now, stolen from a German armory so many years ago. They would not take him alive.\n\nThe final attack was brutal, but the Germans were strong and many, and their numbers and superior weaponry would prove to make all the difference. The addition of tanks helped matters immensely. Finally, when the gunfight was reduced to nothing and the hill on which the partisans were entrenched was nothing more than a cratered moonscape, the Germans leapt the barricades to find Kovner's corpse, laid down besides his men at the front, a single round shot cleanly through his skull."

Stahlecker claims that the continued improvement of the economic and industrial sectors, as well as a focus on rebuilding the colony from the Civil War.\n\nObservers have pointed out that the policies of the last regime are the only thing that allowed such violence, and that a strict copying of what was done before will most likely be ineffectual when facing the Herculean task of mending together the colony.

In the wake of the UPO's victory, a flurry of stories have reached the perked ears of the international community; stories of mass trials for German settlers and native collaborators both held out in open air, free for the world to watch.\n\nThe organization's leader, Abba Kovner, during a broadcasted trial in-absentia for Adolf Hitler himself, demanded that the nation of Germany "know justice in the eyes of each and every life snuffed out" by the Nazi regime.

His rhetoric sounds similar to that of Speer, but many have pointed out that Speer had never been so extreme in his rhetoric. Many Speerites have even decried this, claiming that a lack of moderate reform will allow subversive elements to destroy Europe.\n\nDespite this, Meyer-Landrut seems to care little, and has already begun multiple liberalization programs in conjunction with his work towards post-war recovery."

KOV.1.t:0 "The February Incident"
KOV.1.d:0 "The unthinkable has occurred. On February 14th, an attack on our nation like nothing ever seen before occured, shocking not just Ostland, but the rest of the Reich. Numerous seemingly coordinated attacks on our arms factories took place, destroying our already struggling arms market. The strangest part is that we have no idea who committed such an attack. The only way to find out is to launch an investigation into the culprit immediately."
KOV.1.a:0 "We must find the culprit."
KOV.2.t:0 "A Difficult Choice"
KOV.2.d:0 "With the investigation getting started, our neighbors the Belorussians and the SS have both offered to help find the culprit by searching in the border regions and their own nations. However, the bitter hatred left over from the war still remains, and they refuse to work with each other. We must choose between the two."
KOV.2.a:0 "The SS will help us find the culprit." 
KOV.2.b:0 "The Belorussians might be a better choice."
KOV.3.t:0 "The SS Comes to Our Aid"
KOV.3.d:0 "With the SS helping, we now have the full help of Himmler in tracking down the criminal who conducted the July incident. Their work during the war in imprisoning enemies of the state, and those not of the master race will be invaluable in a time like this. Surely, in no time, we will find him."
KOV.3.a:0 "We will get to the bottom of this!"
KOV.4.t:0 "The Belorussians Comes to Our Aid"
KOV.4.d:0 "Though the Home Guard is neither as professional nor ruthless as the SS, their intelligence network extends far further into the populace. They also, unlike the SS, understand that a certain level of tact is necessary in dealing with non-combat operations. It may be painful to have to stoop ourselves to their level, but like it or not, the Belorussians will be invaluable to ensuring a quick and satisfactory resolution to the investigation.\n\nPreferably before any other arms factories explode."
KOV.4.a:0 "They will prove their worth." 
KOV.5.t:0 "The Investigation Starts"
KOV.5.d:0 "Several weeks after the incident, we have been able to organize an official task-force to investigate the culprits behind the attacks. We have determined the process which we will go through during the investigation. We will start by investigating any possible internal involvement in this matter, as a compromised member of our military is a dangerous thing indeed. Next, we will move onto investigation any possible involvement by the natives in the incident, and finally, we will follow up on any possible leads we may have found."
KOV.5.a:0 "We will get to the bottom of this!"
KOV.6.t:0 "Internal Matters"
KOV.6.d:0 "Despite our many successes over the years, the investigative arm of the police has always had difficulty in acquiring anything beyond the most basic governmental assistance--many, both high and low, preferring more direct methods of dealing with crime. "Home Base" for the team is beneath a low, squat building, in a lower, squatier building. The word "podunk" may be apt, but it is never used. At least not within earshot of the chief investigator.\n\nRoughly speaking, there are two factions we can choose to investigate, the liberal Speerites, or the hardline SS. Both have been satisfied providing minimal information to our government, and our investigation. That will have to change soon, especially as the situation on the ground deteriorates. Disciplinary actions for excessive use of force has almost quintupled amongst our forces, and that¦s only for reported incidents. Many a shocked patrol has walked through the ruins of what once was a village, the bullet casings still warm beneath scattered ashes."

KOV.6.b:0 "Investigate the SS!"
KOV.7.t:0 "A Disturbing Message"
KOV.7.d:0 "Something worrisome has come up today. The process of the investigation involves digging up mountains of paperwork, most of which ends up on the chief investigators desk. Decrepit, faded documents inside moth-eaten manila folders hog every bit of desk space they can. But even amongst the clutter, one particular item stood out when investigators came in today: a velvet red envelope, lounging on mountains of paper. Inside, a single message:\n\n"There are certain organizations that you need to keep your noses out of. This is your only warning.""
KOV.7.a:0 "Stop the investigation!" 
KOV.7.b:0 "Continue ahead."
KOV.8.t:0 "Burgundian Whispers"
KOV.8.d:0 "We have decided to halt any serious investigation into the SS, but that comes with its own set of problems. Many investigators have come forth with their frustrations of having to abandon several promising leads with no elaboration as to why. Some have even gone so far as to accuse us of taking orders from Himmler himself! If only...\n\nWhether that threat was credible or not, we'll never know. A little dissent is a small price to pay to keep that ignorance."
KOV.8.a:0 "We must redouble the rest of our efforts."
KOV.9.t:0 "A Bloody Day"
KOV.9.d:0 "Bad news. Earlier this morning, a group of heavily-armed assailants forced their way into the investigative office. As the offices were located in a relatively safe part of the city, on-site security was lightly armed, if at all. An emergency call was not put in until 20 minutes after they opened fire. Furthermore, responding forces were held up by sudden traffic jams and communication issues. By the time reliable police and army units arrived on the scene, an hour and thirty-five minutes had elapsed, leaving us nothing but bodies and a few scraps of paper that escaped the flames.\n\nPerhaps investigating the ruthless killers we¦ve asked to help us was not the greatest of ideas."
KOV.9.a:0 "An unfortunate incident."
KOV.10.t:0 "Mounting Suspicion"
KOV.10.d:0 "It seems that our internal investigation is finally bearing fruit, despite attempts by a currently unknown group to the contrary. Though recent requisition forms seemed airtight, rerunning the math and accounting for transport costs has revealed a discrepancy in the amount of explosives shipped, and the amount that arrived. In particular, a recent series of forms from the normally silent SS seems to be the source of this inconsistency. Despite the need for further investigation, we finally have concrete evidence to back our suspicions."
KOV.10.a:0 "We are making progress."
KOV.11.t:0 "A Bloodstained Confession"
KOV.11.d:0 "Working with the brutes in the SS has proven to be, if not a good idea, at least a pragmatic one. Focusing on the Speerites in our government has turned up several sympathetic officers, some even quite high ranking. All of them have refused to say anything beyond expletives, however. After several days of fruitless interrogations and running in circles, our seasoned interrogators just about gave up, before the SS stepped in. One set of pliers, a car battery, and three hours in a backroom later, a beaten and bloodied staff officer finally cracked, singing like a canary. Or at least trying to with his remaining vocal chords.\n\nIt seems that certain low-priority weapons shipments have been redirected to a currently unknown partisan group. Any further details are still hazy, but we have concrete, if somewhat bloody, evidence now."
KOV.11.a:0 "Finally!"
KOV.12.t:0 "Wasted Blood"
KOV.12.d:0 "Focusing on the Speerites in our government has turned up several sympathetic officers, some even quite high ranking. All of them have refused to say anything beyond expletives, however. After several days of interrogations and running in circles, our seasoned interrogators have only turned up the standard bureaucratic corruption and embezzlement. The assistance of the Home Guard was welcome, but equally as fruitless in producing results. With the suspects detained for over a week and questions from their subordinates growing, we had little recourse but to release the survivors."
KOV.12.a:0 "We have other leads."
KOV.13.t:0 "Internal Report"
KOV.13.d:0 "As our internal investigation winds down and documents are put back into the archives, we must contend with the truth, as harsh as it is. This has all been a colossal waste of time. Yes, our bureaucrats are stealing money from us, and there's enough financial fraud in the government to make an accounting room faint. None of that brings us any closer to discovering the culprit behind the attacks, nor does it help prevent any future ones. Many others have come to the same conclusion and are soundly criticising our use of resources for what was essentially a dead-end. We must redouble our efforts and hone our focus to ensure this does not happen again."
KOV.13.a:0 "Hopefully our luck will improve."
KOV.14.t:0 "Internal Report"
KOV.14.d:0 "Though it has not been easy, our internal investigation was more or less successful. We have a solid lead as to where our weapons have been flowing to, and even a small paper trail. This is a major victory for our struggling government, a small, but very real success story to rally around. Even once harsh critics are coming out in support of the investigation--a welcome gesture, regardless of how sickly their sweetened words are. The political victory has secured enough financial and military resources to pursue our new lead to its conclusion. Excellent work."
KOV.14.a:0 "Onto the next lead."
KOV.15.t:0 "Native Suspicions"
KOV.15.d:0 "With the conclusion of our internal investigation, we must refocus our attention to other promising areas. Initial reports indicate that, as of now, there are two different areas of our country we can investigate: the Baltics, or Belarus. Though the government has poured more funding and manpower into our investigation, the sheer size of both areas ensures we can only meaningfully investigate one. Again, we must choose."
KOV.15.a:0 "Investigate Belarus." 
KOV.15.b:0 "Investigate the Baltics."
KOV.16.t:0 "An Offer We Can't Refuse"
KOV.16.d:0 "It seems that something quite... interesting has popped up. Two days ago, after nearly being fired on several times, a group of native partisans approached one of our investigators with an offer. In exchange for food and medical supplies, they're willing to divulge information about the attackers. Whether out of some sense of duty, or sheer spite from infighting, the reasons dont matter too much, this presents us with quite the conundrum. While we are technically under orders to destroy any partisan resistance, the past few years have seen a near-total cessation of hostilities, if only because neither side can afford the resources to crush the other. The squeeze on the investigation also grows tighter day-by-day, the need for results growing stronger--we must take any lead we can get.\n\nThen again, this could very well be a trap..."
KOV.16.a:0 "Accept the offer." 
KOV.16.b:0 "We do not negotiate with terrorists." 
KOV.17.t:0 "An Unexpected Windfall"
KOV.17.d:0 "The negotiators have just returned from their final meeting with the partisans, and they bring good news. Very good news. Despite high tensions during the exchanges, not a single bullet was fired, nor a single man killed. The partisans have what they need, and we have what we need. Undoubtedly, the restraint of the Home Guard prevented the volatile situation from exploding, old friends hesitant to fire on one another. We have manifests, names, locations--everything. Our gamble has paid off, and we're closer to finding the culprits now than we ever have been."
KOV.17.a:0 "Perhaps this arrangement might be beneficial."
KOV.18.t:0 "Wasted Effort"
KOV.18.d:0 "The negotiators have just returned from their final meeting with the partisans, and... it has not gone well. While our men approached the partisans unarmed in preparation for the handover, the SS security detail had different ideas. Upon sighting the partisans, they opened fire, killing several, and wounding quite a few of our own men. They underestimated the preparation of the partisans, however, as guerrillas hidden in the surrounding thickets revealed themselves. The ensuing firefight and artillery barrage ensured that nothing of what either party wanted to hand over remained. We¦ve reprimanded the security detail, but, as always, they simply brushed us off. Not much we can do to those who don¦t answer to our government."
KOV.18.a:0 "Unfortunate."
KOV.19.t:0 "A Bomber's Workshop"
KOV.19.d:0 "We have decided to refuse the suspicious offer and refocus our attention on a comprehensive search of the countryside. Our own forces went house to house, village to village, but turned up nothing of note. A few illegal gun caches here and there, yes, but nothing heavier than some aging bolt-action rifles. Just as we were on the cusp of giving up, the SS detail assigned to the team returned from their away leave. They returned 58 hours late, yes, but with items of interest: photographs of a (fairly extensive) explosives workshop, boxes of notebooks, and a single word. Nakam. This, of course, can only mean one thing...\n\nWhen asked to see the workshop in question, the detail responded with a single negative, claiming that "collateral damage" made the area too dangerous to search again."
KOV.19.a:0 "Interesting."
KOV.20.t:0 "Nothing But Dust"
KOV.20.d:0 "We have decided to refuse the suspicious offer and refocus our attention on a comprehensive search of the countryside. Our own forces went house to house, village to village, but turned up nothing of note. A few illegal gun caches here and there, yes, but nothing heavier than some aging bolt-action rifles. The Home Guard's assistance was welcome, but ultimately useless in collecting anything substantial. With the trail growing colder, we have little choice but to refocus our attention to more promising leads, and more pressing matters."
KOV.20.a:0 "We have other leads."
KOV.21.t:0 "Native Report"
KOV.21.d:0 "As our native investigation winds down and documents are put back into the archives, we must contend with the truth, as harsh as it is. This has all been a colossal waste of time. Yes, the natives hate us, and would have bombed us had the culprits not gotten to us first. None of that brings us any closer to discovering the culprit behind the attacks, nor does it help prevent any future ones. Many others have come to the same conclusion and are soundly criticising our use of resources for what was essentially a dead-end. We must redouble our efforts and hone our focus to ensure this does not happen again."
KOV.21.a:0 "Hopefully we have better luck next time."
KOV.22.t:0 "Native Report"
KOV.22.d:0 "Though it has not been easy, our native investigation was more or less successful. We have a solid lead as to who exactly assisted the attackers, and a list of locations to investigate. This has been a major coup for the troubled government, a small, but very real success story to rally around. Even once harsh critics are coming out in support of the investigation--a welcome gesture, regardless of how sickly their sweetened words are.

KOV.22.a:0 "Onto the final phase." 
KOV.23.t:0 "Nakam"
KOV.23.d:0 "The investigative process has been exhausting, expensive, and by no means easy, but slowly, but surely, it is arriving at its conclusion. There remains only one group of interest--one that we've had a long and storied history with: the Jews. Though many have considered the issue dealt with long ago, the attack has forced us to revisit even our most fundamental assumptions. A small, submissive, but still significant minority of the troublemakers remain in Ostland, scattered among the countryside and cities. We must decide whether to focus our resources on urban or rural areas.\n\nThis investigation is almost over, and when it is, we will have our own 'Nakam'. We only need to have a little more patience."

KOV.24.d:0 "Our search teams are reporting back, and unfortunately it doesn't seem like they're finding much. We've dragged a few Jews out of their hiding holes and disposed of them, but their numbers don't break two dozen. They also all seem to be acting as individuals, rather than a coordinated group. There's no documents, no leaders, no nothing. Sweeping building to building is incredibly time consuming, and quite costly too. While many in our government consider eradicating the Jewish menace once and for all a top priority, we can no longer conceal the amount manpower and resources we're spending for results (or rather, lack of them)."
KOV.24.a:0 "We have run out of leads..." 
KOV.25.t:0 "An Interesting Discovery"
KOV.25.d:0 "Our men in the field have discovered something quite... interesting. Teams assigned to searching the allegedly uninhabited Pinsk Marshes picked up on and followed a faint trail of plastic and metal refuse for several miles into the marshes. Progress was slow, with the swampy soil constantly attempting to swallow the team's vehicles, and the local wildlife claiming the lives of dozens of men (and two entire squads). In the end, the search teams came across a small village--if you could even call it that--consisting of a few rickety shacks on unstable wooden platforms. Though our initial sweep found the area deserted, we discovered a few stragglers after some of our men fell through the platforms. Intensive interrogations revealed that the village was some sort of commune, and had far more people than we captured. The suspects had to be disposed of before we could extract any more information, unfortunately. Ultimately, this little incident was of no consequence to our investigation, but still...\n\nThis is not a good sign. Not at all."

KOV.26.t:0 "An Interesting Discovery"
KOV.26.d:0 "Another report's come in today. As our men continue to sweep the Pinsk Marshes, we keep digging up more and more things that we thought were long buried. A search team came across an abandoned shack over 50 kilometers from the nearest town, and, after disarming an explosive trap, scoured it from top to bottom. There was little in the shack apart from a few documents in a currently unknown code, but those documents are very interesting indeed. Our cryptologists are working around the clock to decode the passages, but strangely, a single term constantly appears without any encoding: 'Nakam'.\n\nIt's just idle speculation at this point, but, if that single word was purposefully left unencoded..."

Excuses, delays, and 'missing' documents constantly stymie our requests, holding up progress at vital points. Forms that were once freely given now need pickup in-person, within a 15 minute window."\n\n"Those fucking bureaucrats are suddenly so concerned about saving their precious little behinds when there might not even be anyone to come after them, at least if this investigation doesn't finish in time. For God's sake, I mean, at this point, half our men do more work as couriers than investigators!"\n\nOne might consider this a conspiracy against our investigation, but thank God there isn't anyone in the government nearly competent enough to start one."
KOV.27.a:0 "When will it end?" 
KOV.28.t:0 "A Chance Encounter"
KOV.28.d:0 "It seems that our decision to investigate the urban areas of Ostland has proven fruitful. After days of tearing up the ghettoes and suburbs, an abandoned safehouse was located. Inside our teams located the corpse of a woman, we have been unable to confirm her identity as of this time. After a thorough investigation of the safe house, a book was discovered, written in some type of code. We have been unable to decipher the code, but a single word has appeared repeatedly without encryption, "Nakam""
KOV.28.a:0 "Interesting." 
KOV.29.t:0 "Nakam Report"
KOV.29.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our most courageous agents, after concluding the investigation into the supposed involvement of this "Nakam" organization, we have made no progress in identifying the culprits. As was perhaps to be expected, locating such an obscure, and potentially fictional, group has proven to be beyond us. As we announced our latest reports, the government once again faced harsh criticism from the party, with some questioning whether or not this signals that the current administration has failed completely."
KOV.29.a:0 "Damn it all to hell!" 
KOV.30.t:0 "Nakam Report"
KOV.30.d:0 "It seems that our decision to investigate any Jewish involvement in these attacks may have proven fruitful. Although we have not discovered any significant leads as of yet, we have followed a trail of small clues, coded phrases, and deserted safehouses. But as the evidence gathered by our task force grows, some have voiced their suspicions. As it seems like somebody might have deliberately left these clues for us to find..."
KOV.30.a:0 "Worrying." 
KOV.31.t:0 "Final Report"
KOV.31.d:0 "With the last phase of the investigation finally concluding, we have reached the end of this whole debacle. After a thorough investigation into our Internal suspects, possible native collaboration, and a suspicious organization named "Nakam". As we reach the end of this investigation, a single question remains, who was the mastermind behind the attacks? We are finally ready to reach a conclusion. Did we gather enough information to discover the culprit?"
KOV.31.a:0 "Let's get to the bottom of this."
KOV.32.t:0 "The Ghost of Kovner"
KOV.32.d:0 "After a thorough review of all of the evidence that we have gathered, we have done what many considered impossible, through the valiant and determined effort of our investigative team, and despite harsh criticism from large portions of the party, we have determined that the ultimate mastermind behind the attacks, is Abba Kovner.\n\nBut what can we do to a dead man? Kovner was reportedly killed in 1951 after years of terrorist attacks by the state. But in all the documents, the coded journals and the safe houses, only two common factors have been identified, the name Abba Kovner, and the words "nakam"\n\nIt seems we have reached a dead end, but then who was the culprit?"
KOV.32.a:0 "Interesting." 
KOV.33.t:0 "A Cold Trail"
KOV.33.d:0 "As the days go by, and after reviewing all the available the information, we are left with a simple, undeniable fact. We have failed, utterly and completely. Despite the valiant efforts of our investigation team, and despite all the time and effort we have poured into this black hole of resources, we have failed. The news has reached the rest of the Einheitspakt, and our German masters are less than happy with our investigation, and several members of the team have been forced to "retire" by the party. This incident will cast a long shadow over our government for a long time."
KOV.33.a:0 "Unfortunate." 
KOV.34.t:0 "Equipment Captured"
KOV.34.d:0 "After seeing control of several German armories, we have managed to capture a significant amount of German equipment, this will surely help our cause."
KOV.34.a:0 "Good."
##Kovner kills some losers events
##Stahlecker
KOV.42.t:0 "Death of Stahlecker"
KOV.42.d:0 "Victorious partisans overwhelmed the last garrisons of the pathetic Stahlecker today. A series of terror bombings broke the last will they had, and while retreating they were overran by our united partisan forces.\n\nWith the last vestiges of the old regime gone, the time for retribution can begin.\n\nThose members of the bastard state who have not managed to flee have been dragged out across town squares and partisan camps across our occupied zone, and, after hours of retribution, have been shot, hung, or butchered in a thousand ways as dictated by the mob.\n\nStahlecker himself was dragged out on the highest tower, where, bruised and battered, he begged for forgiveness on broadcasted radio. Moments after his pathetic plea, he was shoved off, and the people cheered as the tyrants death was broadcasted to the world all the way to the sickening crunch."
KOV.42.a:0 "Death to the old regime!"
##Drechsler
KOV.43.t:0 "Death of Drechsler"
KOV.43.d:0 "The militarists lay defeated, their armies shattered, their tanks destroyed. Every single one of the fools now bow before the strongest- not some Aryan stooge or Nazi fool, but Kovner and the many who they ruined. From the most proud of generals to the most base of soldiers, they have been stripped of uniforms and dragged through the streets so the people can see the weakness inherit not only in their ideologies and minds but also in their weak bodies.\n\nDrechsler himself was given a most fitting punishment. As he stumbled barefoot through the streets, being pegged with rocks and refuse by the people as the sounds of gunshots echoed the fate of his men across the city, he was dragged to the town square.\n\nThere, the general who preached so much fire and fury screamed vitriol at the masses while the partisans coated him in gasoline. As the people laughed at the man and his pathetic body, the match was thrown.\n\nDrechsler always wished to go out with a bang, and we gave him this."
KOV.43.a:0 "Death to the hounds of war!"
##Jeckeln
KOV.44.t:0 "Death of Jeckeln"
KOV.44.d:0 "The SS, long hated enemies of all free people of the world, is vanquished. The black banner burns and their so hated Untermensch have now disgraced both their men and women. Those few SS cells who managed to flee to the woods put up a pitiful resistance, but outnumbered without the knowledge of the trees and swamps that we possess, have found themselves massacred in their guerrilla campaign. Each man of the SS has been shown no mercy, given only the worst punishments that each one of the cells could imagine.\n\nNakam is universal, and even those members of our united front who are not of God's children harbor so much hatred for the SS that we need not tell them to only give true retribution to these fools.\n\nJeckeln was abandoned by the last of his men, and we saw it all. As a helicopter took pathetic Himmler's equally pathetic advisors back to Burgundy, Jeckeln and his men attempted to board and were thrown back onto the helipad.\n\nJeckeln soon after took a pill in an attempt to kill himself, but we had him before it could take effect. His last moments, broadcasted over captured television systems, showed the world that the Nazis are truly disgusting- not only on the outside, but on the inside as well..."
KOV.44.a:0 "Death to the servants of darkness!"
##Meyer-Landrut
KOV.45.t:0 "Death of Meyer-Landrut"
KOV.45.d:0 "The so called 'liberals' lie defeated like all others. While they proclaim forgiveness and openness, they are simply Nazis who have seen the coming tide and hope their cowardice will spare them from retribution.\n\nThis is not to be, for they are Nazi scum as all others. The student militias who we have taken pity on have found themselves working in mines and factories, serving under us like the slaves who they grew so fat lording over. This was the fate of half of those who did not resist, the other half found themselves facing true retribution for their crimes.\n\nDragged out, we lined them up in the hundreds. Each was allowed to say one thing into recorders before the bullet entered their skull and spilled their oh-so educated brains across the ground. They begged, cried, screamed, shouted, and each had their last pathetic moments broadcasted straight to their Fatherland.\n\nMeyer-Landrut himself was given to the crowd that he tried so hard to win over. The rich magnate screamed as they tore him apart.\n\nIn life, he tried to win over the mob. Now he can see what they truly think of him."
KOV.45.a:0 "Death to the cowards!"
##Vituska
KOV.46.t:0 "Fate of Vituska"
KOV.46.d:0 "The Council burns, the sky blood red as their fate is seen from miles around. The cities are burned, as are their supporters, and the last vestiges of our 'alliance' now turns to ash.\n\nThe Council, hounds for the German regime who showed how truly spineless they were before death, has been treated to the same fate all have met, and already they hang from every tree, and line every wall, and bleed across every floor in every pathetic city they had once claimed as theirs.\n\nMany in our coalition showed pause at this final battle, trying to intervene on behalf of their 'brothers' and 'sisters'. We ignored their cries, and we will deal with them later.\n\nVituska himself, the spineless snake, is the only of our enemies to have alluded us. First, in a furious battle across his compound, we cornered the bastard in his meeting chambers where he managed to gun down three men with a machinegun before he was finally tackled and dragged out. This man was one of four body doubles across the compound who we captured and killed.\n\nThe real Vituska was last spotted tearing out of the vicinity in a stolen vehicle along with a convoy of supporters. Each vehicle in the convoy was defeated, but Vituska, personally driving his own vehicle, somehow managed to evade our men.\n\nVituska, the last surviving tyrant of Ostland, was last seen heading east..."
KOV.46.a:0 "We will find him. One day."
