 POLITICS_WERNER_BEST_DESC:0 "Werner Best was a staunch German nationalist who bounced between several far-right parties, so it was little surprise that he eagerly joined the Nazi Party in 1930. He became a part of the SS, using his legal and administrative skills to help organize the nascent Gestapo and coordinate the Night of the Long Knives in Munich. After rivals forced him out of his Gestapo position in 1940, he served in the military occupation of France, and was appointed as the Reich's Plenipotentiary to Denmark in 1942. Best found himself in an odd position, as Denmark was still permitted to retain its monarchy, a cabinet and a semi-democratic parliament. Many compromises were struck, and Best even advised against deporting Denmark's Jewish population to the concentration camps for the sake of maintaining stable relations with the Danish government. An attempt at organizing free elections and a series of labor strikes in 1943 led to Best placing the country under German military occupation and dissolving parliament, but the Danish monarchy, cabinet, and much of the bureaucracy was left intact. Best was also oddly ineffective in stopping the majority of the nation's Jews from escaping to Sweden, and rumors of being a Jewish sympathizer have clung to him for decades.\n\nAfter the war, Denmark stayed in its strange limbo. It remained nominally independent, but still under close supervision, and with the threat of a return to German martial law constantly looming. Best still retained his office, and he briefly attempted to implement wide-reaching Germanization programs. The economic collapse of the 1950s caused funding to dry up and the programs were shuttered, but Best still hopes that his dream of turning Denmark into part of a Greater Germanic Reich will one day be reality."
 POLITICS_NILS_SVENNINGSEN_DESC:0 "Nils Svenningsen is the personification of the loyal cog in the vast machinery of state, working diligently to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. While some in Germania claim that the former Foreign Minister's loyalties lie more with Denmark than the Reich, his diplomatic record is not to be scoffed at. With a streak of liberal pragmatism matched only by his strict diligence, many are hoping that Svenningsen's ascension to ruler of Denmark following the failed coup by Martinsen's National Socialists may finally herald a period of relative stability in the Protektorat."
 POLITICS_HERMANN_HANNEKEN_DESC:0 "As with most militarists, patience is not a virtue respected by Hermann von Hanneken. Since 1942, he has served the Reich as the chief of police and supreme commander of the Wehrmacht garrison in Denmark, cracking down on dissent and treason. While his strict militarism does not reach the fervent frenzy of Schörner, the officer's concern for the security of the Großgermanisches Reich has led him to take swift action in securing the leadership of Denmark.\n\nVon Hanneken and his loyal clique believe that the complex bureaucracy of Werner Best has created a tight knot around Denmark's throat, a fact well known by Germania. This knot has restricted progression of the nation's Germanization and left it hanging limply as a mere Protektorat in the north. Like Alexander the Great, von Hanneken is ready to sever this rope in one swift motion so that Denmark and its Germanic people at last be integrated into the Reich."
 POLITICS_KNUD_MARTINSEN_DESC:0 "Knud Børge Martinsen's loyalty to the Reich is only superseded by the love for his nation. He has long acted as the Fører of the National Socialist Party of Denmark, serving as the face of the Party while his trusted ally Carl Popp-Madsen acts as its brains. A man of infamous cynicism, Martinsen's rise to power in the Party can be traced back to his actions in the West Russian War of the 1950s. He led his military units to important victories in the chaotic struggle against the Russian advance, his temperament as cold as the snow they fought and bled upon.\n\nDespite serving the Reich as a loyal collaborator for the last two decades, Martinsen's desire for an independent Denmark has been no secret to Germania. With a successful coup cementing his Party's rule over the nation, the Fører's demands for an independent but loyal Denmark may yet come to fruition."
 POLITICS_GUSTAV_MEISSNER_DESC:0 "Gustav Meissner's bureaucratic career has seen him rise through the ranks of the Protektorat's government, and his tenacious loyalty has finally paid off. Formerly a functionary under Werner Best, the death of his boss has propelled him to the position of German Plenipotentiary and effective head of state for Denmark. Meissner is a man who knows how to listen and obey, and his government will doubtless dedicate itself to continuing Best's work without question or delay."
 POLITICS_OCCUPATIONAL_AUTHORITIES_DEN_DESC:0 "With Denmark once again under the German boot, a provisional interim government has been established on the orders of Martin Bormann to stabilize the region. Led by the most efficient German bureaucrats, the Occupational Authorities are preparing to seamlessly transfer power to the next government, which will be selected by the Führer when he deems fit."
 POLITICS_JENS_OTTO_KRAG_DESC:0 " What took six hours to destroy in 1940, has taken over twenty to restore to a semblance of its former glory and standing over once-proud Ozymandias, is Jen Otto Krag. Where others across Europe wept at the feet of the mangled corpses of their Motherland, Denmark watched. When partisans and native collaborators butchered and mutilated one another, in the name of their concrete vision, Krag stayed silent. But he did not stay still. Climbing up the byzantine labyrinth of Social Democratic politics, Krag was determined to shield the common Dane from the torrent of Hitler's abomination of an ideology. Even if it meant standing with the Führer, hand in hand.\n\nKneeling at the great monument to the Pharaoh, the winds bite at his back. He knows that he will never get back the innocence of peace that they lost. One day, he will fade into the dunes, leaving but the flesh-picked bones of his achievements as the only signs of Krag's existence. It does not matter. Everything, from the dissolution of the Danish government to the establishment of "Permanent Secretaries" in 1943, will not mean a thing if the Prime Minister can guide his people out of the Desert and out of the shackles of bondage. Standing up, Krag looks upon Ozymandias. Not with disdain or dread, but with hope. For it is here, upon the bitter ashes of failure, shall Denmark's greatest victory unfold."

 DEN_permanent_secretaries:0 "The Permanent Secretaries"
 DEN_permanent_secretaries_desc:0 "Denmark's situation is a remnant from the war. In 1943 Prime Minister Scavenius handed in his government's resignation to the King after some outrageous demands from General Hanneken. But King Christian X refused to dismiss the government, but it stood down regardless. Something had to replace the government as the executive branch, and nobody wanted German administration. Nils Svenningsen and the rest of the permanent secretaries from the ministries quickly emerged as spiritual successor to the former Government. Many found this awkward, as non elected officials were running a democratic country, with no political mandate nor legal authority, but secretary of the Interior Ministry developed the concept of 'provisional laws', laws that could be passed within a ministry, and be acted upon by bureaucrats until a parliament could ratify it. With no parliament active, and prospects for one are close to zero, Denmark has turned into a legal jungle, maneuvering around outdated provisional laws from many years ago.\n\nThe situation is more urgent than it might sound like, as Germania pressures German officials in Denmark to enact more effective measures to hasten the integration of Denmark into the Greater Germanic Reich, no one knows how long the structure will hold. May it live long, and keep Denmark away from foreign control."
 DEN_agrarian_economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
 DEN_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "The war left the Danish economy damaged, whatever momentum it had going into the war was stopped and reverted during it. Conquests and operations all across Europe, Africa and Russia required rations for soldiers and food for civilians. Each year tonnes upon tonnes of Danish grain is distributed around Europe, especially England, as the war saw an end to her former grain-supplier.\n\nWhile the Danish economy is relatively stable, it is stagnant and barely keeping up with the Reich's growing demands. Young bright boys and girls are required to stay on their family's farm to keep production up, effectively forced to give up their dreams of university and lives in the cities. Something must be done to effectize the agriculture so the economy can begin growing quicker."
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg:0 "Threats from Silkeborg"
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht Garrison in Silkeborg watches closely everything that happens in Werner Best's 'Dagmarhus'. Hermann von Hanneken, is to say the least, not impressed. Best had suggested in clear text that by 1960, Denmark would be a state in the German Reich. Yet, to Hanneken's great annoyance, Best is still in place and running the show along. Every month, Hanneken sends reports, some true; some exaggerated; some fabricated, about how the resistance is still going, and how bad of a job Best is doing to deal with it. Hanneken, naturally, has ambitions for himself, seeing himself as deserving to run Denmark, it is after all, he, that has kept the peace and kept the resistance weak."

 den.4.d:0 "We have managed to thwart the recent attempt at subverting the will of our government, and the will of our people! Foolish and vain, our heroic soldiers patrolling the capital made quick work of the perpetrators, and now they await their trial. However, despite this clear showing of strength and organization, we have a major problem that is now facing us. The Führer of the Reich, Albert Speer, leader of a Germany bound to fall into degeneracy and trappings of "democracy", has demanded that we are to immediately release the treasoners that we have taken to trial, and that we enter into the Einheitspakt. Though we could deny as a showing of ideological purity and continue with the trial, which would conclude with their mass execution, we also have to consider the legitimacy of their threats. We may see the Führer as a spineless betrayer of National Socialism, but with the possibility of the Wehrmacht bearing down on our borders, we may be strong-armed into joining the Reich so that we do not lose our sovereignty.\n\nRegardless of what we may think, we must make a decision with all due haste."
