### Megacorp Info ###

NOV_megacorp_1_name: "Feniks"
NOV_megacorp_1_desc: "The Feniks Corporation is one of the three main economic forces within the Federation, and has long ties with Alexander Pokryshkin. As the principal arms manufacturer and distributor within the Federation, Feniks is both the driving force behind and the beating heart of the Federation's sizable army.\n\nThe corporation was founded by prospective siloviki soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union. With their close relationship with Pokryshkin, and their invaluable service as the provider for our armed forces, Feniks Corporation is a natural friend of the government."

NOV_megacorp_2_name: "Sibir"
NOV_megacorp_2_desc: "Associated with the mayor of Barnaul, the Sibir Corporation was founded by the landowning bourgeoisie following the Soviet Union's collapse. They represent, and hold the principal shares of, agricultural production within the Federation and, indeed, perhaps the entire Central Siberian region. Not only producing agricultural products, but also the agricultural equipment and, surprisingly enough, act as the backbone for much of the Federation's financial institutions, Sibir is certainly the heart of the Federation's civilian industry.\n\nThese facts, tied with Sibir's close association with civilian politicians within the silovik-dominated government and tacit support for Vasily Shukshin, make it an incredibly important organ of the Federation's economy."

NOV_megacorp_3_name: "Titan"
NOV_megacorp_3_desc: "If Feniks is the Federation's muscle, and Sibir its beating heart, Titan is the Federation's brain. Their motto, simple and precise as the corporation's mission itself, is: "Progress", and this is what Titan does best.\n\nGeared towards the furthering of the Federation's technological fronts, Titan has long been the frontrunner in the Federation's race towards mechanization and the furthering of all technology, Titan once directly competed with the Modernists in Tomsk."

NOV_megacorp_4_name: "The People"
NOV_megacorp_4_desc: "The Federation does not solely comprise of corporations and the resources that they produce. The Federation, and, by extension, her economy, are fueled by the people - the civilians that live under our administration. These people, from the lowliest rural peasant to the highest administrator within our government, have at least a nominal say in how we run things.\n\nIt's important for us to be well aware of the status of our people, how loyal they are to our regime, how popular our administration is, and how influential they are within our borders."
