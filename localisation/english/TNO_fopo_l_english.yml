What is there to discuss?\nThere's nothing left for us to say of us."

Now, the jackboot threatens once again to stamp out democracy in South Africa.\n\nOur involvement in the South African War is necessarily limited, but Brazil is uniquely positioned to help control the Atlantic and act as a backdoor for American weapons. From the Lobster War we have gained invaluable experience striking against the Nazi threat, and intelligence on their colonial forces, and we have not forgotten about the damned fascists attacking our convoys, forcing us into the war.\n\nIt's true that the war in South Africa is largely a ground war, and our recent past anti-fascist experience has been in naval affairs. And there are some at home who would prefer we have nothing to do with the Americans.

While our most recent operation has reclaimed Shonan and all ports from their illegitimate government, we have information that they have stretched their hands for the Americans of all people.\n\nIt's clear that the situation in South East Asia is escaping our control, and harsher measures must immediately be taken, starting with squashing Chin Peng and the UMAJF once and for all, before we turn towards the Philippines, and their own little rebel problem too.\n\nHawaii might have been an overstretch, but the Pacific belongs to us, and we will not let this afront to our hold in the Pacific stand."

Samora Machel is a socialist, and far from a true friend of Japan, but we have already come to an agreement with him to help him restore his broken nation in exchange for economic and political concessions. The Americans will no doubt back the opposition, who has risen up in armed conflict to try to oust Machel and install their own dictator in its place, so it falls to us to protect the Machel regime and our interests in not only Mozambique, but all of Africa as well by extension, blunting the tip of the Yankee sphere in Africa in the process.\n\nDevastation is: §R[?ZZZ.mozambique_devastation|2]%§!\nMininium Increase is: §R[?ZZZ.mozambique_devastation_exponential_min]%§!\nMaximum Increase is: §R[?ZZZ.mozambique_devastation_exponential_max]%§!\n\nEvery 3 weeks devastation will increase by a number between the min and the max.

 USA_MLY_aid_category_desc: "After our defeat in the Second World War, a crested wave has descended upon the Pacific Ocean, the wave of Japan's so called Co-Prosperity Sphere. Recently however, an opportunity has arisen from the war-torn region of Malaya. Having endured decades of occupation from the Japanese invaders, the Malayan people have seen the government alternate between collaborators and rebels from time and time again, and have fought a relentless guerrilla campaign against the Japanese occupiers.\n\nThe 25th Army, which are stationed there by the Japanese, has launched a final desperate offensive in the hopes of destroying rebel presence in the region once and for all. This has led the rebels to contact us in search for aid to defeat the Japanese.\n\nDespite our clear ideological differences, the opportunity that Malaya provides is immeasurable. We are finally able to strike them where it hurts, and if the stars align, we will tear down the Crested Wave piece by piece, and we will watch as their glorious Sphere crumbles before our eyes."

Tales thereafter told of men continuing the good fight to the south, in the mountains and forests Manila cannot reach.\n\nTwenty years have passed hence, and recent developments have shown the true extent of their long campaign. Where before they were cast to the untrammeled wilds, now only a hundred miles stand between them and Manila. Many have clamored the President to send our old soldiers aid lest they falter and fall.

Further hampering any lasting success are the budget cuts of ministries past, dwindling the once-formidable 14th Army's numbers into a glorified garrison - a trend only recently stymied by the damnable rebels' resurgence.\n\nNevertheless, the archipelago's importance is rarely overstated. For the Pearl of the Orient secures not just our sea lanes to Indonesia but also our grand bulwark against the American leviathan. A loss now will leave our lands and seas exposed once more to Western intrusion; Heavens know what will happen from there.\n\nThankless and bloody our job may be, but it is necessary. Let's get to it."

Nevertheless, Japan's parting shot is as direct as it is profuse with irony: that the Empire would so easily surrender is laughable at best, and a lethal jape at worst. The real test begins soon, at the rare moment in a man's life where history repeats and legends are retold.\n\nSo rally the men, raise the palisades, man the guns - but above all, never lose hope.

  reconstruction_desc_text: "[GetPHIreconstructionDesc]"

  JAP_PHI_reconstruction_desc: "The failure of the Balintawak Blitz has brought us ever further into solidifying our position as the sole master of all of Asia. Though their rebellions have collapsed, the damage that they inflicted is here to stay, and is costing the Filipino government a fortune to clean up, which if they're not careful, could spell economic and societal disaster within the country.\n\nThus, we have elected that we will bring aid for our Filipino brothers in many shapes and forms, be it money, medical equipment, construction, or even weapons to clean up any remaining resistance fighters.\n\nHowever, we have been warned that the tension in the islands are very palpable, and that a failed reconstruction campaign may warrant §Runforeseen consequences§!. We must be wary."

  USA_UPH_reconstruction_desc: "Although the parties have died down and the beer taps have finally run dry, the Filipino people must still contend with the pains of a nation exhausted both in land and spirit. American aid in easing this process goes without saying.\n\nOur analysts estimate that we have no more than six months of leeway to fix the war's worst damages before public sentiment compels a withdrawal. By then authority should be restored to an elected civilian government, whether it is of Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr.'s Partido Liberal or Carlos García's "new Filipinos."\n\nNote that Mr. Diosdado has staked his legitimacy on us delivering not merely reconstruction, but a timely, well-managed one at that. Should we exceed the six-month deadline, Mr. García will likely succeed the late Sergio Osmeña, Sr. as President and establish a government less open to our suggestions than the Lawyer."
  #USA_UPH_OFN_Mandate_reconstruction_desc: "With the general breakdown of civilian government in the Philippine Islands, Congress has authorized the Philippine Department to enforce martial law within the former Commonwealth's jurisdiction until order is fully restored and the bare minimum of economic activities may resume. General Beach pledged that martial law will last for no more than six months, after which the Mandate authorities will assume all government functions.\n\nFor the country today, insofar as it may still be one, is a hollow shell of what it was before the Blitz. Villages lay empty, the hollow wrecks of cities wail, and what few parcels of farmland that haven't been bombed, burned, or defoiled have been plucked of all they're worth by the bandits that rule the interior. Hope has fled for fairer climes; much as it pains us to say, the Filipino people will have to do without it for quite some time."
  USA_SPH_Coalition_reconstruction_desc: "In response to the 14th Army invasion, the USFIP and the Communist insurgency brokered an agreement which elevated their non-agression pact during the Blitz into a full-fledged alliance. Among its stipulations was a binding pledge to organize a post-war government composed of appointees from the Communist Party of the Philippines, the military and civilian halves of the USFIP, and miscellaneous groups opposed to the former KALIBAPI. Thus, the so-termed United Filipino Front evolved into the Coalition Government following the Evacuation.\n\nActing President Lorenzo Tañada's popularity with left-wing forces and Ramon Magsaysay's popularity with the Nacionalistas is a direct threat to our candidate, Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr.'s Partido Liberal. What happens in either case is anyone's guess, but it certainly won't be good for the country - or for us, after all we'd sunk into prying it off Japan."

 ################ MALAYAN RECONSTRUCTION / South Seas Reconstruction Strategic Initiative
 TNO_malaya_reconstruction_category_desc_usa: "Rome wasn't built in a day, and Malayan surely won't be rebuilt in an hour. While the country shed the shackles from the Japanese Sphere, the truth is, it stands alone surrounded by agressive countries that see them as traitors, and her only allies being the Indian and the Australians, and who knows what holds for them in the future. The war is over, but the real battle to rebuild the country from years of warfare has begin; one battle that, thankfully, is much easier on our burdens. Investors and Money are much more pliable to movement than guns and tanks."

 TNO_malaya_reconstruction_category_desc_jap: "Our protectorates and network of allies in Southeast Asia have been under varying degrees of tepid control, prone to infiltration by resistance groups and Western-backed cronies. To this end, the Greater East Asian Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have proposed the Southern Sphere Reconstruction and Stabilisation Initiative - a plan to grease the wheels of the full economic potential of the region. From the tin mines of Malaya to the rubber plantations of North Borneo, our grip on the Sphere will be reforged, and our political hegemony in the region will be secured."

### Iranian Civil War

JAP_ircw_category_desc: "Once one of the few allies belonging to Germany in the Middle East, Iran has recently imploded into civil war following the death of its Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a largely unpopular figure following his overthrowing of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and establishment of his pro-German regime. As the instability of the region has been threatening to boil over since the beginning of the Oil Crisis, it seems only natural that with the death of its leader, the partisans of Iran have made their move for power.\n\nAmong these rebels moving against the government of Iran are the Democratic Republic of Iran, led by Karim Sanjabi, the Socialist Federation of Iran under Iraj Eskanderi, and the Baluchi Liberation Front, an independence movement in the south of the nation led by Sher Mohammed Marri, among others. Of course, there is also the remnants of the pro-German government holed out of the north of the nation.\n\nAs fresh arms flow into the region, and the anti-German alliance already shows cracks, it would seem as though it's in the best interest of the world powers to send aid the way of their preferred candidates."

### SAF War - Aftermath

TNO_SAF_Aftermath_desc_USA: "We have won a great victory for democracy in South Africa, but our work is far from finished. While the German army is defeated, remnants of their forces still fight on. In addition, many local warlords have established their own forces, and would like nothing better than expel us from their lands. Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term. Whichever approach we take, the public demands that our young men return home soon, and leave a stable continent behind. If we fail to satisfy the public, we will surely suffer at the polls."

# Mano Campaign

Now Japan's bloodthirsty stooges have taken advantage of the Oil Crisis to continue their 'liberation' efforts, striking at Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nThese two nations, imperfect as they may be, are the OFN's only friends left in the region. The alternative to victory in this war is absolute Japanese dominance of West Africa and its vast resources. America will not stand by while slavery is reimposed upon Africans - defeat is not an option!"
JAP_mano_campaign_desc: "Our cohorts in anti-imperialism, the Pan-African Liberation Front, has excelled thus far in West Africa; their defeat of the 'Free' French, even backed by the OFN, proved the righteousness of our cause. Western avarice is no match for the armed wrath of the oppressed. Now, with the Oil Crisis raging, and the PALF relatively unaffected, they have seized the opportunity and struck at the last bastions of imperialism: Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nBoth ourselves and the OFN are impacted by the Oil Crisis, but the Americans have still thrown what they can spare into the conflict. If the PALF fais now, West Africa will continue to be threatened by the colonialist boot - we cannot permit that. One last effort to dislodge the imperialists, and the region will be freed at last... and firmly within our sphere."

GER_PP_invasion_desc: "Spies in Havana and Washington have delivered reports to us detailing the training of the "Caribbean Legion," a group of political dissidents and mercenaries preparing for an invasion of the Dominican Republic to overthrow dictator Rafael Trujillo. Despite Trujilo's steadfast alignment to Iberia, we may find that humiliating the Americans in their own backyard could prove valuable.\n\nAmerican air assets will likely be used in the conflict and prove devastating to D.R. forces. In response, engineers in the Wehrmacht have begun strongly advocating for the shipment of anti-air weapons especially new technologies for field testing. We should not pass up valuable experience and photos of downed U.S. pilots on the news."

Living as if they were guerrillas in the mountains, they will conduct a variety of sabotage and destabilizing operations to trigger continued fighting.

### French Civil War ###

USA_ffr_reclamation_desc: "In 1776, the French aided the USA in the fight against tyranny - now, it's time to return the favor. The Free French have reached the next step in their campaign to reclaim their homeland from the Nazis - and we will aid them in any way we can.\n\nWe've gotten this far - France's military victories in West Africa would have been impossible without our aid - and now we must take them over the finish line. The French are excited - and rightfully so- but we must ensure that their actions can back up their words."
USA_french_civil_war_desc: "Although France did not take sides in the American Civil War, we will take a side in theirs: we will send men, guns, and other types of aid to the Free French. We will help them reclaim their homeland - and thus return to the world stage as a staunch ally of the OFN. We've gotten this far - France's military victories in West Africa would have been impossible without our aid - and now we must take them over the finish line. The French are excited - and rightfully so - but we must ensure that their actions can back up their words."
USA_FFR_Reclamation_Modifier: "Involvement in §WFrench Reclamation§!"

GER_ffr_reclamation_desc: "For decades now, the inability of the legitimate French Government to curtail the influence of the French Resistance has been a blight on Germany's attempts to maintain its influence over western europe, countless amounts of economic and military aid have born little results, now, most insultingly, they have allowed an old ghost of our conquest of the perfidious French Republic to come back to haunt us.\n\nThe reemergence of our enemy on French soil is an insult to the Aryan Race, forsooth, the old rivalry shall henceforth be rekindled again."
GER_french_civil_war_desc: "The political instability of the French State gave rise into a full blown civil war. While this result is not surprising given the signs from the last 10 years, having so much chaos this close to the Rhine - our natural defense line - is deleterious to the stability of the Reich.\n\nAdding insult to injury, reliable intel from the Mediterranean coast of France tells us of movements of troops bearing a tricolor with the Cross of Lothringen, the symbol of the accursed gaullists. We must squash and then quickly remove them from public light."

IBR_ffr_reclamation_desc: "We have promised aid to the French. They have paid their side of the bargain and it is now our turn to pay our fair share. From Bilbao to Barcelona we are ready to cross the border and go all in on backing the Free French. Our troops will begin pouring across the border into France as we engage in combat in continental Europe for the first time since the civil war.\n\nIf all goes to plan, we will have a stable ally between us and the German menace to our east. Such an opportunity would be great to give the Germans a taste of their own medicine and scare them with a hostile state on their borders for decades to come."

JAP_CCW_desc: "Colombia lies in ruin; the fragile peace, the frozen war, that the nation has been in for the last decade has melted, and Colombians once again fight with blade and rifle for what they believe in. Colombia lies directly in the United States' backyard- and we are presented with the unique opportunity to humiliate them within it. By supporting the New Granadan government against the so-called legitimate government and the socialists in the Colombian Revolutionary Union, we can establish an aligned nation in Latin America- right near the United States. It is important that we do not squander this opportunity."

JAP_colombia.1.t: "Valleys of the Dead"
JAP_colombia.1.d: "To the Office of the Prime Minister,\n\nEver since the untimely end of President Gaitán in 1954, the South American nation of Colombia has been in a state of civil war and strife, with only a thin ceasefire agreement keeping a lid on the boiling pot, and the pressure is reaching its boiling point. Across the country are dens of bandits, corrupt leadership, communists, and worse. The United States, the so-called guardian of the Americas, has demonstrated its inattentiveness and incompetence with its inability to quell the chaos. As such, the Colombian crisis provides us with a unique opportunity to show both the strength of the Sphere and the weakness of the OFN by defeating the giant in its backyard.\n\nFortunately, we have found a suitable candidate for our support in the State of New Granada. Led by the dedicated fascists and Italiophilics, the state represents a united front of nationalists and industrialists opposed to the government, communists, and Americans. Many among their ranks think highly of our Empire and would welcome our support. To this end, it is recommended that we dispatch military advisers and equipment to prepare their soldiers for the ceasefire's demise. A priority for our allies lies in the Alántico Department, which controls a vital port from which our geo-political rivals intend to send arms to their puppets. Its capture would cripple their re-armament campaigns.\n\nWith your approval, we can begin operating immediately."
JAP_colombia.1.a: "The Rising Sun will shine over the Andes."

JAP_colombia.2.t: "News from Colombia"
JAP_colombia.2.d: "To the Office of the Prime Minister,\n\nAs predicted, tensions in Colombia have escalated to the point of open, if limited, skirmishes in the country's north. Although the fighting has been fierce, our efforts have borne fruit as paramilitary forces from our allies in New Granada have succeeded in seizing the Alántico Department and holding it against hostile counteroffensives. This victory has provided their troops with a morale boost and has left their opposition bereft of secure supply lines, a most decisive victory for the nationalist cause in Colombia.\n\nHowever, while the opposing forces have been dealt a severe setback, our intelligence reports that the end of the conflict is not yet in sight, and we must further prepare New Granada for the ceasefire's end. The nation's terrain and the ferocity of enemy guerrillas will prove a difficult challenge for our forces and allies. Still, our advisers and contacts are confident that our victory is but an inevitability."
JAP_colombia.2.a: "A great victory, greenlight more support."

JAP_colombia.3.t: "News from Colombia"
JAP_colombia.3.d: "To the Office of the Prime Minister,\n\nAs predicted, tensions in Colombia have escalated to the point of open, if limited, skirmishes in the country's north. Despite the aid we have provided for them, New Granada's militias and mercenaries have been forced to turn back from the Alántico Department empty-handed. Between the rough terrain and heavy opposition from the enemy, their forces could not crack hostile defenses, and thus the port and the enemy's supply lines shall remain out of reach for now.\n\nBecause of this failure, we can expect our rivals to continue funneling aid to their pawns unmolested, with a more difficult challenge ahead of us. Although unfortunate, our supply lines to the New Granadan forces remain intact, and their leadership is still committed to victory over the opposition. Our advisors at home and on the ground still believe that success is well within reach and recommend we escalate our support in preparation for the ceasefire's end."
JAP_colombia.3.a: "Regrettable, but we must secure our foothold."

The bloody skirmishes along the border have relatively ceased. Although casualties were high, our allies prevailed and managed to overpower the enemy lines in a series of increasingly one sided battles. With the enemy's main force broken, Iberian volunteers and local troops set to work rooting out partisans and establishing garrisons to occupy the towns in the area. Although partisans remain an issue, it is negligible enough that we can say for sure that our side has won out in the region.\n\nThat being said, the conflict continues to escalate still, the enemy is rearming, and the partisans in the area will not give up so easily.

The enemy was able to overpower both our allies and our own volunteers, exacting heavier and heavier casualties until morale and supply forced us out of the area. Although a significant partisan presence has remained behind to cause trouble for the foe, who have managed to establish garrisons in there, their presence is not enough to truly dispute enemy control. We must face the fact that the enemy has won this fight and now fully occupies the border territories.\n\nThe situation continues to escalate regardless. We are at a significant disadvantage, but we should not let that stop us from preparing for a more intense conflict.

But it seemed that he must now shift his worries outside the land of 'order and progress.' Just as he entered his office in the Planalto, he was met with generals from all over the country, from the Amazonian jungle to the Riograndense pampas. On his table, there were at least ten different maps of Colombia, all of which seemed the same but showcased different details, even if minor.\n\n"Good evening Mr President, I hope your day was a tranquil one. Please, have a seat." said one of the generals as they pulled a chair for [BRA.GetLeader]. "Let's get on with this already, shall we?"\n\n"As you may know from the news, the illusion of Colombia's peace is about to come to an end. Capitão Salcedo's forces have been engaged in heavy combat with the Central Government for the last few days, and it's only going to get worse from each bullet that leaves their guns." - explained the general - "Once the civil war goes into full force, it's inevitable that it's going to affect the bordering regions in some way or another. Therefore it's crucial that we make sure the victors in this war are willing to be our allies."\n\n"I must recommend that we support the anti-fascists of the URC, since they-"\n\n"Those wannabe Varguists? Give me a break!" - One general yelled in protest - "We shouldn't be helping out their lot, all they want is the tyranny of the majority and mob rule! If anyone is going to help us, it's the strong, stable government in Bogotá. They've gotten rid of that Francoist bastard and are even holding elections!"\n\n"Have you forgotten what Gaitán meant to this damned continent? He was a socialist, but he created the most stable democracy in the Americas, and now his dream's under attack by the fascist horde. We should be promoting democratic governments around this continent, not supporting more despotic governments like the Argentinians do in Paraguay."\n\nThe general who had protested nodded in assent, then turned to the president with his colleague.

I am absolutely not approving this. I loved Gaitán like everyone else, but they're fools if they can't see that his followers are just as bad as the damned Varguists!" the Crow continued to caw as the generals tried to explain the same thing over and over. Minutes passed until, eventually, the crow seemed to have run out of energy, one general noticed this and took the opportunity to explain the necessity to support the Revolutionaries.\n\n"I hate those populistic socialists as much as you do, but we must be pragmatic when it comes to who we support in this continent. We don't know how Colombia could end up if we just choose to ignore it. The Americans say that the Revolutionaries hold elections in their territory, that they've maintained civilian rule this whole time in the face of the fascists..."\n\nAfter one cup of water to help his hoarse voice, the Crow chirped: "Right, well. I guess I do prefer having a Colombian Vargas on my doorstep than a Mussolini. You have my authorization, then."\n\n"Thank you, Mr. President" Said one of the generals as they left the room, leaving Lacerda to think for himself."
