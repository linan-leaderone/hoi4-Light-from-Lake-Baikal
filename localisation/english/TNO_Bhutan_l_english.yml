 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_KANWAL_SINGH_DESC: "General Kanwal Singh was a hero when it all started. Throwing himself into the line of fire, he was glad to be among the first recipients of the Sher-e-Hind, the most honourable military declaration. However, when the War of Independence against Britain ended, and it became a war against the INA's milquetoast brothers, Kanwal Singh found new opportunity. Seizing the small mountain nation of Bhutan, a British protectorate which had been split from India in 1910, he was given a promotion to General of the Indian National Army in Bhutan. However, when the war ended, Singh was assigned a new job in the army: to keep Bhutan under India's thumb. As time has gone on, General Singh has grown more and more reclusive, as threats by Bhutanese partisans increase.\n\nAlongside this, he has grown more paranoid of his cabinet and military over time, not helped by the ethnically-Bengali generals in exile in the contingent. They could be trying to wrestle control from him and take power to merely benefit themselves, or worse, be spies that support the exiled Druk Gyalpo's resistance! In Singh's eyes, everyone is out to get him, and he is the only one who can bring Bhutan to accept India's motherly love. However, only time can tell if it will be he who brings Bhutan to the fold, or if the Dragon of the Himalayas shall roar again."

 ### Ideas ###
 BHU_Transitional_Military_Occupation: "Transitional Military Occupation"
 BHU_Transitional_Military_Occupation_desc: "While Bhutan is de jure a state of the Free India Government, the truth of the matter is far more complex; as a transitional government until peace in the region can be achieved, we enjoy far more luxuries than even the average autonomous region. However, this autonomy comes at the cost of the responsibility of maintaining stability until accession to statehood."
 BHU_Transitional_Military_Occupation_tt: "§YThe tentative date for accession to statehood is §RJanuary 1st, 1974§!!§!"
 BHU_Bhotamuzh_Resistance: "Bhotamuzh Resistance"
 BHU_Bhotamuzh_Resistance_desc: "The Bhotamuzh, short for Bhotani Muzhamat, are the largest resistance organisation in Bhutan. Led by Jigme Dorji Wangchuk, it seeks a restoration of the Bhutanese throne and a constitutional monarchy. To make matters worse, they're funded by the Delhi regime, and likely America as well! Each week, reports pour in of the Bhotamuzh raiding armouries and attacking INA regiments. We must do something about this, or we will be at risk of a coup."
