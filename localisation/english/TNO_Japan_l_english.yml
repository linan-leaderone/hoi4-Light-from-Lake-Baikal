 ###LEADER DESCS###
 POLITICS_HIROYA_INO_DESC: "Ino Hiroya is not a popular man. Originally a mere representative in the Imperial Diet, Ino skillfully maneuvered his way through the byzantine affairs of Japanese politics to help overthrow Tōjō Hideki himself, and then later his political rival Kido Kōichi. But things are never so simple. To bring down such political beasts, Ino had to cut a few backroom deals. More than a few, really. And while those connections initially seemed useful, the obligations on Ino's end have piled up, and he has been forced to work for various special interests, rather than the people of Japan.\n\nIno is a firm believer in the Imperial system, and desires to keep the Emperor above most political discussion. Ino's party, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, is the sole legal party in Japan and encompasses a broad coalition of representatives with various ideologies, but can be corralled into keeping the Chrysanthemum Throne safe and secure from the rough-and-tumble politics of the Diet. However, Ino is rapidly losing control over his own party, and his departure from the office of Prime Minister seems all but inevitable.\n\nMany within the Diet who would like to see Ino ousted much in the same way he once bested Tōjō and Kido, including Kido himself, who has found ways to still remain relevant in Japanese politics. If Ino wishes for his ideals to be upheld and for his faction to survive, he must once again find his way safely through Japan's murky politics, as he has done so many times before."
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC: "From the smoldering political malaise of the Taishō era rose the phoenix of Imperial authority, His Majesty, the Holy Sovereign of Japan, Hirohito. The past four decades have seen Japan grow from a fledgling Pacific empire to the de-facto ruler of the largest ocean on Earth. At the top of it all is him, the descendent of the sun goddess Amaterasu and a proud son of Yamato.\n\nBorn April 21st 1901, Prince Hirohito was the first of the Taishō Emperor's 4 sons. Hirohito's military education hardened him and, after assuming the regency in 1921, would inspire his future rule. Hirohito would ascend to the throne in 1926 and lead his increasingly militarized empire outwards, grabbing concession in Manchuria, then all of China, and finally coming to dominate all western holdings in the Pacific.\n\nWith the end of the Great Pacific War, Japan's status as a great power was cemented. The acquisition of large sums of territory brought great riches to the empire and cemented the Emperor's divinity. The Emperor is near exclusively absent from public life, only ever communicating to his subjects through edicts over wire. As the Emperor of the Shōwa period ages, his empire grows unstable. Soon, great change will come and rattle Japan to its core. What will the people have to hold on to but His Divinity, the Emperor?"
 POLITICS_TAKAGI_SOUKICHI_DESC: "Takagi Sōkichi has two core bases of support that would, at first glance, appear to be completely unrelated: anti-establishment constitutionalists and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Few can claim such disparate demographics as Takagi can. And yet, with a little more examination, everything becomes clear.\n\nWith a distinguished service record during the Pacific War, which he was initially opposed to, Admiral Takagi has long been a prominent member of the moderate faction of the IJN. Most notable among his military career was being appointed the Commander of the Combined Fleets, and being named as the leader of the unofficial clique of Kaigun Saha, or the "Navy Left," by Gensui Admiral Inoue Shigeyoshi.\n\nLikewise, Takagi enjoys much support from constitutionalist members the Imperial Diet and activists who want to restore the constitutional normality in the Taisho Era and liberalize the economy.\n\nIn truth, Takagi's support is less stable than it looks. The IJN is only content so long as they do not have to serve under radical mad dogs like Tojo, and constitutionalists often fail to estimate their influence and is unrestrained in their hatred of the YSK establishment. If he is capable of navigating Japanese politics like he once did the waters of the Pacific, and if he implements the reforms he wishes to achieve, then Japan's future indeed looks as bright as the rising sun."
 POLITICS_KIDO_KOUICHI_DESC: "Many said that Kido Kōichi already had his chance as Prime Minister, and that he wasted it. Ascending to the office following a political coup that Kido, alongside Ino Hiroya, executed against Tōjō Hideki, Kido was initially immensely popular. This popularity stemmed not from an actual charisma or capability on Kido's part, but rather from the simple fact that he was not Tōjō.\n\nThere were only so many deals that Kido could cut with special interests before Ino gathered the Diet's approval to supplant him. When Ino too fell into this same pit, Kido returned to power. And now that he's back, the Imperial Diet is beginning to remember why they wanted him gone in the first place.\n\nPerhaps one of Kido's few advantages in these times is his close relationship with the Emperor. During the Second World War and for some time after, Kido served as Hirohito's closest advisor, and he continues to hold the utmost concern for the honor of the Chrysanthemum Throne. But with the ever increasing distance between the Emperor and the Imperial Diet, Kido may be losing his edge.\n\nFor Kido Kōichi, surviving this political turmoil means avoiding the same mistakes he made before. And while experience is a valuable thing, the past is as good a predictor of the future as any."
 POLITICS_IKEDA_MASANOSUKE_DESC: "Few in Japan thought Ikeda Masanosuke had any chance of becoming Prime Minister. But then, few see things as Ikeda see them. A conservative and staunch Inoite, Ikeda represents the best and worst political instincts of conservatives through history. Leery of radicalism and skeptical of sudden change, the new Prime Minister wishes to uphold the current status quo in Japanese politics.\n\nThis is not to say that Ikeda is blind to the many failings of the Ino era. Corruption and loss of morality have caused wide cracks into the Japanese nation. The smooth cooperation between the Zaibatsu, the Army and the government has broken down. This has lured ambitious men, schemers, opportunists and other types of nogoodniks that wish not to see a healthy Japan, but to make a fortune sifting through its ruins. Public faith in the Diet has been shaken by the ugly sight of the Yokusankai breakdown after Ino's resignation. The nobility has lost faith with their partners in the political sphere. And through all this, foreign observers sharpen their knives in anticipation of a weaker Japan. All this has to be fixed.\n\nA political scientist by formation, and a newspaper editor by trade, Ikeda has never been naive to the grime and muck found in every government's dark corners. Now, he faces the difficult task of cleaning the house he himself has lived in for a decade. His thin coalition of Inoite conservatives, liberals and independents scrutinize his every move. But if not him, then who else? Japan must be dragged out of its darkest hour since the end of the war, and Ikeda knows he's the only shield against radicalism."
 POLITICS_KAYA_OKINORI_DESC: "In the chaos of the collapse of Ino's government following the Yasuda Crisis, Kaya Okinori of the Technocrats has emerged to secure his position as Prime Minister of Japan - And has taken charge of a government in crisis that is unpopular with the public, faces a deeply divided military, and must contend with the aftershocks of the Yasuda Crisis. Each of these challenges and problems he must solve if he is to stabilize Japan.\n\nEven within the Technocrats, two factions have emerged to compete for influence and vye for his support, each with their own vision for Japan: the New Bureaucrats, headed by Fukuda Takeo, and the Reform Bureaucrats, led by Shiina Etsusaburo and Kishi Nobusuke.\n\nIt will be up to Kaya to decide whose vision to enact - and in so doing, determine the future of Japan."
 POLITICS_KAKUEI_TANAKA_DESC: "A proverb that is known to every Japanese child says, "the talented hawk hides its claws". Tanaka Kakuei, once the ascending dark horse of the Taisei Yokusankai, now the Prime Minister of Japan and always the "Shadow Shogun" of the Japanese politics, took this morale to his heart, excelling himself at the art of courtroom intrigues and dealing with the influential people. Constantly having been surrounded by massive corruption scandals for the whole duration of his career, Tanaka always succeeded to emerge unscathed from the situations that would sink a career of other, less unscrupulous, politicians, a quality which he owes to his own willingness to work hard for his ambitions, as well as his important connections to the Zaibatsu and the powerful party groups. Never being truly liked by the system he became a part of, Tanaka's rise to the heights of a Prime Minister was unforeseen and, perhaps, even somewhat unwarranted by the Japanese public, but as the initial favorites of the Yokusankai showed their inability to handle the continuing economic strife and saw their grandiose schemes shattered by the realities of the Japanese byzantine politics, it took little to reserve the empty seat and the favor of the Throne for the perfidious creature of the Zaibatsu.\n\nA beloved candidate of the Japanese patrician families, Prime Minister Tanaka pursues nothing but cementing the dominance of the Zaibatsu and breaking away with the economic dualism between Zaibatsu and Keiretsus that settled in Japan after the World War, of course, in favor of the former side. Forcing his way with the Zaibatsu money and pork barrel projects, Tanaka, however, does not forget about the pleas of a simple Japanese person and fancies himself as the man of the people. Tanaka promises a new era for Japan, the one that will provide a carefree life for Japanese workers and will double their salary in just five years - or else Tanaka will voluntarily step down from power."
 POLITICS_KONOE_FUMIMARO_DESC: "Prince Konoe Fumimaro was born into high hopes: an aristocratic upbringing in the Fujiwara clan, a prominent role in Government in diplomatic and then Diet postings, an Order of the Sacred Treasure Award given by the Emperor himself. A product of the old order, Prince Konoe was as regal as he was affable - the charm dazzled the press for a time, and some say he still shines with it. The Konoe star seemed destined for an inexorable rise as Konoe became Prime Minister in 1937, but even Konoe could not controlled the forces at work in interbellum Japanese politics. As the Marco Polo Bridge incident spiralled into one military adventure after another, the smiling Prince lost control of his own Party and Cabinet to trigger-happy militarists, and some say he still carries the old shame of his forced resignation and Long March into obscurity.\n\nSubsequent events proved his worries over the war in China right, but posterity has not been particularly kind to Konoe. Most remember him as the man who watched the sparks fly and the flames rise as Japanese sons died on foreign soil, and did nothing. Now Konoe has been appointed out of desperation by the very Party who pressured him out of his office, and age has sharpened his bitterness - but it has also cleared his sight, and his vision remains undimmed. Recent events have not changed his mind, only convinced him that the old order must be reforged. The Party that betrayed him and the Empire he lost must be woven into the ordered symphony he always wanted Japan to be. The Japanese nation was destroyed by people threatening this balance, but who better than a prince to save it? And Konoe will make it happen by any means necessary: a Fujiwara clansman will only fail once. He will not fail again."
 POLITICS_AICHI_KIICHI_DESC: "If anyone were to ask a member of the YSK to describe the current Prime Minister, Aichi Kiichi, in a single word, every last one of them, from the disorganized liberal dissidents to Takagi's left to the most insane militarists that even Kishi is leery of, would agree to use "nondescript."\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1907, Aichi developed a background in the Ministry of Finance during the Second World War and worked silently and diligently at his post. He was not exceptional except in his devotion to duty; nor for that matter was he known for much in the way of ideological convictions. In the aftermath of the Akagi Accords, he joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and was elected to the Diet under the umbrella of the conservative mainstream - otherwise he would not have been elected.\n\nDuring Aichi's service as a minister in Ino Hiroya's cabinet, he grew more and more distant from his former patrons and, indeed, all factions in the Diet - to a point where he was equally distant from all of them. This combined with the fact that he had been too uninteresting to be brought into Ino's corruption overwhelmed people's dislike of his uncharismatic nature; he was duly selected as a compromise candidate to break the immediate political deadlock.\n\nThough the Diet approved Aichi unanimously, he was nobody's first choice, not even his own (though he is mum about his actual preferences). Moves are already being made by the myriad factions in the Diet to install a more favourable candidate in his stead.\n\nAichi does not mind this. As long as he is free to return to his relatively calm existence afterwards, he does not care who takes over."
 POLITICS_HIGASHIKUNI_NARUHIKO_DESC: "Never in his eighty-odd years of life had Prince Naruhiko of Higashikuni ever thought it would come to this, but he is more than willing to rise to the occasion: in chaos, after all, there is opportunity.\n\nHigashikuni Naruhiko was born as a scion of the Fushimi-no-miya, the oldest of the cadet branches of the Imperial dynasty. From 1908 he was a career officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. In the 1920s, he went to France to study the military arts at Saint-Cyr, and gained the reputation of a hedonist, keeping a French mistress, driving fast cars, and not even coming home when one of his sons died. After his return to Japan, he was promoted to general, participating in the Sino-Japanese War and, rumour has it, partaking fully in the ruthless gas-warfare tactics and human experimentations of the Japanese Army.\n\nThe years rolled by, and Prince Higashikuni evolved into a staid senior politician, a prominent member of the royal family, and a powerful influence-holder with the Jushin. It made all the more sense, therefore, that when Japan went to hell in a handbasket, with the civilian government, the military, and the Japanese people itself all proving themselves unworthy of credibility, that the Lord Privy Seal, Kido Kōichi, would call for his assistance in seizing back power in the name of the Emperor.\n\nThe government is now back in the Emperor's hands - or, more accurately, in the hands of a set of grandees and ministers the Emperor trusts, as it was in the Meiji era. Higashikuni is now free to do whatever he deems opportune with the Japanese Empire and to make it into something that Emperor Meiji would be proud of. But one thing should be clear: this Constitutional Coup is as much a power grab as it is an aspiration to hand power back to the Emperor."
 POLITICS_MUTO_AKIRA_DESC: "All else has failed, it seems. Japan's constitutional era, which had so far endured thanks to Konoe's carefully-built foundations, is lost. The Empire, whose dominance over Asia had been all but assured, has burst into flames. And over the ashes, one man stands.\n\nMutō Akira was born in 1892, at the height of the Meiji era, in a small village in the Kumamoto prefecture, and graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1913. The talented officer rapidly climbed his way up to the top of the hierarchy, as said hierarchy welcomed him with open arms, and he soon distinguished himself in many conflicts during the 1930s and 1940s, most notably in China and the Philippines.\n\nThe thing that made Mutō stand out from his fellow generals, however, was indubitably his propension for violence. Whether in China or in the South Pacific, the general came to be known for his refusal to compromise with the enemy and for his ruthlessly efficient methods, and his talent at pacifying problematic regions made him a darling of many colonial officials. Of course, the sheer level of atrocities carried out under his command did raise a few eyebrows, but those voices quickly went silent as the Empire's Sun dawned over Pearl Harbor.\n\nAnd now, Mutō has returned. The bureaucrats and the politicians could only bicker aimlessly as the crisis worsened around them, and the military had to step in to restore order, if only as a temporary measure; what "temporary" really means is still up in the air, though, as it seems the Yokusankai belongs to the past. As for the old general, the situation doesn't differ too much from his former glories, with the only difference being that the people he has to pacify is now his own; this shall not stop him, however, as if such actions are needed for the Empire to survive, then they shall be taken.\n\nNo matter the cost."
 POLITICS_FUKUDA_TAKEO_DESC: "An outstanding rising star in the Yokusankai, Fukuda Takeo began his political career as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance during the Great East Asian War, right after graduating in law at the University of Tokyo, unlike many of his colleagues who went Manchuria to try out their theories. His work at managing Japan's finances during the war was so well received that other nations in the newly emerging Co-prosperity Sphere bloc sought his expertise to manage their own budget after the conflict destroyed much of Asia. One such governments was Wang Jinwei's China, and while he was overseeing the postwar recovery Fukuda came to a perhaps treasonous realization: if the Sphere is to survive, then Japan must invest in the industry and the infrastructure of its Asian allies, combined with more political autonomy as an exchange for their economic cooperation.\n\nHis ideas didn't find much success among the Yokusankai, but two people among the Reform Bureaucrats thought his work had its merits, namely Kishi Nobusuke and Okinori Kaya. By the time the Yasuda Crisis hit Japan's economy, Fukuda was already at work drafting recovery plans for the new government. When Kaya became Prime Minister, Fukuda fought against political corruption and sleazy politicians, gaining an image of an incorruptible man of the people. Fukuda Takeo's clique, the so-called "New Bureaucrats", started as an offshoot of the Reform Bureaucrats commonly associated with the Manchurian experiment. However, during his tenure as Kaya's Finance Minister, Fukuda began distancing himself from Kishi and his people, with the New Bureaucrats' popularity eclipsing those of other factions in the Yokusankai. Now, Fukuda leads the nation he served loyally for 30 years and the Sphere with its untapped potential. Time will tell if the Fukuda doctrine can have the same success abroad as it did have at home."
 POLITICS_SHIINA_ESTUSABURO_DESC: "Born in a small town in Iwate Prefecture, Shiina's father was the town's mayor but everything changed when his family's business went bankrupt. From that day on, Shiina put his efforts into supporting his family, working during the day and studying at night school. After this troubled period, his family's fortunes improved and, after marrying into the family of Tokyo governor Gotō Shimpei, he managed to enroll into Tokyo Imperial University, where he got a Law degree in 1923. After graduation, he entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, where he was assigned to the Engineering Bureau. It was there where he got the opportunity of traveling to Manchuria, scouted and invited by no less than Nobusuke Kishi. During his stay, he gathered data for surveys that would then make up the first five year plan of Manchukuo. To Shiina, the wilderness of northeastern China was almost like a giant test subject holding all sorts of data to be extracted in the most efficient way possible, data that industrial conglomerates would then use to exploit Manchuria.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Greater East Asian War, Shiina got back to his old job overseeing industrial logistics in Japan but this time with powerful backing from Kishi and the ambition to climb even higher. When the Tōjō Cabinet was established, Kishi returned as Minister of Commerce and Industry with Shiina as his undersecretary, where they promoted a strict war-controlled economic policy in cooperation with the military, which included the forced consolidation of many small and medium-sized enterprises. These policies made the Reform Bureaucrats clique a force to be reckoned with, but they also attracted the envy of many, and when the war ended the politicians felt that there was no more need for the harsh centralization endorsed by Shiina and Kishi, and as consequence they lost much of their influence.\n\nBut today Shiina's schemes came to fruition. With Kaya gone and every other clique in the Yokusankai made irrelevant, the stage is clear for Shiina to continue his experiments. He will transform Japan, and the Sphere as a whole, into an efficient, well-ordered machine where not a single cog will be out of place. He was just a country boy struggling to maintain his family, but Shiina managed to climb the Japanese political ladder armed only with determination, and succeeded. Perhaps he can pass down his iron will to Japan as a whole."

 ## Aleutian Crisis Events ##

 jap_aleutian.1.t: "Walking a Tightrope"
 jap_aleutian.1.d: "The eye of the storm. That was the only way Prime Minister Ino Hiroya could describe it. In the North Pacific two massive fleets were bearing down upon each other. Across Japan, from the smallest village to the Imperial Palace, the people were outraged. Yet here, in the offices of the Foreign Ministry, everything was silent and still.\n\nOn the other side of the table, Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichirō was on the phone, listening to a report on the first mediation proposal. Ino stared at him intently, straining his ears to catch any word from the shrill speaker on the other end. The lack of sleep was starting to take its toll, but he couldn't rest now. Not with so much at stake.\n\nEver since the Americans forced Captain Asoh to ground in Alaskan waters, Japan had been in the grips of a jingoistic fervor unlike anything since 1941. The Army, the Navy, and the Privy Council were all pulling Ino in different directions - it felt like half the country was telling him how to do his job. If he couldn't craft a resolution out of the flurry of furious demands everyone was making, nuclear war was a real possibility.\n\nAt last Fujiyama set the phone down. "The Mexican President has taken our side, demanding the release of our pilot and an investigation into all violations of the demilitarized zone. Nixon was... less than pleased, but Mateos held firm."\n\nIno breathed a sigh of relief. "That should be enough to satisfy the Army and Navy. If our intelligence is correct, an investigation will reveal that they violated the zone first."\n\nFujiyama's face tensed up. "Nixon surely knows this too, that's why he's being stubborn. Do you really think he'll agree to it?"\n\n"He has to, he's overplayed his hand. I only hope that he sees reason before the Army demands a formal apology from him as well.""
 jap_aleutian.1.a: "With each step forward, the rope grows taut."
 
 jap_aleutian.2.t: "The Book of the Void"
 jap_aleutian.2.d: "The doors had been shut. Beyond them, bellows of outrage and cries of perfidy. Beyond them, the Northern Pacific swarming with ships and their planes and their bombs. Beyond them, war.\n\nBut in this room, there was only a man. Fujiyama Aiichirō. He opened his eyes and let the office take shape around him. The chair supporting his weight, the desk loaded with missives and their missi- no. No, before him were only two pieces of paper and only one decision.\n\nThe first paper had been sent to Japan's ambassador to Mexico late on January 5th. A Mexican demand for a formal apology for overflying U.S. waters and the withdrawal of the fleet from the Aleutians, in exchange for the Americans' release of the imprisoned pilot. The phrases were blunt when they were not sharp, and contained not a word on Mateos' promised investigation. Not a word about Washington's nuclear-armed vessels sailing roughshod through the demilitarized waters that had kept the peace for over a decade.\n\nThe second paper had been smuggled to Japan's ambassador in a routine economic report by an industrial minister, Salinas, an hour ago. The hastily written kanji claimed that the shocking breach of the 5th was on the sole initiative of Mateos' second-in-command, Ordaz. Claimed that Mateos had no role in the travesty, and would negotiate. Begged Tokyo to remain in the talks.\n\nThe only decision was the heaviest, most tangible thing in that barren expanse. Mateos was landing at Haneda in two hours. Would the talks go on? Would Fujiyama risk what little shreds of his authority remained after the bombshell of the 5th, holding back the baying, snarling hounds of war, on the scratchy penmanship of some intriguing Mexican junior minister? Could he, even, after the collision over Attu?\n\nFor one last shot at peace, he must."

 jap_aleutian.3.t: "Urashima"
 jap_aleutian.3.d: "Over the past week, the lines on the faces of Ino Hiroya and Fujiyama Aiichirō had deepened, set. The lines on the map, the thin barriers between the Empire and the Americans, between peace and the war to end all wars, had smudged and faded. Over the month since Captain Asoh was forced down into the Pacific waves, the Prime and Foreign Ministers had each lived a nasty, brutish and short lifetime.\n\nJudging from appearances, so had Mexico's President Mateos. The now-haggard mediator in front of the duo could have been a mirror - dark-mooned eyes, pallid skin, suit stained with a full day's sweat. But this trio of wrecked figures kept their exhausted eyes transfixed on the document in front of them as their translators finalized the terms that would bring two superpowers back from the brink of war.\n\nOne, a staged withdrawal of both fleets from the Aleutian Island chain. Two, the immediate release of Captain Asoh. Three, however, was absent. The investigation into treaty violations, Nixon's DMZ violations, had been stripped away by the declaration issued by Mateos' insubordinate second on the 5th. Once that concession had been made, Washington would not relinquish it. In its place, a pale shadow - freedom for twelve Japanese intelligence assets in exchange for only four Americans.\n\nTwo solemn nods - and Mateos was dismissed. It was Fujiyama that spoke first, "To let such injustice pass is a gift only to warmongers and villains. But after Kiska..."\n\nIno, throat dry and head throbbing, replied only, "We will brief the Cabinet. We will inform the Emperor. There was no other way.""

 ## Old Hawaii Crisis Loc, now Hidden ##
 jap.1.t: "Ino-Nixon Negotiation"
 jap.1.d: "The scene is a nondescript office in the Kantei. It is four in the morning, and everyone is asleep except for Prime Minister Ino Hiroya and Japanese Provisional Ambassador to the United States, Tanzan Ishibashi. The two men have been in the office for seventy-two hours as of present, following the emergency radar contacts detected off Hawaii three days ago. Families all across Japan and the United States are glued to their seats. Those who aren't are already in their nuclear bunkers and hideouts. It was deemed so, until the telephone rang - it could only mean one thing.\n\nThe first ring echoes.\n\nThen the second. In the silence, the heartbeats of both men are clearly audible.\n\nThe third. Follow the protocol, Ishibashi. Follow the protocol.\n\nThe fourth. Ishibashi picks up the phone. "Hello, Ambassador. It's President Richard Nixon on the line. We need to talk."\n\nAt present, two carrier groups are staring each other down 40 kilometres east of Oahu. One wrong move, one provoked reaction, and it's the end of the world. Deep beneath the waves are nuclear submarines - the pinnacle of nuclear technology, able to end the entirety of Osaka or San Francisco in a single salvo. It's darkly humorous how the fate of the world hangs in the balance through the actions of two men, one of which is on the verge of collapsing after a three-day run of unceasing work. In his stilted, and weary English, Tanzan Ishibashi said the words that would change the course of history forever.\n\n"President Nixon, the Dai-Nippon Teikoku is willing to negotiate its position. For the sake of our future, and yours.""
 jap.1.a: "We are spared, for now."
 
 jap.2.t: "Ino's Speech"
 jap.2.d: "The air was heavy with tension and crackling static. Across Japan's vast urban sprawls, in Manchuria's great industrial centers, all the way to the agrarian villages in Southern China, over a hundred million radios and TVs crackled to life. In the offices of Guangdong, large screens and loudspeakers buzzed as the crystalline notes of Kimigayo washed over all of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. A calm voice announced, in a dozen languages simultaneously, that a speech from His Excellency the Prime Minister of Japan would replace regular programming for the day.\n\nThose fortunate enough to have a screen in front of them watched as the last notes of the imperial anthem faded away and the red and white logo of the Co-Prosperity Sphere was replaced by the Prime Minister's office. Ino Hiroya, arguably one of the most powerful men in the whole world, sat behind a large and uncluttered desk in his ordered, and suitably magniloquent office. The Prime Minister had a most uncharacteristic expression of relief, mouth curved in a small, dignified smile. Over a billion people held their breath as he began speaking in the measured tone befitting his office.\n\n"People of Japan, honored allies, citizens and subjects of our Great Asian family, I come to you bearing news of a great victory. Not the one we are all used to, one of marching soldiers and rolling tanks, but no less great - a victory of peace." The Prime Minister pauses for a second.\n\n"As of yesterday, an official agreement exists, binding the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Organization of Free Nations to the mutual respect of their marine boundaries and security interests. The specter of nuclear war that has hung over us all in the last few weeks is dispelled..." The Prime Minister kept talking, but few listened after that. Roars of jubilation, silent thanks, and the myriad sounds of a billion lives returning to their normal rhythm after weeks of panic and uncertainty drowned out the Prime Minister's eloquium. For a brief moment, all of East Asia truly came together in celebration, and America with them, as President Nixon made a speech mirroring his Japanese counterpart.\n\nOf course, not all were happy. Some had wished for a war, some had pushed for a war, and for some the notion of ascending Japan negotiating with the moribund United States rankled deeply. Doubtlessly, such feelings find an echo on the other side of the Pacific as well. But for now, peace has prevailed."
 jap.2.a: "Is this a true Tennōzan?"

 jap.3.t: "Across the Ocean"
 jap.3.d: "Across the ocean lies the greatest threat to Japan's sovereignty and mastery of the Pacific - the United States of America. Humbled seventeen years ago through our superior command of the oceans, the once-indefatigable foe of Pan-Asianism lies slain - and our mark on them, the treaty ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles are daily reminders of such. The Tokumusoukan's branch in the West Coast, W Kikan have inserted their proxies well into the confines of American society, and have offered us an interesting insight into the attitudes of the Americans towards Japan.\n\nRichard Nixon's Republican-Democratic Coalition was an ideological and practical failure, but they still remain the voice of reason and moderation within American politics. Famously, Democratic President Dwight D. Eisenhower broached the peace on the Pacific by illegitimately allowing Hawaii's accession to the Union several years ago, as well as tearing up the Treaty of San Francisco. Though, W Kikan has determined that the Republican-Democratic establishment is the lesser of two evils, especially compared to their main electoral rivals.\n\nFar more dangerous is the National Progressive Pact, an unholy union of socialist agitators and their Southern allies united in the purpose of restoring American hegemony over the Pacific Ocean and risking war with the Japanese Empire. While relatively marginal in terms of electoral presence, W Kikan has determined that the NPP could rise to eminence over the next few years, a strong cause for concern as we would have to ensure our rightful territory in Hawaii and the Eastern Pacific is secure."
 jap.3.a: "Two sides of the same coin."
 
 ## Rest of Loc ##
 
 jap.100.t: "Shōwa no Hi"
 jap.100.d: "Rejoice and cheer carried through the streets of the Empire of Japan in celebration of the birthday of Emperor Shōwa. His Imperial Majesty's new year of life is commemorated by all from Taiwan to Hokkaidō in a festival honoring the age of peace, fraternity, and cooperation Japan and its Asian brothers now live in.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Shōwa, the empire had grown in strength and in size to international superpower-status; now, no one dares challenge Japan like they did before the rule of His Imperial Majesty. It was under His rule that the empire had won against imperialism in the Greater East Asia War, and under His rule that the mighty Co-Prosperity Sphere was founded to preserve this sacred peace. Millions gather to observe the holiday in public or at home to wish good health upon the Emperor, so that his prosperous and just rule may continue long into the future."
 jap.100.a: "Tennōheika Banzai!"
 
 jap.102.t: "Mighty Atom"
 jap.102.d: "Every Tuesday, millions of boys and girls across Japan gather in front of television sets in order to peer into another world. The world they glimpse through those hazy screens is a brighter one, where war is absent and wondrous technologies ease the burdens of mankind. One such technology is robotics, and one such robot is Atom.\n\nMighty Atom is the creation of the master cartoonist Osamu Tezuka, who has been crafting comics staring the boy robot since 1952. Built to replace a scientist's dead son, Atom was discarded by his father and forced to survive on his own. But despite this cruel treatment and despite his artificial nature, Atom is defined by his kindness and his humanity. Though his heart beats with the awesome power of nuclear energy, he rarely resorts to violence. He lends aid to the distressed and stands up to the wicked.\n\nThough the comic had been popular, the show (produced by Tezuka himself) is the first animated television series produced in Japan, and it made Atom known from Nagasaki to Hokkaidō. At its height, Mighty Atom was watched by over forty percent of Japanese households that own a television.\n\nThe Home Ministry has even partnered with Tezuka to translate Mighty Atom for audiences across the Sphere so that they can admire this new form of art. But it remains to be seen if the partnership will hold, since Mighty Atom is far from the triumphalist propaganda the Ministry tends to produce. Though full of action and adventure, Atom's world is a kinder one that our own. One worth striving for."
 jap.102.a: "The show is a welcome respite from these trying times."

 jap.106.t: "Incident F17-238"
 jap.106.d: "In the hot and sweaty mines that have fallen into disrepair under IJA administration in Northern Choson, dirty-faced laborers dug deep into the earth in search of magnesite ores to be used in manufacturing on the Home Islands, or to be packaged and shipped across the Sphere for other domestic consumption. The clinks and clanks of pickaxes echoed throughout the mazes of mineshafts and out of the quarry in the industrial zone of the northeastern mountains.\n\nA group of miners hundreds of meters below the earth's surface had discovered a vein of gold ore whilst dragging their heavy feet down the claustrophobic mineshaft tunnels, and were thrilled with joy at the thought of their riches. Being so far deep underground, any officer or administrator watching over them would be distracted for long enough so that they could smuggle some of the pure gold down their deep pockets or socks.\n\nThey clambered over each other, shoving one another to reach the shining gold mineral, until one of the poor miners was thrown against a particularly weak metal beam. A great creaking snap sounded down the mineshaft, and in mere seconds the tunnel began to collapse in on itself, crushing the laborers below the earth's surface. A mighty tumble shook the earth that drowned out the screams of those trapped underneath, but the administrators above were left largely confused about the source of the thud from their positions watching over the quarry."
 jap.106.a: "Buried treasure?"

 jap.107.t: "The NHK"
 jap.107.d: "The NHK is Japan's prime state-owned broadcasting corporation, and enjoys a near-total dominance of Japanese media distribution and broadcasting. From radio to television, from soap operas to sports broadcasting, the NHK is almost eponymous with the very idea of radio and television to the average Japanese - even more so following its deregulation in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nOf note, the NHK's chief executives have recently declared an expansion plan to further its broadcasting capabilities across the Sphere. An ambitious plan, the NHK's official declaration enshrined the need to "project and share the cultural values and harmony of Japan" all across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, as well as to "promote the ideals of Pan-Asianism".\n\nThe expansion plan was met with great approval from the Japanese populace at home and abroad - finally, Japanese people can also view the wonders of the Sphere from their own homes, such as viewing the Indonesian Football League, as well as the exploits of budding adventurer Naomi Uemura - recently heralded as being the youngest Japanese individual to hike in the far reaches of Tibet.\n\nNaturally, one only needs to dig a small distance below the surface to realise that the NHK's expansion abroad is merely another tool to extend Japanese hegemony even to the cultural sphere. Japanese programs receive 5 times the broadcasting hours as native-language programs, and all important communications such as news broadcasts are entirely in Japanese.\n\n" 
 jap.107.a: "Japanese culture is entering a golden age."

 jap.109.t: "Akira Kurosawa Releases 'Sanjuro'"
 jap.109.d: "One of Japan's most eminent filmmakers, Akira Kurosawa has released his most recent opus - the jidaigeki film titled "Sanjuro". A sequel to "Yojimbo", released the previous year, Sanjuro stars Kurosawa's frequent collaborator Toshiro Mifune, and is based off Shugoru Yamamoto's short story "Hibi hei-an". Critics have appreciated the thematic shift from "Yojimbo", as Sanjuro is now set in a fortress town instead of a far-flung backwater, which many have panned for being too Western-influenced. Rumours following the production of Yojimbo include Kurosawa being threatened by the Tokkō and figures close to the military, but there has not been any concrete proof of such.\n\nBy far and wide, critics have lauded the film, with many praising the perfectly synergised mix of comedy, action and adventure. On the technical end, many have also praised the cinematography of the film - revolutionary for the time, as well as Mifune's incredible performance. The film has also outsold Yojimbo in Japanese theatres - another milestone broken by Kurosawa.\n\nRumour has it that Kurosawa has already begun production on his next film, entitled "Akahige". While he has confirmed it as being inspired by another one of Shugoru Yamamoto's short stories, rumours that he has considered Fyodor Dostoyevsky's work as another source of inspiration are still unfounded." 
 jap.109.a: "Japanese culture is entering a golden age."

 jap.113.t: "Sukiyaki"
 jap.113.d: "Kyu Sakamoto has, almost overnight, become one of the most recognizable figures in Japan. At least, his voice has. His new song, Ue o Muite Arukō (I Look Up as I Walk), now plays on radios all across the nation - a whole citizenry enraptured by the smooth timbre of his voice and the gentle sadness of the lyrics. It's a song of lost love, but not a mournful one; full of regret and hope in equal measure.\n\nThe song's appeal has not been constrained by national borders. It was popularized across the Sphere as part of the Home Ministry's push to spread contemporary Japanese culture among its allies. It even became popular within the United States, despite their government's hostility to Japanese exports of all kinds. In Anglophone countries the song was renamed Sukiyaki, after the beef hot-pot dish, in an attempt to make the title shorter and more recognizably Japanese.\n\nThe bright beauty of the song speaks to people from Tokyo to Washington, reminds them that despite their differences, they all know the pain of longing and the pale ache of lost love."
 jap.113.a: "Happiness lies beyond the clouds."

 jap.116.t: "The 1963 Tohoku Winters"
 jap.116.d: "Tohoku had always been one of the hardest-hit regions in Japan when it comes to snowfall and winter - but this year, snowfall in the frigid northern region has hit harder than usual. In particular, Aomori prefecture has received record-breaking snowfalls exceeding 1200 centimetres, with a depth exceeding 150 centimetres. All across Japan, individual charity initiatives through word of mouth, religious organisations as well as political associations went on a charity offensive - calling for snowfall relief equipment and necessity donations.\n\nThe prefectural government, for all intents and purposes, seems to be overwhelmed by the natural disaster that has fallen upon Aomori. We've received a barrage of phone calls and telegrams from the prefecture, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications, in charge of Japan's meteorological research has called upon the counsel of the Prime Minister.\n\nWhen snowfall hits, standard excavation and recovery vehicles are used - tractors, snow ploughs as well as civilian volunteers who dig through the snow with shovels. This is standard operating procedure for the government, but the central government would take several days to mobilise the proper equipment for the task. Of note however, is a proposal from Aomori's regional military commander - a call to mobilise the prefecture's reserve units and clear the snow with military hardware, but we should heavily consider the consequences of such a call."
 jap.116.a: "Don't be silly."
 jap.116.b: "Maybe the boy's got a bright idea."

 jap.117.t: "Josetsu"
 jap.117.d: "Kenzou was no stranger to heavy snow, but even so, it was nothing compared to the snowfall he was experiencing now in Aomori. He shriveled miserably as the wind brazenly grazed his face. Snow pelted him, carpeting his thick jacket and pants. As Kenzou exhaled, his breath instantly turned to mist in front of him, and even while wearing gloves, his fingers were growing numb and losing sensation. He had no choice however, but to trudge on.\n\nKenzou clutched his spade tightly as he stared at the large snowy mound in front of him. It was tall, reaching up to his chest. He tapped it lightly, to which it did not budge at the slightest. Gritting his teeth, Kenzou moved his shovel to and fro as pieces of ice and dirt brushed his face. Several minutes later, the once towering pile of snow lay in pieces by his feet. Smirking weakly, Kenzou leaned against a nearby wall to recover. Half of his strength was exhausted on that one mound, what more the rest? As Kenzou tried to catch his breath, a young lady walked up to him, carrying some hot water. "Here." she said, passing a cup to Kenzou. "You'll need it. You've got a tough job ahead of you, but you're doing well. Keep it up." remarked the girl as she twirled around to head back.\n\n"Th- Thank you!" replied Kenzou sheepishly. He was unsure if the lady heard his reply, but it didn't matter now. Sipping on the water, Kenzou felt its warmth spreading throughout his body, his sense of touch returning as it loosened his frozen joints. He laughed mildly, and grabbed his shovel once more. Their work was far from finished."
 jap.117.a: "Marching in the snow, stepping on ice."

 jap.118.t: "A Directive"
 jap.118.d: "With recent research into equipment tests and modernization, the government has asked the IJA to begin conducting tests on new equipment developed in arms factories across the empire. Quotas had to be fulfilled, and adaptations of the Type 120 flamethrower model were in the testing phase as new weapons were being developed for IJA units across the Sphere. However, now that the levels of snow were reaching extraordinary levels, the government had taken interest in using the weapons to combat the elements.\n\nA soldier from a local garrison in northern Japan had volunteered to test the equipment under the supervision of scientific examiners from Tokyo, and he gallantly sprung into action to play with the destructive weapon. Half a dozen of his squad members cheered him on, whilst the scientists remained silent in anticipation of the weapon's successes against targets some distance away. The soldier rolled back his burdened shoulders and took a wide stance, before bracing himself for a fiery inferno spewing out of his equipment."
 jap.118.a: "Ready when you are, soldier!"

 jap.119.t: "A Test Fire"
 jap.119.d: "With a few clicks and sparks of a nozzle, streams of flames and fires roared out into the debris, scorching the targets and melting the metal frames they were mounted upon. The troops stood behind cover cheered, impressed and amazed by the blazes incinerating the makeshift targets across the field.\n\nThey had gathered on request of their officers to test out the newly developed flamethrower models for military use, and their experiments had proved successful. With every blast of the nozzle, bursts of fiery inferno spewed from the tanks mounted on the soldier's back and over twenty meters ahead of him. The air around the observers grew thicker and a feverish blush flushed through their sweaty bodies every time the trigger was pulled to cremate the targets. Examiners ticked off checklists and recorded video evidence of the experiment's success whilst squad members heckled cheers of approval to the troop testing out the weapon, both thrilled to see the potential ravaging of war.\n\nThe geared-up soldier glanced back at the observing troops and officers with a smile, signalling his approval and joy with a firm thumbs-up, before reinforcing his stance to blast more of the blazing streams across the fields to scorch the grass and blacken the targets."
 jap.119.a: "A success! Now, to the snow."

 jap.120.t: "The Wild Ones"
 jap.120.d: "Midnight, Shinjuku. The chilly winds snake through the giant Odakyū department stores. But at night, the glitzy shopping and finance district turns into something else entirely. Those who cower during the day crawl out of their comfort zones at night, and "Aka" Nakajima is no different. Lighting a cigarette, Aka heaves and leans back into his precious Midori.\n\nBut Midori is no schoolmate, neither is she a courtesan. Midori moans louder than any girlfriend Aka's had, and Aka could ride her for hours, or as much as he pleases.\n\nAll there is now is silence, until the familiar hums of other engines come within his earshot. The three-rev roar was familiar - it was Ryu and the boys from Setagaya. Coolly taking another drag from his cigarette, Aka gestures warmly to the older man.\n\n"How's that scar treating you, you magnificent Mongol-slayer!"\n\n"Quit it kid, you don't know anything 'till you've been in the shit." replied Ryu dryly.\n\nAka zips up his boilersuit and puts out his cigarette, before his hachimaki around his forehead. A sign of rebellion against the state establishment, bikers like Aka take signs of patriotism and own it for themselves.\n\n"Alright old man, so where am I takin' Midori tonight?"\n\n"Out to the ports, other side of Tokyo. If we get there by 2, why not ride around in Saitama for a bit?"\n\nAka, Ryu and three other bikers turn tail, rev their engines and ride off into the night. Several metres behind them, a seemingly unoccupied Toyota switches on its headlamps. Inside the car are two plain clothes officers, silently watching Aka and the bikers for a while now."
 jap.120.a: "The flame of youth is often hard to extinguish."

 jap.121.t: "The Three Sacred Treasures: Electronics"
 jap.121.d: "Of all the nations stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Empire of Japan carries the torch of scientific advancement to guide the liberated younger brothers of Asia into the future. The mighty nation wields great scientific and educational achievements, from the development of ore-refining mineral extraction technologies, to the mass-production of modern medical and surgical equipment, and continues to use this technological grace to develop the younger nations surrounding it.\n\nLeading from Tokyo, advancements in the fields of manufacturing, computing, and machinery have developed a culture of innovation and determination to modernize the economy of the empire. The improvement and refining of technologies from the Greater East Asia War, as well as the progress with new feats of research in the years since, have prided Japan as the leader of electronic and technological development in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and among one of the greatest competitors internationally.\n\nMoreover, advancements in military engineering since the Greater East Asia War have improved Japanese ability to defend the Sphere from foreign incursion; Tokyo's arsenal consists of a multitude of modern arms from colossal ships with some of the most advanced heavy weapon systems in the world, to small arms meticulously calibrated to withstand the harshest of climates. Furthermore, the Japanese arsenal of ICBMs and modern nuclear warheads stand as testimony to the empire's determination to defend its territory and support the brother nations of Asia in the face of foreign aggression and expansion."
 jap.121.a: "Modernization has always been important to Japan."

 jap.123.t: "Urajio Brawl"
 jap.123.d: "Recent reports of rioting in villages on the outskirts of Urajio have flocked in from news agencies following disagreements between settler inhabitants of Outer Manchuria and Russian natives. What began as a series of disputes over rights to land in the region has since escalated into violent outbursts of chaos that now ravage small sections of the countryside in a handful of towns just north of the city. Police are reporting details of 'revenge killings' against settler inhabitants, many of whom are Japanese citizens.\n\nThe local garrisons have been requested by the Outer Manchurian authorities to help control and the local police commissioner has put out a statement, regarding the perpetrators as "No better than the anarchists of the north." These comments follow the uncovering of a particularly brutal scene in which elderly veterans of the Greater East Asia War had been murdered in the street.\n\nThe recent violence and historic tensions between settlers and natives of Outer Manchuria can find its origins in issues of social and economic disparity, but local governments insist that the disputes are the fault of simple miscommunication gone wrong. However, many are skeptical of these statements, and defame them as methods to inoculate the Russians from blame in their own barbarism against the Japanese."
 jap.123.a: "Violence has always been their way..."
 
 jap.131.t: "Opening of the Japan-Korea Tunnel"
 jap.131.d: "The long-awaited Japan-Korea Tunnel was finally opened today, after over fifteen years of construction. The initial Shinkansen project was extended to go into Korea, with plans for extension into Manchuria at a later date, replacing some, if not all, shipping between the Manchuria and Japan. Built on wide gauges, the tunnel include 3 rail lines, one for freight transport, one for passenger traffic and one mixed line. Earlier, transit between Fuzan and Fukuoka was done through the ferry, an expensive and long lasting affair, with its 13 hours duration. The new tunnel cuts this down to a meager 4 hours. Truly a great day for Japan, Korea and Asia, this is the future!"
 jap.131.a: "A concrete symbol of East Asian unity!"

 jap.132.t: "The Importance of Manchurian Steel"
 jap.132.d: "Manchuria had been a prized possession of Japan for many decades now. The vast tonnes of steel located in said Northeastern region of China had become the cornerstone stock for the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere. Iron would be mined from the earth in huge quantities and then brought to the cities in the south to be smelted and processed. From there, the steel would be shipped across the rest of the Sphere. Day after day, week after week, the demand for Manchurian steel never ceased. In fact, it only seemed to grow more insistent by the hour. Steel was a pillar upon which nearly every part of modern existence was built.\n\nWith Manchuria having no real competition in terms of steel production, it was vital to ensure that all was well with the economy there. Should it fall behind, then the precarious web of supply and demand could easily start to unravel. The local Manchurian government was required to make regular and particularly detailed reports into the financial situation of the steel industry.\n\nWhile the steel was still in Manchuria, it was kept closely guarded throughout its entire journey. It was not uncommon for the military to directly oversee the transportation of some shipments, even going as far as to station soldiers onboard along with the occasional Navy warship. It became something of a common joke to claim that stealing state secrets was easier than running off with a single steel bar."
 jap.132.a: "The time for another report soon approaches."

 jap.133.t: "The Manchurian Economic Report"
 jap.133.d: "Manchuria was to be the first among the members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to produce their report on the economic situation in their territory. The state of Mancukuo had been under the management of its Prime Minister, Ruan Zhenduo for some decades now. Through ruthless and deeply cold methods, his state had turned the northern reaches of China into a giant industrial zone. Steel was the most prized resource. Its practicality and ubiquity made it desired by virtually everyone. Ruan had therefore made protecting this vital business a key goal. Although his style of governance had garnered him a reputation for cruelty, the results he produced were enough to stop the government in Tokyo from caring too much. Now, it was time to once again confirm his efforts in Manchukuo were paying off.\n\nFor a good while, the Manchurian economy had steadily chugged along, despite the situation outside of the major cities. Rural life continued in the same way as it had for a good deal of time, despite the induction of modern equipment on some of the larger farms. The Steel industry continued to perform well, although this was to be expected. Despite this, the slow pace of development had become an increasingly pressing issue for Tokyo. In recent years, they had increased their demands for further expansion and growth. Ruan, not one to back down, was fully prepared to ignore his supposed superior's request.\n\nYet he could also see the possible benefits of making certain minor adjustments to his own report. The benefits of making more inroads with political circles on the Home Islands was never to be overstated. It would also finally release Ruan from some of Prime Minister Ino's infeasible demands. With his choices in mind, Ruan set out to write the report."
 jap.133.a: "We see no reason to be dishonest."
 jap.133.b: "Make some adjustments, it's all for a good cause."

 jap.134.t: "Manchuria Reports Adequate Growth"
 jap.134.d: "First of the states belonging to the Co-Prosperity Sphere to make their economic report was Manchukuo. For more than three decades now, Manchukuo had been making these reports, with which it had created a timeline of varying economic success over the years. For the past few years, the economy had remained mostly stable, which the state's Prime Minister, Ruan Zhenduo had largely been accredited for. Now that said first minister had completed the report, it was on its way to Tokyo. First to receive the documents was Prime Minister Ino, who would then pass it on to the Imperial Diet, as well as the Emperor if he so desired to read it. Having finally received the report, Ino began to read over the documents that were contained within the dossier. Written across three pages in Ruan's typically droll fashion, was an otherwise rather standard report. The agrarian sections of the economy were still the largest, although industrial sectors were slowly beginning to creep up to their size. Steel, the prized resources of Manchukuo continued to be mined in exorbitant quantities, just about enough to keep up with the demands of the Sphere.\n\nIno finished reading. The situation in Manchukuo was perfectly satisfactory and consistent with Ruan's previous efforts. The Prime Minister could not but feel somewhat disappointed though, regarding the consistency of small progress as a sign of incapability. He would have to mention it to Ruan next time they spoke."
 jap.134.a: "Still, good enough."

 jap.135.t: "Manchuria Reports Exceptional Growth"
 jap.135.d: "The First of Many Economic Reports was due to arrive at the Prime Minister's office today. As was by this point traditional, the first report came from Manchukuo. The puppet State in Northern China had been governed by Ruan Zhenduo for some time. Ruan praised his brutal methods, which he considered the key to his success. Prime Minister Ino was in truth disinterested in the matter of who was responsible or how they had managed it. Only the contents of the report mattered to him. After receiving the report, which had been delivered to his residence directly from the airport, Ino began to read. Three documents were stored in the dossier that had arrived on Ino's desk, with the first paper entitled: "The Economic Situation of the State of Manchukuo". Written in Ruan's surprisingly droll fashion, the three papers detailed remarkable and rapid growth in the Manchurian economy. The Steel industry, previously struggling to keep up with the demands, was now producing the necessary supply at a comfortable rate. The industrial sector was beginning to expand as well. It appeared that in a few years, it would overtake the agrarian sector, once Manchukuo's only source of revenue. After years of slow progress, it appeared as if the Manchurian economy was seeing a boom."
 jap.135.a: "Ruan has that job for a reason."

 jap.136.t: "The Center of the Sphere's Workforce"
 jap.136.d: "China, with its large size and population made for the perfect place for industrial and agricultural development. Although already the second largest economy in the Sphere, China's true economic potential was as yet untapped. For this reason, much had been invested by both Japan itself and the local Chinese government to modernize the extensive areas of land available for use. It was a popular goal indeed, as most Japanese and Chinese politicians wished to see it completed as soon as possible.\n\nChina already provided the absolute majority of workers for the entire Sphere, providing Japan's power bloc with everything from weaponry to everyday electronics. These factories were owned by Japanese companies, using them to produce ubiquitous yet simple goods for maximum profit. The coastal cities had expanded greatly over the decades, but it was still the agrarian countryside that made up the largest part of the Chinese economy. Most of the Sphere's food supply came from China, with most of the inland country still being used for aiding this purpose. It was the manner in which farming had conducted that had changed somewhat, however. Where rural communities had once sustained their way of life through farming, corporations now controlled vast areas of land, using it to cultivate their produce on the widest possible scale. Entire villages could be employed by the same company, all working to produce the same foodstuff.\n\nLabor was kept cheap through the disposability of individual workers, who could be easily replaced by one of ten who were desperate for work. The ratio of the system meant that there was seemingly always room for expansion, always more opportunity to open more factories or to expand the farmlands. It was becoming increasingly common for most Sphere-based companies to centre their centres of production in China. Here, as the CEOs put it, they could operate freely and without the nuisance of regulation that they faced back home. Indeed, they made use of China's difficult position to the very fullest."
 jap.136.a: "A difficult situation, indeed..."

 jap.137.t: "The Chinese Economic Report"
 jap.137.d: "For all the steps that Japan and the National Government had taken to improve the Chinese economy, there was still a long way to go before it could become the economic power that the Sphere demanded it be. Although the coastal cities had come a long way from the war-torn remnants of the end of the Sino-Japanese war, most larger settlements were still in the same condition as they had been for much of the twentieth century. Agriculture was still the dominant part of the economy, thanks to the largely undeveloped parts of the countryside. Rural life had changed somewhat. A great number of farms had been consolidated into the holdings of a handful of companies. Other communities had survived mostly untouched, left to carry out their lives in near isolation, with only occasional contact from regional authorities to ensure that their presence was still felt. The progression of ending agrarian economic dominance was slow going. It would take many years until China could be considered a nation with a modern economy. Cities would require far more investment. The countryside needed it more so, in order to even make the land useful for the industrial sector. It was now time for the Chinese President to make his report on the state of the economy. An objective and transparent report was the obvious answer, although that carried the inevitable consequences of Japan's stern disapproval. Fear of disappointment aside, Tokyo was not the most astute of masters. They were unlikely to notice a few slight alterations to the report. Regardless, the President would need to make his decision without delay."
 jap.137.a: "Inflate the numbers, it's for our own good."
 jap.137.b: "No need to lie."

 jap.138.t: "China Reports Positive Economic Growth"
 jap.138.d: "The Economic Report from the Republic of China was due. Once again, Prime Minister Ino awaited its arrival. The Chinese economy had always been a significant issue for Japan since its integration into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. China had served as the breadbasket of the bloc, providing vast quantities of food to each member state. Yet even this was not enough. China's vast area, population and resources made it a perfect location to build a massive industrial hub. This was the grand project that Ino, and his predecessors desired to see completed. The Prime Minister hoped that the economic report would remind the Chinese government how pressing this matter was. With the dossier now on his desk, Ino began to pour over its contents.\n\nThe Prime Minister had expected to see some progress towards industrial development, he had demanded it after all, but the report suggested that China was well on its way towards industrialisation. After many years of difficult progression, it seemed that China had just about entered a new phase of modernization. Although the industrial sector was beginning to grow larger, agriculture too had experienced a massive leap in output. The Prime Minister was pleased to see that his message had finally been properly understood. The path was open for China, and in Ino's mind, he had showed them the way."
 jap.138.a: "China grows ever more valuable."

 jap.139.t: "The Chinese Economy Continues to Struggle"
 jap.139.d: "The Republic of China was due to send in their economic report. Waiting for its arrival, Prime Minister Ino considered the situation in the breadbasket of the Sphere, to better understand the documents he was soon going to read. China's current value was in its ability to produce huge amounts of food that was needed in every part of the Sphere. Despite this important purpose and its status as the second largest economy of the Sphere, it was industrial expansion that was now the focus of both Nanjing and Tokyo. Intentions aside, industrialization had been slow going. Ino, like his predecessors, had insisted that the Chinese government focus their efforts on this purpose. As the dossier was placed on his desk, the Prime Minister hoped that his demanding tone had finally paid off.\n\nIno's urgently rapid reading quickly made him realise that his methods were futile. As he had in previous years, he felt a mixture of anger and disappointment. China had failed him once again. Industrialization was not in full swing, with some very unimpressive movement towards that goal. The agrarian sector of the economy had not changed radically either. The introduction of modern farming equipment and methods had done little to help ramp up production. Only some of the very largest farms had truly begun to modernize. Only they could handle the dramatic shift between the old and the new ways so far. The Prime Minister, having finished reading, was now focused on finding an appropriate response to send to Nanjing."
 jap.139.a: "We make our demands clearer."

 jap.140.t: "Bengali Textiles"
 jap.140.d: "Azad Hind had always been a useful contributor to the economy of the Sphere. Although not quite the same size as its rival government to the west, Bose had attempted to make the most of his territory. Modernisation had always been a key goal of his and now the cities and farmlands of East India exported much of their products and produce to the Co-Prosperity Sphere market.\n\nBengal in particular created many goods considered highly sought-after, most notably, the region's renowned textile work. Ever since the days of the Roman Empire, these fine works of handicraft had been sought after across the world. British rule in India had only increased the worldwide demand for Bengali textiles. Manufacturing increased to new heights, as new machinery was brought in to increase the amount of textiles produced.\n\nAlthough now independent from British rule, not much had changed in the way of demand for textiles. The exportation of these goods was now a way to sustain the economy of an independent, if somewhat inconsistently recognised nation. Their popularity in Japan and the wider Sphere, ensured that demand for Bengali textiles never seemed to drop. Yet the situation regarding the rest of the Sphere's economy troubled many. Despite the efforts of Subhas Chandra Bose to increase industrialisation, the overwhelming majority of land in Free India was still being used for agriculture. The crops that were produced were needed for feeding the population and could therefore not contribute much to the economy. It was for this reason that the textile industry was so fiercely protected. Should the trend of agrarianism not be ended, the collapse of one industry could deal significant damage to Azad Hind for years to come."
 jap.140.a: "Now double your efforts."

 jap.141.t: "The Azad Hind Economic Report"
 jap.141.d: "As per usual, the Japanese government had sent for their annual economic report. These were expected of most nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Azad Hind government was by no means exempt. The Free Indian economy was a vital source of revenue and goods for Japan, and it was therefore their concern to make sure that all was well with their westernmost ally. Beyond asking for the report to be carried out, it was up to the Azad Hind government themselves to fill in the details. As had been the case with every other time that this had been done, there were two paths ahead detailing how to handle the situation. Firstly there was the choice to simply report the situation as it truly was. Azad Hind, although rather developed despite its short existence, was not exactly a major financial center. Bose had attempted a number of economic plans over the decades, which seemed to only really produce mixed results. Much of the economy was still agrarian, with only some cities acting as significant industrial bases.\n\nOf course, this was all bad news that Tokyo did not perhaps not need to hear. The Free Indian government was well within its power to emburse certain parts of the report. Would it truly matter if certain numbers were increased and mentions of certain fields were replaced with references to new factories, if only to make the Japanese content? To Netaji Bose, it seemed that a small white lie might just provide his country with the time to make an earnest report for next year."
 jap.141.a: "All is going as planned."
 jap.141.b: "No need for deception."

 jap.142.t: "All Is Well With Free Indian Finance"
 jap.142.d: "East India was the last of the nations to make their annual financial report. This was to be expected, as the reports came in based on their relative proximity to the Sphere's center. Ino, seated in his usual place, awaited his assistant to return with the report, which had just arrived in Japan around an hour ago. Eventually he returned bearing an envelope, much the same as all the other reports. Wasting no time, Ino used an ornate letter opener to extract the information sealed inside. Like each in the series of reports, the letter began with "Report on the Economy of Free India". The Prime Minister scanned the documents, but quickly found that he had read enough to grasp the situation. Across three pages, the Free Indian Government had outlined their situation over the past year. Despite some difficulties, the economy was now doing particularly well, with no signs of declining in the near future. In fact, most graphs showed that more growth could be expected in virtually all major sectors. Agrarianism was beginning to come to an end, with signs of major industrialization in the coming years.\n\nTo Ino, this was a sign of triumph. Not only was a significant economy in the Sphere doing well for itself, but it had occurred under his leadership. Azad Hind may have done the heavy lifting, but it was due to the pressure of the Prime Minister that the successes had been seen in the first place. Or so Ino seemed to think that it had occurred that way."
 jap.142.a: "Excellent, a fine year for Free India!"

 jap.143.t: "East India Delivers the Honest Answer"
 jap.143.d: "Last of the nations due to send their economic reports to Tokyo was the Azad Hind Government. East India was on the periphery of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so their time of reporting was of no surprise nor concern. Ino, sitting in his office, had just received a phone call verifying that the report had arrived at Tokyo airport just under an hour ago. Upon its arrival to his personal estate, Ino asked for the precious documents to be delivered to him immediately. Once the documents that the report consisted of had been brought to Ino's office, he wasted no time in reading them. "Report on the Economy of Free India", said the title page simply. Outlined over three pages of text, charts and graphs, was the stark truth of East India's economy.\n\nThe report did not outline a disastrous situation. The economy was in fact managing to stay afloat, but at a level far below the expectations of Japanese projections. It did not appear that the situation was too likely to shift radically in the coming years. Azad Hind would remain a mostly agrarian society for a good while yet. At the bottom of the last page was a small section, entitled "Plans for Stimulating Economic Growth". Yet by that point, Ino had stopped reading. Solutions to the problem that he had just been made aware of seemed rather useless at that moment. Up until that point, The Prime Minister had assumed that the situation in Azad Hind was entirely positive. Now it was clear that a significant member of the Sphere was financially lagging far behind what was expected. The copies of the report would soon begin to circulate in wider economic and political circles, which would only hasten its impact. Ino was left wondering if there was some way to put the spotlight on the transparency of the report, although that still led directly to the problems it presented."
 jap.143.a: "Let us hope next year proves more promising."

 #SASAKAWA RIDE
 jap.144.t: "Sasakawa Wants Funding"
 jap.144.d: "Kantei received a letter from famous philanthropist and innovative entrepreneur Sasakawa Ryōichi. He is establishing a new oil company based around the Karafuto fields, and he is wondering if Ino's government would be interested in subsidising this enterprise. The prospecting operation was successful and a large and profitable field was found. Sasakawa believes that expanding oil extraction in the area will be a good way to make the Karafuto economy less dependent on agriculture and could potentially bring in a lot of educated workers. Long term it could even evolve Toyohara into an important center in the our Empire's far north.\n\nCertainly a good idea, Ino is however unsure if the best is to handle the request within the Kantei or give it to Kishi Nobusuke, he could possibly integrate it into the larger economic plans for the north."
 jap.144.a: "Ino will handle the request personally."
 jap.144.b: "A matter for Kishi Nobusuke."

 jap.145.t: "Sasakawa's Funding"
 jap.145.d: "Having decided to handle the matter of the new Karafuto oil fields himself, it was now time for Prime Minister Ino to determine the appropriate amount of funding to distribute. Sasakawa, although a member of the opposition in the Diet and a man embroiled in corruption of the highest order, was still a businessman that could not simply be ignored. His numerous enterprises and contributions to the war effort in past decades had ensured he would remain influential whether the government wished it or not. Now that he had discovered oil, ever precious and essential to the function of the Sphere, Sasakawa had the full attention of the Kantei.\n\nSubsiding his oil fields would be no cheap matter, as was the case with anything involving oil extraction. There were risks to consider as well. Caution suggested that only a small sum should be given to Sasakawa, lest his venture fail spectacularly. Yet other voices suggested that Sasakawa's business in Karafuto was more than sound enough to deserve a generous investment. The rewards would surely be great if all went as well as Sasakawa was describing it to be. Having heard both sides being put forward, Prime Minister Ino would now have the final say."
 jap.145.a: "A little bit over the required."
 jap.145.b: "This deserves more funding than usual."

 jap.146.t: "A Spelling Error?"
 jap.146.d: "After much and somewhat careful consideration, Prime Minister Ino selected to provide Sasakawa's oil venture with a modest amount of yen. Believing that the risks were too great to take and that possibly working rather closely with the opposition was a bad strategy, Ino felt it best to take the safer route. Besides, the businessman had never actually stated exactly how much in yen he was hoping to receive in subsidies. To finish off the matter, the Prime Minister would write a letter informing Sasakawa of the government's contribution to his endeavours in Karafuto. With that done, Ino thought little more of the matter, believing it to be successfully completed.\n\n"Prime Minister, Sasakawa Ryōichi is on line one. He says he wishes to discuss your terms of payment. He seemed rather displeased, if that says anything." With a nod, Ino dismissed his aide and picked up the receiver. "Prime Minister, I apologise for calling you at this hour, but I am afraid that there appears to be some sort of spelling error in the document you sent me. The one that details the funds." Ino, having checked the documents himself, replied that there could not have been any sort of fault. "Really? I must say that the section detailing the total subsidies seems to be missing at least one or two zeroes. Such a small amount would otherwise be a poor joke!"\n\nRealising that he was dealing with more than a technical error, Ino requested to phone Sasakawa back in five minutes. Now free to think, he could consider his options. Either he could stand by his original sum and not stoop to the greed of the business mogul. Or he could make the necessary changes to please him. With his five minutes spent, the Prime Minister told Sasakawa..."
 jap.146.a: ""The number is correct, sir.""
 jap.146.b: ""Of course, it was just an accident.""

 jap.147.t: "A Mysterious Letter"
 jap.147.d: "It is almost two weeks since Sasakawa Ryōichi asked for more money than we wanted to grant him. It has been two weeks of silence. Until today, when Ino got a small letter:\n\n'Dear Prime Minister Ino. I will be brief, the past few weeks you have made some choices that are not really wise. Rethinking and righting wrongs are an important part of the your office, and I advice you from the bottom of my heart that you will realize your mistakes and solve the problems you don't strictly need to have. Best of luck.' Despite lacking any clear relevance to Sasakawa, it seems suspiciously relevant to his request and the way he asked for more money."
 jap.147.a: "Sasakawa is up to no good."
 jap.147.b: "Better to give in than to risk Ino's life."

 jap.148.t: "The Arrest of Sasakawa"
 jap.148.d: "A mysterious letter threatening the life of the Prime Minister could not go disregarded, especially when it could be quickly tied to a suspect with plenty of reason to send it. Upon the advice of his closest confidants, the Prime Minister would go ahead with an arrest. "If that mogul is willing to kill me over a disagreement over subsidies, then he is better off behind bars. Who knows who he might have killed in the past over something like this?" Ino picked up the receiver and inelegantly dialed the Home Minister. "Minister, I need you to arrange a high-profile arrest. Who? Sasakawa Ryōichi, now get it done!"\n\nSasakawa was in his usual place, a grandiose office that spoke of wealth and someone with ubiquitous taste. There was a knock on the door, which was met with a "come in" from Sasakawa. In walked 3 police officers. "Sasakawa Ryōichi, you are under arrest for threatening the murder of the Prime Minister." As his hands were forced behind his back and clasped in handcuffs, the businessman could not help but try to bribe his captors, although the threat of additional charges quickly silenced his pleas.\n\n"Prime Minister, Sasakawa has been arrested and now awaits trial." Ino gave his thanks to the police before turning to his ministers that had gathered in his office."
 jap.148.a: ""One less troublesome keiretsu stooge to deal with!""

 jap.149.t: "Sasakawa Goes Free"
 jap.149.d: "The trail was something of a disappointment for some, and an afterthought for one man in particular. After Sasakawa's arrest, he had stayed in a suspiciously comfortable prison cell. To the outside world, it seemed as if Sasakawa Ryōichi had gone on an impromptu holiday, or so anyone inquiring after his whereabouts would be informed. His trial was quickly pushed forward to just a week after his imprisonment. It was a simple affair, with only Sasakawa and his six lawyers, the prosecution and a judge in attendance. Within an hour, a verdict had been reached.\n\n"Prime Minister, Sasakawa's trial has just ended. He's walked free." Ino, in response to this unfortunate news, demanded to know what could have caused this. "Lack of evidence, sir. Sasakawa's lawyers proved that he could not have possibly been responsible for the letter. The handwriting was completely off, and it could not be linked to anyone close to Sasakawa either. No fingerprints either." Ino was left feeling both relieved that Sasakawa hadn't attempted to kill and disappointed that his only feasible suspect for the letter's author had just been ruled out. Just as he was about to put the matter out of his mind, the phone rang once more. "Prime Minister, I believe we've spoken over the phone." It was Sasakawa Ryōichi, sounding particularly pleased with himself. "I understand your response to this letter you received, it's only reasonable to want safety. However, next time something like this occurs, I would recommend you have the letter checked properly, to avoid any difficulties that could arise. Good day!""
 jap.149.a: "Sasakawa is pushing his luck."

 jap.150.t: "The Well Is Finished"
 jap.150.d: "With government subsidies secured, construction on Sasakawa's Sakhalin oil wells soon began. Great heaps of steel and iron were brought up from the Home Islands to the remote and cold north. Once the foundations were laid, workers too made the journey northward, drawn by the promises of good wages and of modern housing that would await them once they returned from Sakhalin. Among the shores of Karafuto, a well was established, breaking up the steep landscape with a stark, industrial machine that produced its black out over the sky. But to those who stood to make a profit, the changes to the land- and seascape did not matter. The oil soon flowed, and Sasakawa looked to make a sizable profit on his latest venture. Prime Minister Ino was pleased too. Some had doubted his commitment to Sasakawa's oil project. Now he had proof he needed, that his government's money had been well spent. Oil was always precious and Ino could claim that he had an eye for finding reliable sources of it. The geologists who had actually found the source needed not to be mentioned, not even by their own employer."
 jap.150.a: "Money well spent, in Ino's eyes at least."

 jap.151.t: "More Money for Sasakawa"
 jap.151.d: "Having successfully constructed and operated one oil well in Karafuto, the question of whether or not Sasakawa should receive further funding. The well had been a success, extracting a profitable tonnage of oil month with no shortage in site for a long while. The idea of a second, or even third well seemed like the best way to move forward with the operation. After all, if one well was producing at an exceptional rate, surely two more would only pay for themselves?\n\nSasakawa could obviously afford to cover the costs of construction and employing more workers. Regardless of if he actually asked for it or not, the businessman would still be asking for more subsidisation. Once again, Prime Minister Ino would make the decision as to how much Sasakawa would be receiving. A great deal of money had already been invested in the oil wells. Caution spoke of providing a reduced sum, enough to provide Sasakawa with some "motivation". Yet with all the success that the business has seen so far, other voices suggested that even more money should be poured into the oil wells, to truly access the full potential of Karafuto's oil reserves. Eventually Ino decided to invest:"
 jap.151.a: "A large amount, no reason to stop now."
 jap.151.b: "A sensible amount, no need to go overboard."

 jap.152.t: "The Well Is Finished"
 jap.152.d: "The isolated gray machine, with its black shadow that coated the icy landscape, once stood alone. Yet it was eventually joined by a second. The construction did not go quite as well as planned this time. The foundations, thought to be firmly secured to the ground, gave way. The structure buckled under its own weight and tilted into the water before finally coming to a rest, lopsided and halfway in the icy water. Fortunately, this seemingly considerable setback, could be resolved with the use of the additional funds from the government. All would soon be restored to working order, apart from that which came at the loss of human life. Once the iron frame was properly attached and secured, the mechanisms could finally be welded into their proper places. After about a month of delays, the oil rig was finally finished, joining its twin in their much valued purpose. The icy waters of Karafuto seemed to grow darker, as production ramped up. At the same time, the increase in oil production lifted the spirits of Sasakawa and Prime Minister Ino Hiroya. Despite the setbacks, the additional funding had allowed for another rig to be built. Even more oil would now be available for the government to utilise. Karafuto did eventually benefit from the oil wells. The money from new industry helped to modernize both the once entirely agricultural economy and the settlements of Karafuto as well. Toyohara developed into a proper town, with a matching port. Immigration rose significantly, as the oil attracted those who sought to find even more of the precious resource. While the oil fields grew and tarnished the landscape somewhat, the people of Karafuto prefecture took solace in the precious comforts it had brought them."
 jap.152.a: "A close call, but good enough in the end."

 jap.153.t: "The Budget Didn't Last"
 jap.153.d: "From the very beginning, construction of the second oil well met great difficulty. The ground upon which the foundations were to be placed, was found to be greatly unsteady. Without extensive work to properly strengthen the ground, no well could be built without risking a collapse. Yet such work was far beyond what the budget could allow for. Upon hearing news of the severe delay, Sasakawa quickly turned towards a source of new funds, one that he hoped would do well not to disappoint him.\n\n"Prime Minister, I have some bad news. However, I believe we can work forward if you agree to my solution." Ino, suspicious that Sasakawa's plan might involve more subsidies, asked him to carry on with his explanation. "In order to safely extract the oil, further work must be done to secure the foundations. I suggest you provide me with more funds, in order to get the operation back on track. After all, this is oil you need."\n\nIno, feeling confident, refused the offer. He instead suggested that Sasakawa cough up the necessary funds using his own money. "Prime Minister, we both know that would be most unwise. I can abandon this second well, without a second thought. But if I do that, how will it reflect upon the government that funded me? Do you really want to appear to have such a bad eye for investment? Ino was left without time to answer the question. "Now, I understand you will need time to consider this. I won't take a moment more of your time. The phone line went quiet and the Prime Minister was left to write up the required funds. This was much to his displeasure."
 jap.153.a: "We better give this man what he wants."

 jap.154.t: "Ino's Corruption Scandal"
 jap.154.d: "Sasakawa eventually got his money. Construction on the second oil well soon resumed and all seemed to be going as planned once more. That was until Sasakawa's rather casual mention of the additional funding he had received during a number of conferences and business lunches. Word of the transaction slowly trickled its way out of corporate sectors and into political ones. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, it was his political rivals who heard the news first. Even with the full context of providing subsidies for a major company, Ino's proceeding financial investments could easily be misconstrued as acts of corruption.\n\nThe Prime Minister, already surrounded by rumours of economic misdeeds, was an easy target for a fresh accusation of corruption. For a few days, it was all the Diet could bring themselves to speak of. Unlike many of the other times that the issue of Inos extensive corruption had been raised, the very real evidence of Sasakawa's proclamation made the matter far more intense. Despite being a sitting member of the Diet himself, Sasakawa was noticeably absent. Although he had been just as involved as the Prime Minister, he may as well have stood in the centre of the house of representatives, for lack of notice he received. Ino was left to bear the brunt of the political backlash from his less than secure investments."
 jap.154.a: "Not even a hint of discretion!"

 jap.155.t: "The Well Is Finished"
 jap.155.d: "By the time the scandal of Ino's investments had blown over for the most part, the second oil well had almost been completed. The last few safety checks were finished, which found the ground to finally be safe for proper construction. Compared to the seemingly gargantuan task of ensuring stability, the actual putting together of the well went swimmingly. Finally, operations at the second well could begin, with only a small shadow of economic abuse swirling over it. Karafuto, once a quiet place, grewer louder with the sounds of industry and of toil. Now with two machines pumping oil up from the earth, Sasakawa's latest business was starting to become even more productive and profitable. For him, the second well was exactly what he had needed it to be.\n\nFor Ino, the entire process of getting to the oil he had subsidized had been arduous and not without harm to his personal image. Still, oil was ever valuable and it would eventually drown out some of the criticism of the Prime Minister in its useful purpose. As time went on, the oil well began to produce other positive results. The local economy started to diversify slightly and the necessity of transporting vast quantities of oil brought about the modernisation of the Toyohara port. It all occurred a little too late to mitigate people's opinions of the Prime Minister."
 jap.155.a: "I'm sure the military will make use of the oil at least."

 jap.156.t: "Kishi's Busy"
 jap.156.d: ""Sasakawa presents an interesting proposition. However, I think it best that someone with more expertise in local matters handles his request for subsidies. Get me Kishi on the phone." Kishi Nobusuke was the obvious man to turn to, if the Kantei was not to handle the oil venture. Kishi had spent much of his time in his domain developing it with brutal efficiency and brutal methods. Ino was sure that the possibility of Kishi being granted new oil wells for his northern fiefdom would be more than enough to convince him that Sasakawa's offer was worth it.\n\n"Kishi, I have a proposal from Sasakawa Ryōichi to present to you." Kishi's reply was simply, a mere "Go on." "He wishes for aid in funding his efforts in extracting oil in Karafuto prefecture. He claims it could seriously benefit the local economy and eventually provide us with a proper port to the far north." Ino could only hear the crackling static on the other end of the line, as Kishi seemed to consider the proposal in silence. "Well I am afraid to say Prime Minister, that particular matters here in Manchukuo are far more pressing. It would be most unwise of me to turn my attention away at this time." Although disappointed, Ino could do nothing more than to accept the answer he had been given. De jure authority aside, Kishi Nobusuke was not a man to force an issue with.\n\nIno would have to handle the matter himself. While having more control over the oil wells was certainly beneficial, the prospect of negotiating funding with Sasakawa was the furthest thing from an enjoyable experience."
 jap.156.a: "Let us see what we can do now."

 #END OF SASAKA RIDE

 jap.157.t: "Systems Failure"
 jap.157.d: "The click of the nozzle sounded over and over as the soldier pulled the trigger, but the tanker on his back grumbled and did not spit out any of the blazes expected in the tests. Taken aback by the failures, scientists observing from a distance threw their clipboards by their sides as they shot down their arms in frustration. Malfunction, they concluded, as reports that followed cited a defect in the adaptation of the Type 120 ignition system; a result of the cold weather's effects on the heated electrical wire within the weapon.\n\nDisappointed, the soldier disengaged his equipment and removed the tanker from his back. He dragged his feet towards his squad members, and they welcomed him with a nodding acceptance. Perhaps more disheartened, the scientific examiners leaned over the observing railings that peers over the testing fields at a loss for words. It was experience, they thought, coping with the dread of reporting a systems failure back to the officers."

 jap.204.t: "Iberia in Flames"
 jap.204.d: ""Prime Minister, the Iberian Union has collapsed, and we believe that the Co-Prosperity Sphere should involve itself into the conflict," said General Iwakuro Hideo, as General Sugita Ichiji handed [JAP.GetLeader] a folder filled with different documents and reports on the conflict.\n\nAs he read through the documents, the prime minister asked, "What sort of intervention did you have in mind?"\n\nGeneral Sugita was the one to reply, "Located on the northern coast of Africa is a state known as the 'Rif Republic,' led by a man named Mohamed Choukri. They have splintered from the former Union, proclaiming a desire to bring democracy to all of Morocco. Their struggle against colonialism makes them a prospective ally for the Sphere's own anti-colonialist rhetoric."\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] nodded along. The republicans seemed moderate enough, and it would be an easy sell to the public. It seemed a simple enough proposal, so he handed it back to Sugita and said, "I'll greenlight the request, then. Inform the rest of the military that the Sphere shall be supporting the Rif Republic.""

 japflavor.31.t: "Ghosts of the Past"
 japflavor.31.d: "The kid had lost his hand. He walked into the village, stumbling and dazed. A scream arose to his mouth, and yet he could not scream. The local doctor had arrived too late, and the boy died of blood loss before anything could be done. The parents were not unlike the boy; shocked, confused, and scared. However, they could scream. Their cries were heard all night, for their boy, mourning that could be understood by anybody a world over.\n\nThe next day, they found a new determination, to find out what had happened to their son. It had not happened at the nearby factory. Nothing in that hell could cut off a hand. The father overheard the boy's friends talking amongst themselves. They said that in the forest south of the village there was a great machine. That was where his son had gone. He shook as he pushed his way through the forest. Was that blood on the ground? A finger shrouded in dirt, or just his mind? Finally, he came across trees, cut for what must have been a quarter of a kilometre, though not by human hands. The cuts were rough and jagged, terribly irregular. At the end of this strange valley was a hulking plane, rusting. The wreck was beautiful, even as it fell apart. This was the place where his son had met death.\n\nA flag of stars and stripes adorned the side, bringing back memories of a war of starvation and desperation. Even in a plane like this, there was likely bombs that had gone unexploded. He attempted to squeeze in through a puncture on the plane's side, but he emerged with a deep gash from a sharp piece of metal. Circling the plane, he took a wrong step.\n\nA brief, fleeting moment of comprehension dawned on the father's face."
 japflavor.31.a: "The explosion was heard by nobody."

 japflavor.32.t: "Accursed Soldiers"
 japflavor.32.d: "Huang Kecheng was once a soldier. A real one, not the bandit that remained. His uniform had gone to shreds, and only the faintest color remained on the gray tunic. His eyes darted around, constantly shifting from item to item. His beard had turned into patches, and the skin underneath was scarred and bruised. He and his two comrades had been raiding villages and police outposts in the mountains of Eastern Shandong for decades, somehow evading capture even as a manhunt for years into the mountains gained the public's interest.\n\nNow, one were firmly in the hands of the police. The rest were dead. An entire Kenpeitai unit, replete with helicopters, machine guns, and night vision goggles had been in close pursuit for the better part of the night. Each man was gunned down, and yet Huang Kecheng had survived. Under no small amount of duress, he admitted to reason and the murder of villagers. An interrogation quickly began, in full force. The man, revealed to be a member of the old Communist Party, was disheveled and confused. He refused to believe the war was over and screamed when he heard that Chongqing had been destroyed. Even after agents displayed a photo of Mao Zedong's corpse, splayed across the ground of Chongqing, he continued denying. It was not until the firing squad was ordered to shoot that he stopped shaking. His last words seemed to echo forever."

 japflavor.33.d: "The sun was fading from view. The shadows got longer and longer, until beams shining through the windows created silhouettes in the ground that were outlandishly high, like beasts in a shadow puppet show. Kaya was tapping his foot on the ground anxiously. He had to get the call. For what must have been the fourth time in that hour, he checked the lines. They were not cut or bugged. The lines were secure, but no amount of reassurance would convince him so. The room was too dark. He did not like to see his own shadow. It loomed over him, followed him. It would never leave. He despised it for that.\n\nPulling the cord on the lamp, he read through the papers again, his hands shaking as he pulled them to the light of the lamp. From Nanjing department of the Kenpeitai. All connected to the end of the war with China. The final moments. He remembered those days, how it all seemed so clear. These papers offered a glimpse at those times, when peace in all the world was certain. And that grim photo, sitting atop the neat stack of papers. The body was unrecognizable, crushed by Chongqing rumble and burned to a cinder.\n\nAll of the evidence was coming together in the most terrifying way. It made Kaya sick to his stomach.\n\nThe telephone rang. Kaya hesitated for a moment. His heart was beating faster than it had ever beat before, faster then when he had even attained the office."

I will not be trusting this with any other officials until I get your express approval. Though, you should know that the Home Minister and the Nanjing Department do have knowledge."\n\n"You sure as fuck won't tell any other souls, if you want to keep your head."\n\nThe Kenpeitai officer was unfazed. "Yes, sir."\n\n"Alright, officer, how'd you tell it wasn't him?" Even the Prime Minister couldn't quite understand why he had gotten so riled up, but he knew that none of this was good.\n\n"After analysing the photos sent to you, the Nanjing department came to the conclusion that the charred body was not his. We had miscalculated. His golden teeth were there, but he was short. Too short for the man himself."\n\nThe prime minister's heart sank, and he slouched into his chair. "It just can't be true."\n\nThe officer continued. "Our agents retrieved some materials that belonged to deceased RGOC general Pang Bingxun. We checked them with some of our documents. All the evidence is there. He must have been active after Chongqing, long after our pacification in the 50's. Everything points to it.""

Born in Kyoto, the year before Commodore Perry forced the Bakufu to open the country which led to actions that participated in bringing it down and leading the way towards imperial rule in 1868. Under his wise oversight, Japanese society experienced a breakneck modernisation - modern schools, industrial bases and a modern army was developed. Most importantly, the Meiji Constitution was established under his reign, which continues to be upheld even to this day, in addition to setting up the initial vestiges of the Japanese empire in Choson and Taiwan.\n\nWhile the Japanese people revere the contributions made by Meiji, whether his legacy is upheld till this day is still up for debate, especially amidst the corruption and bureaucratic chaff of the current administration."

 japflavor.38.t: "The Beloved Camellia Lady"
 japflavor.38.d: "The orchestral opening brought a somber mood to the audience in the bar, even for those who were already extremely drunk. Mi-ja faced the audience, any fear leaving her as she began to sing:\n\n"Endless nights in pain, with her heart torn apart / None know how many tears the Camellia Lady cried..."\n\nTears formed in many eyes, as Mi-ja retold the story of the Camellia Lady. A standing ovation. Hye-ja was next. Straightening her shining dress, she took the microphone from the attendant and made the customary bow. Rising from it, the music played from the speaker again. An upbeat tune played, giving the audience a jolt of energy. Hye-ja began to sing, as the audience clapped to the tune:\n\n"Please tell me you like me / I can't get by without you..." The audience danced to the song, some singing, others smiling, the lyrics of youthful love having touched their hearts. The crowd gave Hye-ja a standing ovation as before. Smiling at the reception, Hye-ja returned to the table, the rest of the musicians seemingly deep in conversation.\n\n"Hye-ja-ssi, do you want to go to Manchuria?" A woman dressed in red approached Hye-ja from the table. Mi-ja.\n\n"Manchuria?" Hye-ja's expression soured. "Why would I want to die in that hellhole?"\n\n"It's not about working in the factories - trust me, none of us want to do that. It's about performing somewhere else. Somewhere better for us."\n\nMi-ja's words rang true. She barely scraped by in Japan, and the homeland wasn't much better.\n\n"When do you plan on leaving?""

 japflavor.39.t: "Trotting Across the Amnok"
 japflavor.39.d: "The Amnok twinkled in the sunlight, as the snowmelt flowed towards the west, where it would meet the ocean. In all her thirty-three years of existence, Mi-ja had never been this far north. It had taken months of careful saving and endless nights of singing to get here. But she would go farther than that. Her eyes scanned the land in front of her, seeing concrete blocks, smokestacks, and scattered apartment buildings. If she squinted, she could barely make out the silhouettes of people. They seemed like ants, in a hill. Soft fog obscured her view, or was it the pollution? With Manchuria, she couldn't tell. A voice called out to her, breaking her moment of contemplation. A distant person waved, gesturing to the train station. She ran over - was the train going to depart?\n\n"Train's about to depart?" Mi-ja took a moment to breathe.\n\nHye-ja nodded, before sprinting to the train station. Mi-ja had no choice but to follow, lest she get stranded forever. An attendant held the door open, nearly smashing Mi-ja's foot when he closed it. In two hours, they would be in Mukden.\n\nAnd there would be no going back.\n\nAs they walked to their companions, they entered Manchuria. Mi-ja claimed the window seat, where she watched farms and factories pass by, idly wondering if they all would have to work in them one day. Wind brushed by her hair as a woman, Yong-im, if she remembered correctly, opened the window screen. She listened to the chatter of her group, as they discussed what they would do when they arrived. She thought that she should participate. But they were singers; singers that had uprooted themselves from all that they knew. Mi-ja hummed a new tune, taking her mind off of real life, as she etched lyrics in her head:"

 japflavor.40.d: "Sato turned the radio up, letting the soft musings of the violin, the pluckings of the guitar, and the whispers of the accordion guide her to sleep. Beams of light shone through her window, giving her warmth. She knew this song well, it was 'Street of Dawn', sang by Toyota Nadeshiko. Sato let her eyes droop, as Toyota began to sing through the speakers. Technically, it was illegal to be listening to this - Korean wasn't allowed on the radio. But something attracted her to the music - her friend Kata had let her borrow some of her records - and she soon fell in love.\n\nThe pleasant music stopped suddenly, replaced by yelling, ripping Sato out of her sleep before it could even start. "Let go! What the fuck are you doin-" A voice from what she could only presume was the radio personality grunted out.\n\nA second later, a loud thud was heard. Sato blinked, simultaneously unsurprised and somehow surprised that this happened. She rubbed her temples. Now she would have to find another station that played her music - and there were probably more arrests happening as she sat here. And what if the Tokkō knew that she listened to such music? What to do, what to do?"
 japflavor.40.a: "She tuned into another station and lied down on the couch."

 japflavor.41.t: "Under the Mercury Lamps"
 japflavor.41.d: "Yujin rested on the cold stone bench, the wind blowing south through the garden. In her arms, she cradled her grandchild - Seulgi - nestled softly in a white blanket. Her legacy. The tree behind her rustled suddenly, startling her, which startled Seulgi. On reflex, Yujin rocked her, cradling her to sleep. Yet she remained fussy, her short arms reaching towards the blue sky. Soft shushing, nor reassurances that everything was alright would calm the child. As she cooed and called out to no one and everyone, Yujin wondered what Seulgi would be like when she got older.\n\nWould she even see her reach adulthood? Yujin shook her head, admonishing herself. But there was a far more immediate concern - what if her very own grandchild didn't understand Korean? What would happen then? She may be a baby now, but what about when she attends school? A song came into her head, a favorite of hers, and she sang it to Seulgi.\n\n"When the mercury lamps bloom in the evening..." Yujin's eyes swept the garden, bursting with bright flowers, of white, of red, of blue. She looked into Seulgi's eyes, the brightest flowers of them all.\n\n"I'm pacing this path I used to walk alone with you..." She caressed Sulgi's face, smiling down at her. The child smiled in return, showing off her growing teeth. Yujin kissed her forehead, touching her nose.\n\n"The soft light of a mercury lamp does not change..." The wind picked up, as Yujin rocked Seulgi harder. She yawned, as Yujin tucked her further into the blanket.\n\n"...And you don't seem to have as well." She chuckled, as Seulgi's eyes drooped further and further.\n\n"Ah, ah! Under the light of a mercury lamp..." Seulgi fell asleep, her only movement being her breathing. Yujin rose from the bench, walking to the nursery. Placing Seulgi into a cradle, Yujin rocked it slowly. She walked away, turned off the lights, and closed the door silently."

 japflavor.42.d: "102.5, 102.9, 106! The aging captain had figured it out, to the relief of his younger aides. The map laid out before him detailed the situation: Red was on the backfoot, after having lost the ridge and the surrounding hill. Defenses had already been established, and it was only a matter of time before Blue would achieve victory. Scribbles and thin arrows pinpointed potential weak spots, as thicker arrows planned out the finishing blows to Red. Just a little more, and they would win!\n\nYet the captain was met not with silence, but instead with music. "What the hell is going on." He asked to no one in particular.\n\nThe music being played was actually good, all things considered. The sound of the trumpet, the strong voice and the fact it was upbeat all contributed to how good it was. Too bad it was interrupting his exercise. The captain turned the dial controlling the frequencies. All were playing the same music. He heard a snicker from his right, as the voice sang. To the Japanese-born captain, the lyrics were unintelligible. To the aide - Taichu, the woman was calling the captain a fool.\n\n"And what's the matter with you?" The captain pointed at the aide, eyes narrowed.\n\n"Nothin-Nothing, sir." The aide stiffened, although his face betrayed him. The captain simply glared at him, gruffly telling the group to call off the exercise. The aides cleared out of the tent, with Taichu relieved that he was out of the captain's sight. He began humming the tune that had ruined the exercise - bobbing his head to the chorus. 'You are a fool! You are a fool!' He imagined addressing the captain in private, finally airing his grievances. 'You are a fool! You are a fool!' The song in his head continued."

The time is seven o'clock, and coming up is a song from Kim Yong-im!" He let the needle go, as the upbeat flutes and faint backing vocals gave way to the Queen of Trot herself. For someone who had lived her entire life under Japanese rule, her Korean was nearly free of Japanese.\n\nThough he shouldn't really be complaining - he was born in America, after all. A knock on the door startled Seungu; his legs kicked the desk, shaking the equipment.\n\n"Sorry about that, Seungu-ssi. Someone from the government came earlier and gave this to me." Sooyoung held up a manila folder, stuffed with papers, continuing. "I read everything. You'll want this." She dropped it on Seungu's lap, as he played the next song. Skimming over its contents, he smirked. This was something he could do.\n\nA week later, the PA systems of the Japanese legations came to life: the songs of Toyota Nadeshiko and Mitsugi Nori played. Confusion, then amusement turned to terror as all military frequencies were flooded with music. Nothing could come in from the legations, and nothing could come out. For Tokyo, this was a disaster. For Washington, Seungu, and Radio Soul, the operation could not have been more of a success."

"Now, repeat after me!" Jisoo put the pointer onto the chalkboard. "Seagulls don't cry over the sea!" The children leaned closer to the board, trying to read and mimic her. A desk creaked as it moved closer to the front of the room.\n\n"S...eagulls...don't cry...over the sea." The students squinted their eyes, clearly struggling to read. Jisoo stopped herself from yelling. These were just children, who were learning. They would get it eventually.\n\n"I hope you all have studied this because you're going to be reciting this to me one by one next week." She warned the students.\n\nAn unintelligible cacophony of affirmatives erupted from the students, as Jisoo returned to the chalkboard. The pointer swept across the second line of characters, as Jisoo read it: "Tears are wet in the water bowl and the jeogori," she read out. This time, her students read it nearly perfectly. Nodding, she moved on. "A small boat on the far horizon, oh, today you're not gone." The teacher pointed to a picture depicting exactly what she recited.\n\n"A small boat on the far horizon, oh today, you're not gone." The students repeated.\n\n"Nice work! I'll be picking on students to read a part of the lyrics. Woonhyung-ah, you go first." And so the students read the lyrics, with Jisoo giving feedback in between. "Seulgi-ya, go a bit slower next time!"\n\nAs the last of the students left, Jisoo prayed. Prayed for their success, but also that they wouldn't forget where they came from:"

 japflavor.45.d: "For Jiang Ziqi, nothing could be better than sitting in her record store and listening to the merchandise as the city of Nanjing ambled on outside of her window. All the likes of businessmen, salarymen, and people just looking to get by passed her windows. A growing pile of poems, of the best prose she could muster stood tall on her desk, ready to collapse if the smallest breath touched it.\n\nZiqi was hunched over her desk, calculating how many sales she would have to make to cover rent. Deep in thought, her train of thought was broken by the ringing of the chimes, and the paper tower collapsed. Too slow to react, Ziqi watched as the customer tried to save her stack of papers, only for it to fall over the floor. Looking up, she realized that a Japanese officer had just walked into her store. Face pale, she shot up.\n\n"Do you need any help, sir?" She cringed at her Japanese.\n\n"I'm so sorry for causing that mess, do you need any help?" The officer seemed genuinely apologetic and embarrassed - Ziqi nodded. In a few seconds, the stack had been reassembled, then divided into chunks to avoid an incident.\n\n"Do you happen to sell trot?" the officer asked anxiously.\n\nZiqi walked over to a rack, filing through the record covers. "There should be some Li Mi-ja here..." She pointed to another rack. "There's Kim Hye-ja and Choi Sook-ja." The officer nodded, searching through the mass of covers. From the corner of her eye, Ziqi could see him pick out a few records, as she picked out ten.\n\nShe left the records on her desk, telling him to let her know when he was done. He came over a few seconds later, holding a bunch of records in his arms.\n\n"Is there any way you can package this?" he asked. "I'll pay extra."\n\nZiqi nodded, producing a box from under her desk. She placed the records in the box.\n\n"That'll be 500 Yen." She got 550. As the man left the store, Ziqi stopped him: "Why did you buy trot records anyway? Aren't they illegal?"\n\nThe officer raised an eyebrow, seemingly acknowledging her argument, and smiled fondly."

Dropping the file into the finished pile, he opens the window, letting the cool breeze flow into the office.

Reading through the documents, his eyebrows raised.\n\n'TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY - In recent months, illegal music has exploded in popularity across Korea and the Home Islands.

For Captain Hata and his humble crew of ten, the day had provided good fortune. They were somewhere off the coast of Manchukuo, out of the way of the crowded seas, from the competition. Here, the water was clear of others, and the Hiraumi was free to fish wherever they pleased. The tuna and bonito kept coming, and all knew that they would dine well.\n\nSunset arrived, and the crates were packed with ice and fish. Making preparations to sail back home, Captain Hata saw a shadow of a boat in the distance, with what looked like a man holding a net. Holding binoculars to his eyes, he could easily see it - it was another fisherman, probably a Russian. His eyes slightly hurt - he was looking directly into the setting sun, after all.\n\nCompared to the relatively clean appearance of the fisherman, as well as the good shape the Hiraumi was in, the Russian was... poor. His ship was clearly falling apart, in spite of his best efforts. His facial expression was grim, as he pulled out his net from the ocean. Fortune was clearly not on his side; no shine of fish scales could be seen. And the fisherman himself was not in the best condition. Aged far beyond his years, and toughened far more than he should have been. Captain Hata could only watch on with pity, powerless to do anything to help."

Outside, fog and rain obscured their view of the rice terraces. Only a faint green tinge reminded the soldiers that they were there. They sipped hot tea, steeped with leaves from the nearby fields. For such cheap tea, it was rather strong, and warmed their souls as the weather stole heat.\n\nA loud knock on the door turned their attention away from the conversation. The leader, Hayato, stood up and opened the door. Standing on the porch, clutching a parasol and attempting to carry what seemed to be a heavy tray covered in cloth, was a shivering girl. Couldn't have been more than 10, he surmised. Hayato raised his eyebrows, letting the girl in. She was emotionless, any sympathy not revealing itself. Hayato took the tray from her; she was struggling to carry it and the girl sighed in relief. He lifted the cloth, checking to make sure it was not explosives.\n\nOn the tray was an assortment of wheel-shaped pastries. They reminded Hayato of Chinese mooncakes, albeit without the elaborate designs stamped on time. He brought it over to the men, who were delighted to have some snacks. Cutting the cakes in eighths, the cakes went well with the tea. The flavors of durian, of mung bean paste, and sometimes even salty egg yolk somehow melded together with the drink. Hayato greatly enjoyed them, and he turned to thank the girl."

Turning to his direction, she asked, "Keitaro-chan, could you please read for the class?" He silently nodded, turning to his book. Seemingly having forgotten what paragraph he was to read, he slightly panicked. The class grew a little louder, as whispers between friends began to start. Seeing his dilemma, she saved him: "The greedy Chiang government..." she loudly whispered.\n\nThanking Yoshike, he began to read. "The greedy Chiang government in China, in a bid to distract the people of China from their poor lives, staged an incident along the Lugou Bridge in order to start a war. We responded..."

Suzu, Hideo, and Kyoshi had toured the verdant forests, teeming with wildlife of all kinds. They had climbed up mountains, reaching summits and frolicking in the snow. They even pored into what looked like the lair to the underworld, as violently orange lava bubbled and fizzed beneath their feet. It was called Mauna Kea by the locals and was a sacred place. If that was the case, surely it would not be so terrifying.\n\nBut with all things, their leave was ephemeral. The last day of their leave was spent in the tropical sun, the three perusing the businesses as they walked down the street. Bars, shops, and restaurants lined the streets, filled with patrons. The youngest of the entourage, Kyoshi, pointed out an "American-themed bar".\n\n"C'mon, it can't hurt to look!" Kyoshi poked Hideo, who was reluctant. "Listen, if you don't want to look, you can just turn your back. It's not hard."\n\nHideo sighed, giving into Kyoshi's desires. It truly would not hurt. Walking over to the storefront, they saw exactly what they expected - Americanisms to last infinite lifetimes. In the corner was a massive cutout of the iconic Mickey Mouse.\n\n"You know, I always expected him to be... smaller? He is a mouse, after all." Suzu waggled his fingers.\n\n"Why are his shoes so big? They're half of his body!" Kyoshi tried to contain his laughter, but nearly fell over himself. The laughter was contagious, as they pointed at his ears.\n\n"The-hehre thehe-the size ohhahahah-of dinner plates!" Hideo slumped against a lamppost, shaking with mirth.

Not only were the administrators putting extra pressure to "emphasize Japanese cultural education", but any classes beyond conceptual were for the most part nonexistent. It pained the teacher to watch his brightest students spend his class in boredom, craving a more rigorous curriculum. Perhaps, he felt, they needed a more inspiring class. Yes, their final chemistry course would be a lesson in the creation of Dragon's Beard Candy.\n\nAll through the week Mr. Kim practiced the recipe in his home, consulting with the retired confectioner in town, laboring in humid weather. Once he felt he had acquired a solid grasp, Mr. Kim went out and drew money from his savings, enough to make sure every student could make their own and then some. It would be unprofessional, but at least the kids would enjoy it.\n\nHis pupils lacked the patience he had for the candy to turn into the wispy strings that the masters could make, but the joy in their eyes for a real experiment would never fade from Mr. Kim's memory. They had the chance today not just to recite and memorize what the Japanese administrators felt was best, but to create something truly Korean."

She would tell stories to her and Jun-yeol of the old Korea, how she watched a parade with the last king, Sun-Jong.\n\nThis time was no different; the archaic village had not changed one bit, save for a few more homes with electric lights. Won-joo's grandmother greeted them with hugs and kisses as she always did, and the family enjoyed a simple, but filling dinner. The octogenarian returned to the table after some time, revealing a splendid set of clothes.\n\n"Grandmother, that's a hanbok! There's pictures of them in our history books."\n\nShe smiled at her young granddaughter before handing the outfit to her. It was her own hanbok, sewed by the youth's great grandmother.\n\nJun-yeol ran his hand along the soft ramie cloth, flicking the frayed tassels that hung from the skirt. Won-joo could only look in awe. The clothes may have been fit for a museum display, but she felt in her a sense of duty to wear it, at least once. Only the old folks wore them in the cities, where most people followed the new fashions from Tokyo. Holding it up to her own body, she saw the proportions were nearly the same - the sleeves may have to be fixed, but it was a perfect fit otherwise.\n\nBut when she returned back to the city, the dress brought only curiosity and amusement by her friends. They joked that she would look like a peasant from the history books, a museum dummy. And while Won-joo could let the insults slide, however they were intended, perhaps the world was not yet ready for the old fashions to come in style again."

The NAJUA was splintered across the wide plains of Manchuria, and the few cells hidden deep in Korea's remaining forests and villages. Radio messages told of a mid-level Japanese officer residing near the Paektu Mountain. As one of Korea's greatest symbols, the rebel felt the death of his foes at its base would be a fitting end for another cog in the machine that raped the lands belonging to him and every other Korean in subjugation.\n\nPeering out from an outcrop, he saw a long line of cars near the mountain.\n\n"Sir, they don't look like IJA trucks to me." one man spoke up.\n\nDong-wi snatched the binoculars and looked at the men getting out - not just men. Families! Following the trail was a sign written in Korean and Japanese:\n\n"Welcome to Heaven's Lake Campgrounds and Cottages!"\n\nHis face began to redden the more he looked. Cheap rubbish bins scattered about, tacky homes by the sacred lake, and smoke from various points - campfires! A sanctified place turned not even into a museum, but a tourist's locale! He began to weep, his spare hand reaching for the old pistol he kept by his side, the grooves familiar to his touch. He had dedicated his life against the Japanese, and they have become so secure they vacation in his country. But he could only watch as Paektu, the spiritual home of Korea, became yet another spot for the oppressor to make money."

[JAP.GetLeader] has issued a statement to the public noting, that with much regret, the Guarded Pearl Exercises have been postponed for the foreseeable future as the government works to process and manage with the immediate crisis at hand. The announcement had come at an immense time of despair for the Japanese public, and the cancellation of the symbolic event had shaken the already frail confidence of millions across the empire.\n\nFrom within the Kantei, the Prime Minister hung his head low in a moment of great fatigue. He was emptied of passion, knowing that the public would suffer each and every day his government fumbled around in their attempts to manage the Yasuda Crisis. With the exercises now dispensed of for the time being, the public would have to confront their suffering in the quiet of the night. Moreover, names in the military have issued their complaints and anger at the [JAP.GetLeader]'s decision, decrying the move as "unpatriotic" and "feeble". Nonetheless, the government had stood by its move with a tired resolve, acknowledging public disappointment whilst shepherding the cabinet's attention towards dealing with the economic recession as best as they could."

In response to the repeated postures of the empire's enemies, [Root.GetLeader] has convened his cabinet, and announced to the globe that preparation for Japan's Guarded Pearl Exercises will begin immediately.\n\nJapan recovers from the devastation that had bled the empire dry four years ago, and as she climbs back onto the international stage once more, the world shall see the strength of the unconquerable Yamato spirit. Once again, Earth's billions of eyes will witness the towering steel ships that rule the Pacific, the great rolling tanks that repel the invaders of Japan's Asian brothers, and the roaring plane engines tearing through the thick clouds above. The showcase will be broadcasted on live television from Keijō to Sapporo; millions of viewers are expected to tune into the displays across the globe to impress and intimidate Tokyo's German and American challengers.\n\nThe race to begin the warring exhibition of Japanese military prowess is carefully spearheaded by the Prime Minister and his cabinet, who are determined to negotiate their way around internal divides and complications so that they may frighten the western aggressors back into their own realms, and show the people of the world that Japan is here to stay."

His cabinet scribbled down notes as he spoke in his office, and he continued his postulations about the future of Japanese military presentation for a while after.\n\nThe topic of interservice rivalry was brought up by a minister, stopping [Root.GetLeader] dead in his tracks. It was a subject he was hoping not to spend too much time on, but something he had to shed light upon eventually. Letting out a sigh and placing his hands firmly on his desk, the Prime Minister softened his expression and spoke frankly; the government was not currently in a position to act as an arbiter between the two branches, and simply had to make a decision about which branch would receive better attention in the exercises.\n\nFavoring the Navy, [JAP.GetLeader] mentioned, would require quite the overhaul in shipyard inspection and naval procedures, but if done right it could strike fear at the mere sight of such powerful and crashing fleets. Although, the Prime Minister also paid attention to the stunning potential in a modernized and well-equipped army, at the cost of burdening the military bureaucracy with endless inspections and statistical ordinance.

The bitter rivalries, personal and disciplinary, that butted heads in almost every avenue in the military bureaucracy infuriated the Prime Minister, but now was not the time to investigate a solution. Rather, he had to take a side if the display of Japanese strength was to stand out across the globe.\n\nHe considered for a moment; thousands of men in regimented rank, followed by countless tanks, artillery pieces, and launchers would naturally impress those who would catch a glimpse of the awesome display. Alternatively, vying for the Navy could present to the world the empire's reach across the globe, as well as the booming power projection it has from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific.

Soon after, another officer from across the court screamed an ear-piercing order, and the swathes of soldiers robotically grasped their rifles instantaneously.\n\nPrime Minister [Root.GetLeader] stood tall on the platform with his hands behind his back, surrounded by advisors chatting about the preparations for the exercises. Once pulled him to the side, and informed him of the aerial exhibitions; the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy both had their own branches of the air force. He asserted that it would be possible to keep the branches separate and specialized for each environment, or to divorce them from their parent branches to form an independent Imperial Air Force.

Entire regiments of finely-uniformed soldiers marched in perfect coordination, every angle of their steps matched as they formed great columns that stomped throughout the capital's main roads. After the wailing order of an officer, the thousands of soldiers jutted into line with a mechanical dexterity, as if their very humanity was built for the purposes of war.\n\nThe mighty steel ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy crashed throughout the Pacific waters, sailing in formations displaying their acute coordination. They were accompanied by the high-powered planes that sliced through the skies, ripping the air into pieces as they tore past crowds of news broadcasters filing the displays.

Thousands of civilians sat in the stands, applauding and cheering at the displays as dozens of large news cameras panned around the exhibition. Some time after, a silence fell over the great roads and crowds, and the Prime Minister began to speak; his voice boomed through microphones as he announced the flag raising ceremony, much to the crowds' marvel.

 japcult.1.d: "Today on the NHK prime-time evening slot "Space Defender Zaku" aired its pilot episode to millions watching at home. The "Space Defender Zaku" project, referred to as "Zaku" colloquially, is the animated brainchild of director Yoshiyuki Tomino. "Zaku" depicts ace pilot Char Aznable as he pilots his titular red fighting robot, the Zaku, in space combat against the Earth Federation Space Forces. The Principality of Zeon's mass production of the Zaku gave the nation the technological edge against the underprepared Federation Forces leading to many decisive victories early in the conflict. It is only when the Federation unveils the Gundam, a high performance mobile suit, that the tide begins to turn. The series takes Lt. Cmdr. Aznable on many adventures in the pursuit of destroying the Gundam, demonstrating Aznable's incredible skill with piloting the Zaku against superior Federation opponents.\n\nAlready "Zaku" has received rave reviews and rumors are circulating that the series's 52 episode season is being extended towards 60 episodes. Zeon's portrayal as a highly disciplined and devoted fighting force in a noble war of liberation against the corrupt "democratic" Earth Federation bears notable parallels with real-world politics causing some fans to ponder Tomino's motivation with his depictions in the show. "Polity Against Zaku", a group opposed to the airing of "Zaku", decries the show's depiction of Zeon despot Degwin's inability to control his military as "ignorant revisionist commentary" and already have sent petitions to the office of producer Sunrise Entertainment. Regardless, little can be done to quell "Zakumania.""

Since the series's hit success, toymaker Bandai has released its first line of "Zaku"-themed plastic model kits. These kits, known by fans as "Zakpla", are 1/100 scale models of the fighting robots seen on TV molded onto plastic spruces for the consumer to assemble on their own.\n\nAlready the titular "Red Comet" model kit has sold out in most stores leaving the noticeably unpopular "Gundam" alone on shelves nationwide. It is believed that the Zaku's rugged, utilitarian design mixed with Lt. Cmdr. Char's charismatic red paint scheme have instilled the Zaku as signature of "cool" with the modern youth. The Gundam's red, blue, and white aesthetic is seen as unappealing with its bright, toy-like colors being seen as "immature" and "too western" by viewers. Already Bandai has announced a second series featuring an alternate-color Gundam along with an advanced lineup of Zaku mobile suit kits."

With three new powerful Gundams at their disposal, namely Gundam NT-1, Gundam GP01, and Gundam MK-II, the ghosts of the past are once again ready to bring corruption and degeneracy to the Solar System. To add to this threat, another group of Federation remanents called the Titans, led by Admiral Jamitov, is also preparing an assault from their secret base in Pezun. His trusted henchman, Captain Scirocco, who was once a legislator of the Jupiter Democratic Party and a misguided fanatic of absolute democracy, has devised the sinister plan of nuking Zeon's Fleet Review using his machine of abhorrence, the O Gundam.\n\nHowever, our hero Char Aznable and his mentee Kamille Bidan, come prepared. With a new mobile suit named "Hizack", which is a vastly improved version of the mighty Zaku, Char stands ready to force out corruption from the universe and defend the sphere of colonies united under the goals of self-sufficiency and co-prosperity.\n\nIn an interview with Director Tomino, he expressed his thanks to the Home Ministry which provided an abundant amount of funding that allowed him to make the new series."

The people of China wish to, therefore, return the favor.\n\nThe Republican government understands that its Japanese counterpart is currently reeling from financial troubles caused by an internal crisis. It is our good-faith desire to assist Japan by taking over the administrations of Xikang and Yunnan.

While most of China's coastal regions were under rule from Nanjing, some smaller warlords to the southwest had remained de-facto independent. These Army generals had gained their status through the Japanese policy of limiting Nanjing's direct authority in the region. The generals were free to do as they pleased within their remote fiefdoms, without as much as needing to inform the central government of their actions. While this had served to satisfy Tokyo's fears of severe insubordination and pleased some, the Republic of China felt increasingly spited by this state of affairs. It became increasingly common for the Chinese government to state their wishes to integrate the southwestern provinces.\n\nThe fear of increasing centralisation in China was certainly enough to cause significant alarm in Tokyo. However, some ministers were wary of trying the patience of the Republic of China for much longer. With another demand for annexation on the Prime Minister's desk, his cabinet and the Imperial Diet was in agreement that the matter needed to be firmly settled immediately."

What mattered was that today, the "delusions of a madman" stands as a fait accompli, amassing momentum with every passing day; today, the blood-soaked banner of insurrection rises high above what was once the Republic of China. Nobody had seen it coming. Not Nanjing, and certainly not Tokyo.\n\nAlready loyal Republican remnants are hurtling towards Beijing en masse. Bickering has erupted in the Imperial Diet over just who was responsible for the catastrophe. The Prime Minister has disappeared, locked in conversation with the military and a number of his closest advisors.

Long Yun, was of course not among the captured. He, and most of his personal troops had charged out from his last stronghold in Yunnan, only to be met with a hail of gunfire. Very few of his other forces had chosen to accept a siege, let alone surrender. There was little left of the army Long Yun had built, neither here, nor in any part of China that he had conquered in only a few months. The Warlord had been pushed back all the way from the Manchurian border, growing only more deranged and violent as his once victorious armies were forced back into Yunnan. Once there, they had made their last stand. Only those that the IJA had managed to capture survived, and once they had been questioned, execution was to be their only fate. A few trials were scheduled for the remnants of Yun's officer corps, which Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] hoped would serve as a fitting end to their brief rule of China. In truth, most felt that the entire matter should be wrapped up with as much haste as they could afford.\n\nChina, for the second time in 20 years, had experienced a full scale war. City and countryside alike had been ravaged by the conflict, particularly as Yun had dug in to hold ground. The Japanese, as well as the remnants of the ROC armies had also experienced heavy casualties. No more was this the case as when the fighting to regain China had become increasingly vicious. The crusade had ended successfully, but even so, it was wrapped in a mantle of past failures.

Certain positions have taken hold regarding the shape of a new China, or if there will be a new China at all. The administration is hesitant towards all options, and wishes to inspect their consequences thoroughly.\n\nThat said, it can be seen from this international tragedy, the status quo was not stable and a decision must be made, for the rebuilding of China must begin as soon as possible if we are to regain our losses.\n\nThe only logical choice is, of course, establish a new order, to learn from the mistakes we made before all of this chaos enraptured our continent. We shall establish temporary IJA Administrations in the areas suffering from extreme unrest and resistance, while the rest shall be returned to the Republic of China, keeping it easier for our careful guidance.\n\nThere is a singular China for us and the world to deal with now, however, a careful amount of autonomy should be given to Political Councils in the Southwest and North of the country to ensure it cannot unite against us again. It is difficult to disagree on the necessity of such measures and this plan would ensure we do not fall in the extreme camps that have formed around this issue.\n\nWe must stay firm and consistent in our vision, lest we fall prey to the mistakes we made in the recreation of China the last time.

"We do not wish to burden the Japanese government," it says, a note tinged by the tone of terror and excitement. "Chinese matters need to stay in Chinese hands."\n\nWith the Japanese diplomatic efforts rebuffed, the government cannot pursue the course of intervention for now. The Imperial Japanese Army, with its assortment of hot-headed generals and officers, are the loudest voices in favor. The Navy quietly nods its assent. However, the Prime Minister pretends not to hear these complaints. The Chinese are doing the same thing, after all.\n\nIf the opportunity presents it, however, the Chinese government may be persuaded to part with its sovereignty in return for its survival.

More worryingly, the messages from Gao's government imply an urgency to the situation, and we suspect that more than the stability of the Southwest is at stake.\n\nWhile the Gao government's inability to control dissent and lawlessness is a displeasure to both our leadership and the wider Co-Prosperity Sphere, it has become clear that the Empire cannot trust them with this crisis any further.

The rebellion under Long Yun and his so-called National Protection Army has advanced at a shockingly rapid rate. It is clear now that Sichuan is definitely under rebel control, and other more central provinces are either occupied or in dispute.\n\n2. There is still a chance for the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China to defeat the insurgency on its own. However, in the worst case, Nanjing may well be lost before Imperial forces can intervene. Needless to say, this is a great danger: to lose China is to lose the whole of Greater East Asia, as we well know.\n\n3. To stave off the possibility of a worse outcome, Japan will resummon the most Japanophilic officials in China to reestablish the North China Political Council, which will rule North China temporarily under Japan's direct control. Nanjing has already been sent a notification of this action, and our forces have assumed responsibility for the territories in question.\n\n4. Daihon'ei [the Imperial General Headquarters] is mobilizing our divisions and fleets in the Home Islands to prepare against a worst-case scenario requiring our immediate attention. It will not be long before our forces are in the right position. Furthermore, Daitōashō [the Greater East Asia Ministry] is sending decrees to the allied nations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to requisition their assistance against Long Yun's anarchic rebellion.\n\n5. For now, the Imperial Government will prepare and wait until RGOC begs for help or is lost. Let it not be said of us that we are a puppet-master with no regard for the will of our allied nations: we will not intervene until Nanjing tells us to. With how things have played out, even letting them hang is likely to end in our favour."

 #INTERREGNUM EVENTS
 jap_interregnum.1.t: "The Fall of Ino"
 jap_interregnum.1.d: "In the wake of the recent scandals following the uncovering of widespread corruption in government, an unprecedented political earthquake has shaken the very core of the Japanese Empire. Every newspaper in Japan and in the entirety of the Sphere is reporting that His Excellency the Prime Minister Ino Hiroya has been forced to resign following a vote of no confidence in the Imperial Diet, and the news is rapidly spreading around the world, as concerns rise about a possible shockwave of political instability spreading to all of Asia.\n\nThe position of Ino itself as Prime Minister was a result of a tenuous compromise, resulting from an attempt to contain the influence of the Imperial Japanese Army in the civilian government by finding a mediation between the various wings of the Taisei Yokusankai. However, such a fragile situation was shattered, and Japan's delicate political equilibrium has been gravely upset. Few commentators dare make predictions about the future in such a volatile situation, but the gears of the Japanese political machine are already starting to set themselves in motion to react to the crisis."
 jap_interregnum.1.a: "Politics is a harsh mistress."
 jap_interregnum.2.t: "A New Prime Minister?"
 jap_interregnum.2.d: "Emergency meetings have already begun in the House of Peers and in the House of Representatives to find a replacement for Ino. While Japanese politics are dominated by the Taisei Yokusankai, the party itself is bitterly split among numerous rival cliques, each representing different interest groups with different visions for the future of the Empire and the Sphere. While the Emperor nominates the Prime Minister, the Diet has a massive influence over His Majesty's decision, as the Diet can always vote a candidate they don't like out of office. However, most commentators both foreign and domestic agree that a new PM will be chosen soon, as had occured when Tōjō and Kido were forced to resign in the past.\n\nTwo major candidates have sprung forth from the ranks of the Taisei Yokusankai - Kaya Okinori and Ikeda Masanosuke. Kaya, formerly a Minister of Finance, belongs to the faction of the Yokusankai termed 'technocrats', advocating for further centralization and state intervention in Japanese economy, while at the same time removing the last remnants of military influence from the government of Japan. The other candidate, Ikeda, comes from the conservative wing of the Yokusankai, the one to which former Prime Minister Ino also belonged - a section of the party closer to the Army and much less prone to reform."
 jap_interregnum.2.a: "Kaya?"
 jap_interregnum.2.b: "Ikeda?"
 jap_interregnum.2.c: "Kido?"
 jap_interregnum.3.t: "Kaya Tries to Secure Backing"
 jap_interregnum.3.d: "In the somewhat confused situation after the fall of Ino, the technocrat faction has been trying to bolster their ranks and wrestle control of the Yokusankai. Rallying around Kaya Okinori, their candidate for PM, their voices are becoming louder and louder in the party, to the point where some speculate that their ultimate victory is close at hand.\n\nKaya himself has been releasing more and more bold statements in interview, with some commenting that he speaks as if he were Prime Minister already. Some murmuring is rising from representatives of the conservative wing of the Yokusankai, and there is fears that the technocrats are attempting a takeover of the party. However, it seems like Kaya's bid for the position has never been stronger."
 jap_interregnum.3.a: "Could reform be the way to go?"
 jap_interregnum.4.t: "Kaya's Not Very Well Liked, Turns Out"
 jap_interregnum.4.d: "In recent days, Kaya's attempts to cement his position as candidate for Prime Minister have been frustrated by constant and fierce resistance from the other wings of the Yokusankai. It seems that the politically aggressive stance of the technocrats has obtained the opposite effect of their goal, as it alienated the rest of the party and provoked backlash from the conservatives, now rallying more and more around Ikeda.\n\nSlammed by pro-conservative newspapers, Kaya has been forced to moderate his stance and go back on some of his earlier stances, and it seems like the offensive of the technocrats has already been exhausted. With Kaya's bid for the position weaker by the day, it appears likely that the new Prime Minister won't be a technocrat."
 jap_interregnum.4.a: "Well, at least he tried."
 jap_interregnum.5.t: "Ikeda Tries His Hand"
 jap_interregnum.5.d: "Among the conservatives of the Taisei Yokusankai, Ikeda Masanosuke has always been a prominent figure, so his bid for Prime Minister was a natural development after the fall of the previous government. Ikeda has been playing his cards more and more openly, appearing in interview on television and newspapers more and more frequently. Ikeda appeals to conservatives especially for his commitment to stability and preservation of policies that were successful during Ino's time, with slow reforms and a continued working relationship with the Imperial Armed Forces and maintaining a strong hold over the nations of the Sphere.\n\nA smaller base of support for Ikeda is found among the more liberal members of the Yokusankai, especially as Ikeda seems to be the only man capable of containing the ambitious and centralizing projects of the technocrats. However, Ikeda has been trying to find some mediation and compromise with Kaya's faction, and a successful compromise, no matter how weak, would be a major victory for him and the conservatives. With his position in the Yokusankai becoming stronger and stronger, it seems inevitable that he will be the next man to be chosen as Prime Minister."
 jap_interregnum.5.a: "The Kokutai must be preserved."
 jap_interregnum.6.t: "Kishi Sabotages Ikeda"
 jap_interregnum.6.d: "An open letter published by the popular newspaper Asahi Shimbun is causing yet another shift in Japanese politics, largely because of the man signing it - Kishi Nobusuke. The former Japanese administrator in Manchuria, Kishi has maintained a strong influence in Japanese politics, as one of the leading representatives of the technocrat faction - however, the high esteem he enjoys among the general public and especially among Japan's political class have allowed him to seriously set back Ikeda's effort to gain the position of Prime Minister.\n\nIn his piece, Kishi harshly criticized Ikeda and the conservatives supporting it, painting him as a weak willed political lame duck that will bring only further stagnation, denying Japan the reform it needs - while at the same time drawing a direct line from the corruption and ineffectiveness of Ino's government to Ikeda, himself often viewed as the protégé of Ino. Such a strong attack has weakened Ikeda's position in the Yokusankai, and his attempts to find some mediation with other factions are now destined to remain a failure."
 jap_interregnum.6.a: "There's no way he becomes Prime Minister now."
 jap_interregnum.7.t: "Deadlock"
 jap_interregnum.7.d: "So far, it seems like every attempt to put a new Prime Minister in office have been met with failure. Political infighting in the Taisei Yokusankai have prevented the two major candidates, Kaya and Ikeda, from gaining a strong enough base of support, and Kido's attempt to nominate the Prime Minister by going directly through the Emperor has been slammed by the Diet. A dreaded word is being repeated more and more often by newspapers and television, in its numerous variants, all with the same meaning - political gridlock, impasse, stalemate, deadlock.\n\nThese new developments have been accompanied by an aura of pessimism spreading across Japan's government, and the country watches in fear as the unclear political direction might have ill effects on the economy as well. A solution must be found, and in times like these, the only solution can be compromise of a particular type - the one that leaves all parties unsatisfied."
 jap_interregnum.7.a: "This cannot continue."
 jap_interregnum.8.t: "Kido Suggests Kogure Budayuu"
 jap_interregnum.8.d: "To resolve the political snag that the Japanese government has found itself into, an old acquaintance of Japanese politics has stepped into the limelight - former Prime Minister and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Marquis Kido Kōichi. A staunch technocrat and Ino's predecessor, Kido has largely remained in the shadows of Japanese politics during recent years, after being ousted following his aggressive attempts to eliminate IJA influence in the civilian government.\n\nKido has stepped forth to the Emperor, proposing the name of Kogure Budayuu as a possible replacement for Ino. A relatively uninfluential member of the Yokusankai, Budayuu has served as a minister in Kido's cabinet. While Kido's strong influence in the Privy Council might mean that Budayuu could get nominated as Prime Minister by the Emperor himself, bypassing the Diet, this has already sparked a strong reaction from the sections of the Yokusankai that are more hostile to Kido."
 jap_interregnum.8.a: "Perhaps the Emperor will step in."
 jap_interregnum.9.t: "The Diet Threatens No Confidence In Kogure"
 jap_interregnum.9.d: "A unified statement has been released by members of the Diet of the Taisei Yokusankai, stating that the party will not support the nomination of Budayuu as Prime Minister, instead immediately passing a vote of no confidence - signifying the end of Budayuu's tenure before it even begins. Such a bold statement is especially surprising, considering that it might mean defying the will of the Privy Council, and by extension, the Emperor himself.\n\nSome members of the Privy Council are already calling this a bluff - the Yokusankai wants to be left free to play its petty political games, but there's no way they would dare openly attacking the Privy Council in such an outrageous way. However, some are advising caution - if the Imperial Diet is serious, then a vote of no confidence would be a devastating blow the Privy Council's political authority, potentially discrediting Kido and risking his position as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. This puts Kido in front of a quite difficult choice - should he back down, or call the Diet's bluff?"
 jap_interregnum.9.a: "This is too risky - we have to back down."
 jap_interregnum.9.b: "Call the Diet's bluff!"
 jap_interregnum.10.t: "An Insider?"
 jap_interregnum.10.d: "The recent snag in which the Japanese government has found itself is a source of embarrassment for the whole nation, in the eyes of Asia and of the world. Heated negotiations between the Diet and the Privy Council, as well as within the Yokusankai itself, have so far gone nowhere. However, another group of politicians have weaseled into the negotiations - the clique of Yokusankai closer to former Prime Minister Ino Hiroya.\n\nWhile Ino himself was a national conservative, much like his protégé Ikeda, he was able to create a stable political equilibrium by compromising with the opposing factions of the Yokusankai, especially the technocrats now rallying around Kaya. Ino's involvement in the talks has been kept largely on the quiet side, but it might be the key to solving this mess."
 jap_interregnum.10.a: "A bit ironic."
 jap_interregnum.11.t: "A Suggestion"
 jap_interregnum.11.d: "Newspapers report that a new option is on the table, likely proposed by Ino Hiroya himself. Aichi Kiichi, a former minister of Ino's cabinet, is well known for his completely equal distance from all the major factions and cliques of the Yokusankai - his lack of charisma and commitment to a faction preventing him from initially being considered as a candidate to replace Ino. However, in this peculiar situation, Aichi might be the perfect person to fill the political rift that is dividing the Yokusankai.\n\nThe reactions from Kaya's and Ikeda's clique has been lukewarm, but it appears that there might be really no other option to get out of this mire. Kido Kōichi and the Privy Council have also expressed tentative agreement with Aichi's nomination. While nobody is truly satisfied or happy, with every passing day it seems more and more likely that Aichi will become the new Prime Minister."
 jap_interregnum.11.a: "This is really getting exhausting."
 jap_interregnum.12.t: "The Emperor Refuses Kido!"
 jap_interregnum.12.d: "Kido's attempt to install Budayuu as Prime Minister has ended in failure as the Emperor has refused to nominate him. Newspapers are praising the Emperor's decision, as it seems like His Imperial Majesty was unwilling to go through with a nomination from above, which would contradict Japan's democratic institutions. In reality, it appears clear that the Emperor simply wished to avoid a worsening of the political crisis, as the Diet had promised a vote of no confidence - and there was no way to tell if it was a bluff or not.\n\nWhile predictable, this development is somewhat embarrassing to Kido and the Privy Council - however, many feel like Kido's plan failing to start protected the Lord Keeper's political standing from a far more devastating blow coming from the Imperial Diet."
 jap_interregnum.12.a: "Well, this went nowhere."
 jap_interregnum.13.t: "A Counterproposal"
 jap_interregnum.13.d: "In a last ditch attempt to retake control of the situation, Kido has set forth before the Emperor a second candidate for the position of Prime Minister - Aichi Kiichi. A long time minister of Ino's cabinet, Aichi's name has been proposed during backroom talks between the Privy Council and the Imperial Diet, and is much more likely to be approved by the Yokusankai and the Diet.\n\nQuite interestingly, Aichi's biggest advantage is his failure to commit to any faction of the Taisei Yokusankai. Equally distant from every major faction of the party, Aiichi served his tenures silently and without much ado - and would be thus the perfect solution to drag Japanese politics out of this rising dumpster fire. Faced with the necessity to act to resolve the crisis quickly, the Emperor has agreed to nominate Aiichi as Prime Minister, and it seems like the majority of the Taisei Yokusankai isn't willing to put forth a vote of no confidence."
 jap_interregnum.13.a: "Hopefully this is the end of it."
 jap_interregnum.14.t: "Aichi Kiichi Appointed Prime Minister"
 jap_interregnum.14.d: "After one last round of meetings and negotiations, it seems like the Imperial Diet has finally found a way out of the political dead end. Aichi Kiichi has been chosen by the Emperor to fill the position of Prime Minister with near unanimous support from the Taisei Yokusankai - with the various wings of the party that had bitterly fought until recently now united at last.\n\nNewspapers across Japan and the Sphere celebrate this development, as a testament to Yokusankai, representing the will of the nation, overcoming petty factionalism and political infighting. A cautious, tentative optimism is spreading across Japan - but for those in the upper echelons of the Yokusankai, this is no time for celebration, let alone for relaxing."
 jap_interregnum.14.a: "I'm sure Aichi will do a fine job."
 jap_interregnum.15.t: "The Interregnum"
 jap_interregnum.15.d: "Just few days into Aichi's tenure as Prime Minister, the vague air of optimism that had spread in Japan has dissolved in the wind. The process of forming a cabinet caused endless bickering in the Taisei Yokusankai, ending up with a patchwork cabinet made up of ministers from several different cliques that barely wish to speak to each other - what's worse, it seems that murmurs have risen from multiple factions of the party, plots to overthrow Aichi's government.\n\nThe Imperial Diet, the Privy Council, the Taisei Yokusankai - all are a pack of wolves, turning on each other after being left without a leader. While a facade of unity and optimism is paraded on newspapers and public appearances, and while ostensibly the party stands united behind Aichi, the truth is far different. The real struggle for power in the Japanese government is only starting, and no one knows how it will end."
 jap_interregnum.15.a: "The Interregnum has begun."
 jap_interregnum.16.t: "The National Polity"
 jap_interregnum.16.d: "It can be difficult to distinguish between truth and rumors in the whispers echoing through the Diet. But many deputies do have a knack for telling when conflict is brewing behind the scene. As the lame duck prime minister watches impotently, the Yokusankai's main factions sharpen knives and try to figure out the best angle of attack on their enemies.\n\nChief among them are the technocrats. Their leader Kaya has not given up on his dream of imposing a new order on Japan's economy, with or without political support. Independent deputies weigh the possible benefits from supporting him with the dangers of making an enemy of Ikeda and his conservative bloc. Independent deputies that have freed themselves of factional shackles are being dragged against their will back into the Yokusankai's civil war.\n\nThis dance between both sides is complicated by the emergence of a third power bloc. The indefatigable Takagi has struggled for quite some time now to establish a third path between the conservatives' stagnation and the technocrats' dangerous intertwining of government and industry. A small but growing reformist faction enthusiastically supports the former Navy officer's program. By untangling the economy from Japan's political and military elites, the corruption and instability of the Yokusankai can be brought to an end. Once a dormant part of the conservative coalition, the reformist faction has been given a shot in the arm by the failure of both conservatives and technocrats to grab the prime minister's office. Smelling blood in the water, the reformists have begun dreaming with renewed vigor.\n\nThrough all this, rumors that former prime minister Kido Kōichi has not yet given up his radical agenda. While the majority of the technocrats support Kaya publicly, the perspective of a transformed Yokusankai remains a very appealing one. The fusion of total political and economical control with Army backing remains an intoxicating idea among the chamber's most ambitious.\n\nNow, the rumor goes, all sides are preparing their move. It seems the interregnum ceasefire is ending."
 jap_interregnum.16.a: "Gentlemen, show cards."
 jap_interregnum.17.t: "Takagi's Gambit"
 jap_interregnum.17.d: "The inclusion of the Japanese reformists into the Yokusankai came out of the darkest days of the war, where a united front of all Japanese politicians seemed indispensable. Victory did not bring liberalization of the economy, but an ever increasing bubble of economical development for the greatest Japanese conglomerates. Vast quantities of contracts with the government and the Army brought endless resources to feed corrupt businessmen.\n\nThe reformists, once swept aside by a tidal wave of money and collusion, were thought to be absorbed in the Yokusankai's conservative faction. The very idea of opposing the Army and the conglomerates looked impossible in the new Japan. But now, under the capable leadership of Takagi Sōkichi, the reformists have awoken. Their goal of securing the prime ministership looks like a pipe dream. The reformists command few members of the Yokusankai, and arrayed against them is the full might of Japan's economic establishment as well as the leaders of its army.\n\nAnd so, Takagi prepares an ambitious gambit. With a little help from his Navy contacts, the technocrat's ties to the Army could be exploited for political gains. On the other hand, many reformists stubbornly cling to Ino's conservative coalition. Why not attempt to peel off as many reformists as possible from the dying conservative faction? Both paths are fraught with risk, but desperate times require hard decisions."
 jap_interregnum.17.a: "Finish off the conservatives."
 jap_interregnum.17.b: "Hit the Army hard."
 jap_interregnum.18.t: "Motion of Censure Against Ino"
 jap_interregnum.18.d: "Every day that the Diet is in session, former Prime Minister Ino and his associates dutifully take their seat in the national assembly. Ever since the collapse of the Ino premiership, these relics of a previous era have been mercifully left to rot in obscurity as the chamber has moved on to new bitter disputes.\n\nTakagi and his associates believe it is now time to revisit the disastrous Ino era to drag the conservatives through the mud some more. By bringing forward a motion of censure in the chamber against Ino, Takagi hopes to dig more hole into the conservatives' sinking ship before Ikeda manages to right it. Passing such a motion is going to be a tall order; the tiny reformist faction will need to convince the remaining reformists within the conservative faction to join. Support from independents and technocrats will also be important. All the conservatives would need to do is poke a few points of this loose coalition to make it break down. But the reformist dream of finally tearing up the old conservative faction and scoop up as many reformist sympathizer as possible. And so, Takagi's gambit begins..."
 jap_interregnum.18.a: "Pull in Ino's allies."
 jap_interregnum.18.b: "Bribes and threats."
 jap_interregnum.19.t: "Pull In Ino's Allies"
 jap_interregnum.19.d: ""You sure?" Takagi said to the receiver. "You are, after all, betraying the former Prime Minister." He sat in his study, the telephone before him. Today's agenda was the extraction of Ino's soon-to-be-former allies. He had everything against them. From phone calls, financial records, and photographs with prominent Army and Navy officials, he had got most of them by the scruff of their necks. As a soldier, Takagi knew that an unfired gun by itself was a potent threat. Now, he needed only to pull and prod.\n\n"Yes!" The voice on the other side said, almost yelling. "Yes. Sorry for the shouting."\n\n"Don't worry about that. You just need to vote for my candidacy on the Diet floor. After that, I will ensure that no proof of your involvement will make its way to the press."\n\n"Thank you, Takagi!"\n\n"Really, it's no trouble. A favor for a favor." Takagi sat back, his fingers curling the wires. "Don't worry. Do as I say, and I will burn the evidence before your eyes if you really want to be sure."\n\n"No need, Takagi. I know that you are a man of your word."\n\nAt this, Takagi smirked."
 jap_interregnum.19.a: "I can't be that famous yet."
 jap_interregnum.20.t: "Disgrace Ino's Allies"
 jap_interregnum.20.d: "A plain, barren package, wrapped in layers of brown paper and black plastic. Destination: Tokyo Shimbun offices. Takagi had decided that if the carrot did not work, the stick would have to do. Some Deputies in the Diet still scoffed at his warnings, with the most infuriating ones refusing to return his calls. No matter. Tomorrow, the dominoes would fall. The Ino clique would no longer claim sole control over the Yokusankai. Not after today.\n\nTomorrow, the editor of the Shimbun would wake to this package on his desk. There, he should carefully open it, revealing the financial records, phone calls, photographs, and other incriminating evidence against specific Deputies. The whistle that he rang would sound upon miles and miles. In such a crowded political environment as Japan's - that could only mean well.\n\nTakagi needed only to think about the label he would put on the package. He pursed his lips, picked up his fountain pen, and wrote."
 jap_interregnum.20.a: "FOR THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC INTERESTS"
 jap_interregnum.21.t: "Bribes and Threats"
 jap_interregnum.21.d: "Carrots and sticks. It's the way the Yokusankai has always done things - whisper sweet nothings into one ear and pull the other. So it is with the Ino Clique, now staunch Ikeda supporters and with ties to the Establishment in their speeches and their checkbooks - the old way has always proved more persuasive than its alternatives, and when persuasion fails, well... This attitude does not translate so well to the rest of the Diet, whom the Ikeda Clique quickly sets out to recruit by means of what can only be described as 'throwing their financial weight around'. It can't be corruption if it's necessary for the preservation of the Nation, after all.\n\nIt turns out the Diet has little patience for the yes-men who watched their leader tie the Government to the hated Army-Navy complex, and over the next month 237 letters are received by various members associating themselves with Ikeda's agenda comparing them to traitors, militarists, and Western double-agents. Kaya and Takagi even take a breather from their internecine strife to present a united front against Ikeda's antics. Representatives from both cliques lambast the Ino-worshippers, as they are coming to be known, as failures who deluded themselves into thinking the old methods are somehow going to save Japan by repeating its mistakes. Ikeda's men are angry, the Old Guard Inoites see opportunity - and the tongues of flame begin to lick at Ikeda's bid for power before it has even begun."
 jap_interregnum.21.a: "Those fools!"
 jap_interregnum.22.t: "The Diet Brawls"
 jap_interregnum.22.d: "Power invites jealousy. Jealousy invites scheming. Scheming invites struggle. Ikeda must contend with the rest of the establishment he is attempting to co-opt; but his rivals in the Inoite Old Guard have other plans for him. A plan is drafted in the dead of night, and a host of accusations against Ikeda is leveled: that his ties to the Japanese Army and Navy, cultivated over connections through the Inoites, are no coincidence. That he is really just a mouthpiece for a new form of military control, leveled over a helpless Diet and country. That he intends to purge the Kaya and Takagi cliques from power dominate the YSK - for if the old order was purged through fear and rumors and scandal, surely it intends to restore by force what has been lost? The speech is given first thing in the morning, and an already chill atmosphere in the Diet quickly turns fiery.\n\nThe speech does not go down well, to say the least. Inoites accuse their peers and each other of betrayal, the Kaya and Takagi cliques take token potshots at each other and chaos reigns within the tight confines of the Diet's reserved power structures. Representative turns against representative. As a particularly violent session of criticism of the Ino regime turns into an irregular fistfight between Politicians, the nation's cameras and press capture the image of a helpless Ikeda watching his clique turn into a glorified Yakuza chapter. And Ikeda watches his dreams of restoring some sense of order to Japanese politics burn to the ground."
 jap_interregnum.22.a: "The situation has developed, and not necessarily to our advantage."
 jap_interregnum.23.t: "Contacts in the Navy"
 jap_interregnum.23.d: "The Japanese admiralty has often had a reputation for aloofness in the last decade. A vocal minority within the Navy has constantly heaped criticism on the Diet and Army for their handling of internal problems within the Sphere. This attitude, combined with the Navy's weak presence in the Yokusankai has left it in the political wilderness since the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nNow a new consensus has emerged in the Navy that its political isolation is detrimental both to its interests and Japan's future as a whole. In Takagi's reformists, the admirals see a serious partner able to shake up the political situation. Word on the street is that several reformist politicians have been seen alternating between the Diet's chambers and the admiralty in the last few weeks. Speculation abounds; most bookmakers put their money on an intervention by the Navy publicly condemning the Army's ineptness in the Diet. Such a brazen public declaration could derail the Diet's work, or help the Reformists' challenge to the status quo. Tokyo's intelligentsia awaits further developments."
 jap_interregnum.23.a: "Let's see the admirals land into the Diet."
 jap_interregnum.24.t: "Blame the Army"
 jap_interregnum.24.d: ""Corrupt, dangerously incapable, a threat to national safety." The admiral's broadside into the Army and its business partners has left most of the Diet too stunned to react this morning. It's a rare event in Japanese politics for a faction to declare so boldly its contempt for its rivals, and now many members of both the Yokusankai and the independents whisper to one another that the admiralty has gone too far.\n\nOn the other hand, reformists in the Yokusankai have stood behind the Navy's condemnation. One after the others, the members of Takagi's clique have come out with reports, data, evidence and testimonies on the sheer dysfunction of the Army's economic work. And so the Navy and their reformist partners worked. Heavy pieces of evidence were screened by well rehearsed speeches and testimonies. Any attempt at counteracting the deluge of accusations ran into carefully placed rhetorical mines.\n\nThe only way for the Army to salvage the situation was to come out with its own show of force. Already the technocrats' position themselves as the Army's defenders, as the conservative coalition keeps a low profile to avoid more responsibility for the Ino administration's mess. Now the capital waits to see the Army and technocrats' reply."
 jap_interregnum.24.a: "The Army fails to make a convincing case."
 jap_interregnum.24.b: "The Army answers every accusation tit for tat."
 jap_interregnum.25.t: "The Convenient Scapegoat"
 jap_interregnum.25.d: "Kaya and his supporters should probably have sat this one out, was the public consensus. Their attempt to defend the Army backfired as Takagi's reformist casually glanced off any criticism of the Navy's conduct. The technocrats' weak argumentation has in turn shown how desperate they are for Army support in the face of a hostile Diet. While the conservatives have mostly pulled through the Navy criticism unscathed, the technocrats' grovelling to defend the Army has not helped their image.\n\nThe reformists' partner in the business community have also greatly enjoyed the performance. The Army makes a convenient scapegoat for economic ills brought in large part by concentration of power into the conglomerates. Unable to directly shake their rivals up, the second row of the Japanese business elite has decided that killing the special relationship between the Army and the titans of the Japanese economy is the best way to topple the latter. By bleeding repeatedly the nexus of corrupt money, the reformists continue to signal their free market chops to any potential partner. More and more take note of the upstart faction and its quest to shake up Japanese institutions."

 jap_interregnum.26.d: "Another day, another unproductive row between Army and Navy. It would be quite an accomplishment if both institutions agreed to disagree. As it stands, a combination of institutional rivalry, divergent priorities and conflict of interests makes the average man of the sea unwilling to cooperate with his landlubber counterparts.\n\nIt matters little which political faction has dragged the rivalry to the Diet, for the eternal struggle has occupied most of the day's agenda. Proxies of both side among the reformist, conservative and technocrats have spent their time arguing that one side or the other was the root of everything wrong with modern Japanese society. Some independent members of parliament have left for the day, convinced that nothing of importance could possibly come out of the mudslinging.\n\nIn the Diet proper, whoever it is that has set in motion the day's conflict slumps in his chair. Things have not gone to plan."

 jap_interregnum.27.t: "Ikeda's Dilemma"
 jap_interregnum.27.d: "Ikeda Masanosuke is a man of few words, and he has even fewer to spare for fools. A career in journalism taught him the value of concise prose, and the Yokusankai, well... Perhaps this is why the scene unfolding before him is so deeply discomfiting on a personal level. After all, a man who suffers not the foolish is fundamentally disinclined to having his colleagues put on 'village idiot' kabuki masks and dance around each other, howling all the while. (Not that he has anything against kabuki dances, low-brow as they might be.) Day and night the Diet churns with intrigue, as the Sphere burns and its people plot - is this how Ino saw his nation going as he handed in his resignation letter?\n\nHe ponders the path ahead. Clean and symmetrical, like the katakana classes he used to do in his youth. He never liked those classes - the world was easier to handle than the infinite fall of a radical stroke. Some of those men in the Yokusankai were close to Ino, barely avoiding being dragged down with him. They might turn to Ikeda, if he plays his cards right. A speech in the Diet persuading those who still believe in the old way of things, of what the Chinese call wuwei, to stand firm might just throw him into the spotlight, and into a position where he can begin to fix things. On the other hand, Ino's clique has been badly compromised by the Scandal - it might be better to start over, to form a new party entirely, and the Reformists who aren't looking to Takagi have shown a somewhat conciliatory hand.\n\nIkeda thinks for long days and longer nights. Then he begins to act."
 jap_interregnum.27.a: "The old wagon shall ride new roads. Appeal to Ino's clique."
 jap_interregnum.27.b: "Fresh barrels, fresh sake. Appeal to the Reformists."
 jap_interregnum.28.t: "Shore Up Support"
 jap_interregnum.28.d: "The representative's face is neon-red as he takes the podium to invite his next speaker to the stage. It's a quiet club in downtown Tokyo, a solidly established institution of the floating world, and the remnants of the Yokusankai loyalists are gathered here to drink, talk shop - and forget about their political troubles. Not talking about something doesn't make it go away, of course, but to mention that would be in itself a faux pas, and so it is left untouched. This is Japanese politics: to artfully dodge questions when they are posed, to maintain respect for authority by remaining submissive to its abuses. Like all norms, it is widely adhered to, and that means it can be manipulated.\n\nIkeda takes the stage and starts to speak. He calls on the audience to remember the days of Ino: stability was messy and founded on complicity, but it was stable - and it was better than the present chaos. He outlines in some detail his own plan - by working with the Army (never collaborating or, gods forbid, submitting) and consolidating the Diet, it might be possible to reweave a whole cloth from the disparate threads of the factions. And he pauses - here his speech diverges, two separate threads unravelled from the same fabric. He can offer the usual 'generous concessions' as means of securing loyalty - but lately Ikeda has dreamt bigger dreams than mere loyalty. He has drafted a plan for a true reform of the Japanese Diet's clique-party system, one that will ensure the brokenness of the old system will never be repeated. But money shouts where principles whisper. Which tone shall it be?"
 jap_interregnum.28.a: "Money."
 jap_interregnum.28.b: "Reform."
 jap_interregnum.29.t: "Bribes and Threats"
 jap_interregnum.29.d: "Carrots and sticks. It's the way the Yokusankai has always done things - whisper sweet nothings into one ear and pull the other. So it is with the Ino Clique, now staunch Ikeda supporters and with ties to the Establishment in their speeches and their checkbooks - the old way has always proved more persuasive than its alternatives, and when persuasion fails, well... This attitude does not translate so well to the rest of the Diet, whom the Ikeda Clique quickly sets out to recruit by means of what can only be described as 'throwing their financial weight around'. It can't be corruption if it's necessary for the preservation of the Nation, after all.\n\nIt turns out the Diet has little patience for the yes-men who watched their leader tie the Government to the hated Army-Navy complex, and over the next month 237 letters are received by various members associating themselves with Ikeda's agenda comparing them to traitors, militarists, and Western double-agents. Kaya and Takagi even take a breather from their internecine strife to present a united front against Ikeda's antics. Representatives from both cliques lambast the Ino-worshippers, as they are coming to be known, as failures who deluded themselves into thinking the old methods are somehow going to save Japan by repeating its mistakes. Ikeda's men are angry, the Old Guard Inoites see opportunity - and the tongues of flame begin to lick at Ikeda's bid for power before it has even begun."
 jap_interregnum.29.a: "Those fools!"
 jap_interregnum.30.t: "Diet Brawl"
 jap_interregnum.30.d: "Power invites jealousy. Jealousy invites scheming. Scheming invites struggle. Ikeda must contend with the rest of the establishment he is attempting to co-opt: but his rivals in the Inoite Old Guard have other plans for him. A plan is drafted in the dead of night, and a host of accusations against Ikeda is leveled: that his ties to the Japanese Army and Navy, cultivated over connections through the Inoites, are no coincidence. That he is really just a mouthpiece for a new form of military control, leveled over a helpless Diet and country. That he intends to purge the Kaya and Takagi cliques from power dominate the YSK - for if the old order was purged through fear and rumors and scandal, surely it intends to restore by force what has been lost? The speech is given first thing in the morning, and an already chill atmosphere in the Diet quickly turns fiery.\n\nThe speech does not go down well, to say the least. Inoites accuse their peers and each other of betrayal, the Kaya and Takagi cliques take token potshots at each other and chaos reigns within the tight confines of the Diet's reserved power structures. Representative turns against representative. As a particularly violent session of criticism of the Ino regime turns into an irregular fistfight between Politicians, the nation's cameras and press capture the image of a helpless Ikeda watching his clique turn into a glorified Yakuza chapter. And Ikeda watches his dreams of restoring some sense of order to Japanese politics burn to the ground."
 jap_interregnum.30.a: "The situation has developed, and not necessarily to our advantage."
 jap_interregnum.31.t: "Discredit the Upstarts"
 jap_interregnum.31.d: "The leaders of the Ino Clique, or what remains of it, are very much products of the same drives and principles that shaped their predecessor. As a direct result of this, they are not particularly open to change, especially not changes that would endanger their privileged positions. Not that this privilege would ever be recognizable to more than a select fraction of the Diet. Who could put a price on respect, or the silent consent of grown men? Well, Ikeda can; and in a speech appealing to the Ino clique (sponsored by sympathetic members, the numbers of which are growing every passing day) he puts his own spin on the little tangle of patronage that binds them all. To be more exact, he slams the measure as blindingly stupid, destructive to actual governance and possibly one of the biggest factors leading to the fall of Ino himself.\n\nAn emperor never takes advice from courtiers well, especially if those courtiers have openly expressed ambitions to the throne. The leaders of the Clique scoff openly at the blind ambition and outrageous disrespect Ikeda is showing. This young upstart deserves little time and even less attention. Surely their fellow members will do the sensible thing and ignore Ikeda. After all, seniority only ever grows with age, and why would anyone endanger a growing asset by proposing reforms to the system which keeps the golden geese in line?\n\nA week later, the response of the clique is made clear in a 'rearrangement' of the Clique. In a show as material as it is symbolic, the clique's main body severs its membership with the club the Clique uses to host events for its leaders, and joins a new one - with Ikeda's name on the contract."
 jap_interregnum.31.a: "Out with the old, in with the new."
 jap_interregnum.32.t: "The Steadfast Status Quo"
 jap_interregnum.32.d: "Nobody expects an order upended to restore itself. The press chattered in the immediate wake of the Ino scandal that the Ino Clique was finished - that its members would never again become the éminence grise they were before their leader fell from the heavens. But now a different man sits in the centre of a network of influence and subtle control, and the network still possesses the flexibility that made it capable of withstanding the stresses of Army-Navy rule. The old boys are, to use the proverbial saying, back in town. And a new wolf always hunts best with an old pack.\n\nChief on the new agenda being preached is the idea of internal Diet reform: slowly prising apart the network of patronage that made Japan so vulnerable to terrible decisions in the first place and replacing it with an actual choice-based system (the fact that this system would be headed by a man raised in and up by the Ancien Regime is ignored). Ideas are raised of continued collaboration with the Army and Navy, of working ties that are sustainable and preferably not immensely corrupt: of arms supporting each other rather than fending each other off. Of course, there is the China issue: but at present there is little time to do much other than make vague threats and consolidate control. Ikeda's war is not quite won, but the flags of victory are being unfurled with a vengeance: and they look the same as the old ones."
 jap_interregnum.32.a: "Congratulations, Ikeda!"
 jap_interregnum.33.t: "A Sinking Ship"
 jap_interregnum.33.d: "Ikeda Masanosuke is a man defined by his connections more than his allegiances: like many Yokusankai figures his career was built on a tenuous web of compromise and personal relationships, a spider held aloft by invisible threads. Not all threads can be salvaged, however, and once the dew becomes too heavy a burden - perhaps a selective culling is necessary to keep afloat. On another cold morning he begins this culling by officially severing all ties with the Inoites planning a restoration of the old order and a preservation of the YSK as Ino intended it. Shadows are heavy things, after all. Sever them and one is all the lighter, and sudden swerves far easier.\n\nThe sudden turn leaves his former base of support in Ino's Old Guardsmen in the dust, but many members of the various committees that have aligned themselves with Takagi's reformist agenda are beginning to consider their own interests. Reform is all very well and good, but with a more... measured helmsman at the wheel it might be possible to moderate the change of course just enough to keep their positions (and their influence and money networks, of course). Takagi is fire, intense and corrosive and attractive, but Ikeda is measured and just stern enough to keep undesirable elements out of his clique - there is an adjacency to be milked here. Before the week is out letters begin to come in discussing a potential change in allegiance, and the sea of Japanese politics ripples with the arrival of a distant wind from a surprising new direction."
 jap_interregnum.33.a: "An interesting development."
 jap_interregnum.34.t: "A New Centre"
 jap_interregnum.34.d: "Ikeda does not believe in staying idle: in his early days as a newspaper reporter he learnt the ethos of constant movement meant that one could never stay long enough to be considered a target. In the weeks following his shift to independent allegiance he has courted, behind the scenes, dozens of prominent politicians loyal to Kaya and Takagi. He promises them what the other cannot, like any good adulterer, making sure to hint with magnanimous silences what mere words prove insufficient to convey. Kaya and Takagi are about many things - but the only line connecting them all is self-interest, and a touch of duplicity. A newcomer is not bound by old strings, which leaves him freedom to operate - good for both reformers and men wary of disruption of the public peace.\n\nSlowly the centrists (if such a word is indeed appropriate to describe men in the Yokusankai) gather around Ikeda, finding in him a sympathetic, loyal and ultimately controllable figure. The last part is never mentioned in public, for obvious reasons, and certainly Ikeda has different ideas, but the latter will only come to fruition if Ikeda comes to power. For now there is the clipped-teeth teamwork of compromise, and the slow churn of the water, as the new raft angles its sides at the opposition coalescing against it. It will be a long fight, and hopefully a longer peace supersedes it."
 jap_interregnum.34.a: "Ikeda's playing kingmaker now?"
 jap_interregnum.35.t: "Responsible Rule"
 jap_interregnum.35.d: "With a shift in the winds comes changes that every mariner in the Japanese Isles is aware of. Angle the sails just right to catch the wind (or currents) and a ship will move: but that is only the first step to ensuring the ship survives its journey. Weather, wind intensity and longevity, the shape and durability of the hull itself, all must be taken care of in the final decision. The captain is no mere navigator or course-setter, in other words; he is a calculator, and in the end a gambler. Who could blame the planks of a ship for feeling a little suspicious of the captain's true motives?\n\nSo it is with Japanese politics. The first creak comes from an unnamed representative who demands proof that Ikeda's plan to reform the internals of Diet politics will actually come to fruition: the Japanese Government has stuck with a broken system so long precisely because it is a stable broken system. A captain is also a husband to an unwilling wife, and sometimes he must obey the one he presumes to lord over, lest he suffer for his actions in a thousand subtle ways. It is echoed by many in the Diet, even in Ikeda's own clique membership, who would very much like to be assured that the reform they have pledged themselves to support is not going to go the way of Yasuda's assets.\n\nIkeda is a captain, but no captain is ever fully in control. He wonders if he should show his clique his plans for internal reform - there is little reason why they should not start with themselves. For Ikeda there is little in the way of financial obligations tying himself and his party members together - to make a show of it would be to demonstrate his integrity and his lack of interest in betraying his own words. On the other hand, he could attempt to blame all problems on the other factions in the YSK. A distraction is always useful at times like these, but there will be consequences. He ponders, considers. Weighs the odds - and acts."

 jap_interregnum.36.d: "When an empire dies convention dictates it dies for good: even if the empire is given a new form, the elements and factions that gave an empire life are changed, or simply gone. This is simply common sense, and even if one views it with a faint sense of wistfulness, a mono no aware, no one can deny that this has always been the case. But now there is evidence to the contrary: by pulling on reformist arms and militarist coattails, Ikeda is forming a new administration that bears a disquieting resemblance to the old one. Motivated by promises of sincere but very moderate reform and a continued relationship with the Army, men loyal to the centre and the stability of the realm have flooded into his faction.\n\nThe same rumors which plagued the old Ino regime as it crumbled under old sins come to roost on the battlements here as well: corruption, failure, and so many accusations of military bootlicking Ikeda is forced to declare his neutrality on the Army-Navy issue in an awkward speech. But for many, the promise of just enough reform to keep things viable is tempting. Japan got here by keeping the Sphere in order, and without the Army there would be no Sphere. By extension, accommodation to the Army is not surrender, simply politics: and politics can be maneuvered, the tiger can be ridden without falling right off. A faintly thin promise, but it's enough for most. For Ikeda is a man of many faces, and even more promises - and for once he has enough hands and feet in the Diet to deliver them all."

Nobody quite remembers how the current mayhem has started, but a veritable mess of concessions, bribes, blackmail and obfuscation has brought the chambers' productivity to shambles. As the speaker of the chamber tries to bring back order, the factions that introduced the day's bills are forced to go back to the drawing board. The only thing they've lost from the day's efforts is time. Yet in such a crucial period, is time not the most important resource?"

 jap_interregnum.38.d: "The disgrace of former Prime Minister Kido could have spelled the end of the technocrat faction, but the goal of strengthening Japan's civilian government remained a tantalizing one. The technocrats' search for a new leader was Kaya Okinori's big break. A bureaucrat with Army connections, Kaya's strength both within the Diet and throughout the Japanese government has made him one of the only serious contenders for true power.\n\nA few political observers are shocked by the about face of the Japanese Army concerning the technocrat clique. But since the fifties the Army's situation in the Sphere has continually been degrading. With pandemonium breaking out throughout East Asia and the downfall of the Ino government, the Army has found itself shopping for a new alliance. In Kaya Okinori the military brass has found a very willing partner. The bureaucrat's need to bypass the Diet has resulted in him making very nice concessions to Army interests. He is thus now seen as a favorable alternative to the Army's beloved conservatives.\n\nNow Kaya plots against the conservative faction and the resurgent reformist bloc. Both factions detest the technocrat program, and so they must be crushed if Kaya's program is to go forward. Using friends within the Diet and without, Kaya is on the verge of declaring open warfare against his enemies."

By exploiting the Diet's anger at the Ino government collapse, he hopes to either humiliate the conservatives responsible for this mess, or discredit the reformists' solutions. His next move could thus go in two directions.\n\nUsing his clout within the Diet, he could raise chaos about the corruption of the Ino era to try and embarrass the conservative faction led by Ikeda. Then again, the members of the Diet are not as reliable as they used to be, and if the plan failed it would make a fool out of Kaya's ambitions.\n\nThe other way forward might be to make some calls to Army contacts. As an institution nominally outside the political chaos, the Army could bring forward recommendations on the best way forward. Moving faster than the reformists and their Navy sponsors could be a source of prestige... or enrage the Navy into making suggestions of their own. Such an outcome could stall Kaya's attempt to outmaneuver his opponents.\n\nWith time being of the essence, only axis of attack can be chosen. After giving it some thought, Kaya decides..."

 jap_interregnum.40.d: "Officially, the honorable Imperial Army does not have any political interest beyond advising on who the war minister should be. In practice, however, the mess of Army suppliers, companies directed by former officers and colonial industrial interests overseen by military men has granted the Army some amount of gravitas in political affairs. The recent implosion of the Ino cabinet due to a massive corruption scandal has left the generals unusually reserved about political comments. Perhaps the consensus in the Army's high command is to wait to see which faction is likeliest to emerge as the best business partner.\n\nThis official neutrality does not extend to Takagi's reformists. The idea of seeing the political sphere slip into the hands of the Navy is not one the Army enjoys. Why not attempt to strike first and demonstrate that the Army is the responsible adult in the room? By bringing forward an elegantly designed political proposal, the officially neutral Army can help strengthen Kaya's cause. If the Navy does not respond in time, their puppets in the reformist factions are liable to lose feathers. If the Navy does respond, however, Kaya's Army contacts will not make much of a splash on the Diet. Despite the risks, Kaya and his technocrats have arranged for a policy proposal arranged by Army leaders to be read in front of the assembly. All now await the Navy's response..."

After an internal review, the military's colonial administrators have decided that a non partisan effort to work with Yokusankai members to create a better partnership between Japan's civilian and military officials.\n\nSome back and forth and negotiation on the bill continued late into the night.

The Navy's refusal to comment on the issue has weakened the reformist faction, and no independent has dared opposing the Yokusankai majority on the issue.\n\nThe great winners of this outcome are of course Kaya's technocrats. Their ability to act as messengers for Army interest has demonstrated their skill at negotiation. The Army's willingness to self-regulate and cooperate with the Diet has weakened Reformist arguments that the current system is impossible to repair.

By decrying the corruption of the conservatives while leaving out Kaya's Army partners, the technocrats have sparked a firestorm in the chamber. Encouragingly, several reformist deputies have turned on their erstwhile conservative allies to decry the conservative corruption.

Several of Ikeda's allies have been reported to explode in anger at the scheme, as they find themselves unable to mount a defense without selling out their Army sponsors.\n\nThe devious plan, however, is not entirely foolproof. Kaya and his allies walk on a tightrope, for while the reformists desire to lash out against the conservatives, the reformist's Navy allies are unlikely to agree to let the Army go unscathed. Using the reformist's help to pass the bill would likely water it down too much for its intended purpose. The bill will thus come down to the support of independents members of the Diet. But getting a critical mass of independent onboard will require the type of concessions that hurt any politician's credibility.

Army officers have looked on with pleasant surprise at this brazen attack on the conservatives. After all, with most of their interests extracted from the disaster by Kaya's masterfully designed bill, why feel bad for their erstwhile conservative allies? The technocrats had been true to their words, and proven their willingness to sacrifice much for Army support.\n\nKaya's faction has grown stronger from the ordeal. While their ascendance is not yet certain, their capacity to marshall some level of support in the Diet augurs well for their future.

However, it's clear that both the national conservatives and the technocrats will descend upon the remnants of Takagi's faction - and inevitably, one of the two will dominate the Yokusankai."

Now the Yokusankai conservatives find themselves under constant attack by the Reformists and Technocrats. The schemes of Kaya and Takagi have further hollowed out the conservative's powerbase. None of the independent members of the Diet are willing to help Ikeda stabilize his position, and so the politician has thrown the towel.

 jap_interregnum.52.t: "Kaya Knocked Out"
 jap_interregnum.52.d: "Kaya exited the building with his head held high. He was asked whether he still had plans to take the job of Prime Minister, to which he only said he "would not actively work towards it at this time". He was asked if he supported either of the other two frontrunners, but while he made some vague hints he refused to openly endorse either one. He said he intended to continue serving Japan to his utmost ability, wherever it may be, when asked about his future plans. Then, he reached his car, and no more questions could be asked.\n\nWhile Kaya may have departed the race with dignity, the truth is simply that he was outmaneuvered. He did not leave the competition by choice, he rather saw that he just did not stand a chance any more, and rather than dragging his feet and refusing to give in, he chose to leave with grace so that he could return and fight another day. Let Ikeda and Takagi fight it out and take the next few years, and perhaps someday he could return to spar again."

 jap_interregnum.65.t: "The Death Knell of Reformism"
 jap_interregnum.65.d: "As predicted, the small and hopeful faction formerly spearheaded by Takagi has dissolved like snow under the sun. With the majority of them flocking to Ikeda, and a few joining Kaya's ranks, it's rather evident that the foreseeable political future of Japan has no liberalism in sight.\n\nAs one major faction falls, the other two rise to try and take down their last rival. The rhetoric from the national conservatives and the technocrats has been rising, with political confrontation escalating more and more - an all out battle has started for political domination within the Yokusankai, as Prime Minister Aichi can only stand and watch in silence. Kaya booms that Ikeda and his men are still the same gang of cronies that led Japan to stagnation and corruption in Ino's times; Ikeda answers that Kaya and his associates are a clique of wannabe dictators and traitors to the Kokutai, while rebuking the accusations of corruption. The stage is set for the final act of the Interregnum."
 jap_interregnum.65.a: "The Diet is too small for the two of them."
 jap_interregnum.66.t: "Ikeda's Stalwart Defense"
 jap_interregnum.66.d: "In the Imperial Diet, Kaya's assaults against Ikeda and the national conservative faction of the Yokusankai show no sign of dying down - on the contrary, they are mounting. From newspapers, televisions, radios, Kaya and his clique use every opportunity to blast Ikeda, and the accusations of corruption are becoming more and more direct. While Ikeda Masanosuke has been shrouded in aloof quietness, not responding directly to the noise coming from Kaya, the situation is becoming dire - Ikeda must respond to the accusations, or succumb to Kaya's offensive.\n\nThe most obvious way for Ikeda to rebuke Kaya would be a direct appeal to His Excellency, the Prime Minister Aichi Kiichi. In the name of the greater good of Japan and of unity within the Yokusankai, Aichi can be asked to take a stand against Kaya's slanderous accusations against members of his own party - this would force the technocrats into silence, at least for a while. There's another option, however - rumors and whispers of a something not quite clean going on between Kaya himself and some prominent Zaibatsu. It would be risky, but if Ikeda were to expose proof of Kaya's illicit activities to the eyes of Japan, it would mean knocking him and his clique out of politics for good. After careful consideration, Ikeda decides his next move..."
 jap_interregnum.66.a: "Appeal to the Prime Minister."
 jap_interregnum.66.b: "Go after Kaya's dirty laundry."
 jap_interregnum.67.t: "Corporate Espionage"
 jap_interregnum.67.d: "Every political thriller has to start with some espionage, and Ikeda's attempts to implicate Kaya in corruption are no different. Silently, slowly, private investigators and contacts within important Zaibatsu are being mobilized by the dozens, while Ikeda bides for his time. Something has already been brought to Ikeda's table - pieces of tentative evidence, some suspicious bank accounts, meetings between men close to Kaya and finance representatives. However, this is not nearly enough to make a final move against Kaya.\n\nA more direct approach might be needed. Ikeda, with his closest advisors, has decided that an attempt shall be made to contact a member of Kaya's inner clique - in the hopes to make him give us the proof we need to destroy Kaya. Finding someone willing to work with Ikeda won't be easy, but after all, money opens every door."

 jap_interregnum.68.t: "The Manchurian Candidate"
 jap_interregnum.68.d: "Backroom talks, shady meetings, suitcases full of money being passed from one hand to another. These might not be the most noble weapons in a politician's arsenal, but certainly work - enough to allow Ikeda to have his prize. One of the members of Kaya's clique, an old bureaucrat nearing retirement, has accepted Ikeda's offers, and soon enough, a large package of documents found its way to Ikeda's desk.\n\nInside, were things beyond Ikeda's wildest hopes: bank transactions, records of phone calls, photographs of meetings. A mountain of damning evidence, and Ikeda is sitting right on top of it. The Interregnum is about to end."

 jap_interregnum.69.t: "The Nissan Link"
 jap_interregnum.69.d: "Today, Japanese in the Home Islands, in Taiwan, in Karafuto, in the innumerable islands of the Pacific, and all over the Sphere, woke up to the news - Kaya Okinori, one of the most prominent politicians of Japan and de facto leader of the technocrats in the Taisei Yokusankai, has been taken into custody by policemen this morning. This major victory for Ikeda came after an explosive interview with the Asai Shimbun, where he proclaimed that he had evidence of Kaya's corruption.\n\nImmediately, the scandal spread like wildfire. Evidence appeared of a major Zaibatsu, Nissan, having bought numerous politicians associated with the technocrat, all the way down to the prefecture level and all the way up to the Diet - Kaya himself appears to be strongly implicated in the happenings, but more and more politicians are being arrested in Tokyo and all around Japan. Meanwhile, Ikeda watches the fire rise - and knows that after the flames die down, he will be the only one standing in the ashes."
 jap_interregnum.69.a: "This is the end of Kaya's career."
 jap_interregnum.70.t: "The Kiichi Gambit"
 jap_interregnum.70.d: "Since Kaya's arrest, things changed in the Taisei Yokusankai. Numerous technocrats have been arrested, the reformists are a distant memory, and the national conservatives have become more powerful than they ever were. Thus, little surprise was generated when newspapers reported that His Majesty the Emperor has decided to retire His Excellency Aichi Kiichi, and to entrust His Excellency Ikeda Masanosuke with the position of Prime Minister. Without a doubt, this choice is the direct outcome of Ikeda leveraging his newfound domination over the Yokusankai and the Diet to strong-arm the Emperor.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Ikeda decried the corruption of the Ino era, but much more so the new, and even more insidious illicit trafficking done by Kaya and his dirty clique of bureaucrats. Ikeda has promised a national renewal - upholding the Kokutai, preserving peace and stability, and most of all promising an end to corruption. Japan has lost its way - now, with the blessing of the immortal Emperor, and the guidance of Prime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke, the nation looks ahead to a bright future once more."

 jap_interregnum.72.d: "Another development has rocked the already divided Japanese political landscape - following an investigation of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, some prominent bureaucrats and politicians associated with Ino's cabinet have been arrested with corruption charges. They are accused of exchanging favours such as promotions to prominent positions in government in exchange for money, and have been involved in numerous embezzlement cases.\n\nWhile there is no hard proof that Ikeda or any members of the Yokusankai closest to him can be linked to these newly arrested politicians, but many suspicions are currently afoot. Ikeda has publicly condemned and decried these instances of corruption, but the situation had become tense once more, with Kaya and his men looking for an opening they can use to finally strike Ikeda."
 jap_interregnum.72.a: "The tiger is silent, and prepares to leap."
 jap_interregnum.73.t: "The Powers That Be"
 jap_interregnum.73.d: "In great secrecy, a conference was organized between Kaya, other members of the Taisei Yokusankai, and some representatives of the Imperial Japanese Army. In an unassuming hotel in Tokyo, these men of the Japanese Empire met under a single common desire: ending the corruption that has tarnished the Japanese government since the Ino era. Their enemy was clear, and they have him in their sights: Ikeda Masanosuke.\n\nAs hands are shaken and alliances are reforged, Kaya has begun to solidify a larger technocrat front opposed to Ikeda and his men, including numerous politicians from different cliques of the Yokusankai as well as several important names of the armed forces. It's only a matter of time before Kaya Okinori finally makes his bid for premiership, removing Ikeda from politics entirely in the process."
 jap_interregnum.73.a: "Is Kaya truly going to win?"
 jap_interregnum.74.t: "Kaya Makes His Move"
 jap_interregnum.74.d: "In one final meeting, Kaya and his advisors have reunited to discuss the course of action. There have been two proposals to attack and defeat Ikeda once and for all - first, a more conventional approach. An outright political attack in the Diet, denouncing Ikeda's factionalism, likely ties to corruption scandals, and unwillingness to give Japan the reforms the country needs. Of course, current Prime Minister Aichi will be in the crosshairs too, for his failure to reign in Ikeda and his clique.\n\nAnother possibility is somewhat more unconventional. By going around the Diet and instead using contacts in the IJA, Kaya can attempt to gain the full support of the military against Ikeda, as well as trying to obtain enough evidence to rile up public support for an arrest mandate against Ikeda. While this is indeed a risky move, if successful it would mean the definitive end of Ikeda's career, and a total victory for Kaya."
 jap_interregnum.74.a: "Go for the military option."
 jap_interregnum.74.b: "We shall fight in the Diet."
 jap_interregnum.75.t: "Secure the Military Veto"
 jap_interregnum.75.d: "In yet another secret meeting, Kaya's contacts in the Imperial Japanese Army have reported about their success - thanks to old favours, tactical friendships and a bit of money to oil up new agreements, the top brass of the Army are now firmly on Kaya's side. While the IJA's influence in politics isn't as prominent as it once was, their support can still be enough to tip the balance, especially in difficult times such as these.\n\nWhile the military's support for Kaya has only been revealed to the public through offhand remarks and other subtle signals, Ikeda's faction is starting to panic. The conservatives in the Yokusankai have called for a private liaison conference between them, a few IJA officers friendly to them and some representatives of the Privy Council to discuss the situation. Kaya knows this, and is preparing for his final move..."
 jap_interregnum.75.a: "The grand finale approaches."
 jap_interregnum.76.t: "Intelligence from the Liason Conference"
 jap_interregnum.76.d: "In the late afternoon of today, a suitcase arrived on Kaya's desk, brought there by the hands of a lowly bureaucrat. Inside, hours of recordings, several photographs, and even a few copied documents, all coming from the liaison conference called by Ikeda. Kaya successfully planted one of his men in the conference, who managed to smuggle the intel back to Kaya.\n\nThe conference was closed to the public, and with good reason - the numerous attendees, including Ikeda himself, discussed their ties to the recent corruption scandals, and the measures to be taken to cover up their tracks. This is exactly what Kaya needed to deliver his final attack..."
 jap_interregnum.76.a: "How will Ikeda ever recover?"
 jap_interregnum.77.t: "Move Against Ikeda"
 jap_interregnum.77.d: "Today, the Japanese public followed Kaya's speech in the Diet with equal parts amusement and awe. Kaya denounced once more the factionalist, petty political games played by Ikeda and his clique, informing his fellow Diet members and the Japanese people about their liaison conference where they desperately tried to clean their dirty laundry in what constitutes a borderline act of treason against the values of Japanese democracy.\n\nIkeda could do nothing but stand in silence, with a pained half smile on his face, before attempting a desperate defense. Much of the Diet booed him, including some members of his cliques who promptly switched sides, abandoning Ikeda's ship just as it started to sink. With Ikeda's support at a historical low, it seems like it's only a matter of time before Kaya becomes Prime Minister of Japan."
 jap_interregnum.77.a: "A devastating blow!"
 jap_interregnum.78.t: "The Arrest"
 jap_interregnum.78.d: "Just as a motion of no confidence was passed in the Diet to remove Aichi and install Kaya Okinori in his place, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department issued arrest orders against a select group of MPs most implicated in the corruption scandals that have recently rocked Ikeda's faction of the Yokusankai. Both stories competed for the headlines in all the Japanese newspapers, especially because the two events are linked together inextricably. The intel gathered by Ikeda at the liaison conference was what prompted the MP's arrests, at the same time boosting Kaya to the position of Prime Minister.\n\nNow, Kaya Okinori stands on top of a renewed Yokusankai, purged of corruption, factionalism, and petty political schemes. At least, that's the image Kaya likes to paint to newspapers and television. In truth, much work is still to be done before Kaya can truly enact his grand reform schemes, but one thing is certain - the Interregnum is over, and a new age dawns upon Japan. Kaya shall bring the nation to greatness once more - stagnation will be defeated in the name of progress, and Japan shall truly live up to its title as one of the world's foremost powers."

 jap_interregnum.79.t: "The Parliamentary Firebrand"
 jap_interregnum.79.d: "Event: In these troubled times, it doesn't take much to get the Japanese Diet to descend into acrimonious name calling. Yet the speech by Kaya's old parliamentary ally was beyond the pale. In a concise oration that continued throughout conservative heckling, the man rained down insults on Ikeda and Ino's conservative faction; on their corruption; on the threat to Japan's future if Ikeda was allowed the reign of power.\n\nPrime Minister Aichi was caught in the crossfire, with his inability to rein in the conservatives lambasted by the technocrats. This attack on the status quo of the interregnum demonstrated to every member of the Diet Kaya's confidence. Were the prime minister to fall on a no-confidence vote, Kaya appeared certain he could forge a strong majority. It was time for Ikeda and the conservatives to go on the counter-offensive."

 jap_interregnum.80.d: "The conservative's reply was rapid and uncompromising. Every representatives the conservative could grab were set to run marathon length speeches decrying the technocrats and their attempt to subvert Japanese democracy. Beyond angry flag waving, the maneuver had a greater purpose. Ikeda and his associates could tell that the current Prime Minister was in great danger of receiving a vote of non confidence.\n\nA show of force by the conservatives and their gaggle of reformist and independents allies would demonstrate to the chamber that Kaya's majority was mere smoke and mirrors. Preventing the vote of non-confidence from going through would be a terrible blow to Kaya's prestige. The nation would see the technocrat gamble the Diet's remaining stability, before losing their bet.\n\nBoth factions stayed in negotiations round the clock to secure a favorable issue on the upcoming vote. Despite the bluster, neither Ikeda nor Kaya knew for sure which way the wind would blow on the day of the vote.."

 jap_interregnum.81.d: "For all the chaos this one measly bill would unleash, the reading of the motion of no confidence was quite anti-climactic. For once Kaya was the one doing the speaking. His words were careful, punctuated by slight looks at his notes. He described the factionalism that had proliferated under Prime Minister Aichi. The prime minister's inability to restore order. The continuing economical instability.\n\nOnce the bureaucrat's leader was done, a vote by roll call was ordered on the motion. Party leaders did their best to maintain a brave face as the vote went on, representative by representative..."

 jap_interregnum.82.d: "When an empire dies convention dictates it dies for good: even if the empire is given a new form, the elements and factions that gave an empire life are changed, or simply gone. This is simply common sense, and even if one views it with a faint sense of wistfulness, a mono no aware, no one can deny that this has always been the case. But now there is evidence to the contrary: by pulling on reformist arms and militarist coattails, Ikeda is forming a new administration that bears a disquieting resemblance to the old one. Motivated by promises of sincere but very moderate reform and a continued relationship with the Army, men loyal to the centre and the stability of the realm have flooded into his faction.\n\nThe same rumors which plagued the old Ino regime as it crumbled under old sins come to roost on the battlements here as well: corruption, failure, and so many accusations of military bootlicking Ikeda is forced to declare his neutrality on the Army-Navy issue in an awkward speech. But for many, the promise of just enough reform to keep things viable is tempting. Japan got here by keeping the Sphere in order, and without the Army there would be no Sphere. By extension, accommodation to the Army is not surrender, simply politics: and politics can be maneuvered, the tiger can be ridden without falling right off. A faintly thin promise, but it's enough for most. For Ikeda is a man of many faces, and even more promises - and for once he has enough hands and feet in the Diet to deliver them all."

The final battle between Kaya and Takagi's factions was commencing in the House of Representatives; their demagogues and ideologues spat and taunted insults at each other to vanquish their support and prop up their own candidate. The Speaker could not control the chaos as dozens of members at a time hissed and harassed their rivals until the very last minute before the vote was called.\n\nThe silence that fell over the chamber was forced and quivering, barely keeping a lid on the feuding growls of the split parliament. Slowly and carefully, each vote was counted; both candidates prayed that their support from the military, deputies, ideologues, and blessings from Kido Kōichi would swing the majority into their favor. As each vote was counted, the intense boiling of the air had created a tense anticipation. Takagi desperately repressed all exhilaration underneath a cool yet pressed gaze, and Kaya leaned against an armrest, scratching his chin in suspense.\n\nAs time went on, the grumbles dancing between the back rows of the chamber had quietened and a silence fell over the members of both factions. Like a predator stalking prey, men stuffed in the rows of the Diet were still and silent - ready to pounce the second weakness showed its feeble face in the coming moments that the results were announced."

However, even amidst the cruel disputes of interservice rivalry, rare exceptions arise where the two forces put down their arms and join forces for the sake of "Kokutai", or rather to preserve their current power and position in Japan against any optimistic reformist.\n\nThe recent political scandals, disruptions, and unrest in the nation has provoked the general staff to take a stance. Indeed, officers from the IJA and IJN have grouped together for what they claim is "a defense of sovereignty". Their final decision was tensely skirmished over in days of morose debate; Takagi's naval background had loyal ties with many of the admirals, whilst Kaya's pledges to develop and centralize the military industry gripped the attention of supportive generals.\n\nAware of their influence in the Diet, a spokesperson for the general staff had issued a conclusive statement endorsing the premiership of..."

In speeches in the House of Representatives; in extra-legal channels and fancy dinner parties; even in back-street bribes and coercion, the race to count a greater share of votes in the Diet growing more tense by the day. They are picked off as particularly weak ideologues within the Taisei Yokusankai, and targeted as weak and impressionable - potential footmen in the sea of votes expected by either candidate.\n\nBoth Takagi and Kaya's entourage of loyal courtiers had sunk their teeth into members of Kidoite, Inoite, and even Independent factions to sway their votes in support of a preferred candidate. Behind the appearances of oppositional politics, their casted votes are expected to play a significant part in throwing the split Diet under the control of the candidate that has won their support in this politely hostile parliamentary feud."

Representing his position as Lord Keeper, as well as carrying the blessing of the House of Peers, an endorsement from Kido can certainly shift the tides in either campaign for the nomination as Prime Minister.\n\nThe House of Peers have come to a consensus with Kido, emphasizing that they recommend the nomination of Takagi. The nobility hold high opinions of the admiral; they recognize his naval background, as well as his respect for the processes of government, seeing him as a candidate of relevant and righteous change. However, Kido's personal opinion differs; he believes that Kaya is best for the candidacy, as he is influential and powerful, but most of all he is most susceptible to coercion and manipulation from the upper echelons of the Japanese political machine.\n\nBoth candidates count their favors and eagerly await the statement from Kido, with staff constantly checking their telephones and keeping up to date with the news coverage of the affair. The moment Kido does announce his endorsement, however, the final stretch of the race to the Diet will become ever-more intense and pressured."

Instead, he was relaxed and sitting in his seat with a smug grin smeared across his face, staring in the direction of a humiliated Kaya. As he arose from his position after a moment, his supporters cheered even louder in support of his candidacy before he strolled over to address the half-joyous, half-embarrassed parliament.\n\nTakagi stood up proudly on the podium, towering over the chamber; he had prepared a short speech thanking the members for their support in the intensely-fought race to the premiership. In the small breaks where Takagi took a breath, he scoured the chamber for impressions of his first address, dancing his vision over the many approving and disgruntled members of the Diet observing his every move.\n\n"This is what it the Prime Minister must expect of himself," the intensely-spoken admiral thought to himself, "to relish in the nagging gaze of those who love you, and to withstand the scathing glances of men who now want you dead.""

The Reformists, shamed by their defeat, scoffed and turned their noses up at Kaya's faction, but nothing could dampen the cheers of the Technocrat's victory over them.\n\nKaya snickered with his men before suddenly turning his attention to the speaker's podium, where he pulled out a prepared speech from underneath his suit and began to address the Diet.\n\nMere moments into his speech Kaya pledged to bring great change to the empire - much to the pleasure of those who had supported him before this moment. Their faces lit up in awe and their mouths watered at the sound of his pledges of industrialization, centralization, and other popular Technocrat talking points that had won him the nomination to the position of Prime Minister.\n\nAs Kaya spoke, his eyes swept the chamber, gathering the expressions of those who had come to support and oppose him. He did not feel threatened by the opposition's precedence; he had just defeated them. Instead, the awe came from those who feverishly backed his platform before they backed his vow for premiership itself."

Being the most established candidate and the one with the most ties to the old leadership, Ikeda is essentially playing white, and his opportunity to move first was all but guaranteed. His move was entirely standard as well: a safe but tactical reminder to everyone in Ino's former bloc that the course must be maintained and a gentle reminder of who got them where they are in the first place. It's not a good idea to bite the hand that feeds, now is it?\n\nThis is the expected move, but not an unsound one. Huge swathes of the Diet owe much or everything to Ino and his clique, and as the most prominent remaining politician in that clique Ikeda is the one who can best reap the rewards from those decades of building connections.

For anyone to become Prime Minister, they would need the approval of at least some of the conservative clique. As Ino's unofficial successor, Ikeda Masanosuke had naturally inherited the overwhelming majority of their support. Ikeda therefore felt confident that his stronghold in the Diet would stand firm during the course of the leadership election. However, it was still wise for him to play to his base.\n\nAs such, Ikeda had prepared to address the YSK representatives, to outline his candidacy for Prime Minister. Knowing full well that he would mostly be speaking to fellow conservatives, he leaned heavily on reaserting his commitment to the status quo. To the rest of the party, he emphasised his qualities as a source of much-needed unity in the Taisei Yokusankai. To the conservatives of the Diet, Ikeda's speech had been exactly what they had been expecting, another reassurance that they were backing the right horse.\n\nYet there were some who whispered that Ikeda had perhaps emphasised his commitments to maintaining the current state of affairs too much. Was he Ino's successor in all regards, including his rather significant faults? Others within the YSK dismissed these suggestions as rubbish, fabricated entirely to sow doubt. It still remained to be seen if damage had been done, or if Ikeda's speech had reinforced his stronghold."

If it isn't broken, don't fix it, or at least that seems to be the line of logic that Ikeda is following. As tired as it may seem, however, even his foes will begrudgingly admit that the strategy still holds merit. To stray from the roots would be suicide at this point with how deeply entrenched they are in Ikeda's platform, and continuing to gather support from those who preferred the old order and those who simply fear change will not cease to be effective until those people stop existing.

This could prove to be either an effective blow or an opportunity for Takagi, depending on how effectively he responds. How he tries to parry this move could have a significant impact on the decision made on PM, even if it's something Ikeda has done a thousand times before. All he needs is to catch Takagi off guard once, and it's over.\n\nTakagi could simply do what he's always done. Same attack, same defense, the game continues and neither side gains. However, it's undeniably more appealing to try something more risky and actively counteract Ikeda's digging. There are two ways to go about it: either make a few compromises ideologically to gain more of Ikeda's change-fearing followers, or dig in just as hard as Ikeda did and attract more radical politicians who see everyone as too bland for them. Either one is risky but both could pay off."
 jap_interregnum.103.a: "Dig in even harder!"
 jap_interregnum.103.b: "Stick to the script."
 jap_interregnum.103.c: "Compromise."
 jap_interregnum.104.t: "Talk to Kido"
 jap_interregnum.104.d: "Ikeda has been working his magic on the various politicians and Diet members who wield their tiny little torches of power in Japan, spending the past months tirelessly bringing them to his side and ensuring their loyalty. Now, however, Ikeda must face his greatest challenge yet. He will not be wooing another nervous status quo advocate or meek third-rate advisor. No, now he must deal with Kido Kōichi, champion of reform and one of the biggest names in Japanese politics for many decades now.\n\nAt first, it would seem that Kido and Ikeda would be entirely opposed, with Ikeda being the stalwart defender of the status quo and Kido being perhaps the greatest advocate for reformism in the Empire. To a degree, that is true, but when facing foes like Takagi, the two could still perhaps find common ground. Takagi may want change, but his reformism is the polar opposite of Kido's reformism, and with the right compromises Kido might just throw his support behind Ikeda in order to stop the reformists."
 jap_interregnum.104.a: "An interesting pairing."
 jap_interregnum.105.t: "Ikeda In Talks With Kido"
 jap_interregnum.105.d: "Ikeda, an arch conservative and veteran serving in the Ino administration, waved about his anti-permissive words like a weapon in the Diet, pointing it's sharpened edge at anyone who dared to tear down Japan's age-old institutions. He had found many enemies doing this in the past, but none had stood up to his postulations in recent times more than the Takagites, who's rising power threatened the status-quo more than any he had seen before.\n\nAs much as it was an unlikely partnership, it was one that both could agree circumstances demanded. Kido was not one to congratulate Ikeda for his positions, nor pride him for what he fought for in the House of Representatives. However, confronted with what they both considered to be an overindulgent reformist faction, the conversations they had were united by a grim determination to put aside their differences and outmaneuver Takagi's influence for good.\n\nThe longer they talked, the greater a bond began to share. Despite their complex relationship in the politicking of the empire's legislature, they could both admit that it became of the utmost necessity to block the advances of the Takagites in the National Diet. Eventually, the smiles they shared in their winding discussions became more memorable than their huffs. Were Takagi to catch wind of this unofficial alliance, the confrontation in the Diet would set up a great defense against the threat of his faction's startling ascendancy."
 jap_interregnum.105.a: "Strong-arm Kido"
 jap_interregnum.105.b: "Concessions, anyone?"
 jap_interregnum.105.c: "Compromise, again."
 jap_interregnum.106.t: "Push for Diet Supremacy"
 jap_interregnum.106.d: "Takagi is wasting no time with striking directly for the heart. Control of the Diet is control of the nation, and the one who controls the nation is the Prime Minister. No matter how hardworking and competent each candidate is, in the end the one who wins is the one who's chosen, and the people who chose are the Diet. There isn't any point in dancing around it; the time to strike is now, and the only course with any chance of victory is to strike directly at the core of power in the Empire.\n\nRight now, Takagi is simply moving his pawns into place. This is not his masterstroke, but if Ikeda doesn't properly respond to this early power play in the Diet, he could be dead in the water even this early in the race. The duel is now truly underway."
 jap_interregnum.106.a: "How will Ikeda counter?"
 jap_interregnum.107.t: "Takagi Pushes the Diet"
 jap_interregnum.107.d: "It is said that politics makes monsters of us all, but monsters do not always bare their teeth and growl. Sometimes, they lay low in the shadows, waiting for their traps to spring so that they may strike with the element of surprise. Takagi's advances in the Diet have become far more apparent in recent times; the number of members finding his proposals more than agreeable have begun to vastly increase in numbers, as the Admiral himself was making moves to quietly outmaneuver his rivals.\n\nIn the Diet, his face was unresponsive to the heckling of politicians and his expression was a dull calm, but it was clear that Takagi prided himself with a self-satisfaction that came with seeing his plans unravel across the chamber floor. Day by day, he convinced more and more members over to his side in an attempt to secure a majority over the divided factions of the Taisei Yokusankai. Even if he did aggravate his rivals, there could be no doubt in claiming that he was quickly becoming a master of the Diet.\n\nFaced with his rivals' capitalization of such a divided party, Ikeda grew sick of seeing Takagi's silently smug grins. The brewing anger churning within him would not let the Admiral see such a spiteful victory; Ikeda concluded that he too must engage in the mind-games played in the Diet, at least before Takagi ascended to power on the chance he could mutter "Check-mate.""

 jap_interregnum.107.b: "Step up the Grand Plan"
 jap_interregnum.107.c: "Keep it quiet, for now."
 jap_interregnum.108.t: "Attend the Liason Conference"
 jap_interregnum.108.d: "The Liaison Conference has been held ever since 1937, established as a way for the Emperor to be informed on the goings-on of his Empire by his lessers in the government. This particular conference may be the most important one held since the war, as while the Emperor would be extremely unlikely to directly support any candidate, getting approval from his clique could be the trump card needed to end this battle once and for all. Takagi has managed to maneuver his way in and will be attending.Ceremonies, endless talks and meetings, conferences within conferences within conferences, it is always a bore at best and a nightmare of tedium at worst, but it is some of the most fertile breeding grounds for political intrigue, and political intrigue is Japan's national pastime. Takagi has done well to move the battleground here."
 jap_interregnum.108.a: "The Emperor's favor is four aces."
 jap_interregnum.109.t: "The Liason Conference"
 jap_interregnum.109.d: "Takagi's attendance at the Liaison conference is a danger for Ikeda to say the least. There is absolutely no time to waste, and a reaction must be formulated. Though it's a one in a million chance, if Takagi managed to get the Emperor's direct approval and the Emperor voiced that approval, it would be the end of the line for Ikeda's chances. The Liaison Conference is a delicate dance, however, and a wrong move could be just as catastrophic.\n\nIkeda could, of course, simply dance along with Takagi, waltzing through the hurdles, dropping finessed hints and subtle statements to the Emperor's clique, earning support one whispered promise and one insincere smile at a time.\n\nOr he could take the ultimate gamble: Try to reach the Emperor himself.\n\nIt would be beyond risky, but it would demolish Takagi if it succeeded. Ikeda would be victorious and his hand in control of the nation. How unlikely could it be? As the traditionalist candidate, the Emperor would surely believe in him above Takagi. All he has to do is ask, right?"
 jap_interregnum.109.a: "Too risky. Smile and keep moving."
 jap_interregnum.109.b: "Approach the Emperor's bureaucrats."
 jap_interregnum.109.c: "Try to reach the Emperor himself."
 jap_interregnum.110.t: "Inside the Palace"
 jap_interregnum.110.d: "Having attended the Liasion Conference and opened up communications with the Emperor's clique itself, Takagi is now in the final stretches of his master plan. Now, he can begin to do away with the small talk and needless ceremony and start talking to the people who matter about things that could change Japan's future forever. The people who surround the Emperor hold far more power than many give them credit for, and getting on their good side is still key to having any real power in this nation.\n\nTakagi has spent a very long time getting here, but now he still must tread very, very lightly. The Emperor is more than just a man, he is the spirit of Japan to many, and to try and deal with him and his clique like just another group of politicians would be absolute suicide. No, Takagi is treading on eggshells, and if one breaks it'll be the end of the line for his chances to be Prime Minister."
 jap_interregnum.110.a: "The palace walls have ears."
 jap_interregnum.111.t: "Palace Intrigue"
 jap_interregnum.111.d: "Time is running out, and just as Takagi makes his final moves in the very heart of authority in the Empire, Ikeda must take his final countermeasures to stop him. If he does not move to stop this quickly, then the clock will run out just as Takagi corners the king and takes checkmate. This is the only opportunity remaining to directly move against Takagi, and Ikeda will have to make it count.\n\nThe methods, however, are all difficult. The brief idea to try and reach the Emperor first was clearly a mistake, and there will be no attempt at that idea. That leaves two plans of action. While it would be tempting to start playing the palace games like Takagi, it's valuable time that could be spent on the Diet and all other facets of Japan's politics. The Emperor may be the heart of power, but it has to be admitted that in terms of policy and actual control the Diet and Prime Minister have more influence. Still, to abandon the Emperor to Takagi could prove absolutely fatal."
 jap_interregnum.111.a: "Put our foot down. This ends here."

 jap_interregnum.111.c: "Give up the Emperor to try and work on the Diet."
 jap_interregnum.112.t: "The Confrontation"
 jap_interregnum.112.d: "The time has finally come.\n\nMonths and months of political dueling, of complex games, of pawns and aces and trumps and evasions, of everything that makes politicians so distrusted and despised. Backdoor deals, public statements, all of it was to try and gain the greatest position in the land bar the Imperial Throne itself: the Prime Ministry.\n\nAfter so long of dancing around each other and battling through proxies and indirect statements, today Ikeda and Takagi finally came to duel head-to-head. Their arguments were pointed arrows, their policies well-sharpened swords. This was their final chance to change any minds, if there were any left to be changed. At this point, however, almost all had made up their minds. The Prime Minister had already been decided in their collective minds. All that was left to do was for each to state his chosen victor out loud so that the new Prime Minister could be known to all. The duel came to a close, and it was time for a decision to be made."
 jap_interregnum.112.a: "Unthinkable power hangs in the balance."
 jap_interregnum.113.t: "Ikeda's Appointment"
 jap_interregnum.113.d: "The decision has finally been made.\n\nIkeda Masanosuke has secured the position of Prime Minister.\n\nAnd yet, daily life goes on. There are protests, but no riots in the streets. There are grumbles, but no shouts for change. The status quo is victorious once again, as it has been for the past decades in Japan. Ikeda is liked by many but loved by none, and just as there are no buildings burning in revolt, there are no parties thrown for his victory. There is only a feeling of contentment in things as usual, and an idea of security and normalcy in a world that was turned upside down by the revelation of corruption in the very roots of Japan.\n\nThat normalcy, however, takes work to maintain. That is why Ikeda was chosen, and that is why he still has so much work to do. The reformists are outraged and the technocrats are uncooperative as ever. The nation is still reeling from the corruption scandal even this many months later, and its repercussions still drain at the country. Now, it is Ikeda's job to fix it all."
 jap_interregnum.113.a: "And the sun rises again each morning."
 jap_interregnum.114.t: "Takagi Meets the Emperor"
 jap_interregnum.114.d: "The decision has finally been made.\n\nTakagi Sōkichi has managed to scrape his way to victory.\n\nThe announcement was met with both roars of applause and shrieking jeers from all corners of Japan. Takagi's victory is being celebrated by the students, reformists, and Navy men of the Empire, adored as an underdog who overcame all odds to come to power and represent their cause. To the hardliners, conservatives, and even further of the Empire, Takagi is seen as nothing less than a death blow to a proud nation and to tradition.\n\nWhile Takagi may have won this battle, there is still a long war ahead. The technocrats continue to call for radical restructuring, the conservatives still rattle their sabers and call for the good old days, and corruption still reaches for the core of the Japanese government. The road ahead is perilous, but Takagi is ready to face it. This is the beginning of a new age for Japan."

 #Investigation leadup
 japleadup.1.t: "Murder in the Metropolis"
 japleadup.1.d: "The detective got the call late at night about a murder by the docks. It could have been the usual, a deal gone bad over some Manchurian Poppy, some 'chankoro' killed for bad blood, He'd seen the likes. But this was different. The report read like a guide for the perfect murder. No prints, no discernable weapon, no signs of forced entry. Just a corpse mixed in with 2 tons of tuna.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the warehouse and crawled underneath the police lines. Whoever did this had a strong stomach, cutting his face up like that, he mused. Unrecognizable. The detective leaned down next to him, getting a closer look at his face. Teeth pulled, fingers taken, and a big 'Chinmoku' carved into his chest. 'Silence'. Who the hell are you?" 
 japleadup.1.a: "Search the scene."
 japleadup.1.b: "Search the workers."
 japleadup.1.c: "Search the body."
 japleadup.2.t: "Search the Scene"
 japleadup.2.d: "The detective had seen heads cracked over movie seats and streaks of blood on windshields, but never before had he seen a peeled person in a tuna warehouse. Another addition to the collection, it seemed. Walking away from the mangled corpse, he swept his eyes across the warehouse floor. Only a few hours prior this place had been dark and still, now it was filled with the hustle and bustle of police officers and forensic specialists.\n\nAs always, documenting every aspect of the scene would take time, and if done too quickly, it might fail to capture what they needed at all. In cases like these, so deliberate in their planning and execution, no detail was too small or too novel to be ignored, each one could be the difference between a breakthrough and a dead end. But the killer, no matter how skilled or prepared they may be, always leaves his mark, it's just a matter of finding it." 
 japleadup.2.a: "Break out the latex gloves."
 japleadup.3.t: "Search the Workers"
 japleadup.3.d: "Given how late at night it was, most of the plant's workers had been long gone when the call finally came in. But there was one worker who had been around, and in fact, he was the reason the call came in the first place. The dispatcher who sent the first squad had received the call from someone claiming to be a worker at the plant from a nearby payphone. He claimed to have seen someone suspicious on the plant's grounds and was worried about an attempted break-in. After giving the address of the plant and his name, he said he would wait near the entrance to the plant for the police to arrive.\n\nSure enough, when the squad car pulled up to the front gate the man was waiting there, huddled against the chill of the night air in his brown leather jacket. He showed the responding officers where he had seen the shadowy figure but they could not find any evidence of external tampering. Unconvinced, the man informed the officers that he was a shift lead and held one of the sets of keys to the plant, so they could check inside if they like. Seeing no harm in it, the officers accepted and followed the man into the darkened building, and the rest was history.\n\nIt may not seem like much, but with only one known witness to be found, the worker's testimony could be critical." 
 japleadup.3.a: "Employee of the month for sure."
 japleadup.4.t: "Search the Body"
 japleadup.4.d: "Of course, for the all the evidence that could possibly be collected, the body remained in the center of it all. It was a grim reminder of the caliber of the crime and of the criminal who carried it out. Just from the first glance one could tell it was not a hot-blooded murder of passion and rage, but a merciless case of cold cruelty.\n\nThe first task had been to remove the body from the vat of now-spoiled fish it was found in. The act itself had not posed much of a challenge, but the aftermath did. The forensics specialists had to carefully separate the oily pieces of fish carcass from the grisly gore of the victim centimeter by centimeter, taking care not to erase any potential evidence. Slowly but surely, as the fish was stripped away more details emerged from the ravaged corpse.\n\nMost notably, there did not appear to be many signs of resistance on the part of the victim, despite the horrifying nature of the injuries. There were no abrasions to the knuckles to indicate a struggle, nor were there any on the wrist to suggest the victim had struggled against some restraints. In fact there were hardly any blows from blunt objects anywhere on the body, which likely would have required in order to subdue the victim while the more precise and painful aspects of the crime were carried out. These absences suggested something on their own however, the victim had likely been killed in the first few stabs, with the rest of the damage being applied post-mortem. These then were not likely to be acts of torture, but intimidation." 
 japleadup.4.a: "But who is being intimidated?"
 japleadup.5.t: "The Burning Files"
 japleadup.5.d: "The detective failed to find anything of interest in the area immediately around where the body had been found. Someone might as well have gone over it a few times with a mop before they arrived, given how spotless it was. Whoever had done the deed had ensured to be as careful as possible, or they were an especially diligent cleaner. Dreading the thought of repeating the same process in other areas of the plant, the detective stepped outside to examine the grounds as well possible points of entry.\n\nAs he stepped outside and began walking towards the south end of the massive concrete building, he smelled something, the faint sharp odor of burning paper. As he drew closer, the smell grew stronger, but there was no accompanying smell of burning tobacco that would have suggested a cigarette as its source. Hurrying now, he jogged around the corner of the plant and followed his nose past some piles of crates and boxes, until he found the source, a pile of smoldering papers, starting to curl and blacken from the heat of the flames.\n\nThe detective sprinted over to the stack and began stomping at the flames until they guttered out and sent small streams of smoke up to the night sky. The detective then gingerly picked up the damaged files, brushed off the dirt that had previously been on the bottom of his shoe, and began to read." 
 japleadup.5.a: "Just in the nick of time."
 japleadup.6.t: "The Burnt Files"
 japleadup.6.d: "The next day the detective got the bad news from one of the officers who had been stationed to guard the crime scene at the plant. It turns out the forensics teams had not been as through as they thought, and had ended up missing something really important. After the detectives and specialists had left the scene for the night, the officer had been diligently patrolling the grounds, on high alert for any sign of the killer returning to the scene of the crime. But as he made his way behind the plant, he found what they had missed.\n\nA small pile of ashes on top of faint scorch marks on the ground, long since cooled by the night air and already beginning to spread over the surrounding area, motivated by the infrequent gusts of wind. Among the ashes there were a few scraps and shreds of paper, some of them with marginally discernible writing on them. From the various bits that were found that could still be read, it was obvious that the papers had once been files or records of some sort, and they had been burned extremely recently. But where had they come from? Was this the killer's true objective and the murder was just incidental? Or were they related? Either way, the detective wasn't going to leave it up to chance." 
 japleadup.6.a: "Better scraps than nothing, I guess..."
 japleadup.7.t: "Eyewitness Testimony"
 japleadup.7.d: "Fortunately, the plant worker who had called the police originally was still at the site when the detective went looking for him. He found the man near the entrance to the plant's grounds, in front of the row of squad cars assembled along the street. He had been speaking to a pair of deputy officers when the detective approached. After introductions, the detective pulled his notepad and pen from his pocket, and the man began his story yet again.\n\nAccording to the worker, after the plant closed last evening he and a few coworkers went out for drinks at a local bar a few blocks away, as they tended to do from time to time. While they were walking, they happened to pass a man in faded military fatigues with a long scar above his eye passing the other way. At the time, of course, this was nothing special. But later that night, after the coworkers parted ways, the man had to walk back past the plant the other direction to get home. As he walked past the entrance of his workplace, he happened to gaze through the chain link fence that surrounded it. And there, illuminated by a chance ray of moonlight, was the scarred military man, hurrying towards the far side of the main building.\n\nWhen the witness gave all that he could, the detective clicked his pen, folded his notebook closed, thanked the man for his time, and turned back towards the plant." 
 japleadup.7.a: "Who is this mysterious military man?"
 japleadup.8.t: "The Leaky Faucet Gets the Wrench"
 japleadup.8.d: "Because of how late it had been when the body was found, most of the plant workers had likely been long gone when the crime took place, their shifts having ended many hours before the call came in. That meant that for the most part they would be able to provide very little detail about the circumstances of the crime when the detective came knocking. However one worker, a shift lead, had been passing by the plant on his way home when he happened to see a suspicious figure on the property, and then decided to call the police. When the responding officers arrived he let them inside to search the premises, where they found the body. While the detective and forensic teams worked the site he had stayed to give his statement but left not long after.\n\nEager to get a more detailed and complete testimony, the detective got his name from the deputies who took his statement and confirmed it against the name the dispatcher received during the initial call. Over the next few days he made several calls to the shift manager's listened number while intermittently interviewing other workers, but each time received no reply. Eventually the detective got fed up and went to the man's address in person to confront him. But when he got there he found the front door slightly ajar. After calling out a few times and identifying himself as police, the detective pulled his pistol from its holster and carefully entered the house.\n\nIn the first room past the front hall, the detective found the shift manager, laying face down in a pool of partially-dried blood." 
 japleadup.8.a: "This is just the beginning."
 japleadup.9.t: "Fortunate Foresight"
 japleadup.9.d: "Eventually, the forensic experts were finished with documenting the crime scene and turned to move the body from its fishy resting place. At the request of the detective, the body was to be taken directly to the morgue where he would oversee the autopsy personally. Three officers with thick latex gloves and facemasks carefully lifted the corpse out of the vat and onto the stretcher. But as they laid the deceased man down onto the platform, one happened to notice something peculiar, something appeared to roll around inside the man's abdomen, causing a strange bulge right next to one of the largest wounds.\n\nWondering if some fish had found its way into the body's chest cavity, the officer pulled open the wound to get a better look inside. But it was not a condensed ball of tuna, rather it was a military issue hand grenade, entangled in a mess of wires leading deeper into the crevices of the corpse. Fortunately, after the initial shock the officer had the good sense to scream for everyone to get out of the building and to call the bomb squad.\n\nForty five minutes later, the bomb squad re-emerged from the plant and confirmed it was safe to go in, thanking the forensics experts who 'volunteered' to assist them. Unfortunately, the bomb squad had been much more concerned with defusing the explosives than they were with preserving the integrity of the evidence on the body. But all that soon became irrelevant, when the detective began looking over the components removed from the corpse and found a fingerprint right beneath the ring of the grenade." 
 japleadup.9.a: "Well that almost blew up in our faces."
 japleadup.10.t: "Deadly Oversight"
 japleadup.10.d: "This was supposed to be nothing more than a murder investigation. Same procedure as always, find the means, the motivation, and finally the man. The same procedure the detective had always done, the boys in blue get the evidence, and the boys in the back get the details. The detective had done his part of finding the body, so he sent on to the morgue like he always did, saw it loaded into the back of the ambulance like he always did, and turned to other business like he always did.\n\nThe ambulance drove for about five minutes before the bombs that had been stuffed in the corpse's chest cavity went off. Of course everyone heard the blast right away, but by the time the police arrived on scene, all that was left was a smoldering wreck. Two medical workers and a police officer had been in the back when it went off. After an hour of work their bodies were pulled from the wreckage, shredded by shrapnel, their blood mixing with the splattered gore of what remained of the body.\n\nBy some miracle, the driver of the ambulance managed to survive the initial blast. They found him collapsed a few meters from the driver side door, having pulled himself away from the ruined ambulance. The detective held the driver's hand while bloody tears ran down his cheeks as he cried that he couldn't see out of his left eye or feel his legs, and promised him it would be ok as he was loaded into another ambulance, crying out the names of his wife and children.\n\nAfter six hours of surgery, the driver was pronounced dead." 
 japleadup.10.a: "Now, this is personal."
 japleadup.11.t: "It Takes A Village"
 japleadup.11.d: "By saving the files from their fiery fate, the detective had catapulted the case forward where it had previously been lagging. It was no wonder that the killer had wanted the files destroyed, as they were essentially the blueprints of the crime itself. First and foremost was a profile of the victim, identified in the files as Yoshikage Shinji, a local taxman employed at one of offices in Tokyo. The files gave a rough description of him and his habits, alongside a slightly blurry headshot. It detailed his usual route to work and his typical schedule, not so clearly that one could trace it exactly, but clear enough to indicate that Yoshikage had been watched.\n\nThe files also gave some information about the fish plant where the body had been found however. The name, address, hours of operation, and grounds layout were all provided in a series of curtly typed notes. Given how complete the description of the property was, combined with the details about work schedules and routines, it was also clear that someone with insider knowledge of the plant had been involved.\n\nIt seemed obvious the killer had been assisted by at least one other party. If it had been the killer himself who knew this information, why bother to bring it with him to the scene of the crime? But who could have been in a position to help the killer, and why would someone involved with a fish plant want to kill a taxman?" 
 japleadup.11.a: "Find the Helping Hands."
 japleadup.12.t: "Up in Smoke"
 japleadup.12.d: "Despite the best efforts of the detective and the staff of the forensics lab, hardly anything could be gleaned from the blackened scraps of paper that had been retrieved from the crime scene. Many of the scraps that had survived were extremely brittle and fragile, splitting into smaller pieces or dissolving into ash at the slightest touch. But really this was no great loss, because most were either already unreadable or contained contextless words or fragments of sentences that provided no leads or useful information.\n\nThe only things that were somewhat readable were the centers of a few pages from the latter half of the pile. Their headers and margins had been swallowed up by the flames, encircling the remaining text in black rings. Unfortunately, this meant there were no names or otherwise identifying information to be found among the lucky survivors. All they gave were some rough descriptions of the fish plant and its operation, nothing to suggest why it had been chosen for the crime. One thoroughly burned scrap made a few references to payment, but gave no context to suggest that it was concerned with anything more than standard business transactions.\n\nWith nothing else to be done, the detective begrudgingly placed the ashen pages back into their dedicated environment-proof bag and returned them to the evidence locker. Despite the flames, the lead had gone cold." 
 japleadup.12.a: "If only we had been faster."
 japleadup.13.t: "Narrowing the Search"
 japleadup.13.d: "While the description of the suspect that the plant worker had given to the detective was certainly informative, it could only go so far in a city like Tokyo. There could have been thousands of people who matched that description just within a few kilometers of the plant. In order to narrow down the possibilities, the detective decided to focus on the most distinguishing part of the description, the military uniform. At first, the detective was conflicted, was it really likely that the suspect was an active soldier?\n\nThe worker's description of a noticeable scar did provide some support for that line of reasoning, as it very well could have been some kind of combat wound. But why would he wear his fatigues during the act? Wouldn't that only make it easier to track him down if he was seen?\n\nBut maybe, the whole point was for him to be recognized as a member of the military. Maybe, some part of the crime was contingent on the killer's military position, or it was part of the way he made contact with co-conspirators. And beyond all that, perhaps its allowed for some plausible deniability, a soldier on short-term leave with nothing but his fatigues. Ostensibly the military held a record of every soldier on requested leave and where they would be, it couldn't hurt to check who was kicking around Tokyo." 
 japleadup.13.a: "No harm in asking."
 japleadup.14.t: "Twins in Death"
 japleadup.14.d: "Unfortunately, the shift worker was left in a grisly state similar to that of the victim. His chest and stomach were covered in nearly a dozen slashes and stab wounds. His neck bore a matching wound, deep and savage, likely the final wound that had drained the life from the poor man. And once again, the same ominous mark appeared gouged into flesh and accented by dried blood, 'Chinmoku', 'Silence'. This time however, rather than being proudly and boldly displayed in the center of the chest, the shift worker's mark was etched into his left shoulder.\n\nBut where the previous victim's character had been smooth and deliberate with neatly traced lines, this one was shaky and jagged. The killer must have been in a hurry, the detective concluded, basing his judgement off the comparatively sloppy work. This wasn't a carefully planned, premeditated murder, this was on a whim, or perhaps, out of necessity.\n\nBut beyond the sign of the killer's gruesome haste, there was little more to be gleaned from the body. It seemed speed did not quite translate to carelessness on the part of the killer. Still, the splatters and drops of blood found around the entryway demonstrated that this had been no simple task. The shift lead must have fought every step of the way against his vicious assailant, fiercely resisting him from the moment he burst through the door right up until his collapse into his final resting place on the living room floor." 
 japleadup.14.a: "But it wasn't enough..."
 japleadup.15.t: "Bombshell Evidence"
 japleadup.15.d: "With great care on the part of the forensics team, they managed to triple the quantity of evidence found from the bomb components retrieved from the corpse. In total they found three fingerprints, one just beneath the ring of the grenade, another on its handle, and a lone thumbprint on its base. As for the rest of the parts, nothing else could be found on them, it seemed that whoever had assembled the bomb had become careless at the critical moment, perhaps overcome with the fear of handling live explosives.\n\nIn terms of sheer force, the bomb itself was nothing extraordinary, it was nothing more than a hand grenade and a few gunpowder charges crudely wired to a rudimentary timing device. By the bomb squad's estimation, had they not noticed the bomb when they did it likely would have gone off within the half hour, a fortunate break to say the least. Likey it was not meant as some form of convoluted terror attack, but as a means of destroying evidence, with the added benefit of another layer of intimidation. But what the bomb lacked in power it made up for in its alarming nature, how was it that a military issue grenade could appear here of all places?\n\nTo answer that question, the detective could only turn to the aforementioned fingerprints, which of course entailed the long and arduous task of visually comparing the prints with the nearly endless collection in the Tokyo Police Records. With nothing else to be done, the detective sighed as he picked up the case files from his desk, and began the long march to the records room." 
 japleadup.15.a: "Police work isn't all car chases and gunfights, you know."
 japleadup.16.t: "Shrapnel"
 japleadup.16.d: "Pulling the victim's body free from the fish vat and examining the sordid details had been grusomework, but the process of going through the ruined ambulance and its former occupants was a thousand times worse. It had been an ordeal of in itself just to separate the shredded remains of their coworkers and the splattered gore of the victim's corpse. To make matters worse, much of what had not been blasted or torn away had been charred and burned by the flaming ambulance, further desecrating the bodies of the innocent and practically destroying any hope of retrieving evidence from the body itself.\n\nAs for the bomb that had caused the horrifying blast, very little of it was left in any useful capacity. What had not been scattered to the winds by the initial explosion had been blackened beyond recognition by the flames. But, by some miracle stroke of luck, a single salvageable piece of evidence was preserved. Inside the chest cavity of the victim, now exposed to the open air by a vicious wound, they found a particular piece of shrapnel embedded within its bloody walls. The shrapnel was much like all the others, save for the row of characters stamped into the metal. A military serial number, the same kind that could be seen on any of the tens of thousands of grenades, bombs, and shells that flowed in and around Japan and the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nBut beyond that one string of numbers and letters, the bomb had succeeded in its purpose, the body lead had reached its bloody end." 
 japleadup.16.a: "Bury the body and the lead with it."
 japleadup.17.t: "The Final File in the Folder"
 japleadup.17.d: "After poring over and analyzing every line of the slightly singed papers, the detective at last came to final page in the stack. It was folded in half, an uneven crease running horizontally across the page. The bottom right corner had been almost entirely burned away, leaving a ring of blackened paper in its place. As the detective opened it to read, some of the more brittle pieces of the charred page broken off, disintegrating into dust as they spun towards the floor.\n\nIt was little more than a simple note, lines of slightly faded typewriter text organized into a unimpressive paragraph. But as the detective ran his eyes over each character and absorbed the meaning of the text line by line, the note quickly became the most important paper in the pile.\n\n'Per our arrangement, you are scheduled to meet our associate at exactly seven minutes past noon, where the disposal equipment will be returned to you. Our associate has been told to expect a man wearing basic military fatigues, brown shoes, and a facial scar above the right eye, ensure you strictly adhere to this description. Furthermore, we have repeatedly reminded you to avoid contact with your brother in the police force in the interest of security, and we hope we agree it would be in the interest of all parties if he were not involved. We sympathize with your concerns, Mr. Takahara, however we assure you that when the job is complete, you will be paid for your time.'" 
 japleadup.17.a: "I guess it really isn't personal, huh."
 japleadup.18.t: "The Mysterious Military Man"
 japleadup.18.d: "As the detective had expected, the military did indeed maintain records of all the soldiers who had been granted leave, and the local office was happy to allow him to view those records, under supervision of course. What the detective did not anticipate however, was the sheer number of soldiers that encompassed. Initially he was faced with a stack of paper so daunting the lead likely would have gone cold before he was halfway through. To save time, the detective was forced to rely on his hunch and narrow his request to only those on a short term leave.\n\nEach record was nothing more than a piece of paper with a few blocks of text in the center and a slightly-blurred picture of the soldier it concerned in the top right. They all contained nothing more than the soldier's name, unit, length of requested leave, place of residence during leave, and start and end date of leave. Over the course of several hours, the detective flipped his way through the stack, quickly scanning the details and comparing the picture to the descriptions in his notebook, before placing it in one of two piles. Before long, the detective's 'rejected' pile was much, much larger than his 'possible' pile, with the few in the latter pile nothing more than distant approximations.\n\nBut just as he was about to give up, he flipped on more page and found a man with a scar above his right eye frowning back at him. The man was Takahara Ryo, a private in the Army on leave for one week, starting two days before the body was found. But when the detective went to check the listed place of residence, he found that while it was registered to a Takahara, it was not this Takahara. Rather it was the home of Ryo's brother, a police officer in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police service." 
 japleadup.18.a: "Maybe the brother can produce an alibi?"
 japleadup.19.t: "The Redacted Record"
 japleadup.19.d: "Much to the detective's delight, the process of comparing and matching the fingerprints had taken less time than he anticipated. By working just a handful of junior officers to the bone for a few days, he had managed to compile a stack of probable matches and their corresponding files. Of course, most were rough approximations and they were limited to those who had their fingerprints on file already, but there was little else that could be done.\n\nMost of the profiles from the potential matches were typical Tokyo criminal lowlife. Thugs and drug dealers, low level gangsters and enforcers, the prototypical scum that the police force fought against. But while most certainly fit the character profile, none had any obvious meaningful connection to the particular circumstances of the crime. But for one such record, that lack of detail only drew more suspicion. There was on set of prints that matched those found on the bomb quite closely, debatably the closest of them all. But the only file it corresponded to was a single redacted arrest record, the original source of the prints.\n\nBoth the name and circumstances of the crime had been struck from the record, generously coated in black ink bars that dotted the page. Beyond that there was no reason given for why the record had been censored, no accompanying paperwork or notice of change. The only pieces of identifying information were the picture of unnamed man, an average sized man with short black hair and a scarred gas above his right eye, and the name of the filing officer, some Takahara down at the central police station. Perhaps he would be able to offer some insight." 
 japleadup.19.a: "I'll call a cab."
 japleadup.20.t: "The Interrupted Meeting"
 japleadup.20.d: "Tracking down Officer Takahara was easy enough, his schedule for the day had him scheduled to be on-call from the Tokyo Central Police Station itself. The Detective felt somewhat weird about confront a fellow police officer about a crime of this caliber. However he figured that the officer would be able to provide some alibi or correct some misunderstood detail on their part. So, he gathered up a small squad of officers and a fellow detective, and made their way down to the Central Station.\n\nOnce there, with a quick flash of their badges and stern relaying of their intent, they were waved past the front desk and towards the general officer's hall. At first, the group could not seem to find Officer Takahara amidst the regular daily hustle and bustle of the station's officers, but one of his colleagues was kind enough to inform them that Takahara had stepped out back for a smoke break. With a curt thank you, the detective turned to the door at the far end of the room that led to the back entrance of the station, his team following behind him. When he pushed the heavy metal door open he saw no sign of Takahara, but heard some hushed words float from around the corner.\n\nNot waiting for the rest of his team to come through the door, the detective briskly rounded the corner in search of the source of the voice. There he found himself face to face with Officer Takahara, who himself had been locked in conversation with another man who looked quite like him in passing, save for the deep scar above his right eye. There was a brief moment of silence as the three men stared at each other. But it lasted no longer than the time it took for the them to reach for their weapons. The first sound was nearly the detective's shout of 'police', but it was just barely beaten out by a gunshot." 
 japleadup.20.a: "Shots fired."
 japleadup.21.t: "The View from the Ground"
 japleadup.21.d: "The detective's vision was blurry, the shapes and colours of the world merged and melded with each other. With each blink his eyelids became heavier and heavier, flicking his vision between indiscernible fog and total darkness. But for a moment, with a great amount of effort on the detective's part, his vision became clear. He saw the scarred man in front of him, face down against the hard concrete ground. His hands were cuffed behind him and the boot of a police officer was placed squarely on his back. Turning his eyes a bit, he could see a small pool of bloody forming beneath him, trickling out of a dark hole in his leg.\n\nThe detective also became aware of the that fact the world around him was quite loud. The sounds appeared distant and garbled, but he had been so focused on looking he had hardly noticed them at all. With yet more effort, the detective strained to hear the sounds of surroundings. First he heard the groaning of the scarred man in front of him, soft and indistinct. Next came the repeated pops and cracks of gunfire, accompanied by the occasional wizzing of bullets and rumbles of impact. Finally, he turned to see one of the officers that had accompanied him, crouched behind a crate and screaming into his radio. For a moment their eyes met, and he saw fear, confusion, and above all, loss. Then, as the detective's eyelids fell for one last time, the words he shouted became clear.\n\n'-requesting backup to our location immediately! We are taking fire from a police officer at the south-eastern exterior of the central station! Officer is down! I repeat, officer is down!'" 
 japleadup.21.a: "But we aren't done..."
 
 #The Touchou
 japtouchou.1.t: "Stage Two"
 japtouchou.1.d: "The developments in the Tōgoku case that occurred while collecting evidence strongly suggested that the motivation for the murder is far more complex and calculated than initially thought. With the revelation that the killing itself was carried out by a former soldier, who had seemingly no obvious relation to the victim, the investigation took on a new character. Where the officers of the ward station once combed through the gory details of the case over tables and across desks, there was now only a stern silence. Hushed conversations were held behind closed doors, locks on filing cabinets were now checked and double-checked, and notebooks became carefully guarded realms of speculation and secrets.\n\nNo command or directive brough this culture of silence to the station, it was ushered in by the demeanor of the chief detective. He had steadily become more stoic and withdrawn as the days went by. Answers to previous questions spawned questions of their own, and before long the case loomed like a hydra over the department.\n\nGiven the general sense of turmoil, it was all the more surprising when the chief gathered the department before him one morning and announced that the investigation was moving to its next stage. The teams would be re-organized to shift away from field work, and focus on filling the holes in the case with paper. Each group would be responsible for interacting with, requesting, and securing information from a different administrative office. Most importantly, the specific objectives of, and information obtained by each group would be strictly localized, only known within the group and to the central command of the investigation. The chief did not offer a justification for that change, but none was really needed.\n\nAfterward, the detective paused to run his eyes over the rows of silent, stone-faced men before him, looking for any sign of concern or confusion. Finally, he broke the silence.\n\n"No questions?" he asked. But the stoic men kept their silence, glancing between themselves and the detective.\n\n"Ok then," he continued. "This is what we're going to do.""
 japtouchou.1.a: "The investigation gains momentum."
 japtouchou.2.t: "Learning the Rules"
 japtouchou.2.d: ""Evidence to suggest the existence of a wider conspiracy does not in turn give clearance to boldly burst our way through the organs of state on the pretense of obstruction of justice," said the chief detective, slowly pacing before his men. "Rather, we must take the opposite position, in a sense. We must carefully plan our actions before we make them, as well as anticipate and prepare for the result of said actions."\n\nHe came to a stop, and turned to gaze over the uniformed officers assembled in the rows of chairs before him. He knew all their faces, the names that went with them, and the desks they normally appeared behind. Some of them were veterans of the service, officers and detectives who had given a large portion of their lives to the Tokyo Police Service. Others were newer, recent graduates from police academies, transfers from other departments, or military men who wanted a change of pace.\n\nWeighing this, the chief resumed. "Previously we have used our obligation to enforce the law like a hammer, smashing aside all obstacles to reveal the information we desire. Here, however, the key is superior to the battering ram. The fierce rivalries between and within the branches of military and government have encouraged the growth of a culture of underhanded opportunism. It permeates through the offices and conference rooms of administration and clouds the judgement of those within. That is the weakness we must exploit, the conditions that motivated the crime will be its perpetrators' undoing."\n\nWith that, he gathered his papers from the podium in front of him into a pile, straightened it with two quick taps against the podium, and walked from the meeting room. As soon as he disappeared from the doorway, his subordinates rose with a chorus of chair legs scraping against linoleum floors, and set to their tasks."
 japtouchou.2.a: "Nobody said it would be easy."
 japtouchou.3.t: "Friends of Friends in the Right Places"
 japtouchou.3.d: "Smoke from the chief detective's cigarette wafted towards the ceiling as he leaned back in his office chair. It rippled past the frosted glass windows that separated his office from the common area that housed the desks of the department's officers and detectives. Two of such detectives sat in front of him now, each in an uncomfortable metal chair half a meter away from the hulking mass of polished wood that served as the chief's desk.\n\nOne was senior detective Kodaira, a long-standing veteran of the Tokyo Police, his age beginning to show in the wrinkles around his eyes and the dusting of grey hairs on his head. The other was a younger man transferred from a department in Osaka, named Tachi. He had served as an officer for a number of years prior, followed by a handful more as a detective. While his senior remained somewhat relaxed in his chair, the young detective leaned forward to speak.\n\n"What I'm trying to say, sir," he began. "Is that given the circumstances it would make sense to establish an informal network inside key offices beforehand rather then try to build a network of contacts as we go along."\n\nThe chief tapped his cigarette on the rim of a glass ashtray, one of the few things that sat on his otherwise barren desk. "What do you mean by informal?" he asked.\n\n"Unofficial connections mostly," Kodaira interjected. "Former contacts for old cases, friends of friends, old Army buddies, whatever. People who we could ask to take care of the pen-and-paper tasks that bureaucrats are usually not so motivated to do. All with the understanding that their effort is deeply appreciated by the Tokyo Police Service, who will happily remember or forget their contributions, depending on what they prefer."\n\n"And because of the rather sensitive nature of the operation," Tachi said, "we think it best to limit our network to one major government working group. Otherwise we risk alerting the conspirators if they find out half of their office goes down for coffee at the station once a week. For our purposes, we recommend either the Army, Navy, or Diet administrations, sir.""
 japtouchou.3.a: "The Army."
 japtouchou.3.b: "The Navy."
 japtouchou.3.c: "The Imperial Diet."
 japtouchou.4.t: "Paper Tigers"
 japtouchou.4.d: "The chief detective sat behind his desk, carefully flicking through his roll of contact cards. Each card was given at least a moment's worth of attention, enough to read the name stamped on it in black ink. Most then were immediately flicked past and forgotten, but a few were worthy of an another moment of consideration, and fewer still made the detective pause altogether.\n\nHe searched for the names of people in the same way one would search for the name of a street. Unconcerned with the memories, thoughts, and feelings related to the names, only their usefulness as a path from one place to another. But the roads he sought led to the heart of the Imperial monolith, and were neither easily found nor traversed. Doubly so, in the case of the Tax Bureau and Board of Audit.\n\nThe Tax Bureau was the attack dog of the Ministry of Finance. Many aspiring gang leaders or captains of industry had their dreams dashed by the discerning gaze and careful calculations of its agents. The Bureau demanded information in torrents of paperwork, for 'accuracy, consistency, and redundancy', and had amassed a horde of data in an impossibly intricate filing system. It neared an intelligence agency in its own right, devoted to the single purpose of following and securing the revenue of the Empire.\n\nBy contrast, the Board of Audit was a reclusive agency, shunned by the ministries of the cabinet. This made little difference to its officials, in some sense it was preferable. They existed to examine the finances and records of the various public institutions that spread around the Empire. But the Board's position in the hierarchy was artificial, in a sense, they reported to the Diet but were subordinate only to the Emperor. While they acted with the Divine purpose of exposing the subversives who exploited the Empire for personal gain, and had done so in the past from time to time, in recent years the office had fallen silent.\n\nThe chief leaned back in his chair, juggling an unlit cigarette between his fingers. Two names now sat before him, one to each office. He considered for a moment longer, and then reached forward to pick up the phone."
 japtouchou.4.a: "Talk to the Taxman."
 japtouchou.4.b: "Ask an Auditor."
 japtouchou.5.t: "The Parallel Approach"
 japtouchou.5.d: "Detectives Tachi and Kodaira stood under the canopy that covered the entrance to the Tokyo Central Police Station. They stood side by side, not quite facing each other but not quite facing away, their backs to the door. Each held a cigarette, Tachi in his left hand and Kodaira in his right, which they would raise to their lips every now and again. Between them, four cigarette butts sat crushed onto the ground.\n\n"How it seems to me," said Kodaira, pausing to pull on his cigarette, "is that we have two angles to approach this case at. One is through the killer himself, who he was, where he came from, how he ended up here, his tragic backstory, all that nonsense. The other, is through the circumstances of the killing, why did it happen where it did, when it did, and in the way that it did."\n\n"And you think it's a matter of picking the right one?" Tachi asked.\n\n"That's just it," replied Kodaira, eagerly inhaling another puff. "If there really is a conspiracy, or at least one going further than we've found already, then none of those details would have been left to chance. What I mean is, it's not just about where those angles lead, it's about where they overlap."\n\nTachi turned to look at him. "So what do you suggest?" he asked.\n\n"Two teams, each of us leading one. One focuses on the criminal, the other on the crime. We keep the specifics local to our teams, but you and I meet privately to discuss, compare, and coordinate. Maximum coverage, minimal risk. And you know how much I enjoy rooting through the personal effects of the deranged and disturbed," Kodaira said with a smirk. "But I think I'll let you take the lead in that respect, seeing as you've yet to have the chance since you got here. Consider this an impromptu field lecture on Tokyo criminal psychology," he said, bringing the remains of his cigarette back to his lips. Tachi flashed a quick smile smiled in reply, before he dropped the smoldering ends of his cigarette on the ground and crushed it beneath the sole of his scuffed leather shoes."
 japtouchou.5.a: "That settles it, then."
 japtouchou.6.t: "Knowing What We Don't Know"
 japtouchou.6.d: "Five men crowded around the worn table in the meeting room of the ward police station. Three were police officers, each clad in a dark blue uniform and carrying a shining badge of office in a clip at their waists. The other two were detectives, Tachi and another recent transfer to the team. All of them leaned over a collage of files, documents, and pictures, carefully arranged in a half circle around a picture of Takahara Ryo.\n\n"So in total," said Tachi, the other four men turning to face him as he spoke. "We know three central things about Takahara here. First, that he killed Yoshikage Shinji in a very specific manner despite no apparent relation between them. Second, he is a member of the Armed Forces, very likely the Army. And third, he had a half-brother in the Tokyo Police Force willing to assist him." The rest of the group nodded in reply.\n\n"So that gives us with two major avenues of investigation," he continued. "We have the military angle, finding out what the military knew about him and what he did for them. Or, we can cover the basics, as we would in a normal case. Establish a broader background, get a general sense of who he was as a person, what his social groups were, his habits, and so on. Regardless, our goal is to construct a motivation from his prior actions, and from there try and form a reasonable connection to further parties."\n\nThree of the other men nodded again, but the fourth, a bright-eyed young officer from the south, cleared his throat to speak. "Sir? Given the circumstances of that case, that is, the fact that the suspect had a brother on the police force, should we consider that an angle of investigation too?"\n\nTachi hesitated a moment, before replying, "At this stage we are missing so much of the basic facts of the case that I don't think we can make real headway in a related internal investigation at the moment. If there is more to be found inside the force, going in blind will only make finding it more difficult. So with all that being said I propose we...""
 japtouchou.6.a: ""Take the military route.""
 japtouchou.6.b: ""Establish a basic profile.""
 japtouchou.7.t: "Learning What We Will Learn"
 japtouchou.7.d: ""Now gentlemen," said Detective Kodaira, pausing to take a sip of coffee from the mug in his right hand. "The simple matter is, I can't accept that a man can be dismembered, defaced, and dumped in a vat of tuna on a whim. That notion simply doesn't sit right in my mind. In all my years of experience, nobody has ever involved a vat of tuna in their plans by accident. Because of that, gentlemen, we will be taking nothing for granted in this case. For us, there is no such thing as the benefit of the doubt, the word coincidence has no use here."\n\nNine member of the Tokyo Police Service sat in chairs, leaned against desk, or stood in a half circle in front of him. They were a mix of street officers, desk workers, and junior detectives. Some listened with blank, expectant stares, while other were stern and cold, frowning as the mulled over the senior detective's words.\n\n"With that said," he continued, "we will be conducting a thorough examination of the particulars of this case. The purpose of that examination is to answer the question of why. Why did the killing take place when it took place? Why was the victim disfigured in the way that he was? And most of all, why did our suspect pick that particular tuna vat out of all the tuna vats in Tokyo. Those are the questions I want answers to, and trust me, I will get my answers one way or another." He let the last sentence settle over his men, gauging their reactions, or lack thereof.\n\n"To achieve that goal, there are two paths that have been laid before us. We can go low, down into the factory floor and see what we can pull from the fish guts and bones. Or, we can go high, up to the owners and financiers of the whole operation, and see how far the paper trail takes us. Given our prior issues with security and obtaining evidence, it seems pretty clear that the correct move is to...""
 japtouchou.7.a: "Investigate the Plant."
 japtouchou.7.b: "Investigate the Owners."
 japtouchou.8.t: "The Infantryman's Caretakers"
 japtouchou.8.d: "As expected, securing Takahara's military files was no simple matter. The Imperial General Headquarters, the administrative office that the straddled the chasm between the Army administrations, was initially willing to cooperate with the investigation without much bother. But in reality they could merely point the investigation towards the relevant branch, in this case the Army, who maintained sole administrative responsibility over Takahara's files. From then on, the efforts of the team were completely subject to the whims of the IJA Personnel Bureau.\n\nFor days on end, the desk workers of the investigative team filled out forms, made phone calls, issued requests, re-submitted forms, all while making sure to file everything in triplicate. No amount of pressure or intimidation seemed to have any effect on the staff either. Such efforts were met with monotone voices over phone calls and glazed eyes in person. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a courier arrived early one morning, clutching a package sealed in a black plastic cover. After he checked and re-checked Detective Tachi's ID, he reluctantly handed him the package before retreating back to the Tokyo streets.\n\nThe package contained Takahara's basic military files, including those regarding his recruitment evaluation, training, and performance records. The files confirmed much of what was already suspected. Takahara had joined almost immediately after finishing school, and was quickly sent to basic training. There, he passed his training regime without issue and was cleared for active service. His psychological and performance reports revealed more noteworthy information, however. His superiors regarded him as 'jumpy' and even at times 'overly eager', but he was also praised for his quick adherence to orders and lack of hesitation in simulated combat.\n\nThe last of the files stated that he had been stationed in northern Indonesia a year ago, as part of an Imperial 'Security Battalion' deployed to the region. But they offered no further insight to his role or his more recent actions."
 japtouchou.8.a: "Persistence is key when dealing with the Army."
 japtouchou.9.t: "Under the Spotlight"
 japtouchou.9.d: "Detective Tachi rubbed his eyes and yawned. He sat alone at his desk in the darkened station office, the usual hustle and bustle had long given way to a steady silence. His desk lamp provided a small pool of light, illuminating Tachi as if he were an actor upon a stage. Looking outside the windows, the sky was as dark as the office. But even at this hour, light from the cars, signs, and streetlights of Tokyo poured through the glass and drew shadows on the walls of the station.\n\nTachi looked back down at the papers arrayed on his desk before him. They were the result of his team's effort to establish a general background on the Takahara Ryo. The intention had been to begin compiling the next day, but Tachi chose to stay late to begin the process himself, not having any spouse or children to return to like some of his colleagues.\n\nBy all accounts, Takahara was thoroughly average. He had been an average student, both in conduct and exams. He had chosen to enlist in the general infantry corps after his final year of school, with no obvious intention of pursuing a specialized role or command. He had been picked up twice for bar fights, but it never amounted to anything more than a night in custody. The only noteworthy thing in that respect was an arrest six months ago for the possession of illegal substances. However, no further information was given in the report, and it seems he was released the next day without incident.\n\nThe detective frowned. None of the other files had implied anything related to drugs. But Takahara's medical records were not included in the bundle, as the records were not centralized and tended to move as the patient did, requiring some effort to track down. Of course, Tachi could not help but notice the curious police record. An apparent repeat offender was consistently let go even after more severe charges were applied. In all likelihood, this was the work of the brother, Officer Takahara, suggesting there was more to their cooperation."

 japtouchou.10.t: "Malicious Compliance"
 japtouchou.10.d: "Nobody, not even Detective Kodaira, could say that the management of the Tōgoku fish plant did not comply with the warrants they had been served. Just two days after the investigative team had requested the transfer of critical files from the plant, they arrived. But they did not come in a series of folders, binders, and envelopes as the team had expected, rather they appeared at the reception of the station in four large cardboard boxes, their bottoms sagging under the weight of the papers within them.\n\nWhat the team found within them would have made the most experienced accountant faint and driven the most determined auditor to suicide. Endless piles of paper, the overwhelming majority falling in that sweet space between 'useless' and 'nonsense'. The cream of the crop was the special few which benefited from either the structure of being typed with a typewriter, or the neatly printed designs of standardized forms. The rest were a nightmare. Hundreds of illegible handwritten forms, dozens upon dozens of half-completed documents making reference to other half-completed documents, all floating in a sea of contextless, meaningless notes and reports.\n\nEvery facet of the plant contributed to this monstrosity. Management and staff files were mixed together carelessly, each individual's reports jammed together in no particular order. Finance reports were lumped together in one pile, it made no difference if the money was incoming or outgoing, it did not matter if it was allocated for raw resources, wages, or shareholder payouts. The whole plant seemed to be enveloped in a whirling vortex of haphazard bookkeeping.\n\nWith the investigation reaching nowhere quickly, Kodaira intervened. He declared that in order to conduct a proper audit, the team would shift to focus on one particular aspect of the plant, rather than it as a whole."

This included everything from the plant's articles of incorporation and bylaws, to their land and development permits. The plant's official name was the Tōgoku Regional Seafood Processing Facility, a name which rolled off the tongue like a brick on a plain. It had been established five years prior, the property had previously been an abandoned warehouse but was quickly converted into its current industrial state at the whim of a plucky investor.\n\nSaid investor went by the name of Soejima Morihiro, a local Tokyo socialite and entrepreneur. He was the direct owner and operating manager of the plant, but it seemed that in recent years most of the day to day operations of the plant were administered by a series of lower level managers. During that time, Soejima had been busy starting and launching a host of other businesses in and around Tokyo, ranging from other food processing plants to naval equipment factories. At first the team was skeptical of how this was possible, given the relative cost of opening and converting properties verses the profits they generated. But two facts came to light that provided easy explanations.\n\nFirst, the plant, in addition to all the other properties opened by Soejima, were part of a wider consumer-industrial conglomerate, named the Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha. It was immediately obvious that the conglomerate provided the necessary capital and backing to support the ambitious expansion plans. Second, Soejima Morihiro was the eldest son of Soejima Shinzō, a respected member of the prestigious and powerful Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, Tokyo's primary legislative body. Either of these facts could have been connected to the motivation behind Yoshikage's symbolic murder, perhaps the end result of industrial espionage or political subterfuge. Regardless, the team was forced to consolidate their efforts and focus on the chosen approach."

 japtouchou.11.b: "Focus on the Father."
 japtouchou.12.t: "Compromises and Powder Kegs"
 japtouchou.12.d: "While securing the first set of files from the firm grasp of the Army had been difficult, it paled in comparison to the effort to retrieve the most recent files. Every single day some new issue was raised that ground the investigation's progress to a halt. Every single day some new form needed to be filled out or some official needed to be corresponded with. A detective would submit a request form one day, only for it to be returned a few days later, with a note stating a list of departments the form needed to be sent to simultaneously in order for it to be considered. All along the way, representatives from the Army scrutinized the investigation and their motives. They cited potential issues in security and demanded to know the relevance of and justification for retrieving the files.\n\nBut finally, with the endless trading of paperwork reaching a stalemate, an agreement was reached. Detective Tachi and his fellow detective would be granted access to the files in a secure room at the IJA Regional Staff Headquarters in central Tokyo. They would not be permitted to remove the files, but they would be allowed to record any information they deemed relevant, while under supervision of course. Early the next morning, Tachi and his partner strode through the doors of the HQ, each with a small stack of notebooks under their arms. Six hours later, they re-emerged.\n\nSix months ago, Takahara Ryo enrolled in an explosives certification training course. The primary purpose of this course was to groom soldiers stationed throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere for anti-insurgent units, specializing in IED identification and defusal. Takahara had never expressed interest in joining such a unit, both before and after he undertook the training. Clearly, the team concluded, the only motivation he had to take this course was as preparation for planting the corpse bomb discovered during the initial investigation. It was also clear that the Army had played some role in this case. They had provided the necessary skills, intentionally or otherwise, now it was time to see if they had provided the equipment."
 japtouchou.12.a: "Anyone missing a grenade?"
 japtouchou.13.t: "Let the Medical Record Show"
 japtouchou.13.d: "As expected, finding Takahara's medical records in the webwork of Japanese bureaucracy was no easy task. Many times Detective Tachi's team tracked them to one clinic or office, only to find yet another notice of transfer. However eventually, through sheer persistence and a great deal of patience, half a decade's worth of records made their way to the desks of Tokyo Central.\n\nThe basic details were generally unsurprising. The records described a physically healthy young man, both by civilian and military standards. The statistics lined up with those recorded in the autopsy, and they seemed to be consistent between each individual file. But the more recent records revealed a pair of intertwined complexities. At some point in the previous years Ryo had begun to spiral into what the doctors had referred to as a 'persistent depressive state'. He described consistently low moods, trouble eating and sleeping, and an increasingly withdrawn disposition. Most notable, the only break in the downward trend seemed to come around eight months ago, when Ryo expressed excitement over rekindling the relationship with his brother.\n\nBut the revelations did not end there. A handwritten note was found shoved in the back of folder containing medical records dated six months ago. It appeared to have been written by the doctor who had examined Takahara, whether it was intended for his own or his patient's reference, was unclear. Three pieces of information were written on the note, the words 'West Tokyo Behavior Clinic', a phone number, and an address. After consulting a phonebook, the team confirmed that all three of those things pointed to the same place. It was a specialized treatment clinic, aimed at combating 'social diseases' such as antisocial behavior, alcoholism, and drug abuse.\n\nWhile the specific purpose of the recommendation was not immediately clear to the team, for once their next move was."
 japtouchou.13.a: "A spoonful of sugar helps the audit go down."
 japtouchou.14.t: "The Criminal's Brother"
 japtouchou.14.d: "At a glance, Officer Takahara and his brother, Takahara Ryo, looked quite similar. They both had dark brown eyes, short cut black hair, and had almost the same physique. But as was usually the case, the longer one stared at the two men, the more the individual subtleties stood out. Almost the same could be said of their respective lifestyles. On the surface they were both men of law and order, Ryo as a soldier and his brother as a police officer. But again, a casual glance over the details revealed the key points of differentiation. Both men seized upon their upon their respective opportunity with what seemed to be entirely different intentions. For Ryo, it served as a means to escape what he saw as the drudgery of civil life. But for his brother, the purpose was the opposite, it was a means to propel himself upwards in the social environment he found himself in.\n\nIndeed, where Ryo had a tendency to meander around the middle ground, his brother tended to shine. Officer Takahara was highly regarded within the Tokyo Police Service, particularly for an officer who had served only three years until that point. His records contained a long list of commendations from his superiors and public officials, but lacked a single citation.\n\nWhat Officer Takahara's records also lacked however, was any reference to the incidents involving his brother. If he had been involved in preventing any charges from sticking to Ryo, he was careful to ensure he did so quietly. In fact, his records contained no reference to Ryo at all, not even a casual indication that he had a brother. In order to gain any insight into the circumstances surround the arrests, the investigation would need to refine their search. Detective Tachi ordered his team to collect and review the files specifically pertaining to Ryo's arrests, as well as any and all that included or mentioned Officer Takahara. As it would turn out, that was a lot."
 japtouchou.14.a: "Better get started."
 japtouchou.15.t: "Employee Review"
 japtouchou.15.d: "The staff of the plant that Takahara had made into a crime scene were an unassuming bunch. For the most part they were either working class locals mixed with a few impoverished immigrants from throughout the sphere. They were paid meager wages and worked long hours, but showed no visible signs of resentment. Their employee reports were littered with pedantic and micro-managerial complaints and criticisms of their work ethic, but never of their attitude and disposition. The employee records also resolved an uncertainty that had been plaguing Detective Kodaira for some time. How had it been possible for Takahara to enter the plant and dump the body unnoticed? Did the plant not employ any guards, and if they did, how did he get past them?\n\nAs it would turn out, the plant did employ night guards, three to be precise. According to their records, the plant had started with just two and had recently hired the third about five months ago. They were paid slightly more than the floor workers and alternated night shifts between each other, according to the contract they all signed. They arrived each day at 7pm, when the last of the factory workers would be shutting and cleaning the plant, and left at 7am the next day, just as the next shift of workers was arriving.\n\nThe employee schedules revealed that the night guard who had been on duty the night of the murder was a man by the name of Hajime Katsuki. He was one of the older two guards, and had worked at the plant for nearly three years by that point. Upon hearing this, Kodaira pulled two members from the team and instructed them to interview Katsuki on his observations, and, if necessary, his alibi."
 japtouchou.15.a: "I'm sure it won't come to that."
 japtouchou.16.t: "Painting with Profit"
 japtouchou.16.d: "A careful analysis of the plant's financial records revealed a distinct dichotomy. The public, outward facing documents painted pictures of organized, systematic production, resulting in efficient and accurate budgets as well as generally accurate and positive growth potential. Indeed, it seemed that the plant had never gone a single quarter without reporting a net profit or some expansion of the plant. This had granted them a steady stream of private investors and seemingly unlimited credit. The internal facing documents, however, were an entirely different colour palette.\n\nThe plant's production methods were, in Kodaira's words, 'a perpetually spinning shitstorm of incompetence'. Every week the plant would receive a seemingly random amount of fish and other supplies, which they seemed to pay a random price for, rather than anything related to the size of the shipment. Those shipsment were taken of the trucks and processed by a completely inconsistent number of workers. A shift could have anywhere from less than ten people assigned to it, up to literally every single floor worker on the payroll. But despite this unintelligible mess of production, the profit projections and growth statistics seemed to always come extremely close to the actual net income.\n\nWhat was equally surprising however, was the sheer amount of money the plant had spent on contractors. And while the total sum of money paid to contractors was rather high, this was spread over only a few instances. Furthermore the details as to who the contractors were and what the contractors actually did were very sparse. More than once the only notes concerning the payments simply read 'contractor fees' with nothing to identify who did what and when. As the investigative team came to recognize this vagueness, they quickly moved to inquire after these contractors, to get a better understanding of the operations of the plant."
 japtouchou.16.a: "Maybe they left a business card."
 japtouchou.17.t: "Caution and Consolidation"
 japtouchou.17.d: "Before long, the team under Kodaira had assembled a folder full of papers about Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha dense enough to stop a small caliber bullet. Official forms, copies of inquiries, building permits, business cards, and even newspaper clippings spilled out the sides, revealing snippets and segments of detail to the world. While each individual piece of information was not strictly informative, the sheer totality of these semantic scraps suggested something in its own right. The conglomerate seemed to stretch so far and wide that a connection between it and the murder could have emerged from a dizzying number of possibilities.\n\nIt had been established in 1951, starting off as a simple shipping company primarily focused on transporting consumer products around the Sphere. But in the following years the company seemed to be graced with a surge of investment, and soon it expanded to encompass the wide range of industries it did today. Half a decade later, the conglomerate was awarded contracts by the Navy and other departments of the Imperial government, which conveniently coincided with Soejima Morihiro's appointment as chairman.\n\nBut something about the scale of the conglomerate nagged at the edges of Kodaira's mind. Unlike all the other colossal brands and corporate entities that straddled the Japanese economy, Minezaka seemed to slink and slide away from the public eye. Where the others proudly stamped their names and logos on every page within reach, every mention and mark related to the organization seemed to be cautiously placed by a hesitant hand. But a conglomerate does not express caution without reason, Kodaira had reasoned, and what other concern does a conglomerate have but profit? If a link was to be found, it would be there."
 japtouchou.17.a: "Ponder their profits."
 japtouchou.18.t: "The Apple and the Tree"
 japtouchou.18.d: "For an ostensibly public figure, Soejima Shinzō at times seemed as distant as the Emperor himself. And though his position on the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly was much lower rank than that, his grasp on his seat was just as firm. He had first come to occupy the predecessor to the prestigious legislative position shortly before the outbreak of the second war against the Chinese, when he was just thirty-six. Previously he had been a partner in a respected corporate law firm, but was swept into politics by the winds of change that had blown through Japan at the start of the century.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years of service, his name had not come to mean much to the general public of Tokyo, but within the halls and office's of the sprawling city his name carried some considerable weight. His reputation stemmed mostly from his performance on the major administration projects the city had undertaken over the years. He had been instrumental in the merger of the Tokyo City bureaucracies into the modern Tokyo Metropolitan Government that the country knew today. He was particularly involved with the design and implementation of the sub-governments of Tokyo's districts, including the maze of tax codes, zoning laws, regulations that accompanied them.\n\nOf course this all stood in stark contrast to his garish and grandiloquent son, Soejima Morihiro. It was a point of debate among the detective whether his attitude towards his only child was indicative of distant approval or silent contempt. They seemed to only appear together at the most important of state ceremonies, otherwise they lived diametrically opposed lives on what sometimes seemed to be entirely different planets. So what then, was this titan of administration's relation to this confused mess of a case? Was it merely circumstantial association by the actions of a fool hardy son, or something more?"
 japtouchou.18.a: "We shall see..."
 japtouchou.19.t: "Competent at Incompetence"
 japtouchou.19.d: "Kodaira scanned the letter Tachi had given him. It was printed on the same stiff and sturdy paper that all high ranking offices of the Empire used, and the seal of the Imperial Japanese Army was stamped in shimmering gold at the top. It did, however, lack any of the precision folds that often crossed their letters, suggesting it had been sent in a large envelope, likely with other files. Tachi, however had only felt the need to bring this one. Kodaira sat close to his desk, carefully studying each word while Tachi stood silently in front of him. Finally, he lowered the paper to his desk and looked up.\n\n"Awfully convenient, don't ya think?" Kodaira said.\n\n"To say the least."\n\n"I mean, here we have a suspect, a confirmed murder mind you, who was actively deployed in the IJA. And under their supervision, he was given a crash course in explosives and then used his newfound skills in an attempt to cover his crime. And that attempt specifically involved the use of a military issue grenade. But despite all that, the Army can't seem to find anything to suggest their inventories are inaccurate or have been tampered with in even the slightest way, and they seem to have no interest in entertaining the possibility that Takahara gained access to restricted military material in another way. It seems to me that either the quality of Army records has dropped substantially since I last checked, or somebody is afraid of self-reflection." Tachi nodded grimly in reply, brow furrowed. Kodaira looked back down at the letter, "And you know, in my experience, letters like these are the paper equivalent of a door being slammed in your face."\n\n"Which is why," Tachi said, swiping the letter from the senior detective's desk, "we are going to have to move fast if we want to get our foot in it.""
 japtouchou.19.a: "Military precision, my ass."
 japtouchou.20.t: "A Burst of Speed"
 japtouchou.20.d: "Initially, the staff of the West Tokyo Behavior Clinic were reluctant to cooperate with the investigation. When the written and telephone messages received no proper reply in return, the team's assistant detective and two officers went to inquire after them personally. Even then, the staff were hesitant to provide any information, even outright questioning the legitimacy of the basis for our request. But, after the proper warrants were shown and some cautionary statements about obstruction of justice were given, they meekly stepped aside.\n\nUnlike the previous medical records, the files obtained from the clinic were mostly useless. Pages of speculation on the 'social origin' of Takahara's affliction alongside notes and results from various psychological and physical tests. In fact, the most critical file was the first one in the folder, which detailed the reason that had brought him to the clinic.\n\nAs the prior police report had hinted, Takahara Ryo had developed a drug addiction. An addiction which for almost the past year had been growing worse day by day, steadily consuming him. But what was most significant, which was eventually noticed by Detective Kodaira, was that Takahara was specifically addicted to amphetamines. Not only were these generally more expensive than most illegal drugs, the notes indicated that he had been taking particularly powerful, long lasting doses. The question was, how could an ostensibly impoverished soldier get addicted to such an expensive drug?\n\nFurthermore it begged the question as to how he was never reported to have any withdrawal symptoms, especially given the evidence to suggest he was an active member of the military. There was no indication that he substituted his usual amphetamines for 'soldier's drugs' like heroin. But surely, the team concluded, if there was more information to be had concerning Takahara's addiction, the Army would have it."
 japtouchou.20.a: "Inquire after the Army medical records."
 japtouchou.21.t: "Four Steps Deeper"
 japtouchou.21.d: "The initial forays into the police archives proved unsuccessful. What few files that could be found related to Takahara Ryo's arrests contained few details and offered little insight. Worse still, none of them made any reference to his brother, Officer Takahara, or gave any evidence to suggest he had directly manipulated the proceedings of Ryo's arrests. With the paper trail beginning to falter, the investigation group under Detective Tachi turned to examine Officer Takahara's case records as a whole.\n\nIn doing so, the team collectively made four key observations. The first was that over the past year, Officer Takahara had responded to five separate calls to the specific fish processing plant where Yoshikage Shinji's body was found. Three times to remove trespassers from the premises, and two times to respond to reports of an attempted break in. On its own, this observation was not so suspicious. However, upon wider scrutiny, the second observation was made. Those five calls were the only calls for police made from the plant throughout the entire year. Still, it was not outside the realm of chance.\n\nThe third observation was a more general, mundane one. Officer Takahara's call record seemed to overwhelmingly consist of responses to suspected petty crime in industrial and seaside commercial zones. For the most part, the reports concerning these calls were extremely sparse. Usually they claimed that either Takahara took a statement and left, or that the situation was resolved without much consequence. The fourth, and final, observation was made by Detective Kodaira while he and Detective Tachi were consolidating their teams' work. The vast majority of the properties that Takahara responded to calls at were owned by one specific conglomerate, the Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha.\n\nThe same conglomerate that owned the fish plant Yoshikage was found in."
 japtouchou.21.a: "There has to be more. Keep digging."
 japtouchou.22.t: "Wearing Thin"
 japtouchou.22.d: "Detective Kodaira's team spent three days trying to reach the night guard, Hajime Katsuki, before their patience ran out. More specifically, it took only two days for Kodaira's patience to run out, but the rest of the team convinced him to wait one more. They had tried repeatedly to get in contact with Katsuki using the information from the plant, but to no avail. In response, two of the team's officers went to the plant in person to enlist the help of management in arranging a meeting with him.\n\nBut when they arrived, they found that none of the managers were present. According to the receptionist, the on duty manager had stepped out for a meeting and had left the lower level supervisors collectively in charge. Not wanting to return to Kodaira empty, the officers asked to speak with a supervisor, intending to find when Katsuki's next shift was. But when they asked the supervisor, all they received was a puzzled look. Katsuki, according to him, was never going to have another shift, and he hadn't had one since over nine months ago, when he was fired.\n\nThe officers then elected to wait until the head manager returned, and when he did, they proceeded to push him against a wall and demanded to know 'exactly what kind of bullshit operation he was running'. But despite their heavy-handed approach, all the manager could stammer out were claims that it was the result of a paperwork error and an accident. He did, however, confirm that because of that error, the plant must have been unguarded on the night Takahara dumped the body.\n\nUpon hearing the officers' report, Kodaira ordered the team to find the most recent public files containing Katsuki's residence and to bring him in for questioning. He also emphasized that, given the delay and the convenient incompetence of the plant's management, he was not in the mood for non-cooperation and Katsuki could either 'open his door voluntarily on the spot, or wait a few hours for an Emergency Service Unit to kick it in.'"
 japtouchou.22.a: "I really hope it doesn't come to that."
 japtouchou.23.t: "Drops of Details"
 japtouchou.23.d: "It quickly became apparent to the investigative team that something was amiss about the contractors the plant had hired. Detective Kodaira and a small cohort of subordinates had gone to the plant in person under the general pretext of 'clarifying the context of some internal reports'. But this only lasted up until the door of the plant's meeting room swung closed, at which point Kodaira proceed to drill the panel of managers before him on the nature of the contractors and their shoddy filekeeping. But in the first moments of the detective's verbal assault, the looks on the managers' faces were not ones of fear or concern, but confusion. But these expressions did not remain long, and they quickly fired back with a series of stern statements.\n\nHowever, they could scarcely provide any more detail than was contained in the records themselves. They could provide only the vaguest sense as to what tasks they had performed, machine maintenance, employee evaluation, electrical repair, and so on, but they had little information concerning the particulars of the contractors themselves. Furthermore they could offer little to no details concerning the payment of said contractors, regardless of who they actually were. Per the testimony of the managers, the contractors were paid either in cash or by money order, with apparently little record preserved on their end. When pressed further, they became indignant, proclaiming that it was not their responsibility to maintain the financial records of contractors and their financial services.\n\nAt that point, Kodaira abruptly thanked them for their time and marched out of the plant, his posse following behind him. Outside he declared that they had 'wrung all they could from those sponges' and that it was time to move on. From a dented and worn payphone a few blocks from the plant, Kodaira instructed his team to turn their attention to finding the elusive contractors themselves."
 japtouchou.23.a: "And make sure to check their hourly rate too."
 japtouchou.24.t: "Profit Margin of Error"
 japtouchou.24.d: "While the Minezaka conglomerate was certainly a shy and reserved creature compared to the roaring beasts of the Zaibatsu, it seemed that even they were inclined to display their financial success to their potential partners. Minezaka rested comfortably in the grey area between privately owned and publicly traded. The corporate leadership and industrial management positions were strictly controlled by the board overseen by Soejima Morihiro, who clearly maintained a highly curated list of potential appointees. But the financial aspect and investor pool seemed to be much more porous. According to a number of financial consultants, the Minezaka firm would allow investment from anyone with enough capital and reputation in exchange for dividends. This gave the conglomerate a reputation of stability and made it a fairly popular investment among members of Japan's political elite.\n\nBut the reputation the conglomerate had cultivated clashed with reality in a surprising way, it seemed to undersell the group's actual successes. Since its founding, not a single financial quarter had passed without Minezaka reporting positive growth. But the growth itself was jagged and irregular, punctuated by sudden, rapid bursts of industrial expansion followed by massive jumps in reported profit. Likewise, the conglomerate had never once delayed or reduced the dividends paid to its shareholders, in fact they seemed to increase fairly regularly.\n\nBut this source of shareholder glee also promoted suspicion on the part of the investigation. The expansions were unprecedented, there was hardly ever any suggestion or talk of preparations beforehand. Furthermore the expansions did not seem to correlate with increases in investment. On more than one occasion an already active expansion effort received an expansion of its own, all without any indication of further investment. It was obvious that Minezaka's pockets were deeper than even their most exuberant financial reports would let on, it was just a matter of what those pockets were actually filled with."
 japtouchou.24.a: "Probably just aggressive rounding."
 japtouchou.25.t: "In the Shade of the Tree"
 japtouchou.25.d: "As it would turn out, even if you removed his son from the picture entirely, Soejima Shinzō had some latent connections to the Minezaka conglomerate. The first points of contact came through the old law firm he had been a partner of. In the spring of 1953 the firm came into contact with what was then the Minezaka Commercial Transport Corporation. They had been contracted to help set up and register the proposed Minezaka financial investment firm, the organization's first step towards its modern structure.\n\nThe investigation's efforts to locate and contact said firm revealed the second point of contact. A little over two years after closing the contract for setting up the financial firm, the rapidly expanding Minezaka conglomerate bought the firm outright, turning it into their own in-house legal team. Now had Minezaka bought out Soejima's stake in the law firm rather than grant him direct partial ownership, officially severing any direct tie between them. But the following years contained some trends that raised a few eyebrows when closely examined. The period between mid 1955 and early 1960 saw an explosion of growth within the newly christened conglomerate, rocking upwards through the ranks of Japanese finance.\n\nBut the size of the growth was not strictly the cause of suspicion, rather it was the speed. To open so many varied properties across so many wards would have required a nearly literal mountain paperwork to be processed by all the various divisions and subdivisions that Soejima had so meticulously designed. Yet given the rate at which properties were bought and registered, the approvals must have been sent out almost as soon as the requests came in. Furthermore the modern conglomerate's most prized contracts, those of the Imperial Government and Military, only materialized in late 1960, a few months after Minezaka quietly announced Soejima Morihiro as their new chairman. Perhaps Soejima Shinzō's association was merely coincidental, but it was an association none the less."
 japtouchou.25.a: "Coincidence? I think not."
 japtouchou.26.t: "See No Evil"
 japtouchou.26.d: "Tachi slapped the envelope onto Kodaira's desk. "Nothing," he said, exasperated. "Over a week of constant inquiries and form requests and it all amounts to absolutely nothing." On the other side of the desk, Kodaira was leaning back in his chair, a steadily cooling mug of coffee in his right hand, the last streams of vapor escaping from the ceramic rim. He made no move to pick up the envelope, but rather waited until his younger colleague voiced his frustrations, and then spoke himself.\n\n"The Army isn't known for being quick to share," he said.\n\nTachi shook his head. "This can't just be a matter of refusal to share. In fact, I'm sure if they had the ability to, they would happily blame Takahara's actions on drugs so they could get us to stay away. No, according to them, they have no record, medical or otherwise, to suggest that he suffered from any affliction at all, let alone amphetamine addiction." Tachi shook his head. "It just can't be the case. It would require such an extreme level of negligence to overlook a heavily withdrawn private that there's almost no way it could be unintentional. It's either that or..."\n\n"Or Takahara had access to a steady supply of rare, expensive drugs while deployed on a military base," Kodaira interjected. "Which would also require a pretty damn big crack in security to be possible."\n\n"Yeah, exactly," replied Tachi. "So which is it?"\n\nKodaira rose from his seat, drained the last of his coffee, and firmly set the mug on top of the envelope on his desk. "I'm not sure," he said. "But I know what comes next.""
 japtouchou.26.a: "Military precision, my ass."
 japtouchou.27.t: "The Link"
 japtouchou.27.d: "Since the onset of the investigation, the two internal teams had struggled solitarily. They pursued independent goals and filed independent reports, and only really saw each other in the dimly lit hallways and elevators of the central building of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The only proper contact was reserved for the two detectives who commanded their respective teams. But even they grew weary of the increasingly deviating leads, and began furiously search for any connection, no matter how small, that could provide them with the break they so desperately needed. Finally, they found it.\n\nThe link had not really been hidden, buried away beneath or within paperwork as the previous leads had, but it was not quite in the open either. It was a simple but all too common situation, in order to find it, you already had to know what it was, even if you don't realize it. And when they finally did, all the leads the investigation had been following began to slowly, but surely, turn back towards the link. Any other time, it was just another shooting, just another crime, and just another cop, but not this time.\n\nSeven months ago, outside a bar in the western side of Tokyo, a man by the name of Hajime Katsuki was shot dead by a police officer. Katsuki was formerly a night guard at the fish plant where Yoshikage's body was found, and he had been fired two months prior due to 'poor performance and disposition'. The officer that shot him was Keizo Takahara, the brother and co-conspirator of the murderer, Takahara Ryo. Officer Takahara also had responded to a call two months prior at the plant to remove Katsuki from the property when he protested his firing. These were the facts that could be firmly established by the investigation. However the claims that Katsuki produced the knife and attacked first, or that he had held serious grievances with the conduct of the plant, were yet to be confirmed."
 japtouchou.27.a: "Circles within circles..."
 japtouchou.28.t: "Frustrations, Forklifts, and Finances"
 japtouchou.28.d: "The hope had been that delving into the details of the contractors hired by the plant would provide some insight into the operations of the plant and their incomprehensible record keeping. Kodaira had been particularly adamant about this point, claiming that the lackluster file keeping and business with the contractors 'visibly reeked with suspicion'. But every effort to pull the nature of the contractors into the clear light of day sent the team tumbling further and further into the fog of confusion.\n\nThe meager list of business names and contact details obtained from the plant and its staff was hardly more useful than if the detective had simply made up the names themselves. In total they only managed to make real contact with two of their intended targets. One was a freelance electrical technician, who could scarcely remember the plant at all, let alone any noteworthy details regarding its operation. The other was a machine shop specializing in hydraulics repair, who had been brought in to repair the plant's forklifts, and their neatly kept records and careful testimonies failed to reveal anything unusual.\n\nIn all other respects, the pursuit of the contractors amounted to nothing more than frustrations. Most could not be identified, much less traced to a specific location. The few that could be traced were either shuttered and dark or vague and unhelpful. Finally, only one potential source of information remained, the details surrounding the contract payments. Those that had been paid by money order could be tracked to a certain extent, but those who had been paid in cash required a more thorough approach. Warrants would need to be acquired not only for access to individual bank account records, but to the net transactional histories of the banks themselves. Once again, the investigation was pulled from the allure of the street work back into the cold embrace of Imperial bureaucracy."

 japtouchou.29.d: "Putting specific numbers to the profits of the Minezaka conglomerate was no easy feat. Despite the reckless and youthful imagine of the organization's chairman, the inner workings of the monolith were obviously constructed by the hands of skilled and experienced bureaucrats. The network linking the various trusts, firms, and factories was a meticulously built labyrinth of filing rules, tax codes, and special exemptions.\n\nEach subdivision of the conglomerate was addressed individually for the purposes of tax and account records, and usually this entailed contacting a different department of the tax agency each time. If a subdivision contained assets across multiple wards, requests had to be filed individually to each ward's tax division. Adding to this headache, the Bank of Japan refused to permit allow for general access to accounts related to the conglomerate for 'reasons pertaining to security', demanding individual requests for individual accounts.\n\nThe result was an endless process of acquiring and evaluating partial information. The detectives would receive snapshots and glimpses of money flowing through the channels and canals of the conglomerate, only to be lost again behind another stack of paper. Tax records would make reference to accounts the investigation lacked access to, which in turn was responsible for tax payments from an entirely different tax office. If there was any logic or reasons to the financial manipulations of Minezaka, it was buried beneath forests of paper and oceans of ink."
 japtouchou.29.a: "Step by step."
 japtouchou.30.t: "Fixation"
 japtouchou.30.d: "Kodaira's team had continued to compile information regarding Soejima Shinzō at the insistence of the detective himself. Ever since the details about Soejima's relationship with the Minezaka conglomerate had begun to come to light, he had fixated all his attention on the reserved councilman. In his view, the case was reducible to three points, the councilman, his son, and the plant owned by the conglomerate. Their job, according to Kodaira, was to draw the lines between them and find where they all intersect. So the team pored through the files they had collected, highlighting every overlap and relationship where they could be found, and speculating about their existence where they could not. Nothing taken for granted, nothing left to chance.\n\nAs it would happen, Kodaira's analysis was off by one point, placed dead in the center of the other three. One of the officers had been examining Councilman Soejima's recent political projects, when he found one detailing a recent restructuring effort in Tokyo's central tax office. He nearly passed over the document entirely, but suddenly a name appeared amidst the blocks of text, Yoshikage Shinji, the victim himself.\n\nHe had been chosen for a position in the Tokyo tax office department responsible for analysing and proposing changes to the city's tax code. His appointment came as a result of his years of prior service in the local tax offices and audit departments of various ward governments. There was no evidence to suggest Soejima had selected Yoshikage personally, but it was still his signature at the bottom of the page. That was enough for Kodaira to rally his team around his selected strategy and pursue it with renewed vigor."
 japtouchou.30.a: "I knew it!"
 japtouchou.31.t: "An Army with a Secret"
 japtouchou.31.d: "Detective Kodaira and Detective Tachi stood just beyond the edge of the chief detective's desk. On the other side of the polished plateau, the chief sat preeing at the report Kodaira had handed him shortly after they walked in the room. His wire frame glasses sat low on his nose as he carefully examined the work of his subordinates line by line. The office was still, the silence only interrupted by the occasional rustling of paper as the chief turned the page. Finally, the chief detective brought his gaze from the papers on his desk and up to meet the eyes of the two men before him.\n\n"You're certain?" he asked. Tachi opened his mouth to reply but Kodaira beat him to it.\n\n"Absolutely, sir," he said, firmly. "The evidence we have compiled based on the profile of Takahara simply cannot be dismissed as circumstantial. Every indication suggests that Takahara's motivations were either facilitated by some personnel from the Army, or made feasible by some failure within its systems. Regardless, the generally poor cooperation show by the IRA-GS, combined with the almost pathologically insufficient maintenance of records, should provide more than enough grounds to justify a re-orientation of the investigation towards military administration." As he finished, the chief flicked his hard gaze over towards Tachi.\n\n"And you?" the chief said.\n\n"Couldn't have said it better myself, sir," Tachi replied quickly.\n\n"Well then," said the chief, sliding the report back into its folder, "get to it.""
 japtouchou.31.a: "The investigation turns to the Army."
 japtouchou.32.t: "The Personal Connection"
 japtouchou.32.d: "Kodaira and Tachi again found themselves under the awning at the front of the police station. This time, the smoke from their cigarettes flowed upwards past the awning until it disappeared into the gloom of the night sky. A small archipelago of crushed cigarette butts sat on the ground before Kodaira, while only a single one lay next to Tachi's shoes, a tiny burst of yellow amidst the dark pavement. But a stillness hovered between them, punctuated by the occasional soft sigh of an inhale and the crackling of burning tobacco. To the unfamiliar eye, they appeared to be strangers, joined together only by the circumstances of habit.\n\n"You know, some small part of me had hoped we would never get here," said Tachi, solemnly. Kodaira was silent in reply. "I mean, nobody wants to dig through the department for this case, it's almost like rooting through your own laundry looking for evidence," Tachi continued. "Everyone loves a conspiracy until one lands right in your lap."\n\nIn one motion Kodaira dropped the end of his current cigarette and reached into his coat pocket to pull out the rest of the box. While his partner struck his lighter and brought it up to his face, Tachi continued. "It's just that, following a case is one thing, it's like walking along a path where you need to keep any eye out for the right sign posts. But this, this is like leaning over a pit that you can't see the bottom of." He started off towards the night sky, "Just why did it have to be us?"\n\n"The fact that it happened to us is pure chance," said Kodaira, releasing a cloud of smoke, "But the fact that it happened at all isn't. Truth be told, I think this has been a long time coming.""
 japtouchou.32.a: "Well it's here now."
 japtouchou.33.t: "Follow the Money"
 japtouchou.33.d: "Kodaira and Tachi sat on opposite sides of an unclaimed desk, each with an avenue of spreadsheets and forms laid out before them, lined with stacks of folders and binders. At times they were strictly parallel and at other they cross, intersected, or overlapped. Sometimes they led right up to the edge of an accompanying critical folder, and other times they trailed off to dead ends. Every now and again the crisp black and white surfaces were adorned with the sharp blue ink that comprised Tachi's neatly drawn characters or tagged with the rough graphite that formed Kodaira's hasty scribbles.\n\nIf one followed the two men on their visual strolls along the paper routes, they would be met with an incomprehensible mass of digits. They were arranged into integers, fractions, and decimals, sometimes joined by text and other times left to speak for themselves. They were presented in lists, squared into tables, and stamped beneath all sorts of graphs, charts, and diagrams. At certain points they seemed to converge, following a steady tread or a smooth curve, only then to violently diverge again, scattering data points across the pages like stars in the night sky. Rather than a concrete, logical narrative, the numbers spelled out schizophrenic rantings and ravings of new directions and failed ventures, of unspeakable highs and unthinkable lows. It spun on and on, circles within circles, tangents leading to tangents, all the while drawing closer and closer towards the orbit of an inescapably dense point of confusion and misdirection, until finally...\n\nKodaira tossed his pencil across the surface of the desk. "Okay, fuck this," he said as Tachi looked up at him. "Time for a new plan.""
 japtouchou.33.a: "Good, this was getting old."
 japtouchou.34.t: "The Political Direction"
 japtouchou.34.d: "Tachi frowned at the display of highlighted and annotated papers, handwritten notes, and scattered notes assembled on the desk before him. He had carefully listened while Kodaira weaved together the narrative he claimed was contained within the formidable mass of text. Through his whole presentation he had gestured to particularly significant fragments of information, sometimes placing a finger by the key characters and other times handing an entire page to Tachi for closer inspection. He had carefully balanced each piece of information on top of another, supported assumptions with pillars of facts, and bridged logical chasms with carefully constructed hypotheses. Finally, upon reaching the crux of the argument, he had turned to gauge the reaction of his fellow detective.\n\n"I see what you are pointing out," said Tachi, carefully weighing each word. "But doesn't it all just seem a bit loose?" Kodaira shook his head in reply.\n\n"That's just it," he said, "This kind of case is designed to be loose. In order to crack this thing open, we can't just assume everything will line up one-to-one, we have to figure out they start to overlap. That's the point of what we're doing, the parallel approach. It all starts out straight and separate, but eventually it all turns back towards each other. Between what you've been doing and what I've been doing, this is the only point at which its really started to turn in a way that gives us a real direction. Can we really afford to let slip away?"\n\nTachi frowned again."
 japtouchou.34.a: ""I guess not, no.""
 japtouchou.35.t: "Squaring Up"
 japtouchou.35.d: "The investigation as a whole had grown thoroughly tired of their mostly one-sided conversations with the Army. The process of contacting the correct office, requesting the correct form, and gleaning a reply had more in common with pulling teeth than pulling records. Given most of the division were trained in deskwork and not dentistry, their collective patience for the process evaporated quickly. As a result, the two lead detectives, Kodaira and Tachi, conspired with the chief to come up with a strategy to break the bureaucratic gridlock.\n\nTachi proposed a direct route. He maintained that the Army could not waver or slink away from such serious administrative failings if they were brought out into the light. Escalating the issue to the higher echelons of Army command would force a response out of necessity, they would tolerate such conduct even less than the investigation could. What they needed to demand, Tachi maintained, was accountability.\n\nKodaria, on the other hand, pushed for an indirect, roundabout approach. He argued that they would never get what they needed from the Army by operating under the impression that they were on even ground, because they clearly were not. Instead they should go around the Army, in a sense. Direct the correct agency or organization towards the existing evidence of mismanagement, and the secrets would come spilling out of their own accord. As each made their case, the chief deliberated over the two positions carefully, before halting the debate with his decision."
 japtouchou.35.a: "Hold them accountable."
 japtouchou.35.b: "Go behind their backs."
 japtouchou.36.t: "Self-Reflection"
 japtouchou.36.d: "Nobody involved with the investigation could deny that the presence of Officer Takahara as a participant in the case had a noticeable effect on the staff at large. This was obvious from the demeanor of the officers and the precautions they took, but what was even more telling was what they did not say. None had dared to explicitly, publically suggest that some element of the Police Force itself was involved with the Takahara's crime in some way, as if doing so would send the investigation spiraling to its doom. So prevalent was this attitude that even when Tachi and Kodaira broke this trend, they did so behind firmly closed doors.\n\nIn their view, the overlap revealed by the combination of their efforts was too significant to simply dismiss as chance. Even if the department had not directly aided in carrying out the murder, they almost certainly had facilitated it in some way. What had to be determined was who could have aided Takahara, and why they did so. Presumably it was possible that the help was given unintentionally, but it was just as likely that it was given opportunistically or, even worse, by the willful manipulations of an associated party. The issue that remained was deciding on the best means to investigate this, while keeping their suspicions hidden.\n\nTo that end, Tachi had proposed attempting to identify co-conspirators by reviewing the officers and staff that had worked with Officer Takahara during the relevant timeframes. Any inconsistencies could be easily revealed by comparing the various statements. Kodaria sympathized with that strategy, but also proposed an alternate method he believed to be more subtle. Finding and following the movement of the Takahara's payment from its source to its destination could reveal more subtle acts of collaboration, maybe even at the higher levels of the Police."
 japtouchou.36.a: "The Co-conspirators."
 japtouchou.36.b: "The Kickback."
 japtouchou.37.t: "The Gilded Guardians"
 japtouchou.37.d: "Two things had become clear to the investigation as they fought their way through the confused finances of the plant and the Minezaka conglomerate that towered over it. First, regardless if the plant and its owners were directly involved with the murder, the internal accounts and monetary reports were far too inconsistent to be dismissed as incidental. Second, those inconsistencies were so prevalent that it was nearly inconceivable that these files had made their way through the major public financial institutions and regulatory bodies legitimately. In order to get a full, clear picture of the incomprehensible network of capital that surrounded the case, the investigation's two lead detective concluded that they would need to get a bird's eye view.\n\nThere were two good places to start, each presiding over a different aspect of domestic Japanese finance and a cornerstone of Imperial bureaucracy. One was the Bank of Japan and the regulatory bodies that surrounded it. The Bank was a central organ in all sectors of the economy, acting as both the reservoirs and canals for the torrents of money that flowed through Japan and her allies. The Minezaka conglomerate and the subordinate plant were no exception, as they had a great number of associated accounts with the Bank. Full access to their records would allow for a more complete understanding of the profits and expenses over a long period, rather than at just single moments in time.\n\nThe other option was the ever-feared and universally loathed Tokyo Tax Bureau. Even among the various attack dogs of the Ministry of Finance, they were known to be particularly vicious. It was difficult to imagine that bureaucrats of such legendary ferocity would allow such flargent mismanagement to go unnoticed without some form of illegal persuasion or heavy handed manipulation. Either way, someone had to be held accountable."
 japtouchou.37.a: "Follow the cash flow."
 japtouchou.37.b: "Tour the Tax Bureau."
 japtouchou.38.t: "The Death of a Taxman"
 japtouchou.38.d: "According to the testimonies and employee reviews provided by the managers of the Tokyo Tax Bureau, Yoshikage Shinji had been the type of accountant that every office dreamed of having. He was ceaselessly diligent and personally invested in the outcome of his projects. A member of that rare breed who sees the analysis and manipulations of numbers and values as an art form in its own right. It was little wonder then, that he had been assigned such a critical position in the project to restructure the city's tax codes.\n\nThough his post was of central importance, he had been regarded as a loner. Most days he arrived early in the morning before everyone else in the department had arrived and remained in his office until well after most had left. The only real interactions people could recall were hurried, but polite greetings in hallways, and the endless series of requests for additional documents he made to the lower level staff.\n\nThere was no indication that this degree of isolation was the result of some grievance he held against his peers or vice versa. But even so, there seemed to be a strangely large distance between him and the general office systems. Hardly anyone could give a more detailed description of his actual day to day work beyond 'statistical analysis' and vague references to the overall goals of the project. This was even the case among the other tax code restructuring project members and supervisors, implying that nobody had yet picked up where Yoshikage had left off. The investigation was faced with an important consideration, was this separate due to some property of the wider Tax Bureau, or was it something about the victim's work itself?"
 japtouchou.38.a: "Tour the Tax Bureau"
 japtouchou.38.b: "Vet the Victim's Work"
 japtouchou.39.t: "Throwing the Gauntlet"
 japtouchou.39.d: "Tachi, emboldened by the chief's endorsement of his strategy, oversaw the subsequent correspondence personally. His chosen target and recipient of the investigation's ire was the Administration Bureau of the Army Ministry, the Imperial Army's source of representation in the Imperial Cabinet. Every request and form was subject to his scrutiny before being sent, and every official letter and written communication was born at least in part from his pen.\n\nThrough his efforts, Tachi wove an accuestory narrative aimed directly at the Ministry and their underlings. He alleged that the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office had allowed a culture of inadequate record handling to take root. Not only in the departments with which the case was explicitly concerned, but the Office's general correspondence with outside parties as a whole. He warned that not only was this a strong indictment of the General Staff's conduct, but it also reflect poorly on them as well, as they were charged with the administrative aspects of Army's function. Failure to act on or resolve this matter, would only worsen that reflection.\n\nFor their part, the Ministry did seems to take almost immediate notice of Tachi's handiwork. Just days after the first wave of correspondence, a sealed envelope addressed from the Army Ministry Tokyo Headquarters arrived at the station. Inside was a neatly typed and folded letter addressed to the Chief of the department. They graciously thanked the investigation for bringing the issue to their attention and assured them they would investigate the situation with 'utmost haste'."
 japtouchou.39.a: "I'll believe it when I see it."
 japtouchou.40.t: "Board to Death"
 japtouchou.40.d: "Kodaira's strategy required a good deal of planning and careful consideration before it could be set in motion. The goal was to locate and coordinate with an organization that was legally and functionally separate from the Army bureaucracy, but still carried enough authority to force it into compliance. This proved to be difficult due to strength of the Army's representation in the Imperial Government. Their political presence was commanded by the Army Ministry, which represented them on the Imperial Cabinet, while their operations and conduct were governed by the IJA General Staff Office. There was only one office, according to Kodaira, that could possibly face this challenge and have even a minuscule chance of success, the Imperial Board of Audit.\n\nThe Board existed in a strange space within Japanese administration. Ostensibly independent of both the National Diet and various Ministries of state, the Imperial Auditors were directly subordinate to only the Emperor himself. On paper, this portrayed the Board as being above all in a certain sense, a manifestation of the divine will of the Emperor, endowed with the responsibility to ensure the loyalty of offices of the Empire. In practice however, the Emperor had little interest in managing the glorified accountants, and so the Board had fallen under the de-facto collective authority of the Cabinet.\n\nThis had left the Board in a sorry state, perpetually ignored or forgotten save for the occasional politicized busywork. So the investigation's plea for assistance was received as a welcome change of pace. Indeed, even though they were only provided only the vaguest details of why the help was needed and what the objective was, the Board's representatives were eager to carry out their original charge, doubly so when they learned the objects of scrutiny were within the Cabinet itself."
 japtouchou.40.a: "All for the good of the Empire, of course."
 japtouchou.41.t: "Impressions of a Stranger"
 japtouchou.41.d: "Over the course of the next few days, the investigation combed through the department's scheduling records to find the officers who had worked closest with Officer Takahara over the past year. The focused primarily one other street officers, but also expanded their search to include supervisors, detectives, and dispatchers who had worked alongside him. Once assembled, the team slowly worked their way down the list, conducting interviews and collecting statements regarding Takahara's conduct and their impressions of him.\n\nMost gave the same rough characterization of him regardless of their respective relationship relationship. He was seen as reserved, but not reclusive or lonesome. He was perfectly capable of, and willing to partake in casual conversation, and was mostly polite and slow the outright anger. Those who had worked with him directly described a diligent, but not fanatical, worker, who carried out his tasks with the unconscious efficiency of routine. Those who were slightly more removed hardly had any perceptions of him at all, positive or negative, he was simply another rank-and-file officer.\n\nBut there was one dispatcher who did not know him at all. This would have been unremarkable, had the dispatcher not been the one who was recorded to have sent Takahara to the bar where he shot the plant's nightguard. Not only that, he claimed to have no memory of such an event at all, vehemently denying that he remembered any details of the case or filing the incident report. Kodaria took this as suspicious, but Tachi was unsure, a flat denial seemed an odd move for a conspirator. Could it be possible that the incident reports were wrong?"
 japtouchou.41.a: "Perhaps the archives are incomplete?"
 japtouchou.42.t: "Liquid Motivation"
 japtouchou.42.d: "It was undeniable that Officer Takahara had undertaken a great personal risk with his decision to aid his brother in the aftermath of the crime. If he was truly involved in some wider plot, there must have been a near infinite number of occasions when one of his peers or supervisors could have uncovered his complicancy. With such tremendous consequences an ever present threat, what was he getting in exchange? The detectives found it unlikely that he acted out of anything resembling brotherly love, given his apparent pattern of indifference towards his sibling's well-being. Instead they looked to the universal motivator, the all powerful Yen.\n\nPawing their way through the personal files of the treacherous officer and the records held by the salary department, the team compiled a rough financial profile for Takahara. Using the records of the paychecks issued by the Police, they calculated his estimated net worth after accounting for taxes and tracked the checks to the Bank of Japan account where they were cashed. While they submitted the warrants for the account files to the Bank, members of the unit searched through Takahara's locker and personal effects, looking for signs of superfluous wealth. But they could find nothing more than the standard equipment and personal items one could expect of a Tokyo police officer. If the officer had indeed been receiving consistent payments for his nefarious actions, he kept such evidence hidden away, like the memories of a shameful deed.\n\nOld money whispers, New money shouts."
 japtouchou.42.a: "And blood money is silent."
 japtouchou.43.t: "On the Banks of the Canal"
 japtouchou.43.d: "Much to the relief of the investigation, the employees of the Bank of Japan seemed more than happy to aid them in pursuit of the elusive Minezaka assets. They were courteous, attentive, and prompt in their actions and replies. Whether this behavior was due to a sense of duty or a fear of reprisal was irrelevant, the detective and desk workers of the investigation we just glad to have a break from the constant bureaucratic battles of the past few weeks.\n\nUnfortunately however, the new perspective provided by the Bank's files was not as clear as the detectives had hoped. The plant, along with most of its siblings beneath the Minezaka parent organization, worked heavily with cash. Constant money orders and long lists of liquid deposits and withdrawals filled folder after folder. Some were easily traceable, sent to other Bank of Japan accounts or otherwise given some description. Others were more difficult, with seemingly arbitrary amounts of money being withdrawn or deposited at random times. Due to the length of the records, the investigation was forced to focus their attention on the timeframe surrounding the murder, and slowly work their way outward.\n\nWithin that range, the team found one particularly suspect transaction. A little over a week before the body was found, 5000 Yen were withdrawn from one of the central industrial reserve accounts owned by the conglomerate. Beyond being much smaller than the rest of the withdrawals, there was absolutely no contextual information alongside it. No intended recipient, no specified denomination, no explanatory notes, and no issued receipt. Without any identifying information, the investigation was forced to turn to the tedious process of track the serial numbers of the issued notes to try and locate their destination."
 japtouchou.43.a: "This is gonna take a while..."
 japtouchou.44.t: "Turnover and Over"
 japtouchou.44.d: "Though the filing and payment of taxes was regarded by many as one of the few constants in life, the office that oversaw those processes for so many in Japan seemed to be in a perpetual state of turmoil. The investigation's first step in the review of the Tokyo Tax Bureau was to collect the names of the those who occupied the various posts in the upper levels of the organization's hierarchy, in order to be prepared for when the detectives would inevitably have to reach out to them. But it quickly became clear that based on the previous few years, that information could change at any time.\n\nThe staff files and public statements put out by the Bureau showed their leaderships to be in a constant state of flux. Managers who had only held their post for a few months were dismissed and replaced with little reason or fanfare. Staff working in one division would be suddenly transfer to another completely unrelated division. Sometimes supervisors from the local ward offices would be brought up to the central office, only to be pushed back down again some time later. Even the department heads of the Bureau were not safe from the perpetual reshuffling. At any time they could be demoted, transferred, or replaced by a handpicked candidate by the Metropolitan Government.\n\nIt was not apparent to the investigation as to why the Bureau functioned in this manner, and indeed many questioned how the office could function at all in this state. There were no reports of serious grievances or systemic troubles, so why then was there such high turnover? And how could such a critical institution continue to operate while being constantly interrupted?"
 japtouchou.44.a: "So much for job security."
 japtouchou.45.t: "Postponed Proposals"
 japtouchou.45.d: "With the help of some report summaries provided by the managers at the Tokyo Tax Bureau, the investigation was able to gain a bit more insight into the actual work that Yoshikage had been doing before he was murdered. While the project as a whole had been focused on the structure of layout of the tax code as a whole, Yoshikage had been focused specifically on the industrial-commercial side. Within that realm, he seemed to have be focused on two particular aspects.\n\nThe first was an effort to improve the accuracy of tax payment estimations for industrial production facilities in order to cut down on the number of over- and underpayments that had to be corrected after the fact. This had involved leafing through the records of the largest industrial producers, as well as examining current production and profit rates from cooperating companies, in order to develop a more accurate estimation system. Beyond this, he had begun to develop a proposal for a system of quarterly reviews for the largest industrial companies to improve market estimations, but it seemed that little progress was made before his death.\n\nThe second effort was an attempt to streamline and integrate the auditing and tax review processes between the ward offices and central office. From the reports, Yoshikage had begun to develop a radical new system whereby the individual offices would have their authority more closely tied to that of the central office with a more consistent information stream. Furthermore it would eliminate the ward responsibilities for some zoned areas entirely, placing them directly under the central Bureau instead. However it seemed that even less progress had been made on this proposal, with Yoshikage himself noting that progress had been delayed by the performance of the Tax Bureau's Audit Division."
 japtouchou.45.a: "Analyze the auditors."
 japtouchou.45.b: "We need more specifics."
 japtouchou.46.t: "Rebut of the Joke"
 japtouchou.46.d: "Unsurprisingly, waiting for a response from the Army Ministry devolved into an endless stream of unreturned calls, deflected questions, and deafening silence. However just as Tachi's ceaseless, agitated pacing began to wear a trench into the floor of the station, a response came. It arrived in the same manner that the first had, sealed envelope, neatly folded pages, and sharp ink characters. But the message this one contained was very different from the agreeable tone of the first. So much so that Kodaira characterized it as 'the nicest possible way to tell someone to fuck off and die'.\n\nThe Ministry's reply, after forcing its way through the obligatory pleasantries, first took the opportunity to clear themselves of any wrongdoing and write off any suggestions otherwise as hearsay. They maintained that the administrative mishaps the investigation had experienced were side effects of previous logistical restructurings and changes in responsibility between the Ministry and General Staff Office. These processes had resulting in some 'known insufficiencies' in the records system which had already been identified and accounted for. As for the frustrating rate of turnaround displayed by the various Army offices, the Ministry thoroughly expressed the importance of redundancy for the sake of security, and that such performance fell well within acceptable standards.\n\nNaturally the Ministry's calm rebuttal sent the investigative team into a frenzy of activity. The lead detectives had no intention of taking the Ministry at their word and resolved to take further action. It was clear that looking the Army Ministry in the face was not a viable option, but where to turn to next? Back down to the General Staff, or even higher up?"
 japtouchou.46.a: "Under their noses."
 japtouchou.46.b: "Over their heads."
 japtouchou.47.t: "Piety and Poison"
 japtouchou.47.d: "Unfortunately, not everyone was so excited to see the Board of Audit's functional role restored. In order to avoid alerting any potential conspirators or implicating the investigation, the Board had resolved to act alone publically while coordinating and corresponding privately with the investigation. Even though their position within the Imperial hierarchy was a point of unrecognized contention, they maintained that their role was fundamentally proactive, They were not intended to simply wait around until whispers of corruption reached the ears of the Emperor himself, they claimed. Rather, any time an issue or inconsistency within the government was brought before them, they were bound by duty and honor to see it resolved.\n\nHowever the various members and Ministries that comprised the Cabinet were unmoved by the Board's lofty claims. It was the Cabinet's view that while the Board was independent of every individual Ministry, they were not independent of all the Ministries taken together. If they allowed for unprompted audits with undisclosed motives and orders, they risked allowing 'the poison of factionalism' back into the Imperial government. How could the Cabinet be sure the audit was not intended to meet some opportunistic political goal? All the Ministries of the Cabinet said some form of this argument, save for the Army Ministry, who essentially screamed it when they found out their files in particular were in question.\n\nSeeing this, the joint Board-investigation team took stock and tried to formulate a new approach. They found that there were two possible directions. Either they could try to avoid the Cabinet entirely by reaching out to the highest possible levels of Japanese administration, or they could appeal to the division that represented the Police in the turmoil of Imperial politics, the Bureau of Public Order."
 japtouchou.47.a: "Over their heads."
 japtouchou.47.b: "Bring in the Bureau."
 japtouchou.48.t: "Running Upwards"
 japtouchou.48.d: "With the dispatcher's shocking denial of involvement, the investigation turned towards the records division to try and corroborate or disprove his claims. Based on the available files and testimonies of other dispatchers and supervisors, the dispatcher was on duty during the time period when the shooting occured. As for the event itself, most claimed to have some general knowledge or awareness of it, but few could recall any specific details or observations from the day. Notably however, none could remember any instance of the dispatcher making reference to the event either.\n\nGrowing increasingly worried, the lead detectives confront the head of the records division, hoping to gather some information concerning the related files themselves. But the department head was just as mystified as the rest of his staff, if not more. He was barely able to say anything about the shooting at all and provided virtually no details concerning the creation and storage of the files. At first the detectives grew annoyed and suspicious, but when they pressed him on the integrity of the files and the potential for unauthorized modification, the reason for his demeanor became clear.\n\nThe department head had occupied his position for less than six months in total. His predecessor was an aging veteran of the Tokyo Police, who had held the post for the better part of the prior decade. But just a month after the shooting, he unexpectedly resigned, leaving the department scrambling to find a replacement. His reason for doing so was because of a promotion, but in reality it was less of a promotion and more of a job offer. Because his new position took him above the police force entirely, up to their source of representation in the Imperial Cabinet, the Bureau of Public Order."
 japtouchou.48.a: "Must have missed the retirement party."
 japtouchou.49.t: "Suitably Correlated and Certainly Suspicious"
 japtouchou.49.d: "What the records of Takahara's bank account revealed were not obvious to the naked eye. At a glance, it appeared to be little more than the ebb and flow of money typical of any bank account. But the investigation was not simply glancing. Comparing the pattern of outbound payments to the average demographics of the area where Takahara's listed residence was, the investigation calculated an estimated rent, cost of living, and utility expenses. With these estimations, they compared the actual rate of withdrawal and deposits as well as the changing total balance of the account. What they found, was that the numbers didn't quite add up, not by an obscene amount, but enough to raise any accountant's eyebrows.\n\nThere were a number of points where the balance simply should not have been what it actually was. Oftentimes these coincided with what were determined to be significant payments, such as security deposits, doctor's services, and more recently, mortgage payments. In these cases, the total balance should have been lower than the records indicated after the payment. Some of these instances came from obvious sources, where a large cash deposit was made several days prior to a large payment. Some speculated that this was evidence of Takahara slowly siphoning in dark money from a physical source, using it to offset major expenses while maintaining his standard of living. A level of discretion and control that most fraud culprits did not show.\n\nFrom that point, the next step was to test that theory by attempting to locate Takahara's cache, if such a thing truly existed. Kodaira suggested the classic approach, tear their way through his place of residence and count the 'loose change' they come across. Tachi opted for a more restrained approach. The cash deposits made to the bank presumably had serial numbers, as did all official Yen banknotes, so they could simply trace the record of the notes themselves and follow it back to the source."
 japtouchou.49.a: "Look under the mattress."
 japtouchou.49.b: "Run the serial numbers."
 japtouchou.50.t: "Further Out"
 japtouchou.50.d: "After the painstaking process of recording the serial numbers of the notes issued by the bank for the withdrawal in question, the investigation submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance. Though serial number tracking could be a very effective means of identifying fraud, acquiring the relevant, complete records was a slow procedure, littered with difficulties and chances for error. Each note would have to be traced to the file group associated with its issue date, where the chronological list of registered locations could be found.\n\nHowever, the only occasions when the notes would consistently be registered and appear on the list is when they were deposited or withdrawn from a bank account. So if the notes were being held as a cash reserve their location would likely not appear. Even worse, due to the sheer number of transactions taking place on a daily basis in Japan, there was usually a sizeable delay between the initial recording and that recording's appearance on the list. Then, of course, there was the obvious problem, the cash was likely spent at different places, at different times, and ended in different destinations.\n\nThat is why it was such a shock when the records finally arrived in the hands of the investigation and revealed that all the notes that had be issued for the withdrawal were currently together in one place. They had been deposited in the bank account of one of the regional financial offices of the government of Manchuria. How they got there, was another question entirely."
 japtouchou.50.a: "And it's a question we intend to ask."
 japtouchou.51.t: "Death by a Thousand Budget Cuts"
 japtouchou.51.d: "As it would happen, the high rate of turnover in the Tokyo Tax Bureau was not quite evenly distributed. While all the departments experienced it to some degree, none more so than the Audit Division. This was the group responsible for reviewing the tax forms and returns of major institutions and those with suspect records. Ostensibly they were involved with investigating everything from estate tax payments to currency exchange programs. But unlike the other departments, instead of a constant stream of departures and new arrivals, the auditors seemed to only be faced with departures. Hardly anyone was moved from another department into the Audit Division, and anytime someone was removed from the division they were almost always destined to be send back down to the local ward offices. Over the years the total number of staff had dwindled down to a skeleton crew.\n\nMany in the investigation team questioned how the office could perform its varied and intensive functions with so few resources. But the answer turned out to be painfully simple, they weren't. Hardly anything came out of the division other than the occasional allegations of minor fraud or tax evasion, and even these had grown few and far between. Even projects that one would think would require the input of the auditors showed no sign of their involvement.\n\nOfficially, the reason for the division's decline was the 'increasing redundancy of the department as a whole and the continual dispersion of its functions to more appropriate bodies'. This line came from an internal review obtained by the investigation, and coincided with a substantial budget slash. But what functions were they referring to? And if the auditors were not involved, who was?"
 japtouchou.51.a: "Who indeed..."
 japtouchou.52.t: "Tied Hands and Tight Lips"
 japtouchou.52.d: "Unsatisfied with the vague outlines and broad descriptions provided in the project reports by the staff at the Tokyo Tax Bureau, the investigation team pressed for more. Kodaira in particular stressed the importance that the actual figures in the statistics Yoshikage had collected held to the case. Furthermore it was essential that they know the context of the statistics, who the data was collected from and pertained to. If Yoshikage had noted some inconsistencies in the numbers, the implications they provide may prove key to assigning a motivation for the murder.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bureau was not so keen to share their deceased worker's efforts, regardless of the justification. They claimed that the project details and its internal files were considered 'secure', due to the fact that the effort was still ongoing. They could not allow the yet unfinished proposals and analytics to become a matter of public record out of a concern that the relevant and related parties would take pre-emptive measures to subvert their conclusion. Kodaira, of course, harshly rejected this claim, proclaiming that there was a chance that a related party had already taken pre-emptive measures in the form of murdering their coworker.\n\nBut this did little to sway the tight-lipped taxmen, who maintain that they were bound by both internal regulations and external expectations. However one supervisor was surprisingly candid, saying that even if he believed there was good cause to give the investigation access, such an act would require authorization from external authorities. To Tachi, this was a red flag on its own, in his view the transparency of the organization had been critically compromised, but Kodaira was insistent on keeping up the pressure."
 japtouchou.52.a: "Raise concerns."
 japtouchou.52.b: "Press harder."
 japtouchou.53.t: "Battened Hatches"
 japtouchou.53.d: "The investigation rushed to make contact with the lower-level administrators of the Army, only for their efforts to blow up in their collective face. The hastily assembled plan had been sketched out and put into motion less than a day after they received the Ministry's response. The intention had been to make quiet contact with officials throughout the Operations, Intelligence, and Communications divisions of the IJA General Staff Office. Once the contacts were made, the investigation would attempt to get ahold of files related to the internal operations of the records rather than the records themselves, alongside testimonies from said officials. Once collected, that information could be complied and compared to the statements made by the Ministry to reveal any sources of inconsistency.\n\nHowever it quickly became apparent that the investigation's mistrust of the Army Ministry was mutual. Almost all the contacted officials either requested clearance the team did not have or simply deferred to the Ministry outright. Of the few who did speak, they all either could not offer anything of use or could merely point to an uncooperative superior. The Army's bureaucracy all at once appeared to be water-tight, sealed in word, thought, and deed.\n\nBut even in the face of this decisive setback, the pair of lead detectives remained firm. The argued, both privately to the Chief and to the team as a whole, that now was the time to double down on the strategy. Clearly, they claimed, the Army was worried about what the investigation would find buried beneath all the papers. So worried, in fact, that they had rushed to clamp down on any potential points of entry. And where there was worry and frantic action, there were bound to be mistakes."
 japtouchou.53.a: "Keep up the pressure."
 japtouchou.54.t: "Misdirected Mediation"
 japtouchou.54.d: "Overwhelmed by the politics of the Cabinet, there was only one body left that the investigation could look up to for assistance, and this one required them to look so high they risked spraining their necks. It was a poorly kept secret that in the lead up to the first war with the Chinese back in 1894, the bickering between the Imperial Army and Navy became so intense it threatened to tear apart the war effort before it even began. To resolve this, then Emperor Meiji ordered the creation of the Imperial General Headquarters, an organization intended to coordinate and resolve disputes between the branches. With the Emperor himself as its head, this was the only body with legal administrative authority over the two juggernauts that comprised the military forces of the Empire.\n\nSo it was even more of a shock when the Headquarters responded to the investigation's appeals with instructions to consult the Army Ministry for processing such requests. At first most believed that the staff were simply playing the same game of delaying and deflecting that the offices of the Army had, but further correspondence proved otherwise. Their role, the Headquarters claimed, was purely mediatory and coordinative, not administrative. It was neither their responsibility to manage the branches' interactions with external offices nor was it prerogative to override their decisions in that respect. Defeated, the investigative team and their lead detectives were forced to return to the drawing board. It was clear there was no viable route by which they could access and examine the inner workings of the Army. Whether this was due to complacency or pure stubbornness was irrelevant. In either case, more proactive means of investigation were now required."
 japtouchou.54.a: "Well, so much for playing nice."
 japtouchou.55.t: "The Advocates"
 japtouchou.55.d: "Finding themselves caught in the tangled web of Imperial politics that surrounded Japan's public institutions, the investigation now turned towards their own representatives, the Bureau of Public Order. The Bureau was part of the Home Ministry, one of the most powerful non-military Ministries of state, with broad authority ranging from urban planning to colonial affairs. The Bureau itself served as the central hub for civilian police administration. Over the course of its existence the Bureau had slowly acquired more responsibilities beyond those of public protection, including fire prevention and mediation of public disputes.\n\nDue to the sheer scale of its charge, in recent years the Bureau had retreated from the day to day management of the individual police departments, allowing a degree of unofficial autonomy to form, so long as the departments still vocally adhered to its strict guidelines. Furthermore, as the Kenpeitai and other military police agencies steadily began to encroach further and further into civil jurisdiction, the Bureau became intensely fixated on preserving their position within the political hierarchy, lest they one day find themselves beneath the bootheels of military bureaucracy. According to the grumblings of many former and veteran officers, the Bureau was more concerned with acting as 'the Cabinet's favorite dog' than the keepers of public order.\n\nIn that vein, the investigation hoped that the severity and subversive nature of the case would galvanize the Bureau back into their original role. With their voices joined to those of the investigation, they might just be able to command enough authority to force open the administrative doors that had prevented the case from progressing."
 japtouchou.55.a: "Bring on the Bureaucrats!"
 japtouchou.56.t: "Financial Foundations"
 japtouchou.56.d: "In the end, Kodaira got what he wanted, a good old fashioned search raid. Leading the team of officers, detectives, and forensic specialists personally, the veteran detective arrived at Officer's Takahara house with a slight spring in his step. Once through the front door, the group of proud public servants proceeded to ransack their way through the neatly organized home, pulling up everything that wasn't nailed down and a few things that were. Thankfully, no major unnecessary damage was caused that would require reimbursement, as the report made clear that the two holes in the wall had been there when the police arrived, and that the office door had been manually barred, and thus the use of the battering ram was perfectly justified.\n\nFinally, after a few hours of frenzied searching, the team unearthed their prize. An officer, after moving a bedside table in the master bedroom, noticed one of the floorboards stuck up slightly. With the aid of a forceful pull, the polished piece of wood popped free from the floor, revealing a dark, hollow space beneath. Hesitantly, the officer reached into the hole, leaning forward until his hand brushed against something in the dark. After he grabbed ahold of it and pulled it out into the light, he shouted urgently for his peers.\n\nFifteen minutes and a few floorboards later, the whole hoard was exposed to the world. Thousands upon thousands of Yen, bound with rubber bands, stuffed into bags and boxes, all safely tucked away in the space beneath the floor. From the amount alone it was obvious that this was no emergency fund, this was money that was intended to stay in the dark. But what was most surprising was that not all of it was in the crisp bills issued by the Ministry of Finance. About half of the stash took the crude form of the infamous Japanese Military Yen."
 japtouchou.56.a: "Curiouser and curiouser..."
 japtouchou.57.t: "Martial Monetary Musings"
 japtouchou.57.d: "Following the crumb-trail of digits stamped on the suspect Yen notes took the investigation further from Tokyo than they had anticipated. All the serial numbers pointed across the choppy sea and into one of the oldest Japanese conquests, Manchuria. Specifically, all the notes seemed to circle around the accounts of the Sphere member's local financial institutions. Confusion as to how and why the money had ended up there was only worsened by closer scrutiny. Those particular accounts were involved in a shadow practice dating back to the earliest months of the Japanese invasions during the war, the exchange of the controversial Japanese Military Yen.\n\nThe military Yen, sometimes referred to in hushed tones as 'invasion currency', was the predominant currency issued to non-government citizens of other Sphere countries and areas under the direct administration of the Japanese Armed Forces. While its value was not pegged against any real standard, it could be exchanged for civil Yen. But this process of exchange was strictly controlled and the rates were never consistent, often an intentional result of bureaucratic manipulations.\n\nIndeed, that was the claim given by the Manchurian financial representatives when first contacted by the investigation. The transactions they had associated with the government accounts were involved with buyback and 'liquidity balancing' programs aimed at maintaining a steady rate of growth and curbing local inflation. However they would offer no more information than that, claiming dispensing individual transaction information was beyond the scope of their authority. For that, the investigation would have to turn to the relevant offices embedded in the Japanese military."
 japtouchou.57.a: "Of course we do..."
 japtouchou.58.t: "Ceded Ground"
 japtouchou.58.d: "Finally, the reason for the Tokyo Tax Bureau's reluctance to share specific information about the tax code project came into the light. As some had implied, the Bureau's policy of relative silence was less due to a refusal to open its mouth, and more due to a bootheel pressed firmly on its throat. While reviewing the earliest project reports, the detectives came across a section detailing the process of analyzing and proposing regulations for the movement of capital and assets between Sphere countries. The section was noteworthy for two reasons. One, Yoshikage Shinji was designated as the chief analyst of this part of the project, and two, supervision of this particular part was placed under the administration of the Army Ministry, with them having primary authorization rights and access to the internal project files on request.\n\nInitially, this seemed like an utterly bizarre and arbitrary decision, what did the Army have to do with tax reform? But with some more goading, their true role began to take shape. Much of the data involved with that part of the project included information regarding the systems and usage of the Japanese Military Yen, the currency stand-in common among the soldiers and civilians of peripheral Sphere nations. As it would turn out, the distribution and handling of the Military Yen had been almost entirely administered by the offices of Imperial Army. Over time they slowly acquired more authority over its regulation and international usage, areas that were originally covered by the Audit department of the tax authorities.\n\nRecently, in recognition of that change, the authority was official transfer from the auditors to the Army. As such, they felt it was appropriate for them to be included in the decision making of any initiative involving an institution they so strictly controlled, and none were in any position to argue otherwise. With that, the investigation had no choice but to turn to the monolith of military bureaucracy, if they were to have any hope of gaining access to the victim's work."
 japtouchou.58.a: "Well, we have our marching orders."
 japtouchou.59.t: "The Lady in the Red Dress"
 japtouchou.59.d: "Kodaria's frustration wafted around him like the smoke from the cigarette in his mouth. As he walked down the dark Tokyo streets, lit only by the dull street lights and a few glowing signs, he kept his eye pointed towards the ground, his mouth twisted into a scowl. The detective paid no mind to the thin drizzle that fell from the sky, or any of the people who still wandered the streets. It had been another day of disappointment, of frustration, of failure. Every effort him and his fellow detectives had made was deflected or deferred past the point of viability. Every new path they started down was quickly bricked off and sealed away. Day by day, the lead that Kodaira had pulled from the web of information faded further into the dark. He ground his teeth.\n\n"Excuse me? Sir?" came a voice from behind him, soft in tone but firm in intent. When he turned, he was face to face with a young woman, her hair neatly braided behind her head, face covered in makeup and accented with sparkling eyeshadow. She wore a unbuttoned brown coat that reached down to her knees. But beneath it was a sparkling red dress that reached down almost as far as the coat, cut to expose one bare leg to the night air. "I think you dropped this," she said, extending her arms towards him.\n\nConfused, Kodaira took the parcel and turned it over in his hands. It was a plain yellow folder, unmarked and completely unfamiliar. But as he looked up to correct the woman, he only had the chance to see her back for a moment, before she rounded the corner and disappeared into the night."
 japtouchou.59.a: "Who was she?"
 japtouchou.60.t: "Taking Aim"
 japtouchou.60.d: "The newest re-orientation of the investigation accompanied yet another shift in the mood and morale of the team. A sense of apprehension lingered in the air of the station, the same oppressive feeling one would get from reaching their hand into a dark hole in the ground. Just as easily as one could unearth some treasure or piece of lost knowledge, one could just as easily grasp onto the coils of some unseen terror.\n\nNo one, from the brightest-eyed rookie to the most scarred and tested veteran, could have anticipated finding themselves locked in a struggle against the leaders and representatives of the Imperial Army. There were reasons why the twin branches of the military were held above the petty realm of Imperial politics. There were reasons why they maintained their own administrative channels, their own police forces, their own intelligence agencies. Their affairs were their own, their procedures their own, their justice their own. And somewhere high within that bureaucratic behemoth sat the lofty conspirators of this bloody conspiracy.\n\nAnd now the detectives and officers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department were going to bring them down."
 japtouchou.60.a: "Onward and upward."
 japtouchou.61.t: "An Unscheduled Meeting"
 japtouchou.61.d: "After the stern rebuff by the Imperial General Headquarters, the investigation's momentum was stunted. With no other obvious place to turn or path to take, the detectives began the slow march of backtracking. They would have to reconsider each choice, reread every document they had collected, and, if all else fails, consider a different lead entirely. Fortunately, their luck began to turn before they had taken more than a few steps back up the path.\n\nEarly one afternoon, a man came into the station, walked up to the front desk, and politely requested a meeting with the Chief. He was a tall, middle aged man, clean shaven with neatly trimmed hair, and came with a coat draped over his arm and a black leather briefcase in hand. Intrigued by the deskworker's description over of him the phone, the Chief agreed to speak with him. After the man arrived on the right floor and pulled the door to the Chief's office closed, the two were locked in conversation for the better part of an hour.\n\nEventually, the office door was pulled open again. The man emerged while the chief lingered in the doorway. They shook hands, bid each other farewell, and then the man walked past the rows of desks and out of the department. When he had left, the Chief strode from the doorway over to Kodaira's desk and tossed a small stack of papers onto it.\n\n"The Navy sends its regards.""
 japtouchou.61.a: "In a good way or a bad way?"
 japtouchou.62.t: "Confidence In Our Confidants"
 japtouchou.62.d: "Mercifully, the investigation's request to the Bureau of Public Order was acknowledged rather quickly. After a few short phone calls, Tachi and Kodaira were scheduled to meet with a representative from the Bureau to discuss the logistics of the case. So, the two detectives made their way through downtown Tokyo, up into the office block that housed the Bureau, and finally sat down in the cushioned chairs of one of the building's conference rooms. After a few moments they rose again as the representative came through the door, a younger man in a neatly pressed suit.\n\nAfter the greetings and formalities were done with, the three men moved on to the purpose for their visit. The two detectives took turns explaining the task they were attempting to complete and justifying their perceived need for assistance from the Bureau. The representative was generally quiet, listening intently, only occasionally raising his voice to ask a question of one of the detectives or when the discussion was in danger of stalling. Once the detectives had exhausted their reasoning, they pressed the man for a response.\n\nIn reply, he sympathized with the position held by the detectives and agreed that the investigation would likely be best suited if assisted by the Bureau, but there was a problem. The Bureau knew essentially nothing about the context of the requests or even the case as a whole. They could certainly do what was requested of them, but they needed to know why, and have some access to the case files. Tachi and Kodaira glanced at each other, they had tried their best to withhold information about the conspiracy for the sake of security, dare they risk that now for the sake of progress?"
 japtouchou.62.a: "Tachi accepts."
 japtouchou.62.b: "Kodaira refuses."
 japtouchou.63.t: "The Colonial Currency Conundrum"
 japtouchou.63.d: "The discovery of the Military Yen among the hidden hoard of wealth found in Officer Takahara's floorboards proved to be a stumbling point in the investigations considerations. The questions of how the notes got there and why were not easily answered simply because the processes and policies surrounding the rough currency were not generally well understood. Of all the contentious and convoluted systems in the Japanese Empire, the Military Yen was the least addressed. It was regarded as an artifact of the war, a temporary support system that had long overstayed its purpose of providing capital controls to newly occupied territories. But given the fact that it was really only present in the colonies and other Sphere countries, the population and government of mainland Japan had little motivation to address the issue.\n\nBecause of this, the investigation had to commit a considerable amount of effort into finding out who they could actually turn to in order to examine the presence of the military banknotes. Eventually they were pointed to a previously unheard of office called the Currency Exchange Commission, located in the Tokyo headquarters of the Ministry of Finance. But it turned out that the 'office' was little more than a handful of workers arranged in a cluster of cubicles.\n\nStill, despite the obvious lack of sufficient resources, the workers did their best to point the investigation in the right direction. While they could not directly provide them with the information they needed, they could point them to a place that might, a facility controlled and managed by the Imperial Army in Manchuria."
 japtouchou.63.a: "Time for some international correspondence."
 japtouchou.64.t: "The Rule of Two"
 japtouchou.64.d: "Unsurprisingly the Army, having been granted near absolute authority over the internal systems of the Military Yen, had taken the opportunity to construct the most convoluted system of permissions and security checks imaginable. This became clear to the investigation after only a brief foray into the international currency exchange regulations. The Military Yen was controlled not only by a single office of the Imperial Japanese Army, it was controlled by two, the Army Ministry and the Army's General Staff Office Intelligence Division.\n\nThe Army Ministry, while perhaps being the most direct route given their apparent control over internal policymaking for the Military Yen, likely would not be the easiest. The Ministry was stubborn and seldom gave up information without good reason, prior communications between them and the police force had proven that. However, given the sprawling nature of the organization and the relative obscurity of the Military Yen, the relevant departments may be less wary than the central leadership.\n\nThe IJA-GSO Intelligence Division was another matter. They were a reclusive organization, reliquinishing information when it suited them and infamous for sticking its shadowy tendrils in every organization it could reach. Officially, they were administratively beneath the Army Ministry, but perhaps they would see some benefit in whispering beneath the noses of their political masters."
 japtouchou.64.a: "Ask the IJA-GSO."
 japtouchou.64.b: "Ask the Army Ministry."
 japtouchou.65.t: "The Dead Man's Charge"
 japtouchou.65.d: "Kodiara had pored over the files given to him by the mysterious ruby-clad woman over a dozen times before sharing their existence with his fellow detective. At first, Tachi was skeptical of what Kodaira was saying, doubly so because of the somewhat incredible nature of their origin. But after leafing through the first few pages, and taking note off the official Army symbolism and formatting, he began take it all much more seriously.\n\nThe files detailed the communications and procedures of a joint administrative project between the Tokyo Tax Bureau and the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. The project was concerned with further regulating the movement of civilian Yen throughout the Sphere by beginning to integrate the systems involved with administering the Japanese Military Yen, the rough, ad hoc currency employed for use primarily in the subordinate Sphere nations. The files outlined channels of information that would need to be erected between the project's manager, Yoshikage Shinji, and the relevant departments in the Army General Staff Office. These included numerous requests for access to files regarding the exchange programs between the civilian and military currencies.\n\nBut beyond acknowledging the existence of the program and its aims, the files still did not point to an explicit motive for Yoshikage's murder. But the final piece of paper in the folder was a handwritten note directed at the detectives. If they wanted more, they were to return these files to a certain mailbox at a certain time, and more information would come their way."
 japtouchou.65.a: "That's... ominous."
 japtouchou.66.t: "Target Priority"
 japtouchou.66.d: "With the decision to launch a full inquest against the Imperial Army, came more debate. It was obvious that the moment the investigation made their motives clear, the administrative components of the Army would launch a swift counter-assault. In that case, the first blow had to be decisive, they would need hard evidence to justify the use of civil authorities against military staff. Therefore, the point of argument between the detectives was where this blow should be placed to be most effective.\n\nKodaira argued that they should keep their effort simple and targeted. Pull in the base commander associated with the killer and demand he talk openly or be faced with obstruction of justice charges. That way they keep the pressure in one place and potentially delay how fast the Army can respond. With a little luck, they may even be able to slide under the noses of the Army admins entirely.\n\nTachi disagreed, claiming that such an approach was too narrow in scope. If they wanted to catch the conspiracy as a whole, they would need to cast their nets wider. Besides, all previous efforts to navigate the low level bureaucracy had failed, it was time to meet the Army Ministry head on. He proposed they bring the demands for unrestricted access and uncensored testimony directly to their faces and in plain view. Then the Army would have no choice by to comply or else risk appearing suspect and corrupt before their administrative peers."
 japtouchou.66.a: "The Base Commander."
 japtouchou.66.b: "The Ministry Admins."
 japtouchou.67.t: "The Hollow Office"
 japtouchou.67.d: "While the information given by the man from the Navy Ministry was not so significant in itself, its potential implications certainly were. It seemed that the appeals to the Imperial General Headquarters by the investigation had attracted the attention of the other half of the Japanese Armed Forces. According to the testimony of the man, a member of the Navy Ministry, not only was the IGHQ's dismissal of the investigation unremarkable, it was downright anticipated.\n\nHe claimed that the General Headquarters had long since been gutted and largely stripped of its authority by the efforts and ambitions of the Army. Through a combination of vocal protest and outright defiance, the Army Ministry had effectively neutered any potential for an outside party to audit their inner workings. As the Headquarters was partially controlled by the Army, any mandate the organization attempted to give to the IJA would immediately result in half their staff conspiring against them. As such, it was now nearly impossible to bypass the ever-convenient claims of 'issues of national security' the Army gave whenever faced with an inquest. The papers he had provided seemed to confirm this, with dozens of reports of IGHQ efforts and functions halted in their tracks with seemingly little justification.\n\nThese considerations, while hugely impactful, were well beyond the authority of the Tokyo Police to investigate. The two detective agreed that this would require nothing less than a Cabinet level intervention. Where they disagreed, was on which part of the Cabinet they should involve. Tachi held that this was significant enough on its own to be brought before the general view of the Cabinet, while Kodaira felt they should consult their representative office in the Home Ministry, the Bureau of Public Order."
 japtouchou.67.a: "Blow the whistle."
 japtouchou.67.b: "Consult the Bureau."
 japtouchou.68.t: "Counter-coordination"
 japtouchou.68.d: "Despite Kodaira's insistence that giving such unrestricted access to the sensitive case files to such a potentially large group was a mistake, Tachi was hopeful the Bureau of Public Order would be able to provide them with the information they needed. Unfortunately, not long after copies of the files had been sent to the Bureau offices, a letter came that dashed his hopes almost entirely. In the letter, the Bureau informed the detectives that while what they had been asked to do was not a problem of in itself, the nature of the investigation's aimed posed problems.\n\nAccording to them, the case strayed into what they referred to as, 'administratively sensitive areas', namely the civil investigation into offenses committed by military personnel and the upward investigation of Cabinet authorities. In general circumstances, such processes were typically considered to be military and political matters due to the position of their suspects, and were thus delegated to the appropriate internal authorities. However, the case in question went even further. The Bureau cited a previously unknown resolution passed by none other than the Supreme War Council, which stated that no law enforcement agency or department of such an agency maintained the right to information currently relevant to an investigation by another agency, including both civil and military police.\n\nIn this case, the other agency was the Army, which claimed that portions of the information deemed relevant was already in use by a tangentially related internal investigation, and had to be held as secure for security reasons. Dismayed, the lead detectives sent aside any notions of help from the Bureau and turned to a new task. Finding a loophole."
 japtouchou.68.a: "Damn bureaucrats..."
 japtouchou.69.t: "Prevention and Precaution"
 japtouchou.69.d: "Kodaira had refused the Bureau of Public Order's request for access to the case records on the basis of internal security, but he could not simply leave it at that. At the representative's urging, he gave a rough description of the concerns held by the investigation, but ensured to withhold any identifying details. At the detective's suggestion that some members of the law enforcement staff may be complicit in a wider series of criminal activity and provided cover by some elements of high administration, the Bureau representative became very grim, asking only a few curt questions. After Kodaira put forth all he was willing to say, the man thanked the detectives for their time, and assured them that he would relay everything that they had said and report back to them shortly.\n\nNews of the Bureau's reaction to this did eventually make its way to the Tokyo station, but it came as a trickle of whispers that reached the chief's ear, rather than a standard letter or phone call. Apparently, at the suggestion of internal corruption administrative fraud, the Bureau had activated a number of internal security protocols, one of which included reporting to the Home Ministry on the nature of the situation. When the Home Ministry learned of what the concerns were, they too responded with some preventative measures, including a 'temporary evaluation in information compartmentalization'.\n\nFor the investigation, this could only mean one thing, more paperwork."
 japtouchou.69.a: "Just what we wanted..."
 japtouchou.70.t: "The Vault Keepers"
 japtouchou.70.d: "After a few long distance phone calls, the investigation managed to get in touch with the office in Manchuria. From what they gathered, it was a facility tucked away in the Manchurian capital of Xinjing and administered by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. The little information that was easily publically accessible described it as the central storage and distribution point for Military Yen for northeastern China and the entirety of Korea. Naturally, it was a highly secure facility, wrapped in thick walls and patrolled by dozens of guards.\n\nBut when Detective Tachi got through to the admin offices of the facility, he was surprised by their agreeableness and openness. At first, he was concerned that this was indicative of the site leadership mishandling sensitive information, but he quickly realized it was because of another reason entirely, there was not much information to mishandle in the first place. According to the officer he spoke to on the phone, the facility only maintained records of the total quantity of currencies physically in the building at regular intervals. All records pertaining to the exchange, movement, and recipients of the military yen were maintained by some combination of the Army Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Manchurian Government.\n\nWhile the officer was unable to provide Tachi with what he needed, he could offer him copies of the records of currency quantities that they had on hand. Alternatively, he could try and put him in contact with his superiors in the General Staff Office to escalate the issue."
 japtouchou.70.a: "The files will do for now."
 japtouchou.70.b: "The General Staff Office, please."
 japtouchou.71.t: "Further Communications"
 japtouchou.71.d: "Several days had passed since Kodaira had placed the mysterious files into the inconspicuous mailbox, but no word from their unseen sympathizers came. Kodaira was entirely prepared for another impromptu meeting, similar to the circumstances under which he had received the first. Every night, as he walked home, he scanned the faces of the people he passed on the dimly lit sidewalks, searching for the face of the Lady in Red or anyone else who stood out to him. The detective even found himself taking longer and less direct routes home, in subtle hope that this would somehow encourage another meeting to happen.\n\nHowever that sense of optimism did not last long, as the days continued to roll by, more doubt was thrown onto the veracity of their arrangement. Tachi even suggested that perhaps this had been a set-up on the part of the responsible parties to ensure that those files did not remain out of their intended place for long, and that there was not really any more information. Kodaira, of course, had rejected such sentiments, but not as sternly as he might of done a few days earlier.\n\nThat same night, Kodaira arrived home, kicked off his shoes and hung his coat on the hook on the wall the same way he always did. There was no sign of anything unusual or out of place as he walked from his front door and into the main part of his home. But as he entered his kitchen, found a single resting on his counter where one had not been before. And on top was a small square piece of paper, with nothing written on it but his name."
 japtouchou.71.a: "Subtle, yet sinister."
 japtouchou.72.t: "The Commander's Claim"
 japtouchou.72.d: "With the investigation's focus locked onto the commander of the base in Indonesia where Takahara had been stationed, they made their move. Coordinating with local police, the investigation drafted a letter politely demanding that the Commander present himself in some form or else face charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Once the thinly veiled threats were transcribed, their Indonesian-based counterparts placed the letter in the hands of who they claimed was their fastest courier, and sent him on his way.\n\nUnsurprisingly, only a single day passed before Kodaira received a long-distance call from the Indonesian station, who informed him that the commander had responded with a hastily-typed letter of his own. Refusing to wait for the letter to be sent all the way to Japan, Kodaira insisted that they read the letter to him over the phone, against the advice of Detective Tachi.\n\nThe base commander of course furiously denied that he had anything to do with the allegations laid out by the investigation and further denied that he had every attempted to impede their progress. Beyond painstricken claims of innocence, the commander's letter strongly focused on the circumstances surrounding the mysterious grenade Takahara had employed in his plot. He felt that he was undeniably innocent of any charges related to this situation as all the files and logistical details concerning the base's inventory management had been passed to departments of the Navy. This was truly an incredible claim, so incredible that Kodaira outright refused to believe it. He insisted that this was yet another deflection and demanded direct communication from the commander so he could 'hear his voice when he spews such nonsense'."
 japtouchou.72.a: "Does he think we were born yesterday?"
 japtouchou.73.t: "Controversy in the Cabinet"
 japtouchou.73.d: "As expected, the investigation's demands for accountability from the Army Ministry were met with furious opposition, mostly from the office in question. It seemed that the moment that the paperwork was placed in the hands of the workers at the Cabinet's general offices, a storm of controversy engulfed the whole forum. Of course the mere implication that some subversive action had been carried out by the Army kicked off an accompanying flurry of speculation, further straining the already tense situation.\n\nThe representatives of the Army Ministry systematically alternated between unflinching defences of their position and fiery attacks on the motivations behind the demands. They claimed that the oversight of internal military systems and operations of law enforcement were specifically designed to be separate from domestic civil authorities in the interests of national security and administrative autonomy. In the next breath they denied the legitimacy of the investigation's pursuits, claiming they had already provided enough information to reach reasonable conclusions and the continued efforts to subvert the established separation of authorities was tantamount to political tampering.\n\nThe subtle insinuation that all external oversight into the Army was illegitimate did not sit well with many of the Ministries of State, some grumbling with concerns about precedents and procedures. But many others tacitly supported some of the key points given by the Army, agreeing in principle with some concerns of practice. But the powerhouses of the Home Ministry and Navy Ministry remained silent, forcing the Cabinet into gridlock, leaving the pressure to build even further."
 japtouchou.73.a: "We will weather the storm."
 japtouchou.74.t: "A Matter of Procedure"
 japtouchou.74.d: "Tackling a resolution passed by the Supreme War Council as a critical matter of state was certainly no easy task. Even if a logically coherent loophole could be found somewhere is its construction, that did not mean the relevant authorities were liable to accept it. It was more than likely that if the detectives sauntered up to the Council and slyly claimed that by their own words they were forced to comply with the investigation's requests, the Council would simply claim the line of reasoning intentionally subverts the purpose of the resolution and constitutes political interference.\n\nWith that understood, Kodaira pushed his partner and their subordinates to search for a means by which they could convince the Council that it was in their best interests to carry out the requests they had made of them. The less 'creative interpretation' required to achieve that effect, the better. Sure enough, with some careful reading and comparison to legal precedents, they found their angle.\n\nThere were only two authorities which could reliably override the consequences of the resolution. The first was the Emperor himself, which came as little surprise. Second, however, was a subclause granting authority to the Council as a whole to disregard the decision of one of its subordinate offices. It could be invoked if the Council was presented reasonable evidence that a third party held some information that would be pertinent to a sufficient resolution of the internal investigation. If accepted, the relevant office would have to openly corroborate their information with that of the third party. In this case, that would provide the investigation with everything they needed, and maybe even result in the Army's closely held secrets to come spilling out."
 japtouchou.74.a: "A loop without a hole, perfect."
 japtouchou.75.t: "Collective Worry Individual Action"
 japtouchou.75.d: "As if the Home Ministry's decision to apply extra measures of scrutiny and security to the flow of information didn't hinder the investigation enough, it seemed that word of their worries had reached other offices of the Imperial Cabinet. At first the wider response was nothing more than isolated murmurs of speculation and gossip, but soon that gave way to action.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the first office to leap at the opportunity to enforce stricter rules over their knowledge was the Army Ministry. Only a few days after the investigation had learned of the Home Ministry's decisions, similar stories began to flow from the ranks of the Army and their supervisors. They were quick to clamp down on the avenues of inter-Ministry communication, placing elevated checks and additional clearance processes on many of such systems.\n\nBeyond that they had issued strict commands to the offices beneath them. The Intelligence Division of the General Staff Office was to be isolated, reporting directly to Ministry leadership instead. Furthermore, and most relevantly in the detectives' eyes, they ordered changes in the procedures of the various military police units. This included stronger standards on which information could be given out, on the basis of 'protecting sensitive content from potentially compromised civil authorities'. However Detective Tachi was quick to note that they left the definition of 'sensitive' up to interpretation. Was it sensitive to the interests of the nation as a whole, or just to them?"
 japtouchou.75.a: "I think we all know the answer to that..."
 japtouchou.76.t: "Balancing Act"
 japtouchou.76.d: "Event"
 japtouchou.77.t: "A Measure of Intelligence"
 japtouchou.77.d: "After a few phone calls between the Police's primary contacts in the Army's General Staff Office and the head detectives, the Investigation managed to make contact with a public-facing officer who, according to their contacts, 'knew just enough to help them out'. After another phone call or two, this time with one of the relevant officers who preferred not to give his family name, that was revealed to be only somewhat true. For the most part, the only information the Intelligence division could give them was how little information they actually had.\n\nPer the testimony of the Intelligence officer, the part of the Division concerned with the Military Yen actually had only one real function in that respect, tracking the distribution and rough movement of the Military Notes as they moved about the sphere. As far as he knew, which he assured the detectives was rather far, the whole Intelligence Division didn't have a single file concerning the actual exchange of individual notes, just the movement of set quantities of bills from one place to the other.\n\nTo make matters worse the officer could not even assure the detectives that they would be able to see the files for themselves either. However, to their surprise, he assured them that he would do his best to track down who had the exchange files and report back to them. Apparently, he had suspected something afoul in the system for some time, and was determined to bring an end to it one way or another."
 japtouchou.77.a: "Godspeed Officer Shinzo."
 japtouchou.78.t: "Uncharacteristically Helpful"
 japtouchou.78.d: "Knowing the typical disposition of the Army Ministry, the staff of the Investigation prepared for a long bureaucratic struggle to wrest the details of the Military Yen Exchange systems from their grasp. In particular, the two lead detectives spent a good deal of time preparing both administratively, by collecting names and phone numbers of people they would likely need to contact, and mentally for the clash with the stubborn Army representatives.\n\nAs such, Tachi and Kodaira were among the most blindsided when they received a reply from the Ministry in an acceptably short timeframe which contained a relatively informative amount of information. They provided a short stack of papers detailing the absolute and relative exchange rates between Military and Civil Yen, broken down by region and Sphere nation. They also took the time to acknowledge the various facilities responsible for facilitating these systems of exchange and their governing offices.\n\nThere were two things the pile of papers did not include however, which was the justification for the shifting exchange rates, and the records of the specific bills that were being exchanged at any given time. According to them, neither of those sets of records were under the control of the Army at all. They were under the control of the Navy Ministry."
 japtouchou.78.a: "Soon we'll have contacted every office in Japan."
 japtouchou.79.t: "The Hidden Hand"
 japtouchou.79.d: "Clearly Kodaira's sharp words had a profound effect on the commander, as the detective was granted his wish of direct communication in just a few days. After leaving a few curt messages with his secretary, they had arranged for a call to take place between the detectives and the commander, where they would have to chance to ask all the questions they desired and mull over the answers. When the time came, Tachi, Kodaira, and the team's minute-taker filed into a bare and empty office and crowded around the solitary phone sat on the desk.\n\nFor two and a half hours, the two men dragged the commander through the phone lines, sternly issuing questions and harshly demanding clarity in his answers. The commander in return responded in a firm, calm tone, but at the pace of a man weighing his words with his life. In great detail, he described how the Navy came to partially control the records for the base's ever-shifting inventory, and why they should be the point of the investigation's focus. Officially, the base was located in a place that was, 'practically and strategically inconvenient' with respect to the Army's supply chain. The Army sought to resolve this by contracting the Navy to run supplies to the base during their usual movements.\n\nMuch to everyone's surprise, the Navy agreed, on the sole condition that they would maintain the records involved with shipping the supplies for 'redundancy purposes'. The Army, apparently seeing no harm in this, accepted. So, the commander explained, if a grenade had indeed been smuggled off the base but resulted in no inconsistency in the records, the only possible point of manipulation was in the Navy."
 japtouchou.79.a: "It seems we picked the wrong branch."
 japtouchou.80.t: "The Solidarity of Soldiers"
 japtouchou.80.d: "Eventually, after days of debate in the Cabinet assembly, a new perspective was offered to the floor. The Navy Ministry, which up until that point had remained mostly silent and seemingly withdrawn from the issue, put for their first statement since the whole affair began. But as they quickly made clear, the statement did not come from the Ministry itself, in a sense, rather they were giving it on the request of the Navy General Staff Office. But the position put forth by what was thought to be the Army's fierce rival was almost unbelievable.\n\nThe Staff Office justified the relevance of providing their opinion on the basis of their shared membership on the Supreme War Council with the Army Ministry, which they claimed played an essential military and political role. They initially reiterated the Army's positions on the preservation of the independence of organizations and potential security ramifications, but afterwards made a much stronger claim. They maintained that the rights to exclusive authority over legal investigation of military affairs rested solely with the internal system of the respective branch purely on the basis of military operational security. By this fact alone, they claimed, no other non-superordinate office of state could attempt to subvert the judgement of said systems without violating systematic independence.\n\nThe investigation team was left baffled, none more so than the lead detectives. They had fully anticipated that all the elements of the Navy would have taken this opportunity to assert dominance over their bureaucratic rival, not stand by their side. Of all the times the Navy could have chosen to develop a sense of solidarity, why now?"
 japtouchou.80.a: "A little suspicious, don't you think?"
 japtouchou.81.t: "A Matter of Principle"
 japtouchou.81.d: "With their avenue of approach found, the investigation wasted no time in assembling their case for presentation before the Supreme War Council. The whole process of outlining the nature of the circumstances, as well as the justification for their appeal, was overseen by the critical gaze of the two chief detectives, and occasionally by the chief as well. They were careful to ensure that the manner of their presentation was conducive to their actual aims. They had to strike a careful balance between providing enough information to justify their relevance to the Army's investigation, but not so much that it risked betraying the wider suspected conspiratorial elements of the case or implied a degree of political motivation.\n\nTo achieve this, they attempted to format the appeal in such a way as to play off the internal dynamics of the Council, rather than address it as a totality. The Council was formed by the Army Ministry and General Staff Office, the Navy Ministry and General Staff Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of the Prime Minister of the Imperial Diet, providing a host of considerations to take advantage of. Obviously, the Army offices would dig in their heels and flatly refuse to accept the position, that was well understood. But the involvement of their stauch rival, whose presence the investigation was sure to subtly emphasize, may motivate the offices of the Navy to show some sympathy.\n\nGiven that, it came as a rather extreme surprise when the investigation received word that not only had their appeal been quickly denied, but some of the strongest opposition had come from the representatives of the Navy. They had launched into an unprecedented defense of their rival hinged on the mutual agreement of the two branches on the suppression of political intrusion. Never in the history of the Empire had the Navy put forward such a position on principle alone. The detectives of the investigation could not believe it. And thus, they would not believe it."
 japtouchou.81.a: "So that's how the Navy wants to play? Fine."
 japtouchou.82.t: "Security in Subtlety"
 japtouchou.82.d: "The timing and speed of the Army's response to murmurs of corruption circulating through the Cabinet had drawn the suspicion of the investigation and its lead detectives. It seemed rather suspicious that the militarized bureaucrats would so openly take measures that would inhibit the progress of a criminal investigation that involved one of their personnel. Indeed it seemed that if the Army were truly concerned with the identification and elimination of corruption, they would expose their inner workings to the light of the public eye, not push them deeper into the dark. But as eyebrow-raising as their actions were, the actions of their twin were far more questionable.\n\nThroughout the totality of the investigation up to this point, the offices of the Imperial Navy had remained silent observers of the whole affair, rarely ever giving any comment or taking any action in response to the proceedings. So when the gears of Naval administration finally began to turn, many were quick to report on the pitch of their creaks and groans. As quietly as a branch of international military organization could, they slowly began isolating and freezing their internal departments and the information they held.\n\nRather than loudly declare the sealing of specific departments as their rival had done, the Navy's actions were learned through the flow of common chatter of office workers. Officers of the Navy would seemingly select files, case records, and personnel at random and whisk them away to more 'secure positions'. Records kept in one place for years were suddenly reorganized and authorities that had been granted long ago were revoked without warning. But why would the Navy be so concerned with corruption allegations that did not involve them? And why be so secretive about the process?"
 japtouchou.82.a: "Welcome to the lineup, Admiral."
 japtouchou.83.t: "An Unfortunate Upgrade"
 japtouchou.83.d: "Confronted with the irregularities found in the Manchurian facility's records, Tachi and Kodaira were forced to try and glean what information they could from the notes and other information available. But despite all their efforts, no reasonably suitable explanation could be found, and so the detectives were nearly forced to conclude that the files had been tampered with. Frustrated, they again tried to make contact with workers at the facility to confront them about this issue. Fortunately, when they did eventually get in touch with the facility over the phone, the responding officer was the same one who had helped them previously.\n\nWhen the detectives first explained the situation and their concerns to him, he seemed confused, uncertain what they could be referring to. But after a few moments of consideration, he realised what the detectives were observing, and explained to them that it was actually a misunderstanding. The instances where no change in the quantity of military yen banknotes was not a mistake, because an exchange had actually taken place. On those occasions, an exchange had indeed taken place between regular and military notes, but another exchange had taken place at the same time, between two different types of military yen.\n\nSome older prints of the military yen were extremely basic and lacked serial numbers or any kind of individualizing mark. The Manchurian facility had a fair few of these bills in storage, so on a few occasions when some of the military notes were to be exchanged for regular notes, some of the unmarked notes were replaced with newer notes with serial numbers, keeping the total quantity the same as before the exchange. As Tachi began to ask what became of the unmarked notes and what part of the Army was responsible for handling them, the officer interrupted him. It was not the Army who was in charge of transporting the supposedly phased out bills, it was the Navy."
 japtouchou.83.a: "Why is the Navy moving the Army's money?"
 japtouchou.84.t: "Constant Changes"
 japtouchou.84.d: "After a few days of impatient waiting, Intelligence Officer Shinzo had yet to report back to the investigation or either of its lead detectives. Even more concerning, once the detectives were fed up with waiting they attempted to check in themselves, but none of their calls were ever answered. Kodaira began to suspect that either the whole thing had been a wild goose chase or the officer's off-record assignment had gone awry. Tachi on the other hand, had not entirely lost hope, and maintained they should give the Intelligence Officer a few more days before coming to any hasty conclusions.\n\nSure enough, just a day later at around half past four in the afternoon, just as Tachi was about to step out the door to leave for the day, his desk phone rank. After scurrying to pick it up, the detective was greeted by the reassuring voice of Officer Shinzo. He was happy to report that by combing through the files and conversing with some of his colleagues, he managed to track down the Military Yen Exchange records as well as the office that controlled them.\n\nThe answer caught Tachi by surprise, so much so that he had to asked the officer to repeat what he said, in order to make sure he hadn't misheard him. All records and accounts concerned with the specific exchanges of Military Notes were not under the control of the Army at all, they were actually under the control of the Navy, the Navy's General Staff Office to be exact."
 japtouchou.84.a: "Does anybody actually know how this government works?"
 japtouchou.85.t: "Nothing More To It"
 japtouchou.85.d: "The Army Ministry had not provided the Investigation with any specific Division or Department within the Navy Ministry to contact in order to continue to ever-lengthening search for the Military Yen records. As such they were forced to start from the very bottom, at the secretaries of the Central Office, and work their way up to the right department when they eventually found out what it actually was.\n\nWhere the Army Ministry had graced the investigation with their cooperation, it seemed their Naval counterpart was in no such mood. It took the better part of a week for the Navy to respond to their initial request, but even then their response merely directed them to another obscure department to start the process all over again. And then, when that department learned that the Investigation was concerned specifically with the exchange of specific military notes, there was a whole other process with its own set of hoops to jump through.\n\nFinally, one blessed morning a government courier arrived bearing a set of files marked as being from the Navy Ministry Headquarters, ostensibly containing the exchange records they had been after for so long. But any feelings of elation dissipated only a few moments after the lead detectives read the first few lines. According to the Navy the specific notes they were concerned with were part of a 'stabilizing buyback program' implemented to curb local inflation, and as such, should be of no meaningful interest to the Investigation's goals."
 japtouchou.85.a: "That does it."
 japtouchou.86.t: "The File That Can't Be Read"
 japtouchou.86.d: "Unlike the previous mysterious folder, the one Kodaira had found in his kitchen contained only a single piece of paper. It was printed on the familiar sturdy stock that nearly all critical government offices printed their documents on. But where the previous papers had borne the symbols and headers of the Imperial Japanese Army or the Tokyo Tax Bureau, this paper was claimed by the Navy, specifically the Navy Ministry.\n\nBut the Navy's proud iconography was one of the few pieces of intelligible information present on the page. Because where the previous files had been clear and candid about their content, this one had been intentionally made to hide all that it could. The file was liberally coated in the thick black ink the government censors were so fond of. Whole sentences, even paragraphs were turned into rows of black rectangles, any meaning blotted out by the careful hands of bureaucracy.\n\nThere were only a few key pieces of information that could be pulled from what remained of the paper's particulars. First was the name of the Minezaka Conglomerate, the commercial-industrial group that owned the plant where Yoshikage's body had been found. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, were a number of references to shipping details between Conglomerate warehouses and unspecified Naval installations."
 japtouchou.86.a: "There is a link somewhere, but where?"
 japtouchou.87.t: "Choosing a Lead"
 japtouchou.87.d: "With the lists of details and various leads of the case growing ever longer and beginning to twist and intertwine with each other, the Investigation was beginning to find its resources spread thin. Furthermore the parallel investigation method that had served them so well at the start was now beginning to cause the various teams to stumble over each other and on more than one occasion found themselves uncovering or dealing with redundant information.\n\nTo that end, the two head detectives decided it was time to simplify the investigation process by pursuing one lead in particular. They figured that if the leads already overlapped this much, then following one to its end should lead to the resolution of all of them. It just came down to choosing which was the best one to follow."
 japtouchou.87.a: "Follow the shipping lead."
 japtouchou.87.b: "Follow the Ministry lead."
 japtouchou.87.c: "Follow the IJN-GSO lead."
 japtouchou.88.t: "Shipping Out"
 japtouchou.88.d: "At that point, the majority of the evidence collected by the Investigation ultimately pointed towards some form of international shipping. While such frequent references did draw the attention of the lead detectives, to a certain extent it did make sense. Given the geographically fragmented nature of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, shipping became a foundational industry of in itself. Wherever an organization found some international commercial interest, private or Imperial, the captains of the sea lanes were sure to follow.\n\nTo that end, the shipping industry had taken on a sprawling character, with interests and offices in every field and in every nation and region in the Sphere. In order to have any chance of finding useful information, the Investigation would have to narrow their search to the particular area that was likely to be relevant to the case."
 japtouchou.88.a: "Why is the Navy moving the Army's guns?"
 japtouchou.88.b: "What is the Navy's role in moving the Military Yen?"
 japtouchou.88.c: "How are the Navy and Conglomerate involved?"
 japtouchou.89.t: "The Imperial Navy Ministry"
 japtouchou.89.d: "Like its Army twin, the Navy Ministry was a monolithic titan of Imperial administration. There were few bodies in the entire Empire that could claim as much influence or wield as much authority as the total combined might of the Japanese Navy. And among the few who did hold legal authority either equal or above that of the Ministry, only the offices of the Emperor himself could reliably hold them accountable.\n\nThis reality was ever present in the minds of the Investigation's lead detectives, gnawing at the edges of their psyche as they planned their routes of inquiry into the Ministry. As with the Army Ministry, they anticipated a difficult bureaucratic struggle against the internal Departments of the Navy. But in this case, their leads were much less clearly refined in scope, and they had half the number of contacts. In order to have any hope of following the case all the way through, the Investigation would have to be very precise in their choice of targets."
 japtouchou.89.a: "What is the Navy doing with the Military Yen?"
 japtouchou.89.b: "What are the Navy Bureaucrats hiding?"
 japtouchou.90.t: "The IJN-GSO"
 japtouchou.90.d: "The Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff Office was a stubborn and independent department, even by Imperial Japanese standards. They staunchly refused to answer to any authority but that of the Emperor by means of the Imperial General Headquarters, and now even that leash had begun to grow slack. Their performance against the Allied navies and the lauding they received from the public in the afterglow of victory had only emboldened them further, allowing them to secure a measure of political power of their own.\n\nThis meant that they were regarded as an entirely separate beast from the monolithic Navy Ministry. Where the Army Ministry and General Staff Office were generally regarded as two faces of the same machine, the Navy Ministry often found itself blustering and stumbling after the Navy General Staff Office while they steamed ahead without a single damn about the 'political ramifications' of their policies.\n\nWhile the Office's responsibilities were technically 'limited' to those concerning operational command, in reality this gave them a far reaching and broadly defined authority over Imperial seagoing affairs. Given this huge sprawl of administration, the Investigation would need to be very precise in their inquiries."
 japtouchou.90.a: "What are the bureaucrats hiding?"
 japtouchou.90.b: "What is the Office's role in the Military Yen?"
 japtouchou.91.t: "The Errand Boys of the Empire"
 japtouchou.91.d: "The central point of consideration with respect to the shipping situation was the unprecedented level of cooperation between the twin branches of the military, who only took a rest from fighting each other with words when there was someone to be fought with bullets. Indeed even during the War, it had been an open secret that the Navy was deeply displeased with their assigned duties of resupplying the Army during their various campaigns. They grumbled that they had been demoted to the 'errand boys of the Empire', but they complied nonetheless, out of fear of bringing down the ire of the Emperor and the fearsome Prime Minister Tōjō.\n\nSo why now, in times of uneasy peace, would the Navy reverse their position entirely, and carry out what seemed to be far more menial tasks without the slightest bit of coaxing or threatening? From the exterior, the disposition of the two organizations seemed to be the same as always. The constant war of words between the two had been no different prior to the start of the Investigation, there was the same level of bickering and debating over marginal and pedantic issues. Was it perhaps the case that these arguments were merely a facade to cover some deeper coordination?\n\nIn order to determine if such things were actually the case, they would first need to understand the full extent of their relationship. What was the Navy actually moving, where was it going, and why?"
 japtouchou.91.a: "Why indeed."
 japtouchou.92.t: "Where the Shipping Lanes Cross"
 japtouchou.92.d: "Since the start of the Investigation proper, the tendrils of the Imperial Military and the Minezaka Conglomerate had spiraled around each other endlessly. Wherever the one was concerned, the other always seemed to appear in one way or another. At first, it had seemed that the Army was the primary participant in the collaboration between Military and Industrial parties. But as time went on, the Navy's influence was seen and felt in more and more places, until it was obvious that it was the dominant party in the partnership.\n\nAs such, in the later stages of the investigation most of the effort had gone to trying to find the point of overlap between the Conglomerate and the Navy. Now, with the new information they had accumulated, the two organization's mutual interests in international shipping may prove to be a good candidate for that point's location.\n\nIn order to properly assess this possibility, the Investigation would need to review two sources of information. First was the forward facing information from the Navy regarding their contracts with private industries, which they used as a subtle means to entice more competitive offers. Second was the reports issued by the Minezaka Conglomerate itself with the similar aim of enticing further investment by demonstrating their political legitimacy. And besides, what businessmen would pass up the opportunity to rub his military contracts in the faces of his rivals?"
 japtouchou.92.a: "Not one that I can think of."
 japtouchou.93.t: "The Big Fiscal Picture"
 japtouchou.93.d: "As the Investigation examined the administration of the Japanese Military Yen, they were steadily led closer and closer to the embrace of the Imperial Navy. Initially most had assumed that the Military Yen would have been an administrative area thoroughly spearheaded by the Imperial Army, given the currency's purported purpose. But it seemed that nearly all aspects of its management, from tax and exchange regulation to movement and issuing of banknotes, had slowly been given over to the Navy.\n\nTo a certain extent it did make some sense, after all, the Military Yen was a fundamentally international currency and the Navy was among the most suited to movement between the Sphere nations. However one would have thought that the Army would have objected to the sudden concentration of monetary power in the hands of their rival, but there was no indication of any such objections being raised.\n\nBut even with such intense centralization of powers the systems of the Military Yen seemed to be in perpetual disarray. Tracking down any particular set of records had so far proven to be an obnoxiously tedious task, with hardly any paper trail to rely on. As such, in an ironic sort of way, the Investigation had to take an extremely wide look at the general usage of the Military Yen in order to have any hopes of deriving and identifying a particular area that would be relevant to the case."
 japtouchou.93.a: "Keep following the money, I guess."

 japtouchou.94.d: "Each of the Imperial military branches had developed in such a way that they were effectively split in two along an administrative-operational divide. The administrative side of each branch was handled by their respective Ministry, which also served to officially manage the branches' political affairs and representation in the Imperial Cabinet. For operational affairs, each branch had a General Staff Office, responsible for the planning and execution of military plans required for national defense as well as most matters related to intelligence and supply chains.\n\nBut in both cases, neither of the two halves were so willing to surrender all their influence for the sake of avoiding redundancy. Particularly in the Imperial Navy, the General Staff Offices still held a good deal of political sway which they effectively used as clubs to knock aside any opposition, while the Ministries were sure to keep and cultivate intelligence webs that rivaled their official counterparts.\n\nBut in the circumstances of this particular case, the areas of suspicious were not where the two halves of the Navy drifted apart and quarreled, but where they came together and agreed. It was the joint opinion of the two detectives that if the murder and associated conspiratorial elements were stemming from some disunity, there would have been some associated fanfare. The silent conduct of the suspected parties only betrayed their real motivations. They were hiding something."
 japtouchou.94.a: "But what?"
 japtouchou.95.t: "Two Hunches and a Gut Feeling"
 japtouchou.95.d: "While the Investigation now understood that the primary administrative authority over affairs concerning the Military Yen had been handed over to the Imperial Navy in general, what was not clear was how this authority was actually bureaucratically administered. Now officially, the Navy Ministry and General Staff Office were the 'two faces of the same mind', but in reality there existed a considerable degree of separation between them, sometimes even resulting in internal tensions. Clearly the Ministry was involved with representing the management of the Military Yen in the political realm, but what was the IJN-GSO's role?\n\nThe Investigation did have some vague understand of some of the Staff Office's responsibilities based on their prior inquiries. It was clear that they were involved with the physical movement of the Military banknotes for one thing, likely for security reasons. This in turn suggested that they also must have some form of banknote records for the purposes of redundancy and security checks.\n\nOf these two supposed responsibilities, the latter appeared to be more informationally relevant to the lead detectives. But they were still faced with a simple, yet formidable obstacle, they did not actually know where such files were kept. Previous failed inquiries combined with restrictive measures enacted by the various offices had failed to provide an obvious path to accessing those records. If the Investigation was to succeed in this lead, they would first need to get past square one."
 japtouchou.95.a: "Find me those files!"
 japtouchou.96.t: "Peacetime Preoccupations"
 japtouchou.96.d: "By reviewing a combination of public resolutions and documents from the Imperial Diet, as well as some low level materials from the Imperial General Headquarters, the two detectives were able to assemble a rough outline of the shipping scheme between the two branches of the Imperial Military. It seemed that since the end of the War, each branch had needed to find a new outlet to commit their energies and resources to. For the Army, this had been consolidating the Japanese grip on the various nations of Eastern Asia. In some cases, this meant deploying troops and building bases in the various hostile environments of South East Asia, and in others it meant providing advisors and other support for the various friendly regimes of the Sphere.\n\nBut that Navy did not have the luxury of such obviously defined goals. For so long their primary objective had been to build up their strength until they could match and overcome that of the Allied fleets. But when that once-impossible goal and been achieved, the Navy was found struggling for purpose in their now uncontested rule of the Eastern seas. This uncertainty was the foundations of what would become the Imperial Navy's shipping program. The Army's continual need for supplies served as a means for the Navy to bolster the size of their fleet as well as hold additional sway over the affairs of the Japanese merchant marine.\n\nBut the Navy's scheme did not end with military affairs, in recent years they had been granted charters and administrative rights over a range of commercial shipping and supplying areas. While technically removed from the shipping concerns of the Army, it did encompass a large amount of the Navy's attention, and very well could still be related in some way."
 japtouchou.96.a: "The military shipping."
 japtouchou.96.b: "The civilian shipping."
 japtouchou.97.t: "Where the Blame Falls"
 japtouchou.97.d: "Further scrutiny into the material nature of the Navy's shipping relationship with the Army eventually did produce results. The Army's ongoing goals of consolidating military power and suppressing nationalist resistance required a constant reserve of combat-ready troops. For the sake of administrative convenience, these generally consisted of a mix of Japanese consucripts, volunteers from other Sphere nations, and 'volunteers' from other Sphere nations. To further simplify the process, fresh recruits would receive a cursory round of initial training before being shipped off to their deployment locations where it would be completed in a more intense second round.\n\nAs such, the Army required a steady supply of munitions and equipment to sufficiently train their divisions, as well as a means to remove the remains of expended equipment to keep their storage facilities clean. This is where the Navy came in. The facilitated both those roles to meet the needs of the Army, the only price they asked in return was funding for additional ships as well as some administrative authority over the processes.\n\nThis could provide a likely way by which Takahara Ryo could have smuggled the explosives he planted in Yoshikage's corpse without attracting the attention of his immediate superiors. If the explosives had been smuggled out due to some bureaucratic oversight or malicious intent, the fault landed within the Navy's shipping records."
 japtouchou.97.a: "Now the hunt really begins."
 japtouchou.98.t: "Growing Ever Fonder"
 japtouchou.98.d: "As expected, the public facing reports of the Minezaka Conglomerate and administrative elements of the Navy provided some insight to their relationship. Over the course of the past ten years or so, the Navy had signed a number of contracts with the Conglomerate of varying natures. The initial ones were ostensibly simple purchases, including things from food rations to industrial maintenance supplies. The only thing slightly unusual was that the contracts indicated that the Navy would be responsible for nearly all aspects of shipping related to these agreements without any indication of a corresponding price adjustment.\n\nThe more recent contracts involved much more complex and long term agreements. This included things from multi-year perpetual purchasing commitments to usage of certain facilities by the other party. Even more surprising was that on a few occasions the Conglomerate had signed a contract with a third party organization, but the Navy still agreed to ship their wares for them at a comparatively competitive rate even though they had no obvious vested interest. Of course these deals were less proudly displayed by the two organizations and most information about them came from obscure areas of public record.\n\nFor the perspective of the two lead detectives, they had two viable angles of investigation. One option was to go after the shipping records associated with the contracts to ensure the real deals matched up with the paper agreements. Or otherwise they could use these contracts as a rough guide to estimating the Minezaka Conglomerate's international profits and assets."
 japtouchou.98.a: "The shipping records."
 japtouchou.98.b: "The Minezaka profits."
 japtouchou.99.t: "The Derelict Currency"
 japtouchou.99.d: "A closer look at the Navy's involvement in intra-Sphere industrial shipping reveal a number of trends. First and foremost, was the persistent contact between them and the Minezaka Conglomerate. Though the Departments of the Navy Ministry did make deals and collaborate with many of companies and conglomerates of Japan, none were so specifically and consistently tied to shipping. This was further amplified by another trend, the recurring usage of Military Yen in the payment of these industrial contracts, most consistently in the fulfillment of contracts with the Minezaka Conglomerate, to be precise.\n\nThis had not been immediately apparent to the Investigation, it was first noticed by Detective Tachi when he had difficulty tracking down the associated payments in the Navy's public budget records. After further scrutiny he found that the records were part of the Military Yen departments, as the transaction files were always stored with those associated with the currency they were fulfilled with.\n\nBut this begged the obvious question as to why the Minezaka Conglomerate would ever accept such a form of payment, let alone request it. From all outside perspectives, the Military Yen was a derelict currency, poorly administered and of questionable value outside specific geographic regions. What value could such a currency hold to a powerful financial group in one of the strongest nations on Earth?"
 japtouchou.99.a: "There has to be more to it."
 japtouchou.100.t: "The Unofficial Merchant Marine"
 japtouchou.100.d: "To tackle the task of locating the point of collaboration between the two halves of the Navy, as well as its purpose and potentially associated criminal motivations, the two lead detectives made a brief return to their initial strategy. Accompanied by a small group of hand-picked officers, Kodaira would examine the ongoing projects, directives, and expenses of the Navy's General Staff Office, while Tachi would do the same for the Navy Ministry. Then, they would compare the results of their parallel inquiries and attempt to find where they aligned in a noteworthy manner.\n\nSure enough, they were able to find their overlap. In recent years both halves of the Naval bureaucracy had enacted a number of programs concerned with promoting intra-Sphere commercial shipping and bringing the Navy's oversight closer to the shipping systems that already exist. This included offering a number of lucrative contracts to various companies as well as providing easy means of commercial transport, such as cargo ships and planes. In a sense, through the combined efforts of the two Navy offices, they had managed to cultivate an unofficial Merchant Marine almost entirely under the watchful eye of Naval administration.\n\nThis strict subordinate nature of the system combined with the apparent tendency to use the Military Yen and other roundabout means of payment made it difficult to get a decent estimate of the size of the shipping racket they ran. There were two ways the Investigation could go about this, they could try to get a sense of the revenue streams of the Navy's shipping, or they could try and get a sense of their market strategy and reverse engineer it from that."
 japtouchou.100.a: "The revenue."
 japtouchou.100.b: "The goods and services."
 japtouchou.101.t: "The Only Thing Worse Than Silence"
 japtouchou.101.d: "The two head detectives of the Investigation did get their answer from the Navy General Staff Office about the whereabouts of the Military Yen banknote files. But the answer they received was more troublesome than the question it was intended to answer. It was the kind of answer that men like Kodaira and Tachi couldn't just respond to, because it resonated with an almost existential worry. It was the kind of answer one whispered into half empty beer glasses, or while turning a carton of cigarettes to ash.\n\nThe answer was that there basically were no files. At first the representative who spoke to the two detectives over the phone sounded sheepish, like he was being forced to cover for some mistake. But as the call went on, it became clear that the representative's meekness was him attempting to be polite while correcting what he perceived to be an obvious misunderstanding on the part of the detectives.\n\nAccording to the Staff Office, the files they were asking for really only every temporarily existed at best, or existed only in theory at worst. Furthermore, they claimed that the real purpose of the Military Yen was to 'facilitate regional military-industrial development' and that expecting it to have all the records and controls associated with a 'proper currency' was expecting too much out of the military currency entirely. This was essentially an echo of similar sentiments that the officers and detectives of the Investigation had received earlier, that they were dealing with a relic of Japanese administration, a forgotten footnote of financial policy. But if it really were so irrelevant, why did it seem to be packed into every layer of this case?"
 japtouchou.101.a: "I can't accept that, I won't."
 japtouchou.102.t: "The Hammer Begins to Fall"
 japtouchou.102.d: "After an initial foray into the process of securing the shipping records they needed, the Investigation's lead detectives concluded that it would be a much more involved process than it appears from the outset. It seemed that a lot of the information restrictions on shipping schedules and details that were put into place during wartime still lingered to some degree. One could not simply walk up to the nearest Port Authority and expect to be granted access, you needed to have some overarching reason and a good sense of the relevant records.\n\nThe Investigation's case further complicated the issue because of the nature of the shipping they were investigating. It existed in a grey area between private-industrial and public-military shipping. As such, some aspects of the records were under the jurisdiction of civil organizations, granting access to some information, while the only complete inventory of the relevant ships may lie under military authority.\n\nIn order to resolve this, Kodaira and Tachi would need to construct a watertight and convincing narrative to gain persistent, unfettered access to the necessary files. To achieve that there was only cover that would carry enough force behind it to push past any opposition, a general administrative audit of the international shipping authorities. And with just a single call to their contacts in the Board of Audit, the process began."
 japtouchou.102.a: "Here we go."
 japtouchou.103.t: "The Emergency Audit"
 japtouchou.103.d: "Without the benefit of one central office or authority to look towards in order to gather information about the financials of the Naval-Industrial shipping scheme, Detectives Tachi and Kodaira were forced to do it by hand, in a way. They would have to start by selecting a particular contract between the Navy and an industrial conglomerate, usually Minezaka, and making note of its agreed payment and signed date.\n\nThen the Detectives had to corroborate this information with two additional sources. First, was the expenditures of the Navy, which was fairly easy to track give its semi-public nature. Second was the finances of the Minezaka conglomerate, which had to be derived from the organizations profit reports and traceable tax forms. And finally, after hours upon hours of the intellectually painful process of comparing, recording, and re-comparing various financial figures, they made a breakthrough.\n\nThe financial records of the two groups, the Navy and the conglomerate, simply did not match up. The profit reports posted by Minezaka from fulfillment of contracts totaled much higher than they should have been based on the contract reports. And oftentimes the real amount of Yen spent by the Navy was less than the amount they should have. It was obvious that some form of financial tampering was occuring, likely with the assistance of the Military Yen, but without coherent records it would be impossible to locate, let alone prove. There was only one, drastic action that might get them access to the evidence they needed, an unannounced wave of Imperial Audits."
 japtouchou.103.a: "Now we're bringing out the big guns."
 japtouchou.104.t: "The Liaison"
 japtouchou.104.d: "With the detectives' leads quickly beginning to run short, more decisive, stronger actions became more and more appealing. The implicitly shadowy nature of the Imperial Navy's involvement with financial conglomerates in international commercial interests made it extremely difficult for the Investigation to track down relevant information. Beyond that, given the number of different sub-companies and proxy deals the Navy dealt with, it was almost impossible to direct their focus at one particular office for maximized results. Almost.\n\nIn their inquiries, the detectives stumbled upon an obscure organization, whose name appeared in hardly any documents from the Imperial Cabinet. During the war an administrative structure was created to coordinate operations between the civilian government and military bureaucracies, the Imperial General Headquarters-Government Liaison Conference. At the time, this had granted some degree of administrative control over commercial and industrial shipping movements. After the war it seemed the Navy had particularly enjoyed this newfound power, and so successfully lobbied for the creation of a similar body, the Imperial General Headquarters-Industrial Interests Liaison Conference.\n\nThis body, staffed by key officers from both branches of the military and representatives from approved financial conglomerates, was ostensibly in charge of reviewing and handling the processes related to military contracts. Apparently, they were responsible for overseeing the financial logistics as well as ensuring security and legal directives were adhered to. If there was ever a department of state to hit with a general administrative audit, it was this one."
 japtouchou.104.a: "But it's gonna have to be a big one."
 japtouchou.105.t: "The Port Authorities"
 japtouchou.105.d: "The shipping industry of the Japanese Empire was massive to say the least. Even if one considered only the trade that occurred within the Japanese Dominated Co-Prosperity Sphere, it still rivaled that of its geopolitical rivals. But in the case of the Investigation, the success of Japanese international shipping, now know to be under the watchful guidance of the Imperial Navy, proved to be a serious problem.\n\nGiven the international nature of the case, the whole list of shipping files that could potentially be relevant were spread across a number of offices underneath a number of different authorities. But most glaring was the divide in the Port Authorities between the domestic ports on mainland Japan, and the international 'colonial' ports spread around the Sphere nations. Each contained such a vast internal administration that the Investigation was forced to focus on just one if they were to have any hope of making progress at all.\n\nEach posed their own challenges. The Domestic Port Authority was likely to have more robust and multi-layered bureaucracy than the Sphere Port Authorities. But, in turn, the Colonial Ports were more likely to be under the direct sway of the Navy's influence, who would be more proactive in defending their information."
 japtouchou.105.a: "The domestic ports."
 japtouchou.105.b: "The Sphere ports."
 japtouchou.106.t: "Aligning the Audit"
 japtouchou.106.d: "While the cover of a general administrative audit would provide the Investigation some leeway in conducting their searches, there were still some challenges. Given the degree to which the area of shipping they were concerned with was so fundamentally tied with Navy, they would likely still be subjected to some of the pushback and bureaucratic obfuscation that they received from the military branches prior to this.\n\nThis was further complicated by the fact that the Navy's shipping scheme existed in a grey area outside normal administrative authority. Rather than be directly created and maintained by a single office, the desired effect of the program was produced by coordinated initiatives carried out by a group of Naval and Financial organizations. And while an administrative audit may be a powerful tool, it was not a free pass to all areas of the Empire, if they wanted to be effective, they would have to first be selective.\n\nTo that end they were presented with a choice of orientations to start their audit out with. The could focus their efforts on the Colonial Ports spread throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and attempt to take advantage of any regional autonomy that existed. Or they could eschew the subtlety and directly hit the departments of the Navy directly responsible for managing their part of the shipping program."
 japtouchou.106.a: "The Sphere ports."
 japtouchou.106.b: "The Navy's Shipping Departments."
 japtouchou.107.t: "Sanctity in Obscurity"
 japtouchou.107.d: "The obscure nature of the Imperial General Headquarters-Industrial Interests Liaison Conference made it somewhat difficult to get a proper grasp of them in order to conduct a proper audit. As the rather inconvenient name implied, it was less an organization in its own right and more an administrative overlap between two prior-existing organizations. The roles and function of the Imperial General Headquarters were well known to the Investigation's staff. It was the body responsible for coordinating policy and operations between the two branches of the military, and was directed by the Offices of the Emperor himself.\n\nThe 'Industrial Interests Liaison' was a different story however. It was a loose council of industrial and financial representatives and experts that seemed to have been formed specifically to be a part of the Conference organization. The actual members of the Liaison however, had to be approved by the Imperial General Headquarters before the Conference could convene. But in many cases 'approved' could be substituted with 'selected' without much loss of accuracy when dealing with the IGH, leaving the detectives to question the Liaison's real independence.\n\nEither side of the Conference was considered to be a viable path to investigate, however each came with their own challenges. For one, they could focus on the Military's side of the conference, mostly concerned with the logistics of international shipping. Alternatively, they could turn to the Industrial Liaison, who were likely to be the dominant party in financial negotiations, and examine the actual contracts that had been agreed upon."
 japtouchou.107.a: "The naval shipping."
 japtouchou.107.b: "The industrial contracts."
 japtouchou.108.t: "The Customs House of Yokohama"
 japtouchou.108.d: "The administrative command over the Port Authority that regulated the ports of mainland Japan rested primarily with the Bureau of Customs, itself a department within the Ministry of Finance. However in recent years, some power had become regionalized, with local government offices having some sway in customs management. This was especially true of the authorities close to one of the large customs houses in Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka, Nagasaki, Moji, Nagoya and Hakodate. Originally these were intended to be under the direct administration of the Ministry of Finance, but by the time the Japanese trade stranglehold over Eastern Asia reached its peak, they had become powerful semi-autonomous entities in their own right.\n\nThese customs houses seemed like strong candidates for fruitful audits, it was just a matter of picking which one to target specifically. The two lead detectives clashed initially over what their standard for choosing should be, either absolute political strength or closest direct association with the case. Eventually, they settled on the customs house in Yokohama, given its relative proximity to Tokyo as well as it being the presumed office which handled the imports and exports of the plant where the original murder had taken place.\n\nSo, with the backing of the Imperial Board of Audit, the detectives of the Investigation drafted the necessary paperwork and prepped their teams for this new push. If all went to plan, they could be in and out in less than a week, if it all went wrong, they could be stuck there for a month."
 japtouchou.108.a: "Quick and clean, people."
 japtouchou.109.t: "The Best Motivator"
 japtouchou.109.d: "Fortunately for the Investigation, the regional Port Authorities lived in perpetual fear of their superordinates on the Japanese mainland. So when two detectives from a top-level investigative unit based out of Tokyo reached out to them, most compiled without too much effort our of fear of rapprochement from their superiors for non-cooperation with the Investigation, not realizing it was their superiors themselves who were under investigation in many cases.\n\nAs suspected, the foreign ports that had fallen under direct Japanese administration, specifically through the Navy in more recent times, were jumbles of military and civil bureaucracy. There was a two way effect from this, most obvious was that with the presence of military equipment came heightened security, which was also partial applied to non-military products that passed through the ports. But in the reverse direction, some of the standard, organizational methods, and transport routines associated with the profit-driven efficiency of private industry had bled into the Navy's conduct towards their military equipment.\n\nWhile this jumble was certainly confusing and proved difficult to parse, the sheer presence of the confusion was somewhat indicative of in itself. The Navy's interests had clearly become deeply intertwined with those of private industry on a very practical, material level, not just in rhetoric and disposition as had been previously suspected. And of course, wherever military and commercial interest met, there was always prime ground for corruption."
 japtouchou.109.a: "I prefer respected, but I'll settle for feared."
 japtouchou.110.t: "The Navy's Cargo"
 japtouchou.110.d: "Directly requesting the various bureaucracies of the Navy what was being shipped on routine transportation seemed the best approach. With the Navy left suspicious of any meddling in their affair because of the investigation, asking for relatively innocuous documents was how the investigation would progress.\n\nA few rookies were brought from the provinces to work on assessing the mountains of documents coming every day to the station. The country boys were happy to be working on something of importance for once. Left unsaid by Kodaira and Tachi was that getting people from outside Tokyo was the best way to get politically neutral reinforcement. If the Navy got wind of the true purpose of the audit, an abnormaly large pile of documents might end at the bottom ot Tokyo Bay.\n\nLittle by little the Navy's empire of shipping lanes was carefully being brought to light. Various naval groups moonlighting as escorts for civilian ships, IJN supply vessels tacking on extra goods to their holds on long trip across the Pacific. Former IJN personnel using their experience to launch new shipping companies to work on connecting every corner of the Sphere. All of this was well documented, well approved and very legal. But innocuous looking business can something be fronts for far sinister things."
 japtouchou.110.a: "A few patterns are emerging..."
 japtouchou.111.t: "Hidden in Plain Sight"
 japtouchou.111.d: "Every year the brave men that fought to defend Japan needed a vast array of supplies. It wasn't much of a surprise then, that a vast array of companies were needed to supply the soldiers both in Japan and abroad.\n\nThe 'Industrial Interests Liaison' supposedly serves as an independent arbiter of this process, overseeing contracts and the money behind them. While in practice the IIL appears to be a mere proxy of Army and Navy interests, its diligent book keeping might be of great use to the investigation.\n\nThe police department was not surprised to see that the organisation's diligence in record keeping did not extend to diligence in cooperating with the police. Rumours of the investigation might have reached the men of the Liaison office. Or perhaps the usual contempt for civilian administration delayed the transfer of documents.\n\nThe reason for the military men's grouchy behavior quickly became apparent when the team began sifting through the documents. The surprising scale of military yen use in supplying and shipping contracts rapidly came to light. In some months, three to five percent of procurement contracts used it. In shipping contracts the proportion reached twenty percent in some time periods.\n\nWhile the currency was legal tender and the Army was perfectly in its right to use it, it was truly bizarre to see that much military money sloshing around bank accounts on the Home Islands. It certainly complicated the payment of contracts, as conversion offices became essential. To the audit team's growing unease, a specific office treated almost all of the conversion to regular money."
 japtouchou.111.a: "A popular office?"
 japtouchou.112.t: "The Ship With No Name"
 japtouchou.112.d: "For what seemed like the first in a long, long time, the Investigation seemed to have a stroke of luck. The representatives of the Yokohama Customs House had initially grumbled when faced with the demands of the Audit team. But after some honeyed words and careful reassurances, they were mostly willing to comply, at least to a degree that Kodaira deemed to be acceptable. Since then, everything had been going mostly to plan, allowing the Investigation and audit teams to speed along in their work.\n\nThe underlying difficulty of the task lay in its size and ever shifting nature. Fortunately, while much of the shipping that the team was specifically concerned with was involved with the Navy, and indeed involved many of their ships, the leadership of the Customs House clearly had no intention of surrendering all control over the associated records. And so, their de-facto administrative monopoly had won them a copy of the files, which suited the Investigation just fine.\n\nFurther difficulty came from the constant movement of Naval shipping vessels between types of assignment. One ship based from a single port could have commercial assignments for half a month, and then suddenly switch to military transport for the rest of the month. But there was one ship that stood out for precisely the opposite reason. It was a ship with only a number, no proper name. And it left from the same port on every single journey, and travelled to the same destination every single journey, a little known Army base near the Manchurian-Korea border."
 japtouchou.112.a: "What's so special about there?"
 japtouchou.113.t: "Madness to the Method"
 japtouchou.113.d: "As it would turn out, the jumble of civil and military bureaucracy within the Sphere ports caused a sense of confusion that permeated far deeper into the organizations than appeared at first glance. The two lead detectives and their teams struggled to make sense of the records they were provided. It was not the case that they were illegible or impossible to parse, it was more that it was impossible to assemble any sense of consistency or derive any pattern from the sum total of the records.\n\nThis was doubly concerning given the nature of the organization that stood above it. The Imperial Navy, while renowned for its power and influence, was not known to be a particularly nimble organization, they were slow to implement policy and slower to modify it. They typically made long term, expansive deals with strict contracts, always careful to avoid surrendering too much ground or providing too much interpretive leeway. But the patterns of shipment and movement, of both civil and military wares, did not remotely resemble an organization of that character.\n\nThe quantities and types of items being moved shifted on a bi-monthly or even weekly bases. Military equipment that was originally bound for one location was later redirected to somewhere else. Ships that traveled along fairly regular routes never carried a consistent amount of wares to their locations. Some officers observed that these fluxuations did somewhat align with those in the corresponding product markets. But in order for the Navy to take advantage of such information they would require facilities and departments committed to analyzing the relevant statistics and producing the reports, far beyond the capabilities of the existing departments. And surely the industrial conglomerates would not surrender the information they used to produce their profit margins?"
 japtouchou.113.a: "Surely."
 japtouchou.114.t: "Random Supply Runs"
 japtouchou.114.d: "All of the dizzying constellation of organisations and groups tied to the Navy in the shipping businesses appeared to be squeaky clean when taken individually. But when examined as a group, weird coincidences began to appear.\n\nThe audit team has built up a dataset of "clean shipping" from the civilian and military world. This data gives the estimated flow of supply to civilian factories, mining operations, forward military and naval bases across the sphere. The Navy shipping lanes are now being compared one by one to our collection of 'ordinary' supply runs. Any shipping lane that over delivers supplies, or under delivers, or sees increased traffic can now be picked out from the sea of data.\n\nAlready a set of troubling statistical anomalies has begun cropping up. Some areas are served by three or four different Navy organisations, running round the clock shipping operations. It makes little sense to have so many different group working the same area, especially if the Navy does shipping for commercial reasons.\n\nAnother problem is that many places with great demand for shipping present little to no civilian activity. Again, the Navy wouldn't waste fuel and ships of its commercial fleet just to resupply its own outposts when it already commands a sizeable logistic fleet. The only other potential customers would either be local governments of the Sphere, or military bases. The Navy is known to sometimes dip into its commercial fleet to ressuply the Army, but such a level of commercial ships used in military areas is deeply unusual."
 japtouchou.114.a: "Army and Navy, sitting in a tree..."
 japtouchou.115.t: "Preferential Exchange Rates"
 japtouchou.115.d: "Every new actor in this vast web of conspiracy just has to complain and obstruct every step of the way. The Army, the Navy, the seafood plant, the government offices, and now an obscure money changing financial office in the backstreets of Ginza ward.\n\nIt was at least a refreshing change of pace to have some hapless civilians to shout at. Without any Army or Navy protection, the bean counters at the exchange office were obligated to cooperate fully. The detectives bulldozed through delays and attempts at misdirection to gain the full list of military currency conversion for the last few years. The employees were left dazed in the wake of the police investigation as cartloads of precious 'confidential data' was brought off to the police station.\n\nPreliminary reports did not make it clear why this particular currency exchange was favored. The institution was well regarded, but not the best or biggest in town. The investigation team eventually began to look at the timing of the transactions themselves. A few delays in the currency exchange appeared here and there on the military contract list. By comparing them with arcane reports on the official exchange rate of the military yen, it soon became evident that the conversion to regular yen had always been quite advantageous. The few percents of difference that the office had secured when converting the military contract added up to a quite tidy sum for all the Army contractors that agreed to get paid in military money.\n\nEspecially to their shipping partners in the Navy."
 japtouchou.115.a: "Turning military Yen to civilian gold."
 japtouchou.116.t: "Ballast"
 japtouchou.116.d: "If it hadn't been for Detective Kodaira's time in the Navy, the Investigation might have passed over the glaring evidence that was situated in the tangled mess of military-industrial shipping collusion. Throughout the initial foray the Investigation had made two key observations. First and most generally, the shipping systems the various organizations had conspired to create were inconsistent in their conduct and scheduling, resembling market movements more than the pet project of a militarized bureaucracy. Second, and more subtle, was the existence of a single, unnamed ship which consistently traveled to an obscure military installation near the Korean-Manchurian border.\n\nIt was in the records of this ship that Kodaira noticed the first evidence of the fraud, but after recognizing its implications he soon began to check all the other records for similar evidence, which he found in abundance. What gave it away in the end was the ballast. When a cargo ship needed to load or unload substantial amounts of cargo, they would need to make a corresponding ballast adjustment to keep the ship level and its center of gravity low. This was generally done by flooding deciated ballast chambers in the ship with seawater.\n\nBut in the case of the Navy's shipping, on many, many occasions the ballast adjustment did not match the weight of the cargo they said they were on/offloading. Generally, the ballast adjustment was far greater than should have been necessary for the amount of cargo they were said to be carrying, implying that they were actually hauling more than they claimed. But what was even more alarming, was that this occurred on a number of occasions with ships carrying military equipment."
 japtouchou.116.a: "Well... fuck."
 japtouchou.117.t: "The Business Partners"
 japtouchou.117.d: "A conclusion almost too absurd to be true. The Army and Navy, legendary for their intense rivalry both within Japan and without, are secretly business partners.\n\nThis is at least the conclusion our data points to. There is simply too much money floating around these two organizations. Some things remain uncertain, of course. Why would the Navy accept to be paid in piles of military yen that ultimately tie them to their hated rivals? And why would the Army try to dissimulate their widespread use of the Navy's commercial ships?\n\nThe investigation team needed to shift its attention to the Army again. The careful public story it had built was beginning to unravel. Hidden in the chain of military procurement contracts was the strong evidence the investigation needed. But what would be its cost?\n\nAt the end of another long day of work detectives Kodaira and Tachi shared a final cigarette before departing home. It had become something of a ritual for the men to share some quiet time at the end of the day to clear their mind. That evening, however, both men could tell the other remained uneasy. The deeper they and their team descended into the abyss, the more endless it became around them. Both men could only hope that they would live to see light on the other side."
 japtouchou.117.a: "A storm brews on the horizon."
 japtouchou.118.t: "Maritime Reviews"
 japtouchou.118.d: "Nominally, the influence that the Imperial Navy has in our politics is enough to keep us from keeping too close of an eye on them and their affairs, but this issue has gone on long enough. With enough support and evidence on our side, we have secured a warrant to review the cargo manifests. We can now inspect what exactly the Army has been receiving.\n\nThere are, of course, a couple of options as to how we can secure the information we need. Either we can take the safe route, and check the warehouse records and make some inferences from there, or we can take a direct, albeit risky alternative, where we directly seize the boat running the questionable delivery route and interrogate the crew. Which route shall we take?"
 japtouchou.118.a: "Look over the warehouse records."
 japtouchou.118.b: "Stop that ship!"
 japtouchou.119.t: "Outsourced Supply Chains"
 japtouchou.119.d: "It turns out that the Army has been outsourcing their supply chains for quite some time. While this has kept costs from spiraling out of control, it represents an unacceptable breach of security and diversion from protocol. We've captured the worst offenders, and they've given us enough intel that we now have a choice to make.\n\nWe can choose to inspect the supply routes by land, which would involve the private armored car company that has been moving products and payments alike. Alternatively, we can inspect the supply routes by sea, which would require securing a vessel transporting Army goods. Which should we inspect?"
 japtouchou.119.a: "Inspect the sea routes."
 japtouchou.119.b: "Inspect the land routes."
 japtouchou.120.t: "Warehouse Blues"
 japtouchou.120.d: "Tachi is not a terribly taciturn person in public, but the warehouse shocks even him into silence. The nondescript building is staffed by what would appear to be a completely normal bunch of workers of assorted nationality, and the cargo is perfectly visible. The warehouse functions like a perfectly normal warehouse, just like every other one in the Sphere. The only problem is, well, the paperwork.\n\nOf which there is none. The records of the ships which it services are clean; the office to which Kodaira is redirected turns out to be more of an exercise in imagination than an actual corporate structure. The tidal wave of files, folders, and binders which slowly drowns all Japanese offices is simply - not present, not in this case.\n\nTachi is stumped. Kodaira is horrified. The team is shocked into silence. Never, in all their years of life, have they seen such an affront against the ethos of the Japanese company. More importantly, without the accompanying documents as physical proof nothing can be said about the nature of the cargo.\n\nBut after a 20-hour combing of the warehouse, during which several team members collapse, a series of unmarked boxes is found, without even the most basic of identifying marks, invoices or receipts on their body. The way ahead is obvious, if only because there is no other."
 japtouchou.120.a: "We'll trace the damn boxes."
 japtouchou.121.t: "The Boat Raid"
 japtouchou.121.d: "The vessel is easy enough to trace; Kodaira and Tachi have both been involved long enough with it to recognize its markings. What is difficult is concocting a sufficient and viable cause for the raid, especially one done as far away from their jurisdiction as this one.\n\nAfter poring over paperwork (it is, after all, the first step in any Japanese office procedure) a cause is found that does not violate jurisdiction and will not alarm the Navy or Army: food hygiene. The crew of the ship have ample evidence to suggest they are well fed, but what is missing is the requisite cleaning and hygiene material that must accompany food - there is no trace of it in the empty manifests. By Navy and civilian standards this is a violation of regulation, and since the food they eat is traceable to a warehouse near Tokyo it can be claimed that there is due cause.\n\nThe team readies its gear and prepares to strike the ship in dock. Most of the crew will be out on shore leave, and only a skeleton crew, headed by the captain, remains. (Which is suspicious in itself; most captains would happily pass the task to their underlings...) The documents are requisitioned, and a case is drawn up. At the break of dawn the next day they move for the ship."
 japtouchou.121.a: "Maybe we can dig something out of this."
 japtouchou.122.t: "The Armored Car Raid"
 japtouchou.122.d: "The Fujiwara Sokosha Butsuryu Company, as it is known, presents a peculiarity in a sea of peculiarities. Its main office is in the outskirts of Tokyo but its logistics and manufacturing facilities appear to contain far more paperwork than the head office itself; in fact, so much paperwork has accumulated at the isolated facility that the team decide to raid that the office takes several days to unpack and organize. Due to their contacts in the sprawling mess of the military, the workers themselves are left untouched; but as a warning nearly their entire office is cleaned of paperwork with only a perfunctory comment on "bureaucratic standards".\n\nExamination of the paperwork quickly reveals the cause. The product and commerce flows monitored by Fujiwara's main and subsidiary offices appear to be almost entirely separate in volume; just by monitoring the sums of money that are transacted each month, Tachi and Kodaira can tell that something is very, very off in the cash flow statements. The prices offered and paid are simply too high to pay in a sane market, and some of the organisations buying look suspiciously like those owned by Navy veterans. As with so many other organisations involved in the hunt, evidence is spread over a huge scale and so scattered it will take days to reach a tentative conclusion. Efforts to organize the data prove almost entirely futile, as the revenue statements are themselves linked to the diverse sub-offices of the Fujiwara firm and shuffled in ways that would make a professional card player vomit.\n\nHowever, after a member of the team threatens to shoot himself on the spot if the team is not given a break from the number crunch, Kodaira finds the key to this labyrinthine maze of figures. The locations themselves are... exotically arranged. Very exotically arranged."
 japtouchou.122.a: "Go on, I'm listening."
 japtouchou.123.t: "The Trail of Goods"
 japtouchou.123.d: "The boxes, upon examination (and after a prolonged, occasionally physical struggle with the workers handling them), reveal little. The goods within appear to be perfectly normal military surplus, totally in line with IJA guidelines for shipping supplies. When traced, an examination of a random selection leads to a mess of origins from Army storehouses around the Sphere, so confusing Kodaira and Tachi agree not to follow it. (The week-long silence from a frustrated Army Logistics Command did not help matters.)\n\nIn fact, the spread of the surplus goods leads to so messy a web of transactions that it looks like a cover-up. Most boxes of goods will come from a common network, linked by maritime route or geographical proximity. The web of goods of this box does not. It is all perfectly random, no rhyme, no reason. Sure evidence of tampering. But the random nature of the goods is also very much anonymous.\n\nAnd then it hits them; the content of the boxes is totally random, but the box itself is not. All the boxes have the same packaging, and the IJA uses local packaging for its shipping requirements. A common source, in an Army warehouse not too far from the warehouse itself. The team readies its gear. Paperwork is made in huge gluts. This could be the big score."
 japtouchou.123.a: "We must brace ourselves."
 japtouchou.124.t: "The Captain's Log"
 japtouchou.124.d: "The crew are civilian, multinational, and very easily cowed. Tachi tries not to think about the implications of their fear. After all, the Sphere is merciful to its peoples, and so is the Empire. In any case, they are very easily subdued. The one person on board who attempts resistance is the captain; and after a brief scuffle the reason is discovered.\n\nThe captain is uncooperative himself; what is revealing is his quarters. He has a safe in his office; small, black, locked. The appropriate threats of judicial action are used, and the key is requisitioned. And the real itinerary of the ship, the ones containing the anonymous cargo, is found. Of course, withholding inventory manifests from port authorities is not only a serious offence, it is a punishable one by order of the Port Authority, with sanction for an actual legal case conducted all the way in Tokyo. After explaining the technicalities of the situation, the Captain is coerced. Well, he is persuaded. Same difference.\n\nHe points to a nondescript Army warehouse not too far from the harbour itself, and located right on the first stop of the journey, where the boat is scheduled to perform routine resupply and repair work. The team readies its documents; if they are to find anything in this part of the Empire, they will find it there."
 japtouchou.124.a: "That was... surprisingly easy."
 japtouchou.125.t: "The Records and the Backers"
 japtouchou.125.d: "And soon it emerges: the real key to understanding the mess of the paperwork is the locations the equipment is sent to. Oh yes, the locations are very interesting. Because none of them tally with the Army records of the transactions of the Company the team prepares in advance. The web described by the Army follows conventional shipping routes with detours at Shanghai and Saigon, the normal route to take, but the routes of the paperwork bounce back and forth across the Sphere, chaotic, random. It strikes Kodaira that the movement of the routes is almost similar to a deck of cards being shuffled by an old hand, back and forth and back and forth...\n\nUpon closer examination two major patterns can be discerned. Firstly, many of the routes approach warehouses or storage facilities managed by the Army or Navy, most of them marked as surplus storage in military directories. Sparsely guarded and even more sparsely manned, without any value to normal shipping, it appears that these offices serve a disturbing secondary function to the maintenance of the routes.\n\nSecondly, and far more importantly, the routes converge, without fail, on an isolated facility near the harbour; a storage warehouse for the Army. Its manifest is easily accessible after a few phone calls to Army Logistics Command, and appears to be perfectly normal. Suspiciously normal. In fact, the irregularities of the manifest are that none of the usual cock-ups of the military logistics chain are even present.\n\nKodaira and Tachi agree: it must be searched. Whatever they're looking for, it'll be there."
 japtouchou.125.a: "We're closing in."
 japtouchou.126.t: "The Warehouse"
 japtouchou.126.d: "Tachi and Kodaira finally find themselves at the entrance to the warehouse. It had been quite the journey to get here, and Kodaira comments that it likely would not be worth the while, just another dead end or another tiny chain in the endless link. Tachi remains silent and approaches to open the door, only to be stopped by a warehouse worker. He tells them that they are not authorized to enter and that they would best be off leaving. Tachi flashes his credentials, but the worker does not budge. Annoyed, Tachi goes on a long rant until the worker finally gives in nervously and allows the two detectives to pass. Inside, the two are initially rather curious, then confused, then completely shocked.\n\nThe warehouse is completely empty.\n\nThe two detectives both walk around for a moment in stunned silence, looking for anything at all. Weapons, supplies, the kinds of things that they had been tracking to find this place. They find not a single box of shells in the entire building. They immediately begin pulling aside and questioning the truly minute skeleton crew, who dodge every question and refused to give a straight answer to even the most basic queries. Kodaira eventually demands to see actual documents and records, but is still denied. Tachi goes to investigate the office anyways, but finds nothing. Even after prying open locked cabinets, he finds no records and no real documentation at all. Kodaira and Tachi eventually gather what they can and prepare to head back. They have found so much more and so much less than they had hoped at the same time."
 japtouchou.126.a: "Oh my god."
 japtouchou.130.t: "Team Leader"
 japtouchou.130.d: "Everything hinged on this raid. Subsequently, everything hinged on the leader. He wouldn't have a coward at the head of such a monumental event, an event that could change the course of Japan as a nation. He needed someone he could trust, someone who wasn't entangled in the conspiracy. A police officer would not do. They couldn't be trusted with a gun, let alone the most important raid in the history of the east. A soldier was not the one to get it done either. He'd just follow the orders of the state and kill some civilians along the way. It had to be a detective. Kodaira and Tachi jumped out. Tachi was a spritely, naive Osaka transfer. Certainly quick with a handgun and quick with spirit, but he wasn't experienced with commanding groups and not a cynic like every officer in Tokyo. The boy was used to the small-town Yakuza activities in Osaka and didn't have too much dirt on his hands. Most importantly, he's a meticulously careful planner. Nothing will go unthought or unwritten. Certainly a good choice.\n\nOn the other hand was Kodaira. Old, broken. Cynical. The blood on his hands never dried, and his rage against the corruption of the state, the corruption that had killed so many, never ceased. He was a loose cannon, but perhaps exactly what the raid needed was a loose cannon, hardened by the labyrinthian alleys of Tokyo. He didn't break or collapse under anything short of death and knew how to lead a team from years of practice. It was taking a risk in a man who had no reason to trust the state, but perhaps it is worth it in a time like this."
 japtouchou.130.a: "This is Kodaira's time to exact his vengeance."
 japtouchou.130.b: "Tachi is the man for the job." 
 japtouchou.131.t: "Raid Planning: Equipment"
 japtouchou.131.d: "We pray that the bullet will not be used in this raid; ostensibly, it's an information gathering mission. If our raid, a barely condoned secret plan, was to result in the death of an officer or civilian, it would likely mean the end of any real resistance to the conspiracy that has gripped every level of the state. The corruption and the crimes as a result of this corruption would continue unfettered, while law enforcement sits by the wayside. Therefore, death is not an option.\n\nStill, we must bring weapons. If a soldier resists our raid, there is no option but to fire back, if not for our own self-defense. The argument remains as to what weapons to bring; anything too strong will be both cumbersome and conspicuous. Something too small might mean the stopping power won't be able to punch through the plate armor of the soldiers.\n\nA few of the more police-minded, traditional officers suggest simply bringing along standard weapons from the armory like riot shields, pistols, and small submachine guns. These are readily available, and officers are certainly familiar with them. However, they're not designed for use against military units with heavy armor, being used to control civilians and criminals.\n\nA few detectives and specialized officers suggest what they see as an obvious solution; use military-grade weapons against military-grade troops. Semi-automatic rifles are also at the Tokyo armory for use against heavier, well-armed targets. The high caliber would cut through the armor used by soldiers like butter. A couple of issues remain. Bureaucracy would have to wade through to get these weapons, a bureaucracy drowning in corruption. Officers aren't trained in these weapons in the slightest; heavy training will be required, and even with this they won't be as skilled in comparison to earlier weapons."
 japtouchou.131.a: "Sometimes, it's appropriate to fight fire with fire. Bring out the rifles." 
 japtouchou.131.b: "Light weapons are familiar."
 japtouchou.132.t: "The Entry Method"
 japtouchou.132.d: "Plans littered the floor of the complex. The occasional wind would send papers sprawling, and staffers chasing vainly after them, but most of the important information had been taped down and written in scrawling notes curling and dipping around the edges. A backdoor here. A hidden room there. An armory just in the corner, in the range of the alarm system's trigger - and a section of fence where the weeds grew just tall enough to disguise, if necessary, a human-sized object in the foliage.\n\nThe raid took shape, one action at a time, one manoeuvre after another. Tin soldiers were used for planning, Kodaira and Tachi having both worked the men to physical exhaustion by putting them through drills and pushing them to the psychological brink in endless cycles of paperwork. Thankfully enough, only the two of them were needed for the decision confronting them, and in all probability just one of them could have done the job better. Would the raid use a frontal approach in military action or would it attempt to infiltrate from areas of inactivity and low surveillance?\n\nAuxiliary military police forces could handle themselves best in direct conflict situations, and Kodaira recommended a sharp, short entry into the compound. The schedule would be short and the casualties would be limited. Tachi, on the other hand, advised that an indirect approach would allow for the minimisation of casualties and also allow for more accurate on-the-ground actions. Both were variable degrees of suitable, but only one option could be taken."
 japtouchou.132.a: "Bust in and find the goddamn evidence."
 japtouchou.132.b: "Give them a warning, we want the jig to be up."
 japarmyraid.1.t: "Going In"
 japarmyraid.1.d: "The rain fell heavy upon Kodiara, who leaned against the chain fence outside of the decrepit warehouse surrounded by dozens of heavily armed law enforcement officers. The night sky above him was gloomy and dark, and the light of the twinkling stars barely penetrated the thick layer of smog and clouds hanging above them. Light rain fell like a cold mist over his beige trench coat, chilling him with an anxious anticipation.\n\nHe took the last puff of his cigarette and tossed it to the ground, before stamping on it and unholstering his handgun. Yellow streetlights down the dark and twisting alleys around them flickered until the only source of light came from the weak glow behind the cracked glass windows of the warehouse. He nodded to Detective Tachi and the commanding officer to approve of his readiness and cocked his gun; the raid on the compound suspected of holding incriminating evidence in the IJA investigation was within this building, and his team had the responsibility to gather it safely and securely.\n\nWith martial dexterity and organized speed, the officers descended into the building in the cover of the night, armed in dark black uniforms and with weapons to quieten those who dare violate their deadly veil of silence."
 japarmyraid.1.a: "We don't have long. Get it done."
 japarmyraid.2.t: "Looking Around"
 japarmyraid.2.d: "A few moments in, the officers had separated into small teams and were clearing the great warehouse at high speeds. They rushed into rooms, hallways, and cupboards with beaming torches at the end of their rifles to scour the four walls of any ruined facility they could find. Scrounging up evidence behind the trail of law enforcement, Detective Tachi flicked through files and picked up scattered sheets that looked to be somewhat useful to the now potentially deadly investigation.\n\nAlthough he seemed composed and trusting of the officers, he was desperately repressing his fears and unbearable tension - this was the most radical of the IJA they were dealing with; those who did not fear death in the slightest. Twinging and with eyes darting from side to side, Tachi continued to flick through anything of use whilst lagging behind the raiding parties, remaining very aware of his surroundings. He was visibly sweaty, with droplets on his forehead and a dry throat.\n\nMoments later, as he continued to follow the officers like a small and timid child trying to prove his resourcefulness, there was an unusual sound from down a dark and damp hallway. Tachi turned his head in an instant, and a deafening silence followed. The officers lowered their weapons to glance at Detective Kodiara before also gazing down the hallway where the unusual sound originated. A million thoughts gushed through Mr. Tachi's head, and he gulped before reaching for his sidearm."
 japarmyraid.2.a: "Prepare yourselves."
 japarmyraid.3.t: "The Encounter"
 japarmyraid.3.d: "The officers silently marched over to the door where the noise originated from and prepared themselves to forcefully enter and investigate the strange sound, but as they pressed themselves up against the wall, they could begin to hear small chatter. Detective Tachi, who was a small distance behind the officers held his pistol up and ready to shoot, teetering on the edge of panicking as he heard the crackling of fire. The commanding officer nodded at his men and began to count with his fingers in a grim and harrowing silence.\n\nIn a great crash, the officers burst through the door and flooded the room with glaring torches and threatening yells of violence. There was a thick smell of metal and gunpowder, as well as the oily smell of burning papers and plastics. The IJA men in the dim-lit and damp room, caught in the process of incinerating piles of what seemed to be incriminating evidence, instantly darted their heads towards the weak door flying off its hinges and leapt from their seats. With law enforcement charging towards them, they staggered across to the corners of the room to grasp any kind of weapon or sharp object, and as Detective Tachi followed in, he skidded across the floor and frantically dashed to find cover."
 japarmyraid.3.a: "Put your hands where I can see them!"
 japarmyraid.4.t: "Lambs to the Slaughter"
 japarmyraid.4.d: "Charging in with shields, the officers had stormed in at ferocious speed and were now pummeling the men they were clearly searching for. From Detective Kodiara's position, they were now dotted around the ruinous room and attempting to arrest the squirming men. The IJA troops had leapt from their seats and dashed for weapons placed across from them, and the closer the law enforcement officers approached, the IJA criminals scattered between the cover of furniture and debris in the facility. The roars of both parties echoed throughout the hallways of the facility, banging about the unpainted plasterboard walls that were once lined with the heavily armored law enforcement agents. As some of the men unsheathed blades, turning them inwards towards their stomachs as they were cramped behind cover, others hid from law enforcement and pressed the barrel of their pistols into their temples in the brief moments they thought they had left.\n\nA worrisome flush washed over Kodiara; every muscle in his body tensed as he heard the wails of the IJA men from behind cover. However, just before his blood could curdle at the sight of the death of these men, it had become clear that the officers had detained and pinned them to the ground before they could so easily welcome their doom. They let out screams of defeat, muffled under the subduing force of the officers before being thrown about as they were escorted from the dingy location of their plotting.\n\nAs the raid came to an end and the teams shuffled out of the building, Kodiara pulled out another cigarette from his pocket and sighed a large breath of the tobacco-rich gas that danced in the air in front of him. He watched the armored trucks ship what remained of the documented evidence away in the misty rain from under the cover of the tin-metal roof. Tachi leaned against the brick wall behind him, similarly exhausted, and basked in the tired silence they now could share."
 japarmyraid.4.a: "Don't think about it for too long."
 japarmyraid.5.t: "A Lead Secured"
 japarmyraid.5.d: "Detective Tachi sat in at his cheap desk, smoking a cigarette and taking a moment to relax. His body had not quite rested since the intense paranoia and his mind was still running circles around the memories of his frightening experiences in that room. After a deep breath, he sat forward in his chair and began to sift through the documents retrieved in the raid and now spread out across his desk.\n\nSpending hours analyzing printed information on the documents, Tachi had removed his tie and unbuttoned his shirt to cool down his hot and bothered chest, frustrated with the piles of useless numbers and statistics he had to search through to find diamonds in the rough. His mouth was dry from a lack of sleep, and the ring of tinnitus was mind-numbingly foul. However, as the sun began to rise in the morning, Tachi had a moment of realization.\n\nHe scribbled down some notes in a frantic haze, dashing the pen across the empty room once he was finished writing, and darted to collect a handful of relevant papers and his trench coat. Just as the his colleagues were arriving for their shift in the morning, he pranced out of the building and to the legal offices that were managing the case; he had scrounged up the required evidence to incriminate the plotting corruption in the ranks of the IJA."
 japarmyraid.5.a: "Eureka!"
 japarmyraid.6.t: "The Panic"
 japarmyraid.6.d: "It happened almost in slow motion for Detective Kodiara as he dashed into the room the police were raiding. He had skidded on a gasoline spillage on the wet floor, and he was able to survey the room for a slight moment. For a second, their eyes were wide and their bodies sprung into action; like animals in the wild, their reflexes kicked in to save them from their bludgeoning. After that instant, however, a great blaze erupted from the far corner of the room as one of the men kicked over the burning fuel used to incinerate documents, destroying much of the evidence in a hellish inferno.\n\nMr. Kodiara was thrown back by the small blast, and as he gathered his senses among the shouts and cries of the law enforcement agents scuffling around the room, his attention returned to the now armed criminals. They had scurried behind old tattered furniture and debris with handguns and knives, but as Kodiara reached for his pistol he realized what they had planned and he let out a great yell.\n\n"DON'T SHOOT, THEY'RE NOT OUT TO KILL-"\n\nLaw enforcement officers charged past Detective Kodiara with brute force to subdue the men, throwing him to the ground by the stacks of dilapidated furniture. His view was blurry and waning; he was nauseous and dizzy, barely able to make sense of the chaos unfolding around him. He crawled to find cover and could barely breathe, until his vision locked with the lifeless eyes of the IJA troop he had been looking for. A short blade protruded from his stomach; the troop had committed suicide before he could be captured by law enforcement, and he died with the last remaining evidence that could be salvaged from the disaster. Blood trickling through the old wooden floorboards towards Kodiara, he remained still on the ground, dazed and shocked; the other men had died too, taking their lives in similar ways before they could be arrested."
 japarmyraid.6.a: "Now, the damning silence."
 japarmyraid.7.t: "Day of Blood"
 japarmyraid.7.d: "The blood-curdling yell of a brave death echoed throughout the warehouse, and then a deep silence fell over the numbingly-alert officers. Detective Tashi gulped; his hands quivered with his pistol shaking about between his fingers as he looked over the bloody conundrum of suicides sprawled across the dark wooden floor. Kodiara climbed up to a stable stance, and his wide eyes scoured the room of the terrific mess of bodies the officers gazed at. No one dared to speak, not even to issue a command to wrap up their operations.\n\nThe sound of crackling fire was broken up by the sudden coughs of Mr. Kodiara, who approached Tashi from behind and patted him on the back as his eyes were fixated on the ghastly horror of their failure. The officers had already left the room, but Tashi's shock had captured him in an immovable and awesome stance. He rubbed his tired eyes and darted his vision towards Kodiara, who nodded and sighed, signalling for them both to leave the room and escape the sight of the grisly remains.\n\nSome time had passed since the final incident, and Kodiara had reached to light another cigarette in the fresh air. Offering Tashi one, he sighed and puffed out a great breath of tobacco-rich smoke, bringing him a slight relief from the bitter awe of their failed incursion. With most of the evidence gone, and the criminals dead, Kodiara stared aimlessly with defeat into the misty rain that glittered in the night sky. He looked back to Tashi, who leaned against the brick wall with wide eyes and was biting his lip; Kodiara scoffed, and took another breath of his cigarette before returning his vision to the thick clouds that lined the sky."
 japarmyraid.7.a: "It's a terrible day for rain."
 japnavyraid.1.t: "A Buzzing Prelude"
 japnavyraid.1.d: "It was nighttime in the particularly quiet parts of Tokyo. The sun had set, and the cover of night ruled over the rumbling city's buzzes and wails in the distance. For once, Kodiara and Tachi could find a peace away from the trauma of such blasting noise, but they were not spared from the baking heat in the dusk's darkness. A riot of temperatures had thickened the air, prickling their skin from under their sweaty white collars and trench coats.\n\nKodiara took a puff of his cigarette, before slinging it down by his side as he gazed over the distant urban center they now overlooked from just outside the warehouse. He could not take his eyes away from the dazzling white lights that flickered so far away as if they were stars twinkling in the city he grew up in. He took another puff of his cigarette and let out a deep breath.\n\n"Kodiara. Surely it's too hot for a cigarette now, even at this hour?"\n\nTachi chuckled after he broke the glistening silence, but Kodiara did not respond. Instead, he turned his head and put out the smoke by stamping it into the ground. As law enforcement signaled that the raid in search of the rogue IJN trail was about to commence, he reached for his handgun and held it by his side. Tachi, now with his smirk firmly wiped from his face, followed suit and tailed the detective. The itching air pressed against their skin, growing hotter as they approached the warehouse, and Kodiara let out a groan of impatience before taking another breath - anticipating a great deal of trial to follow him into the gloomy complex."
 japnavyraid.1.a: "All's well that ends well, I hope."
 japnavyraid.2.t: "The Tense Crux"
 japnavyraid.2.d: "Kodaira and Tachi entered the building, guns raised, and were greeted by nothing but deathly silence. Flickering bulbs swung overhead, casting dim lighting onto the concrete flooring, tall walls of stacked crates filled the warehouse, and soon, the patter of rain on the roof filled the silence the complex had offered them.\n\n"Find anything? Got nothing on my side." radioed Kodiara to Tachi, the soft static reverberating off the walls.\n\n"No, I haven't found anything yet either." replied Tachi, shining his flashlight on a desk he had stumbled upon, finding nothing but some pen and paper.\n\n"Damn." remarked Kodaira. "These guys really cleared everything out. Bastards must've taken it all and left." he said, perusing through the filing cabinets without success. "Wait, Tachi, come here. I found something."\n\nKodaira and Tachi now were staring at a rusted metal door, its window blocked off by wooden planks. Kodaira found its knob unwilling to budge.\n\n"Let me handle this." stated Tachi. A simple kick sent the door flying sideways. Funneling in, the team found themselves in a dark hallway, its air moisty as the floor riddled damp with puddles, as its stench was foul like rotting waste. Then a noise, like rats scampering.\n\nSomething wasn't right.\n\nSomething definitely wasn't right."
 japnavyraid.2.a: "Quiet, they're here."
 japnavyraid.3.t: "Silence Chews the Vigilant"
 japnavyraid.3.d: "The prickle of anticipation shuddered down Kodiara's spine; he was begrudgingly certain that where that small chattering scratch came from was exactly what they had been looking for. He took a deep breath, and reached to his back pocket for another cigarette to ease his blistering mental tension.\n\nThe dark and creaking corridor the team had stuffed themselves in had an air thick with fear, choking their every breath. Tachi made eye contact with Kodiara from behind the group of law enforcement officers; his eyes were jittery and dashing across the room in an intense dread. Kodiara clenched his jaw and pressed his feet into the ground to conceal his own anxieties from his colleagues.\n\nIn the room adjacent to theirs, a small flicker of a flame and low levels of muttering could be heard by the silently attentive team. Whilst law enforcement listened in, Kodiara rested his eyelids and braced himself for the inevitable violence to come. Tachi looked over to him for affirmation, who stood by the shattered window and the peeling wallpaper, before nodding with pursed lips and a sweaty brow. Their lack of words was unsettling, but their body language spoke volumes of the foreboding raid to come.\n\nOn the count of three, the agents broke down the door and wailed arrest orders to the naval officers incriminated in the month-long investigations. Innumerable hours of research, scouring, and chasing dead leads had led the team to this very moment; Kodiara let out another deep sigh before he too charged into the dank retreat."
 japnavyraid.3.a: "Brace yourselves!"
 japnavyraid.4.t: "In the Nick of Time"
 japnavyraid.4.d: "In the blurred moments Kodiara could make out after law enforcement had charged in, the officers implicated for their crimes had been subdued and constrained on the floor and against the walls of the decrepit hideout. He lowered his handgun as an intense brush of relief washed over him, followed by the unbinding of pressure that had coiled around his old heart.\n\nThe putrid smell of soft, moulded-over wallpaper and furniture had swamped the room in a disguising stench, but at least the criminals had been arrested, Kodiara thought to himself. He coughed up a brief chuckle as he walked through the room, until his eyes passed over the two dead officers shot by law enforcement in their resistance to arrest. Their lifeless eyes had rolled back, leaving a glossy-white hue that reflected the dim and flickering flame from the makeshift incinerator a few steps away. Kodiara scoffed, signalling for some help in clearing up the mess.\n\nTachi scrambled past the raiding team to peer down the rusted barrel housing the flame; it had already burned many of the documents that the naval officers wanted to get rid of. Tachi choked on his breath, exclaiming "Sir... I think they were trying to cover their tracks before they knew we'd get here," before stepping over to flick through the preserved files left untouched. Kodiara chuckled to himself, turning his eyes back to the subdued officers with a wise and dismissive glare:\n\n"We've got you now, you sly bastards. We have everything we need to have you locked up forever, or worse...""
 japnavyraid.4.a: "All in a day's work."
 japnavyraid.5.t: "A Crackle in the Skull"
 japnavyraid.5.d: "With the burst of gunfire, small fragments of metal shot across the room in a deadly display of lights that seized the attention of Tachi's eyes. He darted his head downwards and raised his arms in a frustrated haze, shaken by the sudden spurt of metal and gunpowder. The echoes and crackles of the bullets bounced about the room, and in his skull over and over, hammering and grinding at the back of his eyes in a painful awe. Thrown to the ground, Tachi's mouth ran dry as he tried to return his vision to the darkened room around him and make sense of the violent chaos unfurling around him.\n\nThe clatter of metal on metal ached throughout the room, and the wails of the IJN criminals grew louder. Tachi, still immobilized and dazed on the ground, tumbled and dragged himself behind scattered debris. He could barely make out the dark figures dashing between shapes, screaming as they fired bullets and heckled. He gulped again; the stuffy heat strangled him with a thumping headache as he stretched his tense muscles across the floor.\n\nThe roar of gunfire grew louder for a moment, and then ended with a great thump and the giggle of empty shells falling to the ground. Tachi was still shaken by tremors of the encounter, and his heart raced in a moment where he lost control of his breath and his vision."
 japnavyraid.5.a: "The bloody hammer falls."
 japnavyraid.6.t: "Sailing Against the Wind"
 japnavyraid.6.d: "Tachi blinked his eyes many times over and reached for something to stabilize his position. The buzzing white noise ringing in his ears began to quieten, and the pounding pains in his head had dampened as he caught his breath. He exhaled deeply, and as his body descended into a calmer state Tachi slowly lifted himself from the ground as he reached to pat down the smears of soot on his clothes he had collected from the grimy floorboards.\n\nAfter the wailing crackling of gunfire had ended, Tachi could only hear the shuffling of feet over and across the room in desperate search of remaining criminals or evidence. With great beaming torches and silver alloy guns, the law enforcement officers glided around the room in small groups and yelled for the surrender of any remaining survivors, and they were met with no replies. Kodiara slid into the room soon after and he approached the conflict-shaken detective; they stood stiller than rock as they looked over the dead sprawled across the ground.\n\nTachi, amidst the trauma of bullets zipping over his head, did not notice the brutal mangle of bodies that laid across the floor adjacent to where he was immobilized. His eyes were wide and fixed as he gazed at the corpses chewed up by small arms fire, realizing the horrendous implications of such brutality on the investigations. The stench of gunpowder and blood razed Tachi's nose hairs, but he did not react to the violent aftermath. Rather, the hysterical buzz of shock froze him in place. Kodiara cleared his throat before patting Tachi on the back; he pulled out a pack to offer the detective a cigarette, and did not dare to speak over the deafening silence shared between the two in that moment."
 japnavyraid.6.a: "A bittersweet victory."
 japgoodaftermath.1.t: "A Clean and Quick Affair"
 japgoodaftermath.1.d: "The dust had settled, the guard accounted for, the debriefings finished. It had been almost too easy to seize the things they needed; information, the executive management and a wide-reaching warrant for further investigation of the Armed Forces for "suspected treason, illegal trafficking, and conspiracy against the Emperor". An uneasy peace reigned in the meeting room, and Kodaira and Tachi used this peace to plan their next move.\n\nThe two began by thanking the many people who had made this investigation possible, and Kodaira, stuffy as ever, bowed formally in gratitude. Embarrassed laughter rippled in the space of the hall. Moving to a serious note, the two warned the team that the information they currently had indicated possible breaches of trust going all the way to the upper echelons of the Sphere, and that the Government itself was deeply implicit. This meant that keeping the investigation internal would be suicide, both professionally and possibly physically.\n\nBut how would this investigation be kept going without lethal consequences? Tachi introduced the plan to keep the Armed Forces accountable in the public eye: a 4-hour conference with the press of Japan, so wide-scale and exhaustive in details that it would be irrefutable. Only with the truth could the investigation and their own lives be safeguarded.\n\nKodaira ended on a cryptic note, warning them to keep to themselves; no one knew what would happen to the Kokusei when this was finished, but it was unlikely to be pleasant. And as for themselves..."
 japgoodaftermath.1.a: "Ominous."
 japgoodaftermath.2.t: "Tie Up the Loose Ends"
 japgoodaftermath.2.d: "The investigation team's complex of meeting rooms, drawing boards and hallways was a complete mess. Here and there were scribbles and messy diagrams implicating almost every figure in the Imperial government in one way or another. And the paperwork had seemed to come alive in the months since the initial murder; it tumbled merrily down desks and out of cabinets, splayed across rooms without any real sense of order.\n\nAnd the folders marked with "Cause for Concern" or "Needs Urgent Attention" were many, and few were resolved. It was all utterly unacceptable, and more importantly, potentially damaging to the press release. Kodaira and Tachi decided to refocus their efforts on taking care of these loose ends to prevent any damaging information from leaking out and hurting their credibility. (Given what half the papers in Japan were saying, their credibility was already in mortal peril; no further assistance was needed on that score.)\n\nThree main areas were identified for attention: the mountains of paperwork involved in the investigation had to be settled, the accounting of the financial flows between the Army and Navy (at least those that could be tracked) finished with the help of external organizations, and the captives from the Armed Forces interrogated to reveal their dealings. The rest would be minor in comparison.\n\nKodaira and Tachi nodded, scribbled notes on their books, and began to reorganize the complex. Even if the outside world was melting, they could restore order here, and perhaps even ensure their survival beyond that of the immediate future."
 japgoodaftermath.2.a: "Oh wow, look at this paperwork I just found!"
 japgoodaftermath.3.t: "Settling Accounts"
 japgoodaftermath.3.d: "The accounting of the Armed Forces had been limited by two factors: time and exhaustion. The team had suffered from crippling shortages of one and overabundance of the latter, and so examination had been brief and cursory, limited to the biggest single sources of revenue they could track down; even then details had been brief and limited to the strictly functional.\n\nBare-bones examination worked well for presenting a bunch of confused military bureaucrats with evidence they weren't prepared to handle, but it wouldn't fly in the eyes of the press. Drastic improvements would have to be made by the time of the press release; and that day was drawing ever closer. The team pulled their leads from some of the minor accounting firms they had prior experience with, and began work.\n\nIt turned out that the money circulating around the Sphere through this branch of the armed forces had been crafted by a few hands; more promisingly, it appeared to circulate around a few key agencies and departments rather than an endless mess of laundering through the many departments of the Sphere. Even so, there was much to be done, and a simple task was not necessarily a straightforward one.\n\nDuring the briefing, one member of the team voiced his concerns over the sheer amount of documentary evidence flowing through the complex; boxes and boxes of files and documents, all of which could be compromised. Kodaira's face turned black and he left the room, while Tachi voiced the trademark assurances that security was tight as ever. But the truth was that no one truly knew how to safeguard this volume of information. And the time was drawing close when they would have to wield it."
 japgoodaftermath.3.a: "Crunch the numbers and we can worry about security later."
 japgoodaftermath.4.t: "Interrogate the Captives"
 japgoodaftermath.4.d: "The room was small, enclosed, padded just enough for the voices to resound off the walls. Standard Police engineering. And who could forget the classic table and dimly lit lamp? Every cadet was taught that interrogation lay not in words, but in atmosphere, and this atmosphere had been delicately crafted. For the target had information that could save - or doom - the government of Japan.\n\nKodaira looked through the case files; everything seemed to be in order. Most of the captives they'd arrested through the raid had been career bureaucrats fattened off government money. A cozy life in the military with limited training in combat would make them easy targets: a few days in confinement and a silken-gloved approach would scare them just as much as any Yakuza lowlife. Not that the Yakuza ever visited the Police.\n\nHe then leafed through a well-worn copy of the list of Key Performance Indicators the team had outlined. The usual requests were all there: money, transactions, agencies, names, and personal involvement. All informative, all useful, all critically incriminating. And a reminder: if the targets were reminded that they served no purpose except as hostages for the Army and Navy (which was true, but only to an extent) they might prove more willing to negotiate. After all, the easiest way to surrender was through fait accomplis.\n\nThe target entered the room, held on either side by guards. Kodaira brought out his most wolfish smile and began to speak."
 japgoodaftermath.4.a: ""So, my friend, do you know why you're here?""
 japgoodaftermath.5.t: "Clear the Paperwork"
 japgoodaftermath.5.d: "After many, many hours of hard work, the papers justifying the investigation and the raid had finally been sorted and categorized. Huge stacks of papers had been moved, no longer lining every wall but instead properly organized and stored. While that may finally have been completed, the security of the papers still remained in question, and many within the department worried that by centralizing and categorizing the papers they had in fact just made it easier for their foes to seize the evidence and end so many months of hard work.\n\nHowever, there was a rumor that Tachi and Kodaira had a plan. Word around the department was that the two detectives, having foreseen the inevitable attempt by enemies to steal the papers, had organized for the documents to be moved and stored in a secure location. However, the two refused to confirm when questioned. Everyone on the investigation team hoped that they did indeed have a plan, because if the papers were lost then all their work would have been for nothing, or even cause more harm than justice."
 japgoodaftermath.5.a: "They better have a plan."
 japgoodaftermath.6.t: "The Footsteps of Giants"
 japgoodaftermath.6.d: "The investigation team had gathered once more, called by Tachi and Kodaira. The looks on the faces of the two detectives were grave. They wasted no time as soon as the team was gathered and got right to business. They informed the team that despite their hopes, it seemed that there would be many foes yet to come in their fight for justice. No longer were just the Navy and the Army involved, it now seemed possible that those implicated could run all the way up to the Ino Clique itself. The Audit Bureau and Central Command itself could try to get involved along with the Army and Navy Ministry.\n\nKodaira sighed heavily before continuing. He gave an apology for dragging the entire team into danger, and expressed sincere regret that this could not have ended as simply another murder case. However, there was now a distinct possibility that the jobs, security, and even lives of everyone on the team was now in serious danger. Because of this, two primary actions had to be taken. Firstly, security had to be tightened severely. Contact outside of close, trusted friends and family was to be reported and kept to a minimum. Secondly, a group life insurance policy was being taken out on the team in case any of them did end up losing their lives for justice. Though everyone on the team felt somber, they knew that these measures were necessary. They just wished they weren't."
 japgoodaftermath.6.a: "We can only pray."
 japgoodaftermath.7.t: "The Hands of the Law"
 japgoodaftermath.7.d: "The meeting was brief and rather underblown. The head of the department called up Tachi and Kodaira with a subtle but noticeable note of annoyance in his voice. He tersely congratulated them on their good work and then sent them back without a further word. As soon as the meeting was over, he called them back to speak with them privately. Contradicting his praise from just a few moments ago, he chastised the two. His voice was constantly on the edge of true and furious anger. He exclaimed that the two had gone simply too far in the pursuit of justice and had put not just the department but all of the Police of Japan in a dangerous situation.\n\nHe explained that while the police were furious, public perception and the demand for justice had forced them to take the detectives' side. Preparations were already being made to obtain huge amounts of warrants and the authority to arrest many in high positions of power. The department head shook his head and told the two detectives that if this ended poorly, they were no longer just endangering themselves but in fact almost everyone in the Japanese police. He concluded by saying that he hoped to the heavens that Tachi and Kodaira could handle what was coming."
 japgoodaftermath.7.a: "We do too."
 japgoodaftermath.8.t: "The Press Release"
 japgoodaftermath.8.d: "The day was cold and rainy, torrents of sharp droplets barraging the miserable crowd. Nobody really wanted to be there, but they all wanted to know what was happening. They had been waiting for almost an hour, and though they all had a vague and worrying idea of what was to be announced they wanted to know the full extent.\n\nFinally, Tachi and Kodaira made their way to their podiums. Kodaira did the majority of the talking, giving a somber greeting before getting into the actual investigation. He described the initial murder and how the case had slowly escalated the further down they had gone. Eventually, he got to to what would really turn heads. He described their discovery of a vast network of illegal arms dealing and general corruption, centered on the Army and Navy but also reaching into other areas of Japanese government and society.\n\nThe instant those words left his mouth, he was drowned out by shouts and yells from the crowd. The questions of journalists, the gasps of workers, and the anger of Army and Navy servicemen were far too much. A group of soldiers from the Army even attempted to rush the stage in outrage and were only barely stopped by police officers. The two detectives had to be escorted back to safety. They looked at eachother with fear in their eyes. They could no longer have any assurance of their own physical security. It was too late for that."
 japgoodaftermath.8.a: "The things people do to stop the truth..."
 japgoodaftermath.9.t: "Calm the Team's Fears"
 japgoodaftermath.9.d: "Tachi waited at the complex with his team. It was so silent one could hear a needle drop on the other side of the building. The entire team had become very worried as of late. Their enemies' numbers grew by the day, every morning a new outraged letter from the Kenpeitai or threat by the Navy. It had gotten so bad that team members did not just fear for their work, their jobs, or even their freedom, but for their very lives. There seemed to be a very real fear of murderous retribution from those they had brought justice to.\n\nTachi finally decided he needed to do something. He stood up and addressed all the team members present. He said he knew how bad it felt, how scary it was, but that they would be okay. Their foes had no reason to kill them. If anything, if they killed the team they would only be proving their own guilt. However, he also said that revenge often outweighed reason, and to keep alert. The team members should all be on guard, and be ready to move their families to the complex if needed."
 japgoodaftermath.9.a: "Would our enemies dare stoop so low?"
 japgoodaftermath.10.t: "Calm the Government's Fears"
 japgoodaftermath.10.d: "Kodaira sighed. He had been in this meeting for over an hour, enduring hatred, fury, and absolute contempt from those who supposedly had the same ideas and goals as he did. A government where exposing corruption and malpractice got you nothing but spite was not one that Kodaira wanted to serve, but he knew that these were just bad apples in the still-standing and proud tree that was his nation. He assured the politicians time and time again that he was only trying to bring justice and serve Japan, not harm it, but his assurances fell on deaf ears. These people wanted the status quo, even if the status quo was wrong.\n\nThe meeting eventually began to fall apart completely. Kodaira talked less and less, and with shock he noted that the representatives had started to argue with each other as much as they were arguing with him. Soon they seemed to have forgotten him entirely and were biting and yelling at each other with seething rage. Each blamed the branch that some other politician was representing. Kodaira had not realized until now just how deep he and his team had struck at Japan. The branches and fruits were not all that were spoiled. The very roots were rotting away, and if he had not acted and revealed it the whole tree would have collapsed. Even now the whole system seemed on the brink of collapse. Kodaira silently hoped he had done the right thing."
 japgoodaftermath.10.a: "Is there anyone innocent in this entire damn government?"
 japgoodaftermath.11.t: "Brace for the Storm"
 japgoodaftermath.11.d: "Tachi and Kodaira each sipped from their tea, making small talk that neither cared the slightest bit about. The clock above their heads ticked slowly, each little click a second closer to total chaos. The two detectives had never even guessed what they were getting into all those months ago. Just a standard murder. Just a nobody pawn in the machine. Kodaira remarked that he almost wished that they had never found the greater truth. That they could just have continued as normal. Lived their lives, done their jobs.\n\nAround them, the department was going into full lockdown. All the evidence, captives, and documents were being moved around, shuffled away and hidden in locations undisclosed to even most of the officers. They had reached a point they had prayed would never come. There was a rumor that someone, perhaps the Kenpeitai, perhaps the Navy, perhaps even the government itself, was going to attack. Be it to desperately save themselves or simply out of pure revenge, they would have vengeance. The government was in absolute chaos and would likely not protect the department. Who knew how long there might even be a government for. Even if the department survived this attack, there was an even slimmer chance they would make it through the almost certainly upcoming power struggle. All they could do was pray and fight like they had hoped they would never have to."
 japgoodaftermath.11.a: "May there be mercy upon us."
 japbadaftermath.1.t: "Recovering from the Unrecoverable"
 japbadaftermath.1.d: "The light of dawn hit the base, but it stayed still. Corpses lay on the ground, covered with blood as if they had fought to the last moment. It was not until about noon that a tenuous peace set in place. There was no more need for fighting. Now was a time for collecting the bodies and mourning. Not just mourning the casualties, but the implication of the casualties. The raid had failed and the department had lost. Justice would not shine, even though the death of its forebears. There was little hope at this point. All the detectives could do was try to move on, as hard as it may seem. They would continue the fight, even if it killed them.\n\nThe military officials were doubly excited and terribly disappointed. Sure, they had covered their asses, but at what cost? At what cost to their legacy, at what cost to their troops? Perhaps most importantly, at what cost to their enemies? They had the intention to exploit, but not murder. They weren't looking for a war. They were looking for money, plain and simple.\n\nThe bodies are buried in quiet ceremonies. The reason of death is not given, but a healthy pension is given to the families of the deceased."
 japbadaftermath.1.a: "The investigation is dead."
 japbadaftermath.2.t: "Burying the Men"
 japbadaftermath.2.d: "A hundred funerals were planned. On both sides, there were those regarded as heroes and those as villains. Vigils of companions and comrades attended each one, silent and mourning. Rain pelted down the tears of someone above, and a quietness settled upon it all. There was a time for violence, but now was a time to reflect. On the pessimism of the past, the actions of the present, and the optimism of the future."
 japbadaftermath.2.a: "Silence."
 japbadaftermath.3.t: "Survey the Wreckage"
 japbadaftermath.3.d: "From the outside, the building looked as if it had been in perfect condition. There was little that belied the horrid interior but a few bullet holes scattered on the facade. Inside was a mess of scattered paper, ashes, and bodies rotting in the humid air. Rodents scrambled about, looking for a cut of the meat.\n\nA few expeditions had been conducted to gain bodies, but nothing more. The bowels of the base still laid untrodden since the siege. They smelled of rotting shit and flesh. The unknown called to no one, and zero volunteered to see what was inside. Eventually, a squirmy officer was pushed in. He emerged stinking with the same stench of those rooms but brought news of what lay inside. The file cabinets were empty, the evidence inside vanished. This would not do. The police could not have gotten ahold of them. They will not."
 japbadaftermath.3.a: "The rooms smell of death and missing evidence."
 japbadaftermath.4.t: "Salvaging What We Can"
 japbadaftermath.4.d: "The officials were furious. Even though the raid had resolutely failed, the detectives had gotten away with too much. They weren't sure whether the police would even put it all together, but they weren't gambling on it. Action must be taken, and quick. One raid wouldn't set this whole house of cards tumbling down,"
 japbadaftermath.4.a: "Would it?"
 japbadaftermath.5.t: "The Note"
 japbadaftermath.5.d: "It was in the early morning that a messenger arrived at the police department. Cloaked in a trenchcoat akin to our own and carrying a pair of small Manchurian binoculars, he brought a small note in a white envelope. As we mourned our fallen, he knocked on the door two times. Certainly, not a good time to arrive, but when is there a good time? Tachi opened the door sulking, with a frown on his face. He gave a nod to the messenger without knowing who he was, took the note, and closed the door. Probably just condolences.\n\nIt was when Tachi slipped open the note that he realized this was much more important-and dangerous-then some simple condolences. In plain text, without a return address or even a name, were those words, typed out.\n\n"The Tokyo Police Department will not spread any information they supposedly gleamed in the raid. Any slander directed toward the Military or other government groups will be severely punished for."\n\nTachi's heart dropped. He thought the issue had been closed. It wasn't as if they had gained much information from the raid in the first place, but now they were being threatened by some mysterious higher-ups? Kodaira would know how to deal with this. He had to."
 japbadaftermath.5.a: "There's no-one else who could."
 japbadaftermath.6.t: "Taking Stock"
 japbadaftermath.6.d: "Kodaira took a glance at Tachi and let out a snort. He wasn't sure why he was laughing, but something had cracked. First, the biggest event in his career goes terribly sour, and now they're being threatened by the government? It's not like he hadn't ever felt at risk of being put in prison for perceived crimes, but this was certainly the worst situation he had been in so far. And still, he wasn't going to let this get in the way of the investigation; everyone else seemed to think it was over, but it was obvious that the military thought the department had something on them.\n\nThey couldn't stop now. Even if it caused more deaths, he had learned that sometimes, it was all worth it. Besides, there was something out there that they didn't want him to see, and he would try his damn hardest to see it. As Tachi waited eagerly for some kind of answer, Kodaira stood up, grabbed his coat off the wall and his hat off the weathered stand. Tachi followed suit. In a time like this, when the young transfer felt powerless, he tended to simply let the power guide him. Kodaira sighed."
 japbadaftermath.6.a: ""We're going back to the scene of the crime.""
 japbadaftermath.7.t: "The Slip of Paper"
 japbadaftermath.7.d: "The train ride back to the base was tense. They didn't have any authority to be there, and they certainly couldn't be certain that they wouldn't be shot on the way. But they reached the base quietly and without being shot, so there was at least a chance they would get out without a bullet in their brains.\n\nRummaging through the scattered paper covering the ground and bodies found among the bullets, Tachi couldn't help but feel sick to the stomach. He had seen bodies before and inspected crime scenes, but this many bodies? Some of his own friends and colleagues? No man could prepare for a moment like this. It was while padding down some soldier's uniform that he felt a slip of paper, no larger than an envelope. Scrawled in rough, rushed handwriting was a phone number and a name, Arai Katsuhito. While he could barely read it, there was at least a bright spot to this horrid day. As the day closed and the duo bagged up the evidence, they could not help but feel as if they were being watched in there every move.\n\nThe train ride back was as tense as the first."
 japbadaftermath.7.a: "A stranger watches on the horizon."
 japbadaftermath.8.t: "The Stranger on the Horizon"
 japbadaftermath.8.d: "The stranger peered through his binoculars. They were a dusty affair; some old Manchurian produced ones, dating back to the war. On the cusp of vintage but still in the realm of old and worthless. They wouldn't stand out, considering the small size. Through them, he could see those two detectives who had gotten a little too close to comfort to the whole ordeal. One of them was older. He had stubble and a weathered tan coat. Some wire-frame glasses gave him the look of that Manchurian bastard, Puyi. The other was younger, but not too young. He was dressed a little too sharply to be a veteran in the field. After a couple of hours of silent gathering of evidence, they left without a word, but the stranger swore that one of them noticed him, standing in the silence. He slunk away.\n\nTachi and Kodaira returned marginally less distraught then they had been in the morning. Ignoring the sick feeling in Tachi's stomach, they had a promising lead, and nobody from the military had been bothering them. That was until another knock arrived on the door. When they opened it, nothing awaited them but a small letter at the ground in front of the raised doorway. Again, in clear typed script, it read,"
 japbadaftermath.8.a: ""Stop this feeble investigation, it will lead to nothing but death and suffering.""
 japbadaftermath.9.t: "A Patrol"
 japbadaftermath.9.d: "Morikawa was on patrol in a quiet part of town, and consequently alone. The raid had affected him deeply, and the police department had realized it. They had assigned him to a middle-class neighborhood rarely had any crimes; the worst on a daily basis was a child receiving a slap on the wrist for shoplifting. But the peaceful nature of the area belied the turbulent mind of Morikawa. By his own account, he had not slept for two days, as each time he closed his eyes he saw the faces of his comrade-in-arms, screaming in pain and terror. There was no end to the torture, and worse, the survivor's guilt. His wife was distraught and left to go live with her parents until Morikawa "got his act together." His kids had left with her. Nothing seemed to be going well.\n\nAt least the department had given him a break, even if they could hardly afford it in this time. Something would eventually go well. The nightmares must recede and he would get a good night of sleep. Something had to give. He had to believe something had to give. Out of the corner of his eye, Morikawa saw stranger carrying a pair of inconspicuous binoculars. The man pulled out a pistol.\n\nMorikawa was shot three times between the eyes."
 japbadaftermath.9.a: "He was declared dead an hour later."
 japbadaftermath.10.t: "News from Tokyo"
 japbadaftermath.10.d: "Everybody was in shock, including Tachi and Kodaira. On every radio and television in Mainland Japan, dozens of politicians, from local mayors and council members to cabinet members, announced their resignation at once. The reasons varied; some declared that they had grown to old and were ready to retire. Some announced that personal matters had compelled them to leave their posts. But Japan was stunned; there was no good reason a third of the Japanese bureaucracy would leave in a matter of days. It must be connected to the note the two detectives had received. Big things were shifting outside of their control. If they couldn't control it, they sure would witness it.\n\nThe two detectives had a great weight on them. They had considered stopping it all since the death, but they couldn't. They were too far in, and it seemed as if their actions had been doing something massive. Now, they just had to follow their lead and not back down. If they did, they could simply be met with another lawless murder."
 japbadaftermath.10.a: "There is simply too much at stake."
 japbadaftermath.11.t: "A Pair of Binoculars"
 japbadaftermath.11.d: "Katsuhito wasn't far. Apparently, the man who they had found in the slip of paper lived in a back alley on the bad side of town. The duo made their way, talking under their breaths about who Arai could be. A rat scurried, brushing against their foot, and Tachi swore he heard a scream from somewhere up above. This was not a neighborhood to stay in for long. The door was caged and built into the wall. In the thin alleyway, it scraped against the opposite side of the alley when opened. The two entered without knocking and pulled out their flashlights. Following the address on the slip of paper, they slinked up the stairs until they reached the apartment number. The door was unlocked and the two inspected the dark apartment until they froze. There was a man sitting in the chair. Snoring, by the looks of it. In his lap was a pair of binoculars and to the side of the chair a gun. Shaken awake by the sound of the detective's shoes, he looked up and his face deflated. "Well, you finally found me? I knew you two were good detectives," he mumbled. Tachi struggled for words, but Kodaira spoke up. "Were you the one who killed Morikawa?" he stated, in a simple, resolute tone.\n\n"I would say that you two killed Morikawa. I would still suggest you halt whatever you're trying to reveal.""
 japbadaftermath.11.a: "The stranger in the chair pulled up his pistol and shot himself under the chin."
 japbadaftermath.12.t: "The Pieces Come Together"
 japbadaftermath.12.d: "A string of expletives emerged from Tachi's agape mouth. This was not what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to meet with Arai and discuss with him what was happening, not having him shoot himself the moment they met him. Now there were people walking over to see what the ruckus was. Kodaira went over to the door to explain that there was an issue with the water heater. Tachi went over to look at the stranger's body. On the wall behind the chair was a board with dozens of notes and clippings. Upon closer inspection, each revealed a loose relationship with one another. A few were on bank proceedings in Shenyang. One was a transcript of a Zaibatsu correspondences in Indonesia. Another was of Japanese interests in Chinese resource extraction mergers. A sheaf of paper described smuggling cash and arms to warlords operating in Eastern Russia. Still, more were on affairs in Japan: allegations of corruption quickly silenced by authority. Under the table agreements between important military heads. A number of them were stamped with the numbers 731. Here, on this wall, was the makings of a grand political conspiracy. Silenced by the sheer amount of information before him, Tachi called for Kodaira. When Kodaira spotted the wall, with every piece of evidence needed to indict every man in Japan, enough to indict the empire, he let out his typical sigh."
 japbadaftermath.12.a: ""Tachi, it seems we have uncovered one of the largest scandals in Japanese history.""
 
 japraidideas.1.t: "Paralyzed"
 japraidideas.1.d: "Tachi and Kodaira eventually return with what they have found, plunging the entire investigation team into complete and utter shock. This has just become much bigger than they really ever wanted, and they have crossed the regular threshold of risk to a point where their safety may be compromised. There are clearly very important and very high-ranking people who would be willing to take very drastic measures to keep this quiet, whatever "this" really is.\n\nThe debate soon proves to be extremely divisive. Many become extremely worried about whether they might be in too deep and if it might just be best to drop the whole thing. Others insist that the only way to ensure their own safety is to continue pressing harder. Every moment that this loose end stays untied, they become more at risk of retaliation from those that are being investigated. The only sure way to both be safe and make sure that justice is served is to strike first.\n\nThe debate carries on for hours as the investigators pore over the information, reading and re-reading every line, combing over everything they have gathered as of yet to try and glean some clue as to what they must do next. Eventually, however, one conclusion is reached. Something has to be done. This case cannot go cold. The only thing is to figure out what exactly to do."
 japraidideas.1.a: "We are treading in dangerous territory."
 japraidideas.2.t: "Too Crazy to Work?"
 japraidideas.2.d: "After hours of debate and scheming, Tachi finally speaks up with a truly insane idea. This is clearly much deeper than anticipated. The military is involved somehow. If they do not act soon, they could be in the sights of some very powerful and very dangerous people. Thus, the only course of action is to strike fast and more importantly strike hard. If the suspects will not cooperate, which they have shown they have no plans to do, then the investigators will have to get the smoking gun themselves. A vulnerable military base, one assigned to the unit which the warehouse supposedly belonged to. A quick raid: in and out, and the criminals exposed before they can so much as file a complaint.\n\nKodaira listens thoughtfully, and though many are wary of the plan he speaks in favor of it at the end. He talks about the contacts he has made over the years, people who could get the men and supplies necessary for such an ambitious operation. People who have dealt with unsavory and dangerous things before. Kodaira is, after all, one of the most seasoned members of the team.\n\nTachi thanks Kodaira, but insists he knows his own plan and the people he wants to carry it out. He is young, fresh, the wildcard. The people he might know are stranger, more on the fringe, and perhaps more unique and more unexpected both to the team and to their foes. His ideas are innovative but untested. The team is wary, but many think his tenacity will bring them to victory. Eventually it is brought to a vote."
 japraidideas.2.a: "Kodaira's allies are as seasoned and well-versed as he is. He will find us allies."
 japraidideas.2.b: "Tachi will innovate and get our enemy where they least expect."
 japraidideas.3.t: "The Old Dog"
 japraidideas.3.d: "The investigators decide that Kodaira, as the most experienced of the detectives, should be the one to seek out allies. Tachi accepts this judgement with only a little argument, and Kodaira thanks the team and promises not to let them down. He quickly heads to his office and begins rooting through his files to find names and numbers. After a good search, he starts to make some calls.\n\nHe skips formalities and makes it clear that this is a dire situation and he cannot disclose too much. His contacts understand. This is not the first time they have had to exercise discretion, though they note that Kodaira is more grim and urgent than he ever has been before. They direct him to names, who direct him to other names, who give him numbers, who give him info. He eventually gets a few key names, numbers, and addresses, and heads out.\n\nHe finds two potential allies that interest him most. The first are a few policemen in the Tokyo Police Department who are personal friends of Kodaira. Though he suspects the conspiracy may even reach as the police department, he would and has trusted these friends with his life, and they can gather the non-corrupted and loyal officers of the department. The other contact is riskier, but perhaps more rewarding. He has managed to gather a short list of discontent and slightly hot-headed officers who would do much for a chance for advancement. They could use their involvement against this conspiracy as a chance to take the places of any higher-ranking officers that lose their positions."
 japraidideas.3.a: "We will reach out to these officers. Power is a powerful incentive."
 japraidideas.3.b: "The men of the department will be our allies."
 japraidideas.4.t: "The Young Wolf"
 japraidideas.4.d: "The young transfer from Osaka, Detective Tachi, would lead the charge to find initial allies against the Navy or Army.\n\nA bold first idea was simply to ask the Navy to help the Tokyo police fight the Navy. Hidden in the maze of audits and circumstantial evidence was the simple fact that there didn't seem to be enough money to go around. There had been winners in the Navy's shipping sector; there had been losers. By seeking the help of greedy Navy men that had been left out of the lucrative Army-Navy contracts, the police department could begin building a coalition. Once the raid came to public attention, perhaps enough of the ambitious Navy men would try to sell out their Navy rivals to defend the police's efforts. And if the Army was targeted, well, Tachi hoped that the Navy men not in bed with the Army would jump at the chance to upstage their land rivals.\n\nOf course, the safer option was just to find more reliable police officers. Tachi had a lot of friends in the Osaka and Kobe police departments. Some of west Japan's police higher ups might be able to swing local politicians the way of the Tokyo police's investigation. Of course the Army and Navy's reach extended all over the Home Islands, but Detective Tachi was ready to bet that this particular conspiracy wouldn't leave the Army and Navy barracks of Tokyo."
 japraidideas.4.a: "A cup of coffee with western policemen?"
 japraidideas.4.b: "Let's have tea with Navy officers."
 japraidideas.5.t: "Military Contacts"
 japraidideas.5.d: "To most of Kodaira's Army contacts, it had seemed too good to be true. A mere civilian police investigation, making space for unexpected promotions? Not happening this century!\n\nBut Kodaira kept at it. The old policeman deflected any attempt to figure out just what was being cooked. The vagueness of his offer certainly drove away a great many contacts. But a few stayed on to listen.\n\nDetective and officers played chess, Kodaira doing his best not to reveal what all this was about as his Army interlocutors hinted that they potentially knew where Kodaira was getting at. Eventually the detective's shortlist had gone done to two candidates. A young man, fresh from his service in Indonesia and frustrated by the ineptness of the Indonesian garrison. And a veteran of the Manchurian Army, who likely suspected his fellow officers had been skimming off a little too much from the top. "What the hell Kodaira, an old geezer like me hasn't gone much to worry about, right?"\n\nAnd so young and old man had promised to seek out like minded officers in the rank. Having some military men around to defend them would help shield the Tokyo police from most retalation, wouldn't it?"
 japraidideas.5.a: "Time to go see our boss."
 japraidideas.6.t: "Police Contacts"
 japraidideas.6.d: "The civilian police has never been the most powerful institution in Imperial Japan. But it does have its own set of influence. Without the constant monitoring of criminal groups and round the clock vigilance of the elite Tokkō police, the order and progress prized by every Japanese might become a very distant dream indeed. The civilian police's ability to get crimes solved without the endless internal politics of the various military polices was also in a league of its own.\n\nMaking use of this influence to cover the investigation would however be quite tricky. There was no way to tell just how deep the tendrils of the Navy and Army reached inside the department. But the investigation units also had its own allies. The gravity of the unfolding conspiracy would also help convince more conservative members of the police department to throw their weight behind the idea of an evidence collecting raid. And so the investigation team worked, filtering every police officer into "reliable" and "unreliable" groups. When the time came to show cards, a surprising proportion of the Tokyo Police Department were forecast to stand behind the investigation team."
 japraidideas.6.a: "Time to go see our boss."
 japraidideas.7.t: "Navy Rivalry"
 japraidideas.7.d: "A pleasant tea ceremony in Ueno Park. Detective Tachi admired the finely lacquered bowl as he and his host chatted pleasantly. Soon the topic came to the difficulty to find purpose now that the Japanese Navy was the strongest in the world. No, the young detective had never heard of such dreadful things as Navy officers whoring out the proud Japanese Navy as commercial freighter. But now that the honorable officer had mentioned it, the young detective had been investigating untidiness amongst the ranks of the Navy and Army. Were trouble to arise, it warmed the young detective's heart to know that proud men still toiled to maintain the Navy's honor and reputation. The Navy officer nodded to this, and pledged to support the Tokyo Police Department in its endeavour to root out corruption.\n\nSo went several of Detective Tachi's afternoon for the week. Not every Navy man was as delicate and diplomatic as the tea ceremony enthusiast. Many simply wanted a slice of the pie when potential rivals were canned. The young detective never explicitly discussed the Army-Navy underground shipping contracts, but his interlocutors seemed heartened to know that the upper rungs of the Navy were expected to be hit by the police quite soon. In return these ambitious men would protect the Police from any backlash."
 japraidideas.7.a: "Time to go see our boss."
 japraidideas.8.t: "Go Up"
 japraidideas.8.d: "Tachi and Kodaira looked at each other grimly before they entered the office of their boss. They had worked hard to ensure that they had the proper allies and contacts to make this operation a reality, spending days finding the best men for the job, but they had to admit the idea was still rather risky. As soon as they explained the planned raid, their boss immediately began tearing into it. He was extremely skeptical that it could work at all, and worried about how terrible the repercussions could be if it did fail. He was a man who played by the rules, and the rules were not terribly well defined here.\n\nThe discussion was on the brink of becoming a full-blown argument, but through deft teamwork and excellent planning Kodaira and Tachi were able to hold their ground without pushing too hard. They explained every aspect of their plan and how it would be executed, and any concerns their boss might have were quickly eased. It was not short or easy, but after a long session their boss was finally convinced. The raid would happen.\n\nThere was one catch. The boss was not convinced that the team had all the people needed to properly carry out the raid with the needed precision and ambition. He ordered the two detectives to gather more allies, people with real power and experience. He suggested less savory organizations that felt cheated by the competition from the government, or politicians who could use their clout to support the investigators and hurt their rivals. If Tachi and Kodaira could get the necessary help, then the raid would happen."
 japraidideas.8.a: "Allies in politics are the safer bet."
 japraidideas.8.b: "Sometimes you need a criminal to catch a criminal."
 japraidideas.9.t: "Cabinet Contacts"
 japraidideas.9.d: "Tachi quickly went to work on getting in contact with politicians who might be willing to help the two detectives and the investigative team. He did some quick research and asking around, finding the proper rivalries and ties that could be exploited to make them more sympathetic. He had a rather large file on the subject, and rifling around through it he already was finding some very promising leads. He picked up the phone and started making some calls as soon as he had the right info gathered.\n\nThe talks were somewhat covert, with every word having to take on a double meaning so neither side could be incriminated, but after a while Tachi was making progress. One particular minister had been feuding with a high-ranking admiral for a few months and was looking for any chance to shame him. That admiral just so happened to be closely involved with this case, and so it was essentially a done deal as soon as his name was brought up. Tachi gathered up several other variously ranked politicians before calling it a night."
 japraidideas.9.a: "The web of intrigue grows."
 japraidideas.10.t: "Underground Contacts"
 japraidideas.10.d: "Tachi and Kodaira quickly debated which of the paths they would follow, but after only a moment Kodaira came out on top and said he had the number of a certain Yakuza family that could be of assistance. Tachi was skeptical but gave in. Kodaira went off and started to make some calls. He could only hope that this would end well, as even the most civilized of the Yakuza gangs were not particularly notorious for being friendly.\n\nAfter making a quick call, he headed off into the city to meet with the man he had contacted. Kodaira ducked under an archway into a little restaurant. There he saw the old man, one he had worked with before. A Yakuza boss, not a particularly noteworthy one but the only one Kodaira would even think of working with. They exchanged the standard pleasantries and spoke largely in veiled sentences, but the negotiation was productive. The boss was angry at the competition to his business posed by the very government, and he was very willing to work with Kodaira and the team to take them down. They ended the meeting with a handshake and both left with a new ally."
 japraidideas.10.a: "Take any friend you can get."
 japraidideas.11.t: "To Catch a Thief"
 japraidideas.11.d: "The investigation team has gathered a cabal of uneasy friends and allies. The planning is in its final stages. The planners determine that a fast and clean raid is both possible and extremely desirable. A single drop of bloodshed by either side could spell catastrophe; the last thing anyone wants is conflict among loyal servants of the Empire. Thus, this operation must be planned down to the millisecond; every step mapped out, every factor brought into the equation.\n\nThere remains, however, one titanic decision: to raid the Army, or to raid the Navy. It seems that for this particular unsavory endeavor the two have put aside their differences for mutual gain, but their general separation and traditional rivalry means that only one can be focused on. The team is divided on who plays the larger role and who is the riper target, but eventually a decision has to be made."
 japraidideas.11.a: "We strike the Army. They will have more information."
 japraidideas.11.b: "Target the Navy. They are the greater culprit."
 
 japarmybrief.1.t: "The Army HQ"
 japarmybrief.1.d: "In the end, it came down to a simple choice; follow the boats, or the guns they shipped? The Army had a long and storied history of defying orders all the way up to the Emperor himself, and an equally storied history of denying it had ever crossed the line. To top it off, the equipment volumes per shipment that the team estimated were necessary for the warehouse to be emptied in a shipping run were phenomenally large. Stupidly large. The entity running this series of shipments was totally unconcerned with appearances, or so it seemed.\n\nKodaira emphasised the fact that it would be easy to track the physical shipments, far more so than tracing the elaborate dance of the numbers that was the Navy financial scheme. Guns and equipment could be handled, they could be tracked, and they could be traced. All that would have to be done was the drop of a sample into the black pool of the market, a trace bug here or there, and the Army would drop piece by piece into their laps.\n\nTachi was more than a little uncomfortable at becoming a gun runner; he'd seen what happened to smugglers in his early days, during the war. But if it was for the good of Japan, nothing could be withheld. He agreed.\n\nMeetings were scheduled. Weapons were bugged. Members were briefed. The Team began to move."
 japarmybrief.1.a: "Let us begin proceedings."
 japarmybrief.2.t: "Track the Guns"
 japarmybrief.2.d: "The contacts were more than a little mystified; they'd never heard such a singularly ridiculous request. Buying a large chunk of weaponry on short notice was nothing unusual for the Police, if a little unsubtle for their usual operations, but to then resell it on the same market? At a 15 percent revenue cut? It seemed like the Tokyo Metropolitan Police were out to burn away their annual budget; one contact even went so far as to advise Kodaira, over a drink, to "calm down and think about their finances" before committing. It took a series of further drinks, and a casual palming of financial grease, to assuage his fears.\n\nThe team worked overtime behind the scenes to get the "modifications" to the guns working. Augmented sights, new chambers, new magazines; with all the flashy new additions, who'd notice the slightly heavier weights or the slightly hollow sound they made as they reloaded? Hopefully the Army would be too deep in its cups to notice. And it wasn't like more than a fraction of them did more than basic weapon cleaning, if the stories were to be believed.\n\nSlowly the scheme began to come together. The policemen donned anonymous black suits, prepared their assets, and waited for the biggest fish to snatch the bait. Based on prior activity, they wouldn't be waiting for very long."
 japarmybrief.2.a: "Guns and butter for greasy palms."
 japarmybrief.3.t: "Bug Everything"
 japarmybrief.3.d: "The team swore obscenities under their breath. Another damned storehouse? The 5th in 3 days? They'd never get to sleep at this rate. But it was a problem borne of their own success.\n\nWith the agencies preparing to buy the weaponry arranging for meetings in secluded locations, Kodaira and Tachi had ordered a zero-slip policy regarding information transmitted by the Army parties: zero information could be lost by the Police. This meant comprehensive surveillance of meeting locations, preparations of equipment and obsessive arrangement of schedules to fit the timings just right.\n\nThe team struggled to keep itself together in the face of increasing demands for surveillance in this fashion; one nearly snapped after hearing his series of wiretaps lead instead to the neighbouring hotel room and its... indiscretions. But room by room, bug by bug, the sheer scale of the task began to shrink to organize streams of information. And the team had increasingly settled down to its new task: listening, and watching.\n\nNow the storehouse doors opened, and 17 separate cameras and audio bugs chittered with activity. It was time to commence recording. The police were watching, after all. And soon, all of Japan would be watching too."
 japarmybrief.3.a: "We're always watching."
 japarmybrief.4.t: "Pull Rank"
 japarmybrief.4.d: "Kodaira had made it a point to maintain contacts with various assets in the armed forces in his long career. The madness of Imperial bureaucracy was easier to handle when a few friends were there to provide strategic cover, and ample elbow grease, to get things done. These were the assets he had called upon to assist him, along with others in the Army who felt ambitious enough to hitch their wagon to the investigation; and now he had another task for them.\n\nCalling them together in a bar where the secrets piled as high as the cigar smoke, he briefed them on what the next step would be. Interference was a familiar term to most of them, but this interference would be on an unprecedented scale - and all of it would center on the large shipment of weaponry the Police were now shipping to the Army. Internal security, counter surveillance and protective measures: what was left of these protocols would vanish like morning dew, and the mid-level operatives surrounding Kodaira would be the cause.\n\nIt was a simple job, and it could be done with bags of cash to the appropriate agencies as "goodwill" gifts, but men on the ground were far more reliable. After all, the Army's inter branch rivalry and sprawling organisational mess already resembled a minor civil war; all it would take was a little interference here and there for caution to break down. And competition was the mother of desperation, and therefore necessity."
 japarmybrief.4.a: "The Trojan Horsemen will aid us greatly."
 japarmybrief.5.t: "And the Money Will Follow"
 japarmybrief.5.d: "The offers came flowing in, one by one, in meetings and through letters and anonymous (and not-so-anonymous) offers in bars and hallways. Most of these offers would be considered; a few would be taken into special consideration, but only one would be accepted. It was how business worked, after all.\n\nAnd behind the closed doors of the surveillance rooms and the meeting rooms, a web grew to encompass Army ministries both small and large; logistics, intelligence, literally half the infantry units in the Sphere, the Air Force. Most of these agencies had attempted to use counter-espionage to cloak their activities, as per protocol, but the Trojan assets, as Tachi had taken to calling them, had neutered the efforts. The doors, for all intents and purposes, were wide open, and everything - and everyone - could be seen.\n\nSome links on the web and the cluttered board were thicker than most. But by far the largest individual connections were linked to an agency whose identity continued to elude the team. Until one offer, written in hastily scribbled handwriting, came up with an exact match for font and writing style; a senior officer in the Kenpeitai, their biggest internal security competitor.\n\nKodaira and Tachi looked at each other, and laughter echoed down the halls. After all the efforts taken to secure their target, it appeared the end of this investigation would be an internal affair. A very internal affair."
 japarmybrief.5.a: "You have got to be kidding me."
 japarmybrief.6.t: "Note the Bankers"
 japarmybrief.6.d: "Tachi and Kodaira continued to pore over all the documents. They had the major points now, but it was time to start taking down all the names, not just the big ones. They needed to make sure that nobody would escape once the music played. The focus would obviously be on the generals, the politicians, the big scandalous names, but one group that really needed to be brought down a notch was the bankers.\n\nA few major names in the Japanese financial sector were showing up a lot more than they should. A quick bit of digging and cross-referencing showed their role in the scheme: routing and distributing the money through enough accounts and intermediaries so that it would not be noticed. They would guide the money down a complex path, dodging and darting through the trickling brooks and raging rivers of the financial sector before finally coming to rest in the bank accounts of the higher-ups in the scheme. The bankers would of course skim a little bit off for themselves in exchange for their efforts and their discretion.\n\nTachi and Kodaira took down names and made note of the most egregious offenders. They were clueless for now, upstanding members of society. For the time being, the detectives would smile and act as if nothing was wrong. Retribution would come for these criminals."
 japarmybrief.6.a: "There are many layers to this crime."
 japarmybrief.7.t: "Prep the Papers"
 japarmybrief.7.d: "There was no doubt at all that trying to take down the department's biggest competitor would raise suspicions in the government. It could easily be seen as a hit job, a move to usurp power rather than a legitimate operation. The detectives had to do everything they could to ensure that did not happen. They could not afford to lose anything here. They were treading on thin ice, they had to make sure their legitimacy was unquestionable and their motives completely publicly pure.\n\nThere are so many papers and documents that it would take a normal team months to fully abridge and comb through them, but Tachi and Kodaira had already done more than a normal team could ever do. They had found several highlights that would hopefully make a bulletproof case against the Kenpeitai. The weapons trade alone should have been enough to convince everyone that something fishy was going on, but these were not normal times. The two detectives had to reinforce their case with another major point: the money. It always seems to come back to the money in crime. The cash that has suspiciously been making its way in and out of the Kenpeitai was not normal in any way, and would be absolutely damning once properly documented and backed up. Tachi and Kodaira began assembling files containing all the evidence that could ever be needed. This would be a hard fight."
 japarmybrief.7.a: "Good work."
 japarmybrief.8.t: "Hush the Officers"
 japarmybrief.8.d: "Kodaira had a very hard task. The Tokyo Police Department had been rather inappropriately close with the Kenpeitai for decades now, a result of bureaucratic failures and an unfortunate ability by either side to properly do their jobs without support. This relationship was deep, and it meant that many if not most in the department would not be happy with any action that could damage that relationship. Kodaira had the unfortunate job of finding the right allies within the department and making sure that all worries were kept at bay, even if those worries were completely justified.\n\nKodaira spoke to several colleagues, each time assuring them that this was simply routine and there was no need for any worry. He made sure that everything he said would still sound fine once it was inevitably relayed to the Kenpeitai by some loyal crony in the department. They were in many ways the real audience of his talks, and as such they were perfectly tailored to make the Kenpeitai as unsuspecting as possible and the raid as viable as it could be.\n\nKodaira had to admit, he felt like he had done a pretty good job. Seeding a lie with the intention that it would be carried to another party was a skill that few could master, but he was no stranger to it. By the end, he was cautiously optimistic that he had bought enough time for everything to be properly done."
 japarmybrief.8.a: "He has a silver tongue."
 japarmybrief.9.t: "We Can Still Hear You Sayin'"
 japarmybrief.9.d: "Tachi pored over yet another paper. He had hardly slept for weeks at this point, catching a few hours here and there and missing important things when he did. They were too far in. At this point he could not afford to miss anything, and he could not afford to be as tired as he was. The eternal paradox of a detective. As his tired eyes tore apart each line, searching for anything of note, he noticed a name. It seemed familiar. Reading further, he realized it was a major general, bigger than anyone else implicated so far. He had seen his name in the paper earlier for getting some medal. He quickly made a note of it and realized with dread how big this case was growing.\n\nOver the next few days, big names like that started popping up more and more often. Evidence continued to flow in nonstop, and Kodaira and Tachi kept finding truly major figures in places they had no right to be. This was getting bigger than either of them could have ever thought. Their shock and worry grew as even bigger names started to show up, something they thought impossible. People at the very center of government, high-ranking politicians in the Diet. People who could potentially be Prime Minister some day. People with more power than most could dream of. The two detectives had a distinct feeling that they were punching up."
 japarmybrief.9.a: "This is worse than we could have ever imagined."
 japarmybrief.10.t: "You Would Never Break the Chain"
 japarmybrief.10.d: "The names just kept coming. The list kept growing every day, and it was starting to look less like a chain and more like a massive web of generals, politicians, officers, and now to top it all off admirals. As the evidence continued to flow, it started to become clear that this was not just an Army operation. The Navy was apparently willing to put its differences with the ground forces aside in the name of mutual profit, the eternal motivator. The entire military was compromised, it seemed, and a good chunk of the government to go along with it.\n\nTachi and Kodaira had gone from worried to completely panicked. Now they were dealing with not one but two different branches of the military police who would absolutely annihilate them if they found out what the two detectives were doing. They realized that they had to act far faster than they had thought before. Each minute that ticked by, their enemies got closer to finding out what they were planning. Each day was another chance that agents of the Army, Navy, or government itself would bust through their door and arrest them both, or worse. There was not much time left. The raid had to happen as soon as humanly possible."
 japarmybrief.10.a: "We're in the endgame now."
 
 japnavybrief.1.t: "The Navy HQ"
 japnavybrief.1.d: "It seemed like the obvious choice, and Tachi saw no point in moving away from the path of least resistance. After a closed-door debate with Kodaira (and a search for bugs and surveillance equipment immediately before said debate) the Navy was deemed as the branch of the Armed Forces more liable for investigation.\n\nKodaira laid out his old arguments: the Navy wasn't the owner of the goods in the first place, and as shipment movers they simply couldn't provide details as to the whereabouts of the missing equipment. Tachi pointed out that the Navy might not have details on it, but the hundred little sub-companies hitched onto its back had more than sufficient details on the matter to justify a raid; and where the Navy ended and these sub-companies began was anyone's guess. The cash flows of these companies, surely critical to any analysis of the Navy, would also be invaluable, and should therefore be captured sooner.\n\nIn any case, the Navy's involvement with the investigation had become so deep-rooted that it would almost be a relief to move from the subtle passive-aggressive dances of bureaucratic hand-wringing to outright antagonism. On this Kodaira was silent; he had been on the receiving end of too many "chidings" from the Navy Ministry to disagree.\n\nThe debate was settled. The gears of the team began to move."
 japnavybrief.1.a: "Let us begin proceedings, then."
 japnavybrief.2.t: "Finding a Branch"
 japnavybrief.2.d: "In the end it was the paperwork that did the Yokosuka Naval Logistics and Supply Base in. That was its formal name, anyway; most just called it Yokosuka. It had been relatively undeveloped following the War, with official funds flowing to centres connected to the arteries of the Sphere, places like Shonan and Djakarta. Although funds had dried up, other sources of revenue and supplies had replaced them. Very... interesting sources. And the amount of paperwork done to justify this diversification? Even more interesting.\n\nIn fact, the most interesting part of this was that the paperwork itself appeared to fit a base far larger than the Yokosuka base; analyses created an image of a sprawling centre of military activity, with complex logistics and supply chains. This activity was totally absent from the payrolls, the records at Central HQ, and the public eye. But it was there. The question was: to what end?\n\nSubsidiary factors only improved the suitability of the base. The unguarded paperwork trail that had attracted the team to the base meant that the base was run by management either blinded by their greed or brainless in their actions. Not that Navy men couldn't be both.\n\nTo ensure the smoothest possible course of entry, the team spent a week creating a foolproof alibi; they became members of the local branch of Kotachi United Shipping Supplies, a company run from faraway Sapporo by the Kotachi brothers, Navy veterans with an impeccable record. This record was also entirely fictional, but who'd notice? It was a world of shadows, and the team knew that the best plans always came to fruition in the dark.\n\nSources were traced, money changed hands, meetings were arranged. The game was on."
 japnavybrief.2.a: "Let us lay the traps."
 japnavybrief.3.t: "Draw On Our Friends"
 japnavybrief.3.d: "Tachi was a card-player in his youth, like most disillusioned youth entering the Japanese education system; he knew that the best games were with anonymous players, for no one could rig a round played with strangers. But the games where you wanted to win? You made sure half the board was in your pockets before the first card was dealt. And so Tachi prepared a very different board for the highest-stakes game he had ever played; and he knew he had to win.\n\nThe players had met before, of course, in tracing the anomalies that had led to the Navy branch in the first place; and there were psychological chunks in their armor he could use. Wounded pride was a potent substance, and Tachi manipulated it with surgical precision, saying without ever using words that the Yokosuka folks had simply not given the dues necessary to veterans such as themselves. A missed opportunity here, a broken deal there; surely it added up to...\n\nThen he offered, in deepest sincerity, a solution; if information were to pass hands, say, regarding a certain period of transactions and of supply runs, and even of what they knew of the branch's dealings itself, business that was messy but necessary could take place, and the obstacles to a deeper and lucrative partnership could be... removed. With Kotachi United in lockstep, of course.\n\nAnd they took the bait, all of them. One even offered to use his own contacts to create incongruities in the branch's supply routes for the next month, to demonstrate his own willingness. Tachi almost felt sorry for them, watching them draw up the plans for their demise.\n\nAlmost."
 japnavybrief.3.a: "Well, our men are in."
 japnavybrief.4.t: "Money Talks"
 japnavybrief.4.d: "Kodaira had spent a week poring over the necessary documents; his eyes were aching and his five o'clock shadow was beginning its relapse into full-grown neckbeard, but he had, at last, a picture of the single most glaring issue with the cash flows of the Yokosuka Base. It stood out as a series of glaring red figures, a sea in a paper full of puddles. Whoever was handling this issue was even worse at covering his tracks than the rest of the base, which was certainly saying something.\n\nIt even had a name attached to it; the Internal Logistics Department. How quaint. And ironic. In any case, the department head was likely to be foolish enough to accept something at face value; and in a "friendship establishment meeting" held in a secluded bar, Kodaira began offering mountains of somethings. He hinted at the riches his company had to offer, its links to the lucrative Hawaii pineapple trade route and the positive consequences of cooperation. And implied airily that if certain... procedures were to be identified and disposed of, that cooperation could be made very much more lucrative. But only if they were disposed of.\n\nLike a pig to the feeding trough, the head got his face in the metaphorical dirt. Taking his money with a grin, the head agreed to a series of steps that essentially amounted to blowing up the finances of the base. The pieces would fall just where they needed; at the feet of the investigators.\n\nKodaira smiled. It was the easiest hunt he'd ever had. And the prey was offering its neck in friendship."
 japnavybrief.4.a: "Smile, you idiot, it's practice for the jail photo."
 japnavybrief.5.t: "Go Through the Paperwork"
 japnavybrief.5.d: "The initial glance through the nearly countless gathered documents had already revealed a few notable discrepancies and oddities, enough to justify the raid to the team, but they had to go deeper. They needed to justify the raid to the angry higher-ups who would no doubt storm into their place of work and demand all their evidence. They needed to justify the raid to the very people they were targeting, who would no doubt try to squirm and lie and weasel their way out even if they were captured and brought to trial. Every missing cent had to be documented. Every bullet shell out of place had to be recorded.\n\nThe more bureaucratic of the team members spent sleepless days and nights comparing mundane figures and seeking even the smallest discrepancy. The work was both boring and brutal, and to a normal man it could well be called torture. However, eventually, the documents had been picked apart to less than atoms, and every man on the team had to consider himself impressed at what had been found. The stack of papers documenting all the potential discrepancies and peculiarities was nearly as tall as the original stack of paperwork that was being questioned. The baggy-eyed readers presented their work with pride. They had recorded all issues, their causes, possible explanations and the debunking of those explanations, and everything else that one could possibly need."
 japnavybrief.5.a: "Good work, but shocking results."
 japnavybrief.6.t: "Seduce Them With Promises"
 japnavybrief.6.d: "The best target is one that embraces you as you hold the knife over its back. The most effective way to erase suspicion is through amity, and that is what has been offered. The investigation team has already organized a number of assets within the branch, and now all that needs to be done is to show them that the offer of cooperation truly is genuine, even if it is not. A group so clearly corrupt and greedy as this will respond best to the most classic and simple of bribes: softly rustling bushels of Yen bills.\n\nThe first installment has been sent, promised to be one of many in a long and profitable relationship. Of course, this is a blatant lie, but a lie accompanied by cash is sweeter to the ear and harder to dispute. This influx of cash into their bank accounts will give the raid team the time needed to finalize and carry out all the planned disruptions into the supply chain, and with any luck the unsuspecting targets will be too blinded by their bribe to suspect their new and generous benefactors."
 japnavybrief.6.a: "The carrot is a powerful motivator."
 japnavybrief.7.t: "Coerce Them With Vague Threats"
 japnavybrief.7.d: "The meeting was tense throughout. The branch representative had clearly dealt with corporate threats and foes before. However, he still did not suspect that the man he was meeting with was in fact no corporate representative at all but instead a member of the investigative team whose only goal was to take the whole branch down. Perhaps that showed that he was not as sly as he thought. The so-called corporate representative continued to drop vague hints and subtle nods towards threatening ideas, unspecific enough to be clearly non-binding but real enough to force the other end to cooperate.\n\nAt first the verbal spar was an even fight, each side prepared with smart and powerful arguments and half-threats. However, as it went on, the undercover investigator clearly gained the upper hand. If skill is even, then he with the higher-quality weapons shall prevail, and one side had much better weapons indeed. He dropped clues towards the oddities and irregularities that had just so coincidentally been found, and where those irregularities might be reported to if things did not end well. He held the promise of funding high over the head of the foe, showing him that thing that he could not afford to lose. Eventually the other side crumbled, and the deal was ensured. The target was exposed."
 japnavybrief.7.a: "A genius negotiation."
 japnavybrief.8.t: "They'll Never See Us Coming"
 japnavybrief.8.d: "The investigation team gathered yet again. Every member had bags under their eyes and looked weary from weeks of work. They were in the final stretches, they hoped. They knew their plan had to work. There was no other option. If it did not, all of their lives were over. They could all go to prison or far worse. They would win because they would not be able to live their lives if they lost. They went over their assets and plan again. One could never be too thorough with the stakes this high.\n\nThe Navy has demonstrated thoroughly that they think their newfound business partners are just that and only that. They have given no sign that they suspect anything, and for all intents and purposes they can be treated as oblivious. Because they see it as just another company, even if they sense a threat they can only imagine it is the same threat posed by any other company, which is to say a small one that they can silence or deal with. Even if they get suspicious they will not be even remotely prepared for the attack headed their way.\n\nMost importantly, their paperwork is so dirty and so ineptly kept that it reaches an almost comedic point. Even the relatively small amount the team already has would be enough to send them spiralling into serious damage control. Once the raid is complete and the true extent revealed, they will never recover, and it will likely cause a chain reaction. This could be the case of decades. Despite how nervous the team is, this operation is honestly like shooting fish in a barrel. The Navy stands no chance."
 japnavybrief.8.a: "We're so close."
 japnavybrief.9.t: "And We Sure As Hell Are"
 japnavybrief.9.d: "Finally, the team went over one final review. This was the actual last one before they move on to the next stage. It was a review of reviews of reviews, as everyone involved had been briefed countless times to ensure all data was factored in and all bases covered. Everyone had to be reminded a final time that no matter the consequences, what is being done here is right and just. The Navy has refused to aid the investigation, and the only likely explanation is to save their own hides as the hammer comes down. More importantly than anything else, the Navy is clearly extremely guilty here, and any consequences they will face will be beyond deserved.\n\nThe final preparations were at hand. The team began to transition and move forward. Despite all that has happened, only then did the true gravity of the situation begin to sink in for many of those gathered. They were no longer helping Tachi and Kodaira investigate just another murder. They were ripping the curtain away to expose the corrupt underbelly of a cheating, lying organization, no matter what was really there. They could well be changing Japanese history, for better or for worse."
 japnavybrief.9.a: "Onwards. We're not done just yet."
 #The Investigation Endgame
 japendgame.1.t: "Rotten Soldiers, Moneyed Ships"
 japendgame.1.d: "Day by day the crowds gathered around the headquarters of the Army and Navy grew. Since the press release the public had been up in arms, and rare was the day that passed without an attack on a high-level military officer. Police officers could no longer intervene - the hate was mutual - and the internal police was fighting for its life. The IJA and IJN were, for all intents and purposes, dead in the water.\n\nKodaira and Tachi should have been celebrating at this point; their prime targets had been proven demonstrably guilty. But two niggling issues haunted them, two loose ends begging for resolution.\n\nThe first was drawn from the use of several code words drawn from conversations and interrogations with various military staff, the names of famous cultural landmarks; "Kamakura Buddha", "Kyoto Golden Temple", "Kyoto Silver Temple". All codeword owners were spoken of in a deferential tone and appeared to have pulled strings behind the string-pullers. But the transactions traceable to these codeword accounts did not correspond to the Army or Navy; in fact, even the Imperial General Headquarters appeared to be innocent. So who was above the Headquarters?\n\nThe second was this; the Army and Navy, the civilian government's biggest enemies, were busy collapsing, so why was the civilian government falling to pieces along with them? And did anyone really want to know the answer?"
 japendgame.1.a: "I don't like where this is going."
 japendgame.2.t: "The Private Commission"
 japendgame.2.d: "The press room was rank from consecutive days of public hearings, but not from sweat or exhaustion - the scent of fear was heady, and it was everywhere. The team wore the expressions of children with their hands caught deep in the cookie jar. Ironic, given the circumstances, but nobody was laughing.\n\nKodaira's speech was short to the point of curtness. To prevent further internal interference, a private commission would be set up with the facilitation of the Tokyo Metropolitan and granted extraordinary powers to search, arrest and interrogate across all branches of government. It was the will of the Emperor - and here he paused for emphasis - that the investigation reach just conclusions.\n\nScarcely had the meeting ended when a note was passed to him by a staffer; it was impossible even to catch his disappearing outline in the crowds of journalists. Kodaira opened the note, noting the letterhead.\n\n"Stop before you are encircled and destroyed. Your fight was brave, but it ends here. We are watching.\n\nYours, the Thousand Temples."\n\nBaffled, he raised his head just in time to catch Tachi's cry. "Kodaira, our leads in the Navy are in trouble! Orders from the Diet-""
 japendgame.2.a: "Assigned to Fusoshima? Where the hell is that?"
 japendgame.3.t: "Faster, Further, Deeper"
 japendgame.3.d: "As the team hastily reassembled their work, damage reports confirmed the worst. Some kind of purge was taking place in the Army and Navy ministries, and it was being directed not by the command staff but from the dizzying heights of civilian bureaucracy. Some of their prominent leads had been caught up in the chaos. Something was very wrong.\n\nKodaira and Tachi were running out of time.\n\nThe crisis meeting stretched into the long hours; many on the team had let their unspoken fears take hold of them and wanted to shut down the investigation before their own heads wound up on executive platters. What emerged was a consensus that the work had to be done as quickly as possible, to attempt to outflank the Government.\n\nArrest warrants and lists of suspects were hastily compiled, and the team divided into ministry sections to tackle each list, to hit the Government as hard as they could. If they couldn't manage a full sweep of the Thousand Temples, they could at least nab enough of them to kill momentum.\n\nNobody said the obvious, but it was on their minds regardless; time was the only insurance they had left, and the results had to come in before their own arrests did. The Japanese police had a 99 percent conviction rate. Even for their own men."
 japendgame.3.a: "We're working for our goddamned lives."
 japendgame.4.t: "Betrayal From On High"
 japendgame.4.d: "Everyone knew that the Bureau of Public Order, in theory the Civilian Police's representative to the Emperor, was in reality a fair-weather friend of their juniors. The Bureau seldom did its assigned work these days, focusing instead on arcane power games in the Byzantine structures of the Empire. Even so, nobody had quite expected the about face the Bureau now made.\n\nIn orders crafted to maximise humiliation, the Bureau essentially dressed down the entire team for acting above their pay grade, station and status before the Emperor. This was fairly normal treatment, and to be expected; but what surprised the team was the blunt demand of the corpus of the investigation, evidence and all, to be moved to Bureau headquarters and safekept for "an indefinite period". The reasons cited were the preservation of the dignity of the Government and the Emperor, as well as the need to safeguard potentially sensitive data. Uninspiring, but effective.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances the orders ordering them to stop could at least have been published, but this order was classified so highly that to release it would have been an immediate death sentence for most of Kodaira and Tachi's team. It was an outrage and an impediment of justice, but you could admire the handiwork.\n\nDazed and confused, the team halted work. A missive seething with rage and vitriol was drafted, redrafted and hastily sent to the shredder before it could do any harm."
 japendgame.4.a: "Stabbed in the back! And they're to blame..."
 japendgame.5.t: "Resistance from Without"
 japendgame.5.d: "No one was sure when the low-grade civil war brewing in the Diet and in the Imperial government at large had quietened to a simmer, but somehow the worst had passed. Nobody knew why, but most of the team were thankful that the world around them had remained somewhat intact even as the military fell apart. It was reassuring to know that Japan hadn't yet become a military state and was in fact increasingly unlikely to do so, given the state of its armed forces.\n\nOne evening a letter was received from the Imperial General Headquarters, in anonymous typescript and generic government-issue letterhead. It was similar in content to countless other missives received that week, all of which ordered the team to cease and desist under the pretext of protecting the dignity of the Emperor. What was different was what came after. The signage of the letter read like a who's who of the most powerful members of the Imperial government; senior members of the Diet and Cabinet, the Army, the Navy and the Headquarters itself had all penned signatures in person. Kodaira's files indicated that half of these individuals were embroiled in intrigue against each other in the upper heavens of the government's chambers. If this were the case, how did they all end up signing the same petition?\n\nThe answer arrived in the form of a team from the headquarters the following week, brandishing a warrant for immediate audit for suspected treasonous activities against the Emperor. As they searched the office (ignoring the cries of the already overburdened investigation team) Kodaira found in their warrant the seals of a half-dozen major ministerial appointments; but above them was the thick, unmistakeable seal of the Kokusei's council.\n\nIt was now clear to everyone who the Thousand Temples were, and why the Government had closed ranks. What could be done to stop them, however..."
 japendgame.5.a: "My God, how deep does this run?"
 japendgame.6.t: "The Government Lockdown"
 japendgame.6.d: "Kodaira was tired, even by the standards of the metropolitan police of the Jewel of the East. A sleepless man for a sleepless city, dancing on the edge of collapse. The investigation and months of his team's time appeared to be slipping into the gutter, and there was little he could do to stop it; he was reminded of the old stories of children playing with the Gods, pretending at equal status.\n\nHe pored through the documents. The seals on the letter corresponded to senior positions in the Government, but they seemed to have come from somewhere else; analysis of the seals' imprints revealed that this was a wax used for financial purposes. Why had the letter been stamped with accounting seals rather than executive ones? And what did this mean for the investigation?\n\nA cursory search of the invoicing records the team had captured revealed nothing. All the seals' they had on record corresponded to senior executives whose names they already knew in ministries slated for audit. Pictures of contracts they'd captured revealed nothing as well; the seals' identity and function eluded him. Kodaira worked through the night, chasing the paperwork in expanding spirals, and by the next morning he had an answer for a very confused Tachi.\n\nThe seals on the letter had been found in the Minezaka records they'd seized in the fishing factory, and the peculiar thing was that the seals hadn't been found in an isolated one or two places. Out of 371 documents seized by the initial investigation, 320 of them had a match for one or more seals used. It had slipped past the initial investigation (most government firms had ministerial seals for documentation and approval) but it could no longer be ignored.\n\nThe government wasn't above this scandal - it was right there in the mud with the rest of them."
 japendgame.6.a: "Another set of criminals to chase."
 japendgame.7.t: "The Facade Cracks"
 japendgame.7.d: "They'd trained Tachi in rudimentary middlemen tactics in Hostage Negotiation seminars, but Tachi had never expected to use them like this. Two teams of the most powerful agencies in Japan were snapping at each other, with members of his own team desperately trying to get both sides to stand down. Hands to holsters, the Police Department held its breath.\n\nThe Imperial General Headquarters had sent a team of specialist bureaucrats to commandeer what evidence could be taken to safeguard it for the Emperor's protection in a facility guarded by themselves. It was unfortunate that they'd happened to meet a team from the Bureau of Public Order sent to commandeer what evidence could be taken for the exact same purpose. Now they glared at each other, the team heads practically throwing warrants at each other in efforts to prove the other an inferior in carrying out the Emperor's will.\n\nLooking at the two of them, Tachi had an idea. Didn't the Art of War say that enemies were best defeated when divided? And didn't they possess significant reserves of evidence that everyone wanted - but only one agency could keep?\n\nThe plan formed in his mind then, and festered through the rest of the day into a full-blown strategy. If they could pull it off, survival would be a possibility. And slim hope was better than none at all."
 japendgame.7.a: "Divide, Conquer... Survive."
 japendgame.8.t: "Chinks in the Armor"
 japendgame.8.d: "At this point the team was so used to overnight meetings called at an hour's notice that scarcely anyone really cared about the infringement on personal time. Between the 10 or so members gathered only a couple had children, and all were so exhausted by the investigative efforts that few had actually visited their parents in months. Even so, they hoped, perhaps this would be the last push, the final struggle to some imagined victory. And as the details were laid out in the flickering lights of the rooms, that hope only grew.\n\nKodaira and Tachi reorganized the team for the umpteenth time, focusing on three major conflict vectors under the ragged Imperial umbrella; the Bureau of Public Order, the Diet, and the Army and Navy. The latter were undergoing a full-scale internal "reorganization", complete with occasional gunfight, but still possessed enough internal cohesion to be a potential threat to the other two. And the plan was simple at heart; turn the three agencies against each other in such a way that the conflict would escalate and spill into the courts, forcing the release of the documents they needed.\n\nThe Trojan Horse lay ready for entrance into three separate Troys, a series of invoices with seals from all three agencies, with Minezaka logistics, Army money, and Navy shipping. More than enough to nab all three - but just enticing enough to convince each agency to fight the other two for ownership. And if all three agencies were to be seduced at the same time...\n\nTachi smiled. It was time to turn the Government upside down. One last roll of the die."
 japendgame.8.a: "One last gambit."
 japendgame.9.t: "Smile at the Ministers"
 japendgame.9.d: "The offer was transparent appeasement at best. That was really the best that could be managed, and given the dire straits that every branch of the government were in even an offer like this could easily be the best one the Diet might receive. After all, they were on the brink too, and they would have to take any opportunity possible to try and save themselves as what seemed like the entire government collapsed around them into the boiling sea of corruption and disorganization.\n\nThe proposal was simple, if worded to be long-winded and noble to flatter the Diet: given the conflicts of interest elsewhere in the government and the possibility for further damage, the Diet was the best organization left to safeguard evidence regarding the investigation. Their cooperation would surely shield them from much of the upcoming chaos, and their assistance would prove their dedication to justice and the innocence of many Diet members. They would safeguard the evidence from the corrupt and prying eyes elsewhere in the government and Navy, reaping all the benefits of doing so. Tachi and Kodaira had worded the letter to be just right, hopefully appealing to the sense of urgency and desire to remain safe that the Diet members all felt. They hoped that it would be enough to win an ally, at least for the moment."
 japendgame.9.a: "Flattery is an ever-powerful tool."
 japendgame.10.t: "Wave False Hope at the Soldiers"
 japendgame.10.d: "Kodaira's contacts in the military had dried up faster than a Saharan drought after the investigation started to have real repercussions, but he knew that they were one of the last hopes for the two detectives. The entire government and the military were gunning to seize evidence and shut down the investigation, and Kodaira knew that they were all in far too deep to let this go now. He would see justice or die trying, and he would take any help he could get to see that happen.\n\nSeveral of his old contacts, people he had once considered true friends, flat-out refused to meet with him. Eventually, however, he had met with a few of them, those who knew there was no other option. The offer was simple: they and their soldiers in the Army and Navy would safeguard evidence pertinent to the investigation. In return, their reputation could still be safeguarded, and perhaps they would survive and make it to the other side after this whole debacle settled down. Every time he made the offer, he knew it was a lie, but the people he talked to were so desperate for any chance to escape that they agreed. Even a hope that they knew deep down was false was better than the chasm that faced them currently. Kodaira just wished that they had never put themselves in this situation in the first place."
 japendgame.10.a: "One last favor, old friends?"
 japendgame.11.t: "Wink at the Bureau"
 japendgame.11.d: "Tachi was tired. He had been working nonstop for literal months now. He truly could not remember the last time he had slept properly. He had gotten five hours of sleep a few weeks ago and it felt like an eternal slumber compared to what he was usually running on. This general tiredness made it extremely difficult to conduct a proper meeting with an outside representative, which was exactly what Tachi was trying to do. A lot hung on this meeting, and if the Bureau chose not to comply, it could be the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nTachi decided to for once in this entire ordeal to cut the shit and talk frankly. No more flowery language and dancing around what was really on the table. He set out the offer as so: the Bureau of Public Order would assist in the storage and safekeeping of evidence so that hostile and potentially corrupt forces within the government could not seize them. In exchange, Tachi promised that if the evidence was secured then the investigation could be turned to politically benefit the Bureau. His up-front manner surprised the people he was meeting with, but the response was promising. They continued their endless game of double meanings and non-incriminating vague half-statements, but Tachi was able to gather that they were accepting the deal. He left the building with a tad of optimism and resolved to take a nap sometime."
 japendgame.11.a: "They might just help us."
 japendgame.12.t: "Release the Bait"
 japendgame.12.d: "As Tachi spoke into the microphone, Kodaira anxiously watching aside, his voice trembled with a sense that every word he gave to the radio waves would be quoted in Japanese history forever. The inner circle of the government the investigation team selected to release the transaction invoices' history and extensive documentation is not an airtight one, yet the extraordinary circumstances they cite threaten the future of the entire nation itself. He ends the broadcast and sends the files to the officials listening in shock, and in less than an hour later the three agencies are set aflame.\n\nWith the crimes of the Army, Navy, and Diet implicated with dozens of pieces of evidence for every transgression, government hearings have been filed and are already set in order to acquire the damning records. The halls of Tokyo are filled with the disorganized shouting and the exasperated screaming of those named, each agency clamouring for its access, each giving different reasons as to how they are fit to secure it "for the good of the Japanese people and the Emperor." It seems as if their desperation will be for naught."
 japendgame.12.a: "Can there even be a victor?"
 japendgame.13.t: "Divide, Conquer, Repeat"
 japendgame.13.d: "If there ever was any hope in this crisis being resolved calmly and diplomatically, it's gone now. The common front entrusted with the information has completely collapsed upon itself. Governmental officials have fallen upon each other, like a pack of starving rats, stalking and praying at night, sensing weakness in their brethren. The cultivated contacts from the police have been put to effect, and now offer to help out all three agencies with their pursuits. The giant bureaucracies and entities controlling Japan will soon find themselves trapped by the rules they themselves made.\n\nThe agencies have already hastily granted wide-open access to the police investigation team, quickly moving to secure all of the transcriptions. The hearings held themselves have resulted in the granting of access to voluminous incendiary material surrounding the agencies' dealings with each other. As all three players smear each other with allegations and evidence, the hands of the puppet-masters above will never be clean again."
 japendgame.13.a: "Let's see what kind of trouble they can get themselves into."
 japendgame.14.t: "Tumbling Down"
 japendgame.14.d: "Prime Minister Ino Hiroya, implicated in making concessions in over thirty key areas of military autonomy. Deputy Ikeda Hayato, recently resigned, proven to accepted hundreds of thousands in bribes. From Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichirō to Security Minister Inukai Takeru. Hundreds of more names, from the Army, from the Navy, from the Diet, all complicit, their desperate scrambling to prevent the outflow of information horrifically failing. The list of names only grows, and those who desire to be in the know now know.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before the headlines of newspapers will blare with the cries of corruption, the pitcher's ears hearing past our best efforts at censorship. The situation has become evident that any hope of controlling the damage has been forgotten, if the past could ever ever be forgotten. As the Zaibatsu begin to collapse and the cabinet reaches its end, it seems as if a new era for Japan is about to dawn. What's done is done. The government has let everyone and itself down."
 japendgame.14.a: "It all returns to nothing."
 japendgame.15.t: "The Politicians Knew"
 japendgame.15.d: "Things had been quiet for longer than they had been in weeks when a messenger appeared at the front of the department. His message was short and tersely delivered: the Government would comply with the investigation to its fullest ability. He brought with him dozens of binders, each big enough to carry perhaps years worth of data. They were all quickly dropped off and the representative left.\n\nTachi and Kodaira were quickly informed. They looked at each other for a moment, sharing a glance of simultaneous eagerness, fear, and confusion, before quickly standing up and heading down to grab the binders. After a few trips back and forth to gather them all, they each grabbed the top binder from their stack and started to read.\n\nBoth of their binders contained the same general kinds of info. It was not pretty. All the transcripts were true. Paper after paper documented truly staggering amounts of money flowing from the Navy and the Army into the accounts of politicians. The further they read, the higher profile the names became. Soon they were no longer truly reading the reports, just skimming them and noting every single name they came across. Not a single innocent person was mentioned from the front to the back.\n\nKodaira picked up another binder, having already gotten through several, and started to read. This one was different, however. This did not document any suspicious transactions or politicians, at least not in the same way as the other. This was a full government-ordered report on the state of corruption. It had been chartered and viewed by the highest in the government, and then tossed aside. A single note at the end stated that the report was to be archived in high-clearance storage and forgotten, for the security of Japan. No, for the security of the people running it."
 japendgame.15.a: "The rot sinks deeper."
 japendgame.16.t: "The Accountants Knew"
 japendgame.16.d: "Everybody was afraid now; the central board was riddled with notes of various fonts and styles, and the corridors of the rooms were trodden half to dust, but no one even dared make small-talk. The energy was channeled into work so frantic it seemed like a burst of public madness; talk veered and jolted between talk of leads and the next step, the next agency to find.\n\nKodaira and Tachi found solace in their most recent routine. To properly conduct an accounting audit, an uninvolved neutral agency had to be found; they had devoted themselves to finding it. With a book of the most influential auditing agencies and accounting firms in Japan in hand, they holed themselves up in the rooms for a week, working their way past the streams of data. Slowly the web began to unravel.\n\nThe accountants involved had covered their tracks with exceeding competence, but certain irregular patterns were suspiciously similar to others, and if they could be proven to link to an accounting firm, the firm could be supposed to be compromised. The name of the firm was crossed out on the books and the search would continue.\n\nName by name, number by number, the anonymity of the accountants began to collapse. And the lists of the book grew shorter, and shorter, and broke into pieces which shrunk, and shrunk, and shrunk again.\n\nOne day Kodaira woke up early, as was his nature, and took a browse through the cross-ridden book in the hall. And then another, and another. He managed, with great effort, to keep from screaming. Instead he sunk into his chair, half-sobbing, to be found by a worried Tachi.\n\nEvery single name on the book had been crossed out."

 japendgame.17.t: "They All Knew"
 japendgame.17.d: "Soejima Shinzō gave a brief resignation speech, showing no emotion and leaving as quickly as possible. He was found in the morning, dead for approximately four hours. He was on his side, keeled over into a shallow pool of his own blood. His hands still gripped the hilt of a very old and very expensive wakizashi, a centuries-old antique and one of his most prized possessions. His face was frozen in a sad frown, his eyes as empty dead as they had been when he announced his resignation.\n\nThe police quickly rushed to inform his son, but they found him missing too. There was a brief panic until it was discovered that he had skipped town on a plane less than an hour after his father's body had officially been found. He was on his way to India, officially on business, in truth because the entire world was collapsing around him. There was little chance of catching him now, and even less reason in trying.\n\nJust a few hours later, yet another heap of documents emerged. The Minezaka corporation was now shown to have almost certainly assisted the government, Army, and Navy with their operations. They had used their business expertise and many assets to shuffle money around, skim just enough for nobody to notice, and keep anyone who might object off the scent. They had even audited the vast majority of the accounts involved in order to keep suspicion at a minimum. Every level of power was now implicated with solid evidence. Hardly an innocent soul remained."

 japendgame.18.t: "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"
 japendgame.18.d: "Kodaira poured a glass of whiskey for himself and immediately drank it down before pouring himself another and offering one to Tachi. The younger one wearily accepted. He had been avoiding alcohol as much as he could over the past days given the concentration needed for his work, but he just couldn't take it anymore. He took the glass with a mumbled thanks and savored the harsh flavor.\n\nA lesser ranking officer poked in his head and delivered some more papers. Kodaira initially tried to decline, saying to just put it to the side so they could get to it in due time, but the officer said this was different. This had just come from the Ino Clique itself. That got Kodaira to stand up and snatch the papers right from the officers hands. He struggled to keep his eyes steady as they ran up and down the paper.\n\nHe sighed and sat down before handing the tiny stack to Tachi. The younger detective read over them as well, then looked at Kodaira in shock. The clique was now agreeing to cooperate with the investigation fully. Anything the team asked for, as long as it was relevant to the case, would be delivered. All they wanted in exchange was a guarantee of safety. The Ino Clique would be secure, and in return everything and everyone else would be fair game."
 japendgame.18.a: "Pour another glass."
 japendgame.19.t: "The Verdict"
 japendgame.19.d: "The final hearings were miserable affairs. Each one was just hour after hour of details about the truly, hideously, astoundingly corrupt affairs of nearly every branch of the nation. After they were completed, the last pieces of evidence had finally been officially compiled and reviewed and were incorporated into the report. The report was titanic, large enough to make one wonder if every citizen in the Empire was being accused. After a final day of nervous preparations and finalizations, the report was released.\n\nBy the next day, literally hundreds of arrest warrants had been issued. Diet members, cabinet members, politicians, businessmen, previously admirable figures, all were stopped and brought in as mere criminals. They were joined by a staggering amount of generals, admirals, and officers, both major and minor. A good number were yet to be captured, and they continued to trickle in as the fallout grew harsher.\n\nThe Minezaka corporation was on the absolute brink of collapse. The vast majority of its remaining leadership had been incarcerated, and what little remained was extraordinarily unprepared to deal with this. It was teetering and would be knocked over by a slight breeze or push, and this was more akin to a city-shredding hurricane. Every sign pointed to a collapse in consumer confidence. There was no coming back for the Minezaka corporation.\n\nThere was no coming back for anyone."

 #Yasuda Collapse
 japyasuda.1.t: "An Unpleasant Finding"
 japyasuda.1.d: "Yasuda Banking. Yasuda Fire Insurance. Yasuda Investments. Yasuda Innovation And Enterprises. The Yasuda leviathan slouches like a beast over corporate Japan, and it leaves a long, oily shadow. The Group's core property in downtown Tokyo is a swirling mess of endless hallways and bureaucrats, many belonging to other Big Four firms (whispered of as though they are foreign countries) and the Government. And the halls are full of chatter this week, as the investigation has captured the minds of the company just as it has captured their newspresses.\n\nAsato Kokei is a recent arrival fresh from the university, and he believes he's stumbled onto something big. Very big indeed. Errors have begun to proliferate on the balance sheet of Yasuda Bank, which is worrying, especially since he's in a junior role in the Bank's accounting division. But what is more perplexing still are the sources of the errors: a series of large anonymous numbers attributable to Minezaka Group. The company's been all over the press recently, and for the wrong reasons: and yet no one will tell him why the company under investigation has paid sums of money to Yasuda, and for no discernible reason at all.\n\nToday he's scheduled a meeting with his boss, in the hopes of arranging some assistance and perhaps netting a promotion out of the matter. After all, it's a matter of profit, and profit is Yasuda's bread and butter. The boss even takes time out of his schedule to meet him personally, which is rare. The reason the boss is so willing to meet him becomes clear when the boss slips him an envelope, with an apologetic look, the same evening."

Ahem, it won't matter soon enough, haha, we give all our employees nicknames after the first week. Oh, hi, Sumito! (Whispering) We call him the Snoring Cat, because in his office he, well, snores and lies on his desk. You'd better hope we don't give you a similar nickname - you're not protected like Sumito is.\n\nAnyway, the Flow, is that right? We're in charge of Accounts for the Special and General Accounts, the two main accounts for the War Ministry, and our job is simple, see this spreadsheet? There's a Flow and it works like this. Other firms spend money on bonds which are bought from the General Account. The revenue from this is channeled to the Special Account, because the Special Account handles all our transactions with the Army and Navy - they funnel it through a firm you might've heard of, called Minezaka Group.\n\nSo the money goes from firms to the General Account to the Special Account and then to Minezaka and the Armed Forces, so the Army and Navy can play games with their guns and ships. Complicated, but it's like water flowing through pools at the Zen Garden. Flow, see?\n\nWait. Okay, you see the numbers here? That indicates that this stream has jammed up. Yasuda, I think. Damn, wait, this sheet is jammed up too. And - and this one - and that one - what the hell is going on? Half the Flow is jammed up from these numbers alone! And this is just the past week!\n\nMitsue!

Now that a half-dozen firms are under investigation, I think it doesn't matter anymore. My boss, Hiromi - he is a strong man, good to his children and his wife - was found with a glass of industrial bleach in his hand yesterday.\n\nThe simple truth is this. Yasuda, my work, everything has been found out. I hoped the nausea of working in a rotten bank would keep to the workplace, but now it is out, you should know too. Our funneling money to the Army and Navy so they could play games with billions of Yen. Our payments from Minezaka to keep us quiet while they rolled in the mud. And the ugly shadow of the Kokusei over everything. Everyone knows now. And the bonds which keep Yasuda afloat have burned to ashes.\n\nI want you to tell my son this: I have always loved him. I always will. And I am so sorry I can barely breathe as I write these letters. I hope he will think of me as a man who has done his duty to his family, not as the rotten shadow I truly was. Perhaps he will grow up better.\n\nAnd Haruka, I want you to know - I think I am in love with you. You have never heard it, have you? Not from my own lips? But when I see you rushing about the kitchen or teaching Hiro, I am convinced that I could walk from one end of the Empire to the other and I would still be drawn back to you. I love you, Haruka, and what I do next I do to keep you safe. I hope you will remarry, for no man could be fortunate enough to find a wife like you on his own.\n\nMy secretary will deliver this message. Enclosed is 500,000 Yen for my funeral costs.

 japyasuda.5.d: "Yamanashi Prefecture, Chateau Mercian. Kikyogahara Merlot, about 20 years vintage. (Specially ordered by the Imperial Palace, given the date.) Oda Masashiro nods, closes his eyes. Cold, mildly acidic taste. Goes well with crackers, less well with substance. Somewhere in the distance people chatter, but he can't hear it. Numbers, instruments, tools. Red lights glimmering in his mind, trails of fear and trembling.\n\nA voice comes closer, annoyingly insistent. "Director Masashiro! We have finished our meeting!" He waves them away. He knows more than he needs to, at this stage. It is only a matter of time. Only a matter of time till the firm goes down like the boats in the Great Wave off Kanagawa wood-print.\n\nStill slightly buzzed from the fine wine, he makes his way to the elevator, swaying all the way up. He reaches, steadies himself, pulls himself out of the cage. Tokyo sprawls before him, a lazy beast in glittering metal and dull concrete. Soon it'll swallow him too. Maybe the ride down the gullet will be entertaining.\n\nSomeone bows to him, even more inebriated than he is. Dim recognition: Chief Financial Officer Hisagi. Hisagi says, haltingly, "Mushashiro - wait: I wanna-." He reaches to stop Hisagi, says something comforting, but leashes the habit. They are both men on a cliff, and the ground is crumbling. What can he offer?\n\nTogether they sit on an air conditioning unit and wait for the vermillion sunset. Wordlessly they watch the neighbouring tower, and like fledgelings kicked from nests the falling of the workers, one by one, off its roof."

 japyasuda.6.t: "Poisoned Cups for Thirsty Mouths"
 japyasuda.6.d: "The Yasuda Building is pretty from a distance, a glittering steel-lined endeavour built in Neo-Art Deco style, with sparse Japanese highlights. It was a breath of fresh air in the endless architectural drone of downtown Tokyo. A monument to the Japanese psyche - whether to its nobility or its insanity depended on the eye of the beholder. One could easily ignore the graffiti sprayed on its exterior, the angry crowds mobbing it day and night, and the police officers trying to keep the edifice safe. From a bird's eye view Yasuda would always be pretty.\n\nThis was what the man who would finally destroy Yasuda Group thought, sitting in the neon glare reflected in the taxi window, as the protesters floated by in a smear of raindrops.\n\nThe man wrestling past the crowds and made his way into the lobby. Being slight in build it took him a good five minutes to writhe through the masses. He entered the lobby's sprawling entrance, noting the burnished doors, and took the elevator to the 37th floor. Padding through the carpeted floorboards, he made his way to the Board of Directors, opened his suitcase, passed the assembled Board members a sheet of paper - and that was it.\n\nYasuda had been bought by its government - for a steep price. That price was the arrest of most of the Board, the Chief Officers, and the CEO, and the firing of salarymen in their hundreds and thousands: all floated away in the howling monsoon winds and rain through a stroke of the pen. They would join the rest of the losses in the storm buffeting Tokyo, one which would soon swallow Japan whole."

And they have in their papers the notices that will finally end Yasuda's death throes.\n\nIn parting, Yasuda's Temporary Board shakes hands gingerly with the team, with a sense of finality. Long-festering limbs are finally being amputated from the rotting corpse. It's almost peaceful. Sumitomo will have to deal with the fallout. And what if the rest of the Big Three (formerly Big Four) object? To the winner belong the spoils, and Sumitomo has determined that they are the definite winner here.\n\nThe feeling of peace is rapidly disabused when the legal team step out into a near riot: disillusioned public, old Yasuda hands cut loose by the bailout, and rival firms are mobbing the police, who are firing into the air. In the chaos one of the members faints, and his papers are grabbed by the mob and set afire. Yasuda might be done, but Japan is not done with Yasuda."

He shrugged his coat off and threw it on a rack before pinching his nose and leaning against the closed front door. His family were distracted in the house, but he was suffering with panicking heartbeats and singeing anxieties as he curled up in the dark corners of his home.\n\nAs a result of recent economic chaos raging throughout the Empire, he was one of countless salarymen fired without a moment's notice as his employer sought to make cuts to survive, leaving him without a job or stable income. The news hollowed out his chest when it was broken to him, and the thought of telling his family that they could no longer pay the bills was killing him in every breathing second. They had very little savings; it would mean defaulting on the mortgage and going homeless. Two beautiful children and his loving wife in the streets because he couldn't look after them, he thought, defeated, as his eyes glossed over.\n\nBarely pulling himself together, Mr. Nakamura crawled out of the darkness of the hallway's shadows and into the living room to embrace his daughters and kiss his wife. He held them tight, knowing that they were all he had left in this world. The walls of the room looked alien to him as he understood they wouldn't be his for much longer. His lip quivered and throat stiffened; they would have to find out soon that he failed them as a father, as a husband, and as a man."

He had just been evicted from the youth hostel he was staying in; the little money he had left after being made redundant in the recent economic turmoil could no longer afford him a place to stay. He was young, only twenty years of age, and roamed the dark avenues of the capital in search of a quiet corner to sleep.\n\nThe rain crackled and hammered down into the concrete sidewalks; streetlight beams twinkled in the puddles that freckled the twisting city roads Kane trudged down. Not a soul could be seen in the empty streets to pay Kane a moment of attention, as he was a stray in his own home. Afraid and alone, he sniffled and wiped his glossy eyes with his soaked fingers as he stumbled down dirtier routes for somewhere dry.\n\nHe found a back-alley corner, packed in with metal waste disposal units and damp newspapers, and hurled his belongings into the hideaway. Tears flowed from Kane's eyes, drenching his dirtied white shirt more than his soaking-wet hair dripping down his face. He curled up by his belongings, doing his best to ignore the roaring rainfall and putrid smells of the waste bins, and wept for hours, defeated by his remote solitude in the shadows of the city he had loved as a young boy."

Office regulars sat lazily at their desks, pecking at their keyboards, pretending to be hard at work. The scent of coffee and cigarettes choked the ventilation, and printers whirred on in the background. The signs were, at first, ignored. A few accountants glanced worryingly at the stock market data screen, but neglected to investigate further. News clippings were scattered here and there, though everyone seemed to ignore the sections documenting the porpoising state of the stock market.\n\nNow, this story could not be further from reality. Countless corporate buildings had fallen into chaos after the Yasuda Crash, with law enforcement regularly patrolling the fallout of street skirmishes between security and redundant employees. Within the offices, the shattered shards of glass cabinets skidded across the carpeted floors as employees broke into gases to prize off trophies they could get their hands on. People had stopped watching the percentages and prices; they raided and stole what they could before they too were as bankrupt as their former employers were.\n\nThe sudden and shocking fall of the Yasuda Corporation was predicted by few and expected by even fewer across the islands of Japan, but all would come to taste the starving hysteria of desperate fathers, brothers, and sons trying to save their skins in the economy's plummet to its doom."

She rubbed his fingers, tickled his belly, and sang him lullabies, but nothing would silence the wailing child she held in her arms. She had been awake for hours now, sweating and exhausted with a piercing migraine, desperate to get her child to at least quieten his wails so she too could sleep.\n\nHer husband, who was strangely not home at such a late hour, had recently lost his job in the en-mass layoff of employees working for corporations struggling to survive the economic crises, and could provide very little amounts of money for his family to survive off of each day. As a result, the baby was hungry, but there was not enough food in the house to feed him. Her untucked breast was sore and chafed in the last-ditch attempts hours ago to feed her son, but to no avail. She could not provide the breastmilk for her baby, and a sense of defeat loomed over her enervated body.\n\nShe continued to rock her screaming baby in the darkened rooms of her dingy apartment, praying that her child would finally come to rest, but the cries only continued throughout the early morning. Drenched in sweat, her dirty nightgown hung over her tired shoulders as she could barely stand up for much longer. She threw herself back into a chair, and rocked the baby with a drowsy passion, distressed and debilitated by her sufferings as an isolated mother in the dullness of the night."

 japyasuda.12.d: "Police siren lights twinkled in the pattering rain falling down upon Tokyo's night time evening streets. The sky was a dark blue, overcast with gloomy clouds that casted a great shadow over the mighty city. A small crowd had gathered around a crime scene outside of the Tokyo Stock Exchange building from behind blue wooden barriers, each guarded by a policeman in a drenched raincoat. The chatter and murmur of passersby that filled the streets were drowned out by the splash of rainfall and the echoing of police car sirens.\n\nBehind the stretched tape, police barriers, and patrolling law enforcement agents were the violently disfigured bodies of some of Tokyo's top economists. They were public names; they had written in newspapers, spoken on television, and were regulars in the facility. Now, however, their bodies were bludgeoned and pulverized in the black and puddle-ridden roads from the impact of leaping from the roof, in what the police department is considering a suicide pact between the men. According to recent records over the last few weeks, their invested stocks and shares have plummeted in value since the crash, and their invested wealth had practically disappeared in mere moments.\n\nMortgage default rates have skyrocketed; banks have begun to fail as loans could not be repaid; entire corporations have declared bankruptcies; most alarming of all, reported homelessness and deaths have begun to fill up official records for in most of the prefectures. The recent economic crises afflicting Japan have spawned many of these events across the empire, and although many big names in Japan have remained reactive in following the effects of the turbulence, millions in the middle and working classes have been plunged into the conditions of a despairing economic depression. Examined and prodded by investigators, the men's lifeless bodies were left uncovered in the rain beneath the towering stock exchange building."

He looked up from the floor of the metro station, onlookers glaring in amusement and confusion. A couple passersby spat on him, others laughed out loud in front of his gloomy figure. The sweat continued to roll, forming a puddle beneath his heavy legs. He snatched a piece of cloth from his reeking tuxedo and wiped his forehead. It did little to alleviate the perspiring steam from his balding scalp. His glasses dropped to the ground, under which a commuter "accidentally" stomped forward. Losing all hope, he pushed himself to his knees, grovelling at the feet of the people passing by.\n\n"Please! A few coins! I just need to get home, please!"\n\nA crowd formed, whispering between themselves about the humiliating sight in front of them. A porky businessman, no doubt, fresh from the stock market floors. With a snap of the fingers, it was gone. A lifetime of investments and buildup from speculation, all vanished in an instant and with it gone the man had no choice but to display his shame to thousands for a few coins. The station was filled with rushing onlookers and commuters, but emptied of any mercy or compassion. A young man, with fire bellowing in his eyes, stepped forward and whispered: "No". He then spat onto the businessman's forehead, and with that, the crowd dispersed for the trains. The businessman slumped back against the wall, dejected, the spit joining his sweat."

Crashes of metal and furniture sounded from above as shattered window panes fell into the streets, exploding in a glittery array of glass daggers on the concrete pavement. Screams and wails followed, and roars of curious crowds gathered outside the Yasuda building had surrounded the paved entrance to the offices.\n\nThe police arrived at the scene a few minutes after the swathes of civilians had gathered to investigate the commotion, and set up barriers to shepherd people away from the courtyard. Suddenly, another great cry came from the crowds as more great crashes and pounds came from the block just ahead of them.\n\nFormer employees, clearly caught in fist fights and skirmishes in the building, scurried out of the main entrance to the offices in front of the police, carrying trophies, watches, and other small valuables in their arms. They tumbled down the short steps at lightning speeds and dragged small trinkets and goods with them, presumably stolen from cabinets to sell in the market for much needed relief. The crowds gasped in horror to see them clamber across the courtyards, and the mere sight of such an outrageous chaos bewildered law enforcement attempting to calm the crowds."

She looked into the tiny window, into the falling snow, wondering if others like her shared the same fate. Under her feet was a suitcase, "graciously" provided by her captors. Perhaps there was a tinge of light in the darkness. Yaling heard the creak of the door; another woman walked into her room. Feng, clad in a simple dress, sat on the other side of the room. "Did you get dismissed?" Yaling held up the slip.\n\nFeng sighed, slumping against the wall. "No. They still want me, I think." Yaling could not figure out whether she felt bad or relieved for her friend. In truth, she believed Feng was feeling the same for her. "I-I'm not sure if either of our situations are good. You can't speak Japanese and act like one." A pause, frozen cold, descended upon the room. "And I have to continue working here."\n\nYaling had not thought of the future. Outside of the women's quarters, she had no connections - and barely enough money to last her a month. After she packed her meager belongings and went out into the cold, what would happen? Could she even go back home? "Only fate knows my future. I just hope we'll meet again." Yaling's eyes watered, as her head pounded from holding the tears back. Sniffling, she continued. "You're a good woman, Feng. I hope you do well." She nodded, sensing that she should leave. Yaling kneeled in front of her bed, opening the briefcase and packing her clothes. After today, she would go to the wolves."

 japyasuda.16.d: "Fresh snow covered the sidewalks of the city, as Yaling shivered, her threadbare coat practically unusable. Snowflakes fell on her hair, clinging onto the strands. She walked by restaurants, where patrons enjoyed warm food and drink. Oh, how Yaling anguished. In her fitful dreams, when she was not reliving years of horror, she dreamed of a better life. Free from her memories, free to just live. Free to live the promises that brought her here. She looked into the window of a closed store, staring at her reflection.\n\nThe years had sapped her youth and strength. If only I didn't fall for those lies, she thought forlornly. She dissolved her reflection, not wanting to relive the cruel past. Yaling trudged on, hope abandoning her soul. Walking past other pedestrians, she received strange looks. She looked away from any men, and women whispered as soon as they saw her.\n\nIn her heart, she knew why. They did not know her previous profession - she wished she didn't. But her appearance was one of poverty: her face was dirtied, hair uncombed, and eyes bagged. Not even the poorest, cast off by the current crisis, spared any sympathy for the woman. All Yaling could speak was silence; she couldn't communicate, for Japanese was lost on her. All she could see was indifference to her situation, memories of only discomfort. And all she could hear was her heart breaking. The wind picked up, buffeting her with more cold. Yaling could only walk against it."

 japyasuda.17.d: "The sea breeze brought with it the smell of salt, giving Yaling a moment of peace. Her dress fluttered, as her hair dried in the wind. In and out, she reminded herself. Breathe in - she took a deep breath - breathe out. The docks in the early morning were her favorite place. From her vantage point, she could see the golden sun rise. Sitting on top of her suitcase, she could see a disk of orange slowly rising. Perhaps not the wisest choice - it did sting to look at such light - but it wasn't like she could last long here.\n\nIn the distance, voices. Male voices. The workers were here for their shift. Looking behind her, she could see that they were deep in conversation - she could escape. Picking up the suitcase, she darted behind a shipping container, hoping they didn't notice her. Yaling steeled herself in case they... no. Not again. Breathe in, breathe out, she reminded herself. Panic wouldn't help her get away from the men.\n\nThe men stopped in between her container and the one opposite. Yaling could only look at them in terror, as she was frozen solid. A slight look. Just a slight turn and her worst fears would attack her again. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. She shivered, her heart beating like artillery on the battlefield.\n\nThe men disappeared to the front of her container. Yaling slumped down and put her face into her hands, hot tears flowing down her face."

 #Economic Wars
 japeconwars.1.t: "Panic at the Stock Exchange"
 japeconwars.1.d: "With the collapse of the Yasuda Zaibatsu, the atmosphere at the Tokyo Stock Exchange has been one of pure chaos. Buyers are frantically selling their shares in every company vaguely affiliated with Yasuda, hoping desperately to cut their lines to the sinking ship loose before they're pulled down with it. Many of them would consider themselves lucky if they can sell their stocks for fifty sen on the yen, cash in hand. However, there are fewer and fewer lucky people by the minute, as the ticker tape continues to print smaller and smaller values.\n\nThe effect is already painfully apparent. Several dozen financiers and stockbrokers have committed suicide after seeing their life savings vanish before their eyes, or watch the companies they represent plummet towards bankruptcy like their coworkers out of high-rise windows. One particularly grisly case was a vice president of the Yamaha Corporation, who shot himself in the head using an old IJN service pistol in the Stock Exchange's bathroom. Although the government is preparing a response, it seems that for today, they are powerless to do nothing but watch as the beating heart of Japan's economy slowly succumbs to cardiac arrest."
 japeconwars.1.a: "God help us!"
 japeconwars.2.t: "Giving a Hundred and Twenty-Five Percent"
 japeconwars.2.d: "It seems that a war that once solely occupied the offices of Tokyo financiers has spilled out into the rice paddies and rubber plantations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At noon, all the major Zaibatsu sent nearly identical telegrams to their agricultural holdings in China and Vietnam with a simple order: production quotas are increasing by twenty-five percent as of next month. An hour later, an order order came from many of the keiretsus' offices to their plantations, demanding a similar increase in production. Although this caused some mild consternation from native farmhands about the feasibility of the goal and the impact on their personal health, some mild policing by the Kwantung Army was enough to convince them to go back to work. All rumors of unrest are simply rumors, no Sumitomo coal miners in Chengdu are rioting, and Nissan's steel mills in Manchuria are all functioning normally.\n\nAs to the origin of the quotas, it isn't quite clear why this started, which of the Zaibatsu acted first, or why the keiretsu responded. Was it the reaction of the others to seeing one raise quotas, afraid that their business rivals knew something they didn't? Was it a bluff, an attempt to force their competitors to attempt unsustainable levels of production? Was it a simultaneous attempt by both factions to corner the market? Is it to fix prices? Or are they all stocking up for something nobody else knows about?"
 japeconwars.2.a: "Let's hope they don't alter the quotas any further."
 japeconwars.3.t: "Empty Shelves, Empty Screens"
 japeconwars.3.d: "Many in the Home Islands who were not involved in finances once felt that the Zaibatsu-keiretsu trade wars would only affect them if they chose to open the business section in their newspaper. However, it seems that the crisis has finally begun to disrupt their lives in a personal way that they never anticipated.\n\nAt first, nobody paid attention when the price of new televisions crept up by several hundred yen, figuring that it was just some new upgraded model rolling out onto the market. But it wasn't an upgraded model. In fact, there wasn't any new model released at all this year. None of the major electronics brands-Totsuko, Hitachi, JVC, Panasonic, or Toshiba-have even continued producing last year's models, let alone announce a new product line. Rumors have also spread of a Toshiba television factory in the Saitama Prefecture being shuttered overnight without so much as a warning to the employees. It seems that with the Zaibatsu and keiretsus embargoing components and resources once freely traded, their corporate overlords have had to start tightening their belts and halting production of low-priority products. And judging by how the shelves in electronic stores grow barer and the prices creep higher every day, it seems that they have consigned their television brands to such a fate."
 japeconwars.3.a: "Politics killed the video star."
 japeconwars.4.t: "The Bells Are Silent"
 japeconwars.4.d: "One of the latest (and certainly the oddest) casualties of the recent economic war has been none other than the humble bicycle. An industry once dominated by a plethora of small-to-medium sized businesses like Kuwahara and Mizutani, it has been transformed in recent months into another market where the Zaibatsu and keiretsus battle for dominance. The first to make serious headway into the market was the Matsushita keiretsu, who began selling bicycles under the "National" brand name. This triggered a frenzy of buying, as Zaibatsu and keiretsu alike both began to buy up as many bicycle retailers in the Home Islands as they could. And when a company refused to sell, the conglomerates would either outbid them on steel contracts, or in the case of Zaibatsu who owned steel mills, simply refuse to sell to them.\n\nThe effect on the Japanese consumer has slowly become apparent. New bicycles are hard to acquire from any company, and replacement parts for old ones are nearly impossible to come by. The shortage of components has meant that mechanics have had to cannibalize other bicycles for parts, build their own improvised ones, or simply tell their customers to make do (which is especially tricky when it's the brakes that are broken). The Tokyo Metropolitan Police have reported at least half a dozen injuries in the last month as a result of bicycles breaking due to homemade replacement parts. Although this is hardly a noteworthy statistic, it will surely increase as time marches onward, and the corporations continue their fight."
 japeconwars.4.a: "Bicycle races won't be coming our way."

We have nothing to hide, and the whole world will envy our continued success."

By creating more and more construction projects and military contracts, we can further develop the islands while keeping the West at bay.

Standards of living are at an all-time high, and technology continues to push forward without relenting. While the two other thirds of the world are crawling in the mud and suffering, Japan has created an economic system to last the ages and bring bounty. Tennōheika Banzai! Dainihon Teikoku Banzai!

With connections to the nobility and an old, wizened figure, he is the definition of a conservative. He knows every dirty trick, every historic betrayal, and every political figure, because he's lived through it all. Serving in the Diet since 1915, this will likely be his last term, and both he and Ikeda know it. With his help, Ikeda can keep the ship of state stable for long enough that he can finally leave the bitter world of politics and enjoy his long overdue retirement in peace.§!"

Despite this handicap, he remains one of the most skilled politicians in Japan. His individual competence puts him at odds with the Prime Minister, as does his blazing temper that flares up whenever actions are taken opposite to his council, which occurs far more than he would like.§!"
 JAP_Ezaki_Masumi_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nCorporatism§!"

 JAP_Kouichi_Kido_hog_desc: "§YChief Cabinet Secretary\nOligarchy§!\n--------------\n§LThe knight among pawns in the great game of chess that has become Japanese politics, Kido Kōichi's role in Takagi's government is at best an approach of like-minded allies, and at worst a bitter compromise on reform. His nomination as Takagi's Deputy Prime Minister was seen as a powerful move by many in the Diet, as the Admiral could now call upon the politicking skill of the noble king-maker to aid his efforts in governing over the nation. Aware of his usefulness to Takagi's government, Kido Kōichi utilizes his cunning craft and years of experience to work his way around draconian legislature so that he may achieve the goals he shares with the Prime Minister. However, he is not to be underestimated as subvertient to the cabinet; he is a rightful contender for Prime Minister in his own right, and his appointment is owed simply to a broadly similar idea of reform and demilitarization both men share.§!"
 JAP_Kuranari_Tadashi_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nGoken Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LOf certain distinction, Kuranari Tadashi was nominated to serve as Takagi's Foreign Minister to represent Tokyo's interests throughout the Sphere and across the globe. Drinking tea and eating cakes with diplomats, he shares smiles with foreign representatives whilst running his mind with plotting thoughts to use the weakness of the Emperor's enemies to Japan's advantage. His position as one of the younger, more inexperienced members of government has led him to latch on to the more ambitious and influential cabinet member Nakasone for guidance and direction. Nonetheless, Tadashi keeps his eyes fixated on maps and graphs, ready to greet the next diplomat in his office so that he may prize enough information from them to ultimately serve his intense war-hawk agenda in defending the Sphere from all threats, from within or without.§!"
 JAP_Nakasone_Yasuhiro_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nGoken Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LAlways seen by Takagi's side, Nakasone Yasuhiro is the man behind the government's grand plans to revive and expand the slowing Japanese markets across the globe. If he is not known to be examining charts plotting the rates of inflation and consumer spending, he will be caught enjoying the high life in the company of politicians presenting slides on the benefits of market liberalization. Whilst not personally admired by the Prime Minister, Nakasone Yasuhiro does command the respect of many in the cabinet as he is a master at his work. His striking charisma and determination to get the task at hand complete is well known amongst circles of politicians across the empire, as his enthusiastic developments to cut down constraining business regulation whilst maintaining tight control over money supply are unrivaled by experts in his field.§!"
 JAP_Horikiri_Zenjiro_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nGoken Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LA man not necessarily known for his words, and rather for his actions, Horikiri Zenjirō is a veteran of the Japanese political game. He has served as the governor of the Kanagawa Prefecture, Mayor of Tokyo City, and in the Saito administration - all getting him to grasp the functions and responsibility of civilian government across the empire. Zenjiro owes his loyalty to the Admiral's faction of the Taisei Yokusankai, and as one of the oldest reformists, he is a firm supporter of Takagi's legislative drives to reform and demilitarize the nation. A peer and government minister, Horikiri Zenjirō understands the necessity of reforms when the time calls for it, but as Takagi's Minister for State Security, he is also aware of the essential stability that must come before any dream of change can flower.§!"

 JAP_Aoki_Kazuo_hog_desc: "§YChief Cabinet Secretary\nControlled Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LAoki Kazuo, the first Minister of Greater East Asia of the Empire and an experienced economy bureaucrat, is a firm believer of Yokusankai unity and interfactional delegation. Though he shares Kishites' distaste for the Reformists, Aoki firmly believes the prosperity of the Empire is built upon the "dynamic balance" between the Technocrats, the Conservatives, Zaibatsu, and the people. He knows that it's only a matter of time before he makes his final standoff against Kishi and his lackeys, but he stands ready, both for his political career and the fate of the Empire.§!"
 JAP_Fukuda_Takeo_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nAuthoritarian Developmentalism§!\n--------------\n§LFukuda Takeo can be easily mistaken as a Reformist on the first sight. This is not completely wrong; Fukuda is trying to beat the reformists in their very own game.\n\nUtilizing his past experience as Wang Jingwei's finance advisor and his knowledge in the economy, Fukuda reached a perhaps treasonous conclusion-- investing in the industry and the infrastructure of the Sphere, combined with more political autonomy of East Asian states as an exchange for their economic cooperation, is the most efficient way to uplift the Sphere's economic situation. Domestically, he constantly vows for the concept of "clean politics," calling for the empowerment of the people to fight government corruption. This strategy, unsurprisingly, paid off very well. Fukuda gained a clean image and the people as a weapon against his enemies, while the New Bureaucrats received massive support from the populace that they desperately need to counter the Kishites and the Reformists. Rumor flies that Fukuda is secretly aiming for a higher position in the cabinet with popular support in hand; perhaps only time will tell if his loyalty truly lies with PM Kaya and his New Bureaucrat friends.§!"
 JAP_Ushiba_Nobuhiko_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nControlled Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LBeing the head diplomat of the Sphere does not mean you must wish for the eradication of the OFN and the Pakt. That's the job for the brutes in the Imperial Army, not Ushiba Nobuhiko. Having served in the Reich, the then-United Kingdom, and the United States as a diplomatic envoy, Ushiba knows the value of diplomacy. When war means the end of the world as we know it, words are often mightier than swords.\n\nUshiba's approach to diplomacy can be summarized into one sentence; you mind your business, and let us mind ours. The Sphere does not run on a distinct ideology like OFN or the Pakt, nor does it desire to spread the East Asian way of life to the rest of the world. Yet never mistake Ushiba as a dove or a punching bag; he will make sure the Westerners know that quiet dogs bite the hardest.§!"
 JAP_Funada_Naka_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nControlled Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LFunada Naka plays by the rules. What would a government be, and how could a government lead its people without the rule of law? Indeed, the laws he abides by are not necessarily made by the people, but Funada truly believes that the people deserve a fair notice of the law before being chained by it. As the newly appointed Home Minister, Funada seeks to make every effort to increase the public awareness of the laws and cut unwarranted searches and arrests, hoping to boost the credibility of the New Bureaucrat cabinet while instilling order to the society after the Yasuda Crisis. It would be foolish to be in Funada's bad books, however; his ability to spot and exploit legal infractions is unparalleled, and he would never hesitate to use such abilities against his rivals, be it a Kishite, a reformist, or even a fellow cabinet member who dares to pose a threat to his power. §!"
 JAP_Kawashima_Shojiro_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nControlled Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LBeing a compromise candidate from the Conservatives in a technocratic cabinet, Home Minister Kawashima Shojirō knows his goals and position well. Kaya needed Conservative support to oust Kishi, while the Conservatives wanted their fair share of reward for their investment. As such, PM Kaya agreed to appoint Kawashima as the Home Minister-- a decision that he would likely regret in the foreseeable future. Utilizing his power as the Home Minister, Kawashima is relentlessly collecting files on both Kishites and Technocrats while silently waiting for his chance to strike. Once the common threat of the reformists and Kishi are gone, Kawashima vows, that he shall bring this country back to its right ol' track.§!"

 JAP_Shiina_Etsusaburo_hog_desc: "§YChief Cabinet Secretary\nReform Bureaucracy§!\n--------------\n§LShiina Etsusaburo is a man of compromised loyalties, but none can say he does not serve Japan well. Working with characters like Kishi Nobusuke in that chaotic state that was 1930s Manchuria, he has proved himself an ambitious bureaucrat and politician that would stop at nothing to advance the interests of his career and the interests of his nation, in that order.\n\nNow, he serves a new leader as a compromise politician, a leeway provided in some secret handshake in some secret office between Kaya and Kishi. Even if his power may be temporary, his standing shaky, Shiina will be damned if he doesn't make something of his new position.§!"
 JAP_Kishi_Nobusuke_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nReform Bureaucracy§!\n--------------\n§LAn old rival of Kaya Okinori and a member of an opposing faction, the Innovationists, it is hard to see how Kishi Nobusuke was ever appointed to any office in the Prime Minister's cabinet. Many in government institutions and politics would like nothing better than to throw the man down, and cast him into the wayside of history. Yet, he does have certain talents.\n\nKishi's ability to sway both the armed forces and certain ministries through his uncompromising brutality has proved useful in the past, and none can challenge his prowess at managing economic affairs, yet it is easy to sense, even for Kaya, that the man may have some... ulterior motivations.§!"
 JAP_Suzuki_Teiichi_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nCorporate Statism§!\n--------------\n§LTo many an outside observer, Suzuki Teiichi's appointment to be Japan's Foreign Minister is a surprising revival to a career thought dead after his dramatic fall from grace amongst Guangdong's capitalist tycoons. But Suzuki always maintained that he was a victim of circumstance, a loyal patriot fulfilling Tokyo's wishes in a hardship posting, simply caught in the blast radius of Yasuda's implosion - and it seems Prime Minister Kaya believes Suzuki's side of the story.\n\nFor Suzuki himself, the position to Foreign Minister is not simply redemption, or a simple promotion - it is the pinnacle of his career, a chance to redraw the economic and political map of Asia to his liking. Twenty years ago, he missed his chance to become the first Minister of Greater East Asia, building the Co-Prosperity Sphere under Tōjō; now, he will rebuild it under Kaya.§!"
 JAP_Tadanori_Nagayama_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nReform Bureaucracy§!\n--------------\n§LSome may call Tadanori Nagayama a rarity among Kishi's lieutenants. Being with the technocrats, Nagayama had an invested interest in working on social welfare and affordable healthcare coverage for the veterans, a rarity among his peers. This is all for the sake of making people more contempt with the government, he claimed-- and it seems that this argument works well enough to make him stay in Kishi's favor. For now. §!"
 JAP_Arita_Hachiro_for_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nReform Bureaucracy§!\n--------------\n§LPerhaps the most loyal to Japan among Kaya's cabinet, Arita Hachiro has been one of the main drivers of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, using his influence as foreign minister during the Second World War to see his brainchild become reality.\n\nDespite the undoubted efficiency and effectiveness the minister may possess, his position remains unstable. A compromise candidate between Kaya and Kishi due to his moderate attitude towards the United States, Arita will do everything within his power to push for greater East Asian unity, no matter how insignificant his efforts may be.§!"

One of the most senior men in the entire government, he has witnessed every ideological experiment made in an attempt to save the Japanese national polity, and is convinced that all of these experiments and attempts have failed Japan. The constitutional democracy, the military rule, and the YSK as well- all of these came to nothing, despite Kido's efforts to assist them in securing their various governments. These failures have shown that it is time for the Emperor to step in, through the person of Kido, alongside likeminded men aiming to similarly restore the Imperial will and power.§!"
 JAP_Sugita_Ichiji_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nOligarchy§!\n--------------\n§LGeneral Sugita Ichiji is a rare example of a frontline IJA commander who, owing to a posting to the United States as an attaché, opposed the war with America and the Western Allies - and in doing so earned the ear of General Higashikuni Naruhiko, a prince of the Imperial line. A veteran of the Malayan, South Pacific, and final years of the Chinese campaigns, Sugita has always remained a strange oddity within the IJA - an iconoclast for his views, undeniably competent despite his beliefs, and ultimately protected by his connection to Higashikuni, who employed him as an aide in 1943 and continued to look out for Sugita even after the war ended.\n\nNow, with Prince Higashikuni looking for a diplomat who can both face the world and keep the Army and the Navy in line, Sugita appears to be the perfect candidate - a man with worldly experience, a decorated military record, and with personal loyalty to match.§!"
 JAP_Yamigawa_Masamichi_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nOligarchy§!\n--------------\n§LYamagawa Masamichi was not a particularly political man, so it may have surprised some to see a man such as him placed in such a high position of administration. A career finance bureaucrat, and the former 20th governor of the Bank of Japan until 1964, Yamagawa has for much of his life been close to business, remaining as "apolitical" as a senior bureaucrat could be.\n\nIt is exactly his outsider status within the world of politics that made him such an easy choice for the Jushin. Untainted by the repeated failures of the Yokusankai and military, Yamagawa is the perfect man to serve as an experienced, but ultimately inoffensive head of the Ministry of Finance.§!"
 JAP_Saito_Noboru_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nOligarchy§!\n--------------\n§LSaito Noboru - is a venerable name in both the YSK and government circles, having served as a veteran home ministry vice-minister, prefectural governor, and police official over the past three decades. His postings to the highest posts in Japan's internal bureaucracy meant that he gained the acquaintance of several of the Jushin, including Lord Keeper Kido - and now that Kido needs capable and loyal men to staff the great offices of state, Saito has been recalled to serve as the Home Minister.\n\nGiven the stated desire to 'right' the wrongs of the YSK exposed during the traumatic Grand Conspiracy, political analysts in Tokyo are wondering why Saito would be considered, given his affiliation to the discredited organization. His long career in internal affairs - and the fact that he is not an Army man, nor one of the seniormost YSK officials implicated in political turmoil - would indicate he is the man they trust not to worsen matters any further while remaining loyal to the hands that feed him.§!"

 JAP_Sato_Kenryo_hog_desc: "§YChief Cabinet Secretary\nRevoloutionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LSato Kenryo has been a spokesman for the IJA for quite a long time, and it is only natural that he would be the one to lead the government now that the Army is in charge of the Empire. A protégé of Tōjō Hideki, he was an important figure in the military government during the War, and he spent the years after Japan's victory tirelessly advocating for an increased military presence in society, garnering respect from many disgruntled soldiers and making a name for himself in the process.\n\nNow that the unthinkable has happened, and that the Empire is once again in the hands of the IJA, Sato's years of support for the military have paid off, as he now stands as the second most powerful man in the land of the Rising Sun. Only time will tell, however, whether or not such a position will prove to be his downfall...§!"
 JAP_Kishi_Nobusuke_coup_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nReform Bureaucracy§!\n--------------\n§LKishi Nobusuke is a known quantity to the Imperial Japanese Army. His brutal expertise displayed during his rule of Manchukuo may have earned him the moniker of the "Devil of Shōwa", but he also vastly increased the colony's industrial production. His experience in Manchukuo, and the friends and contacts he made within the Army during that time, made him one of the few politicians the military is willing to trust in the aftermath of their coup.\n\nHowever, one thing has been made clear. No matter how intelligent and ambitious Kishi Nobusuke may be, he is not the one calling the shots in Japan. That responsibility falls solely into the generals' hands.§!"
 JAP_Iwakuro_Hideo_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nRevoloutionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LIwakuro Hideo is a veteran Army intelligence officer, and with that position comes a varied career. From a long stint in Manchukuo assisting the Kwantung Army, to a period as a defense attaché to the United States in the fateful months leading up to the Second World War.\n\nIwakuro is certainly one of the IJA's most cosmopolitan officers, and a wise choice for his new position within the government in the aftermath of the coup. However, he is also an officer who can reliably be counted upon to advance the Army's interests and its vision for the Co-Prosperity Sphere at large.§!"

A Chief of Operations who earned himself many distinctions in the early days of Japan's war against the western powers, his tenure as one of Tōjō Hideki's staff secretaries taught him many administrative tricks and techniques that many of his contemporaries lack.\n\nWith the advent of a new military dictatorship, Hattori's skills as an administrator made him a perfect fit for the office of Home Secretary, as he is undoubtedly capable of doing the legwork, and the wetwork, needed to keep Japan and the Empire stable, no matter the cost.§!"

 jap_ar.1.t: "Chūō Kōzō Sen"
 jap_ar.1.d: "The Admiral had returned to the IJN Naval Academy in Etajima, cocooned by Hiroshima Bay, coral red brick surrounded with bristling green hillocks. A brisk stroll to the waterside from the main building. The happenstance of tectonics gave them the narrowest of straits, instead of a lake. Those that wished to go to sea were still many, many miles away.\n\nTakagi had a yearly tradition of greeting the latest class of students at the Academy. One that his advisors had attempted to talk him out of after assuming the Premiership. The amplified attention had turned a quiet rejoinder with his past into another recitation of practised, pandering pablum for a congregation of journalists and spin artists . Perhaps he should listen to sage counsel more.\n\n"...it would not necessarily be to our, to the militaries - " Making time for old friends was the raison d'etre for this dalliance. They were seated together in a room with a view of the bay, blinds closed. Said friend had leaned forwards, morphing into a doctor about to deliver a palliative diagnosis. " - advantage to hold these exercises".\n\nHe left the shrouded office an hour later. As a cadet, the Admiral had that unbreakable optimism of a striving youth; colored with internal nattering. A voice asking 'Are you sure, Takagi?'. Those two sides clashed again. He wanted to believe the upcoming combined IJN & IJA military exercises would show the strength that Takagi knew resided in both.\n\nYet. The faultline between them might be disturbed into something far worse. There were cadres of unscrupulous officers tearing chunks out of Japan and pocketing it for themselves. These twinned issues persisted, efforts underway to address them. A resolution was still many, many leagues away. The Imperial colossus could not be halted in time, even if he wanted to. Takagi could only hope next year, his friend wouldn't be able to say."
 jap_ar.1.a: "I told you so."

 jap_ar.2.t: "A Game Spoiled"
 jap_ar.2.d: ""Those damned wedges, awful, simply awful. That bunker on the 15th is a terrible thing..." The General was a route one golfer, a man who viewed anything not played with a wood or high iron to be an irritation to an already irritating game. Ikeda had been listening to his bloviating for the last 3 hours. There were uses for those who talked without thought; the aperitif would direct the conversation in a profitable direction.\n\nAt the 19th hole, wild accusations were levelled against the upcoming military exercises. The General reached such rhetorical heights as to suggest the IJN would fabricate the existence of an entire aircraft carrier. Picking out scraps from the verbal detritus left by this bluster, Ikeda did match them with other anecdotes, whispers, and unsigned reports. He gracefully thanked the General for displaying tact and keeping the Prime Minister informed.\n\nThe creaking wheels of state did not turn without proper care. Ikeda understood that the government could not always intervene to move things along. Ino had mangled this careful, delicate and discreet process into an open competition among pickpockets. Ino was chief among looters, running the greatest scam the financial world had ever seen. Such selfishness blinded that craven fool to the true damage he had caused Japan. The exercises would go ahead, Ikeda needed them to. The entire concept had been put together by Ino's administration, no doubt to winnow away a few billion extra yen to those empty Yasuda warehouses. Whatever disaster that might arise out of these manoeuvres would only strengthen his case against clearing out those not totally aligned with his vision of Japan.\n\nIkeda had names, he knew the guilty parties already."
 jap_ar.2.a: "It was a matter of letting them be caught red-handed."

 jap_ar.3.t: "Command & Control"
 jap_ar.3.d: ""Wholehearted endorsement of the exercises going ahead. Whoever is in your ear about delaying or cancelling are uninformed. I recognize the risks, and acknowledge certain vulnerabilities may be revealed. Those we deem most responsible can be moved along, or brought into line. Negative reaction can be controlled. The public will be told secrecy is paramount and to be wary of those inquiring further, they may be agents of imperialism. This is an opportunity we cannot pass up, essential to our program."\n\nKaya concluded his reading of this pointed letter from Kishi. The typically ebullient operator had been unusually evasive when it came to the topic of these military exercises. Based on his own research, Kaya was sceptical at best on the value of them. What little reliable data he had scraped together from uncooperative sources told a story of overreach, underinvestment, graft and animus between the two principal participants. The military was a black box. Money and manpower went in with no surety on resulting output.\n\nWould that he could call it all off, Kaya once again butting up against the limits of his supposed grandiose power. Kishi held key relationships with top IJA & IJN brass. Attempting to circumvent those was not a battle the economist would win. If Kishi wanted all this sound and fury only to accrue a few extra puppets, so be it."

Blame was endemic, there was no part of the machinery that escaped harsh critique. Poor communication, lack of familiarity with modern tech, overwrought planning, inflexibility, abuse of command, political appointments, on and on. Fundamental tactics were unable to be executed, let alone newer concepts. Heavily redacted sections suggested that the nuclear umbrella they supposedly were being protected by was largely ineffective.\n\nIt was worse than he could have imagined. The room was silent, expectant eyes seeking a pronouncement. Tagaki could see the spectre of his old Academy friend amongst them, whispering 'I told you so'. The Prime Minister cleared his throat, pushing the report away. It had radioactive qualities to it. "How does the saying go? 'The way of the Samurai is in death'? Gentlemen, this report suggests our armed forces will be adhering to that ideal with impressive zeal." A smattering of nerve-shredded laughter broke out. The previous 48 hours had taken its toll on his advisory team, sporting worn and weary faces.\n\nMirth broke the seal, and they began exchanging potential remedies. Actual modernization and a fastidious adherence to an anti-corruption ethos would be the two overarching aims of this sweeping reform. They would be leaning on the reputation of the old Admiral to punch through the regressive rot. Find those who were amenable to transformative efforts, and bind them together.

Heavily redacted sections suggested that the nuclear umbrella they supposedly were being protected by was largely ineffective.\n\nShiina exploded into laughter, a cannon let loose, a cackle reverberating off the boardroom walls. Kishi joined in next, the absurdity of this reaction infecting Kaya, the tendrils finally forcing air from Fukuda lungs. Shiina chucked the carefully arranged sheaf of papers to the ground as a final exclamation point. "Trash. All of it. Entertaining trash, nonetheless."\n\nKaya had to interject. "We have a monumental task ahead of us, to piece this 'trash' back together." Kishi clapped his hands together, a smile still etched on his face. "When something is this broken, my friends, those in charge must take radical steps to fix it. Like I told you, Prime Minister, this is an opportunity with boundless potential."\n\nKishi was right. In fact, Kishi was too right. The grand open space presented by this self-inflicted destruction by the military meant the scion of Manchuria was no longer the sole conduit to the IJA or IJN. Now was the time for sound, scientific rationality to eradicate the excesses of the armed forces, rather than enable them. The watchful eye of the bureaucrat would cast impartial judgement, and these rogue elements would be forged together with the state itself. No more Yasuda's, no more weakness."

Takagi strived to use it for the benefit of all he supposedly ruled over. Why did it always feel like that was the harder thing to do? Military reform had proven to be one of the most challenging tasks of his Premiership, where his ability to affect change seemed at its most impotent.\n\nThe hard road promised great riches. Takagi had only peeked at the summary of the latest military exercises but he knew they had struck a rich vein with these reforms. The global outlook could change on a dime, with each superpower possessing arsenals of terrible potential. Japan now would count itself secure against such threats. Its sailors were well provisioned, well trained, aboard the most powerful navy on the planet. Its soldier's were masters of adapting to the challenging, ever varying landscape of the Sphere. The IJN & IJA were in simpatico, able to undertake complex combined arms operations from the Indian Ocean, to Nanjing, to the furthest waters of the Pacific.\n\nThere was a terrible, mythical tomorrow where a new President might turn the ire of his people against Japan.

 jap_ar.8.d: "Another victory, another feather in his cap, another step taken away from the stain of Ino. A collection of figures, graphs, superlatives lay at his fingertips. The innumerable folios that had been set on his table had started to blend together as time. Ikeda had started skimming executive summaries and letting advisors break them down for him. This however, was one he planned reading cover to cover.\n\nAlready Ikeda pictured himself in front of the Diet, reeling off how he, and his vision for Japan had rescued Japan's armed forces from the ignominy of failure. That all citizens of the Home Islands could rest easy, knowing they were protected by the most advanced fighting force on the face of the planet. That those in the wider Sphere were granted the opportunity to prosper, free from imperialist wreckers. The guts of the report would be spilled in black ink all over every newspaper. Newsreels would spread footage of bristling aircraft carriers, sleek jet fighters, the latest in Guangdong developed miltech.\n\nAll would be thankful for the stability provided to them by the Taisei Yokusankai, and Ikeda Masanosuke's benevolence. The steady course plotted through adherence to tradition and the wisdom of conservative values would steel Japan, and the Sphere against shifting tides."

They'd be proven wrong, and would need to be brought along kicking and screaming. It was just all that kicking and screaming produced irritating roadblocks on this endless march of progress. Those with a battalion or carrier at their beck and call could make a hell of a roadblock.\n\nInevitably, invariably these obstacles had been swept aside. A crushing victory for the technocratic coven. The quadrumvirate was gathered together, Kishi, Shiina, Fukuda with Kaya the tip of the spear, standing at a dias delivering a speech to the Diet in his inimitable gruff, understated style. He was no showman, but when the results spoke for themselves this loudly, he hardly needed to be. You could even sense a hint of pride or smugness, clearly enjoying himself. The army and navy had been brought to heel, made to understand what was required of them. Rigorous adherence to scientific, metric driven efficiency, rewarded with unprecedented investment from the state.\n\nThe latest in miltech, the most comprehensive electronic warfare suites, integrated communications allowing for complex combined operations. They had sprinkled in loyal, watchful bureaucrats at key junctures of command. The old rivalries done away with, the armed forces now simply another tendril of the Empire rather than a rogue element."

Thus, the results of his military reform program being a collection of small victories was satisfying. The armed forces were a hulking beast and as demonstrated previously forcing it into unwanted action was ill-advised.\n\nA modest speech in the Diet, followed by an equally modest round of interviews promoting the sensible path taken to sustainable success, yes. Something like that. Draw enough attention to highlight the positives, but not enough to uncover the less encouraging results. No one general could claim to be put out or overly taxed by what he had requested from them. The officer corps would have little cause to fight against him. The usual smattering of promotions were to be handed out, for both those in uniform, and those who devised the plans. Keeping all involved happy, and keeping the ship charting that same, steady course."

A carefully prepared one at that, swerving around those few stubborn issues not entirely addressed. Kaya still concluded on a note of satisfaction. At least the army and navy had largely understood what was required of them. Rigorous adherence to scientific, metric driven efficiency, which in turn had been rewarded with adequate funding.\n\nThey maintained pace with their superpower rivals in certain areas of military technology. Training standards had been raised to an acceptable standard, there were little complaints of poor morale. The average cadet or private was hardly overjoyed either.

The communications maestros would make it seem like all was well. The Diet would be sated, but Takagi and his team would be left unfulfilled. The Navy worked well enough to old standards, operating in old ranges. Effectively projecting power further beyond had not come to pass. The IJA was unable to cohere its sprawling forces, giving regional commanders far too much leeway to act unilaterally.

The armed forces were a hulking beast and as demonstrated previously forcing it into unwanted action was ill-advised.\n\nThe final report would be filed away, its contents spoken of only in passing. They might throw it to the think tanks, to trusted academics who could produce the correct kinds of analysis. Slowly leak that out into the latter pages of a newspaper or two.

A full speech to the Diet had been cancelled. Now Kaya found himself swerving around the many failures this report on the 1986 military exercises laid bare. The tug of the chain they had undertaken to give the armed forces had led to internecine conflict, powerful commanders digging in for a protracted conflict against bureaucratic overreach. Said bureaucrats were then less likely to loosen the purse strings for a military that had spurned them.\n\nThere had been scant few positives to highlight. Technologically, they were hanging on by a thread in the arms race. Morale and training standards had largely stagnated since '64. Attempts to add in any sort of civilian state supervision were strongly resisted. The perfidious rivalry between IJN & IJA was preventing key combined operations from getting underway.

All the conversations, the endless meetings, the understandings reached, the metrics set, the thousands of man-hours, the billions of yen, none of it amounted to anything. Carriers that desperately needed refitting remained moribund in drydock. Promised cutting edge Guangdong developed electronic warfare was a mirage.

Ikeda paced back and forth a metre at a time, wiping out progress made to either side of the room with each turn of his heel. "The Diet will demand names, they will demand everything from me. Everything."

A full speech to the Diet had been cancelled, and those not directly connected with matters of the military were kept out. Now Kaya watched on in shock as the rest bickered about how best to suppress the findings of this report.\n\nThe tug of the chain they had undertaken to give the armed forces had led to open warfare between two sides of a state they wished to merge together. The bureaucrats were turned back with sneering hostility, which was returned with penny-pinching cuts to budgets in key areas.\n\nEvery possible metric was either stagnant or in regression since '64. None of the vaunted, transformative plans of the technocrats had come close to being implemented. They had fallen well behind in the arms race. Training standards had slipped, commanders allowed to run their own show as they wished. Resulting in poor morale as soldiers struggled underneath the return of petty corruption en masse instead of being quietly controlled to the proper channels. The military as a whole had become a closed shop, unwilling to communicate with the civilian side of the government, but even worse, unwilling to work with itself. The old IJN & IJA grudges come to a boil, two rogue elements acting against each other and against the Empire they purported to protect."

jap_oil.1.d: ""And we conclude our reporting with some breaking news from our correspondent in Riyadh: as Egypt is next to fall into chaos, the Saudi government has formally condemned the insurrections and intends to take all measures necessary to restore order on the border. This only leaves the question..."\n\n"Turn down the volume," one man grunted without bothering to turn his head from the corporate meeting. "Now that every country in the Middle East has fallen into chaos, it is only a question of when our strategic oil reserves will dry up. This chart here shows our overreliance on those slimy Italians and the damned colonies they can't be bothered to keep in line."\n\nHe paused for a moment, composing himself. His frustration was visible, yet all in the room shared the same feeling: negligence on their part had made business in the Sphere vulnerable, because they all had taken oil for granted.\n\n"This could be even worse than the Yasuda Crisis," one associate interjected gloomily, speaking the minds of all in the room. "Our situation is extremely precarious, and we need to look to other oil markets as soon as possible if we do not want to be plowing the earth by ourselves next year. I only wonder..."\n\n"Order! Order! There will be order!" The call to calm was drowned in shouts of anger and cries of defiance, and the bang of the gavel followed suit. The Diet was in complete chaos: when its members heard the news, some muttered resentfully against the government's recklessness. Others, more daring, had publicly expressed their disapproval of the imperial policies regarding oil: how could something so precious, absolutely vital to every part of modern life, be taken for granted?\n\nThere were accusations of naivety, of incompetence, of treason against the Emperor. It was when a brazen fellow spoke of a vote of no-confidence that the speaker decided he had had enough. The Diet was evacuated by force, leaving a few, collected representatives to ponder on the situation, calmly seated as if nothing had happened. One collective question was raised across all those minds."

jap_oil.2.d: ""General, another report has come from the 38th Army. There's been another cross-border raid in Guangxi, identified as Viet Minh. Command there says the current situation puts soldiers at risk of being cut off from Hanoi, since fuel is running dry. The Communists could take up to 3,000 prisoners."\n\nThere was no answer, only a vague wave of the hand, signifying the report was to rest on an ever-growing pile of emergency reports the Southeastern Army Command was receiving.\n\nWith instability in Thailand, communication issues across China, and now Indochina at risk of being snapped out of Japanese hands, there was much work to be done: the last few reserves of oil were to be distributed sparingly, and reinforcements sent across Asia had to be carefully handpicked. At last, with the aide uncomfortably shifting beside the general, an order was given.\n\n"Transfer the Borneo oil reserves to Haiphong and order a bombing party in the air. Get oil from the Navy, siphon trucks or civilian cars if necessary, but get a wing to strafe the jungle in the next two hours. In the meantime, the 21st Mixed Brigade will be transferred to Vietnam and make up for the losses there. Even though it's been reconstituted recently, I cannot doubt its motivation. Once the Borneo reserves are available, order a razing of the jungle. We'll flush the Viet Minh out of their hiding holes."\n\n"What of our retreating forces, General?" the aide whispered with unease.\n\n"They need to get used to this kind of situation, as this is how we'll be dealing with this insurgency from now on."

jap_oil.3.d: "There was a whisper of pages flickering around the table, as each officer briefly consulted the documents given to prepare the meeting. The speaker minutely examined the implications of the instability in the Levant and studied various operations proposed to salvage Japanese influence in the region. With the great wealth of ideas that the sense of urgency helps bloom, everything was up for debate. Outlandish operations, like mounting a commando operation to take over the Suez Canal, and some, far more reasonable were all examined. Not one idea the staff had was not examined, with the patient and burning meticulosity of those pressed by time.\n\nOne proposal, however, stood aside for its audacity and the detail that had been put into its planning, and it quickly became the center of a heated debate: while most were impractical, this operation seemed realistic and ambitious, so much so that the author of the proposal was called in to show more precisely what he had envisioned.\n\n"Operation Shioreta Hana acknowledges the need the Imperial Japanese Army has for a forward outpost from which to coordinate operations across the Arabian Peninsula and beyond", the officer explained. "As a result, my attention turned to Abu Musa, a strategic island located between Iran and the Italian possessions we knew until now as the Gulf Governorate. At the end of the war, Italy occupied all British possessions in the region and inherited the territorial disputes they carried. Iran claims a string of these islands which the British occupied as they colonized the region, and which were administered by the Emirs under British, then Italian rule. Now, the region lies in uncertainty, and we can exploit the situation by seizing Abu Musa and disguising the operation as an Iranian offensive. With a force of fifty commandos, we could take over the police station and install all necessary surveillance arrays and radars to contact our allies in the region, coordinate revolts, and stoke instability where is most needed, giving us an edge over the Germans.""

#Repurposed Takagi Event Chain
jap_oil.4.t: "The Price of Life"
jap_oil.4.d: "The Okuma family had a nice apartment. Although somewhat cramped by the belongings of the mother, father and their three children, one could not say that they lived uncomfortably. It was a cozy home, filled with joy. They had been lucky to even get the apartment, but with their small corner shop proving fruitful, the Okuma's just about pulled it off. However their good fortune did not last. Each month, they had to perform a careful balancing act of maintaining growth and paying off debts.\n\nWhile they managed their finances for a while without fail, the opening of a much larger store just a few streets down spelled certain doom for their corner shop. Eventually, the time came to explain the coming changes to the children.\n\nThe Okuma's gathered around the dinner table, eating a meal that was much smaller than they had grown accustomed to. The father could not even look up from his plate as he spoke.\n\n"I'm sure you've noticed that your mom and dad have been a bit anxious recently. We haven't been going to work as much and I'm aware you've seen us looking a bit worried when you come home from school. There's a bit less money going around these days and it's getting harder to scrape by."\n\nThe father took the hands of his children and looked them in the eye, trying to look hopeful. The mother chimed in, to take the pressure of her husband. She took a candle out of a small box and handed it to her eldest child.\n\n"We're going to need all three of you to be really strong, okay? When it gets dark, we need to use these now. It'll be cosy and if you get scared, you can sleep in our room." Seeing the tears in the eyes of her husband she knew she would also have to tell her children the hardest part.\n\n"And on the weekends, you're going to have to make do without food. It's not fair, I know. It's going to be so tough, but I know how strong you all are. You're going to be so brave. We promise this won't be like this forever, we really do. We'll find a way to make even more money than before, and then you can eat whatever you like."\n\nEventually, she broke down as well. The children, still too young to truly realise their situation began to suggest that they could work too, or maybe sell some of their toys and clothes. The future seemed terrifying to the Okuma parents, but the naive optimism of their children gave them some hope. For them, the mother and father would do anything."
jap_oil.4.a: "Is it too late for hope?"

jap_oil.5.t: "Never too Late"
jap_oil.5.d: "It was the youngest Okuma child's turn to get the mail from the post box in the lobby. He used to love running down the stairs, grabbing the letters and getting back home as fast as he could. These days, he was far too hungry. His stomach hurt as he trudged into the lobby, his eyes barely leaving the floor. The child absently searched the mailbox, and eventually picked out the single letter found within. The writing on the front mentioned something about a ministry, but the Okuma child was too tired to read it properly. Instead, he headed back up the stairs and placed the letter on the table in the kitchen.\n\nThe boy's father, whose eyes were red from too little sleep and too much crying, dared not flip the envelope when he first saw it, lest it be revealed as another bill. Eventually he gained enough courage to dispel those thoughts, which revealed "Ministry of Finance" on the front of the letter. Curiosity and a spark of hope caused the father to tear upon the envelope without a moment of consideration.\n\n"To Okuma Taro and Chinatsu. You are receiving this letter due to your employment as business owners as well as the difficult situation that you find yourselves in. The government has recently implemented measures aimed at aiding businesses such as yours. Therefore, the ministry of finance has examined your financial situation and decided to subsidize your business. You will soon be receiving a cheque, valued at-"\n\nAs soon as Mr Okuma saw the amount, he called for his wife and children to read the letter too, to make sure that he had not made a mistake.\n\nThe subsidies turned out to be just what the Okuma's needed to save the corner shop. They would no longer have to fear bankruptcy and poverty. Even so, they still were forced to make a difficult choice. The business would not survive in the city, no matter how much support it received. As such, the Okuma's decided to move back to the country, where they would at least be able to live comfortably. As they left their apartment for the last time, the Okuma's hoped that they were not the only ones to have been so lucky."

jap_oil.6.t: "Arimathea"
jap_oil.6.d: "Kazuchika was there when it was born once more.\n\nAmber preserved recollections of Yasuda welled up, in a nausea inducing manner. Trusted voices adopting previously unheard tones, trusted faces turning into stone. Nothing to be done about it, last in, first out policy. Nobody to speak up on his behalf, lacking for patrons within the Home Ministry. Made to feel like a child, helpless and mewling. Consigned to standing bars, peeling off scarce reserves of yen for the obfuscatory power of spirits.\n\nThis was different from Yasuda. Not a self-inflicted crime of profligacy. They were all at the mercy of a fundament. The synovial fluid of the modern world was in scarce supply.\n\nBorn again, in much the same way as all petty evils of this kind were. A cohort of similarly-suited functionaires, arrayed around an oblong conference table, in a nameless meeting room. Listening to pronouncements from a representative of the Diet. The interlocutor concluded: there was nothing to be done about it. It simply was the way it was. Keep essential limbs in motion. All else would be slowed...to a halt, if necessary.\n\nAn ashtray abounded with spent cigarettes. The ceiling fan doused them all in a mist of bitter smoke. They were comparing notes after hours. What constitutes essential? Where to cut first? Who did they have leverage on? All eager to tout obscure financial mechanisms, spreadsheet contortions, bureaucratic alchemy. Each word had a ghost note. Arranged together they sounded out a question: who here was disposable? Kazuchika assured them in unsaid words. This was different from Yasuda. He would not be a sacrificial lamb again."
jap_oil.6.a: "Kazuchika would survive."

jap_oil.7.t: "Nadir"
jap_oil.7.d: "Standing up ramrod straight, right arm hooked around the traincar stanchion, Kazuchika seethed. A broken promise, to never end up here again. That hulk of a Nissan, rotting back at home. His miniscule share of the spoils put into stasis. The right to a silent, solemn commute won by bloodyminded determination, snatched away.\n\nFellow travellers, the common folk, encircled him. Unkempt, unclean. Staining his dry cleaned shirt, infecting the air. Their collective desperation clawed at him, skittering up his ankle, his leg, wrapped around his neck. Choking, gnawing, gnashing its teeth. They surely knew who he was, what he did. They would tear him limb from limb. Kazuchika forced his way off at the next stop, pushing bodies aside, making room where there was none.\n\nDid they know he was one of them, once? The son of a fisherman? Did he still have that look in his eyes?\n\nLater, in a corner office, he would start to cross off line items. Trying to invent enough when there wasn't. Some of his former fellow travellers would go by hunger, thirst, by a truncheon to the head, by the bottle. There was nothing to be done about it."
jap_oil.7.a: "Japan would survive."

jap_oil.8.t: "A Dictated Letter"
jap_oil.8.d: "Dearest Kazuchika,\n\nWe have not heard from you recently. We thank you for the money you send home. We worry about you. Things here are difficult. We all wait on the government to help us put fuel in our boats. We cannot fish most days. While many things have changed, our island is still forgotten about. A Navy friend of ours brings us fuel from the base when he can, it is a great gift and he is a good man.\n\nWe wish to see you, when things have calmed down. Time passes quickly for me. Your mother is tired. We know you have achieved great things in Tokyo. I wish to take you out on the boat one last time. I would like that. I hope you would too."\n\nThe paper formed tsunami waves in his hand, then was crushed into an orb. Entombed in its final resting place, a nearby wastebasket. A mauve leather briefcase had its latches clicked open. Lifted from a purple felt compartment was a letter-headed pocketbook. In it he etched instructions for a wire transfer. Then, another note: meet with Shibata, didn't he have contacts in the Agriculture & Fisheries Ministry? It was said that sardines were the greatest logistical boon Japan possessed during the war. We cannot abandon the humble fisherman now. A final note: alert local Tokkeitai to potentially fraudulent fuel syphoning.\n\nThe only remaining light in his office was tainted orange, sourced from a bankers lamp. The sun had set. Eyes closed, Kazuchika could smell the sea. He could hear it, taste it. See it, and his father. The lap of waves against tar-sealed wood. The boat and the world rocked in tandem. Bile in his mouth. Water all around him."
jap_oil.8.a: "You can't go home again."

jap_oil.9.t: "Take Me Out"
jap_oil.9.d: ""Angry, tolerable. Annoyed, fine. Quiet, normal. Mopey Kaz? Unacceptable." A dull thud, flat palm thumping the opposite side of his desk. "I'd prefer if you did not resort to histrionics, Kodai." Kodai was honest, open, a gift to have as a friend and colleague.\n\nKodai's hand slid back, revealing two embossed slips of paper. "Free box tickets for the Giants game, the powers that be providing. Keeps up our morale, right?" A wink and a nod. Officially, morale was permanently skyhigh in the Ministry.\n\nThey were both enraptured by the cacophony as all of Korakuen Stadium became a cheer section. The Giants were rallying late against Hanshin. Kaz, self-described as reserved and mercurial, was at the precipice of the corporate seats beside Kodai. Clapping hands till palms stung, shouting himself hoarse to chants he didn't know. They watched a pale beige and red and dot nestle itself in just the right spot.\n\n"It's our decade, Kaz." They'd retreated to a clandestine standing bar, away from the usual haunts. "Our?" Kaz repeated, shoulder to shoulder with the slight, jet black waxed back hair of Kodai. Holding this inquisitive stare with an alcohol induced intensity and longevity. Kodai laughed. "The Giants you fool! We won tonight, the pennant for the last 2 years, we'll win it this year, and - " Kodai's eyes shone with sincere glee at the prospect. " - and Japan too, Kaz, we've done what we can to help with this oil snafu, great, great work, I'm really proud of it." They clinked empty shot glasses together."
jap_oil.9.a: "It simply had to be done."


#Post-Oil Crisis Proxy Investment Events, written by Frolicking
jap_oil.10.t: "Lifelines and Pipelines"
jap_oil.10.d: "Iraq once loved Qasim for his revolution, but as the days passed, it became clear that it only shuffled along at the pace the Italians allowed it to. Miceli's coup was the capstone that ended the pretense of freedom for Iraq. Now that the Civil War ended, a new revolution came to Iraq, one that preached democracy, charity, and welfare along Islamic lines.\n\nBut this revolution would not succeed without foreign backing either, which was why a gathering of clerics waited in Erbil for the arrival of a group of Japanese businessmen. Rubble and wreckage were swept away as the plane touched down for new wealth to face old traditions.\n\nOil was the name of the game as investment discussions worth millions were had and as the starving people watched their cars pass by. The well-informed among them knew their alliance with Japan was not one made out of benevolence, but they understood it had to be done.\n\nIt was their lifeline to see schools and hospitals built, their chance for a better life and a fulfillment of promises to free the people."
jap_oil.10.a: "And so, they prayed for more investments to come."

jap_oil.11.t: "Promises, Promises, Promises..."
jap_oil.11.d: "To the people of Oman, liberal values seemed even more distant than at the start of the sixties. The women of Nizwa were forced to abide by the Qur'an as if it were the constitution, for all they knew in these hectic times, it might soon become the rule of law. Meanwhile, Inams gathered in their masses, attending to a less secular matter.\n\nThe Tokyo-sponsored development of Oman's oil refineries was not met with a dozen camera flashes - it was an event marked by the back-and-forth interpretations of words. Precise emphasis is placed upon each slow syllable to assuage the safe passage of investment worth millions, followed by the sweet release of a signature's etching.\n\nIt was an ending to the tango, a full-stop to the anxiety of both parties. The Inams could rest easy with their guarantee of a sponsor, someone who would look after them while they fulfilled their holy mission. The problems of today were solved, tomorrow could wait for now as they looked to the promise of their master with a newfound optimism."
jap_oil.11.a: "What difference did it make to have a new master?"

jap_oil.12.t: "Milestones and Uranium"
jap_oil.12.d: "The people of Egypt chose tradition over the guiding hand of Rome or the false promises of Ba'athism and as the sun rose over Cairo, one could see what tradition meant.Islamic revolutionaries lined the streets of the city, tearing down the vestiges of the ancien régime, while outside the city graves were being dug, but not for the faithufl.\n\nIt was under these conditions that Japanese representatives landed in the country to bargain. The outside view, crumbling infrastructure surrounded by shelled buildings, reassured them that the deal would go through.\n\nThe representatives of both governments met for an inspection of the goods, quality uranium, mined in the east of the country. In exchange for the tools Japan needed to maintain its status as a superpower, the Empire would ensure the young state can rebuild. Once the deal was done, the Quitbists left satisfied in the knowledge that soon, the rest of the Middle East would learn the wisdom of the Qur'an as well."
jap_oil.12.a: "And Japan left knowing it would eventually have dominion over them."

jap_oil.13.t: "In the Sun, in the Shadows"
jap_oil.13.d: "Ibrahim Abboud's speeches drew a dream for the destitute people of Sudan. Sudan may have won its freedom from Cairo and Rome under him, but the struggle was not over.\n\nThis was the face of Abboud, where nationalists once despised him, he was now their idol, spinning yarn to distract them from the burning reality - when they went home after his speeches, they would do so on an empty stomach. Abboud was not as ignorant of this as the casual observer may believe.\n\nAnd if the meeting held on this day was successful, all of Sudan would know too, the men he was meeting with, representatives of a Japanese charity organization, came provide much-needed aid to the war-torn country, or so they claimed. On closer examination, there were many problems with this story - notably the fact that these men were political donors and that this charity's history of support seemed to closely align with Tokyo's foreign policy.\n\nHe could feel the invisible strings that were about to entangle Sudan once again, but Abboud could not say no, so the avowed and proud nationalist accepted it..."
jap_oil.13.a: "...and returned to that part of him that he thought died long ago."
#Nil's Negotiation Events
jap_oil.15.t: "Desert Confab"
jap_oil.15.d: "Riyadh was a beautiful place. Homes, markets, and offices stretched as far as the eye could see from Takahashi Inosuke's vantage point. The sand that littered the streets and was visible beyond the suburbs made things more interesting for the Japanese diplomat than it might have been for his countrymen. No better way to await the start of an appointment, Takahashi thought.\n\nA knock at the door heralded the Saudi foreign minister's arrival. With a winning smile, Takahashi bowed, then reached to shake his hand. The minister had a firm grasp, Takashi noted with approval.\n\n"Secretary Takahashi, it is a pleasure. Hopefully your travel here was satisfactory; please, let us be seated," the minister began. Taking two seats right next to a window that opened to the Riyadh skyline, Takahashi placed his briefcase on the table, revealing folders full of draft agreements and directives. He pulled one out for his Saudi counterpart's perusal.\n\n"To your question, Minister, yes, it was very pleasant. Riyadh is a beautiful place; the House of Saud has taken very good care of it. It is our utmost concern that such a record is not broken by this Crisis, which is why we are here. The Sphere can ensure Saudi Arabia is more cared for than Italy."\n\n"If that is the case, Secretary, than I do believe you will know what we want. We do not want guarantees or empty promises but training, equipment. If those Ba'athists even think of trying to take Riyadh... Well, let us just say that should be prevented. In exchange, we can provide you with the resources you desire. That is, of course, if you believe you are capable of upholding your end of the bargain." Takashi nodded reassuringly."
jap_oil.15.a: ""Then I believe this is the start of a bountiful partnership.""

jap_oil.16.t: "From One Empire to Another"
jap_oil.16.d: "Rome was as old and venerable as the likes of Nara or Kyoto, Takahashi Inosuke knew. Others were dismissive—but Inosuke understood that when Rome began, the Yayoi were running after the Jōmon across the Home Islands. "With all of the history that surrounds us, no one could ever get bored here." Inosuke thought.\n\nA knock at the door heralded the Italian foreign minister's arrival. With a winning smile, Takahashi bowed, then reached to shake the minister's hands. "Secretary Takahashi, it is a pleasure. Hopefully your travel here was satisfactory; please, let us be seated. How are you finding the city?" the minister began. Taking one of two seats right next to a window that opened to a view of the old centre of Rome, with St. Peter's Basilica prominent on the skyline, Takahashi placed his briefcase on the table, revealing folders full of draft agreements and directives. He pulled one out for his Italian counterpart's perusal.\n\n"Rome is a beautiful place, as venerable as the oldest cities of Japan back home and my journey here has been rather comfortable, but I suppose we didn't come here to discuss tourism." The minister and Takahashi chuckled.\n\n"Of course, the fact of the matter is that both of our countries have common goals in this Crisis. For Italian-Japanese relations to be strengthened, we need to support each other's effort in defeating these revolutionaries and subversives. If the Status Quo cannot be recovered. Both of our nations will greatly suffer if the Peninsula was to be controlled by extremists, I hope that the Imperial Government has authorised you to consider measures that might allow us to help each other." Takashi nodded reassuringly."
jap_oil.16.a: ""Then I believe this is the start of a bountiful partnership.""

jap_oil.17.t: "REPORT ON SAUDI ARABIAN RELATIONS"
jap_oil.17.d: "Negotiations with Saudi Arabia are proceeding in accordance with the directives you gave us. Our recent successes in the Oil Crisis have greatly relaxed any remaining tensions and Riyadh seems interested in the proposed escalation of our partnership.\n\nI feel safe in asserting that their realignment to the Co-Prosperity Sphere is imminent. We will have to move quickly to uphold our end of the bargain, however, in order to avoid the risk of growing Italian suspension of our plans. A response should be drafted in advanced over our move.\n\nSigned,\nTakahashi Inosuke"
jap_oil.17.a: "The Crown Jewel will soon be ours."
#Manuun's Riot Chain
jap_oil.18.t: "Policing Lessons"
jap_oil.18.d: "No sound in the carrier that brought them to their frontline other than the quiet roar of the engine, and the wheels sometimes scratching against the tarred floor. Each of the men seated at the back of the vehicle silently prepared for the hours to come, where they would battle a crowd, anonymous forces of anger and primitive violence unleashed upon the streets some had peacefully trodden the morning before.\n\nAyumu was there, too, seated just by the rear exit. It was his first time deployed on an anti-riot mission, and he firmly gripped the handle at his right, focusing on it so he didn't have to remember what the commanding officer had said just some minutes ago.\n\n"First time on the streets, eh?" he had said in his raspy voice of his, eyeing the young police constable with curiosity, as if he tried to see through him and realized he was scared.\n\n"Don't you worry kiddo, you'll stay behind. It can get dirty, and you ought to see how we react before going around waving your baton like you try to shepherd protestors. Doesn't work like that. It's like..."\n\nHis reverie was interrupted by a deafening sound that reverberated around the chassis of the vehicle, and the incomprehensible shout of someone, just out there. Nervously, Ayumu readied himself to jump out and see what was going on, but someone to his right took a hold of his arm, meaning for him to remain seated. A handful of seconds later, they were driving again, though slowly, and soon, it looked like they were arriving.\n\n"It's like a monster, really," the officer had quipped. "You don't get to understand what their faces look like, or who they are, or why they decided to be violent that day. The strength of the masse is so much more powerful than any of these individual people. Once you accept it, you can become good at your job."\n\nLike in a stupor, the policemen got out of their carriers, and gathered around their officers to have a short briefing. But he wasn't paying attention, because of how much he disagreed with his officer. It didn't look like a monster at all."
jap_oil.18.a: "It looks like the sea..."

jap_oil.19.t: "Facing the Leviathan"
jap_oil.19.d: "It was like a sea, inscrutable and deep, and at times shifting, and its waves rolled between the buildings on either side of the road. Yet there was no ebb or flood, and no water over the tarred roads, and the surf brought no distant sound of the ocean. It was like a sea, but it was also like a gigantic snake, its scales acting of their own volition as they marched through the streets. Almost like a conscious animal, the mass of people protesting and chanting and battling at times with the police forces went from place to place, and it could not be stopped.\n\nAyumu watched in quiet bewilderment the leviathan leave its mark in the urban landscape, and could not quite comprehend how he, young police constable deployed for the first time, was supposed to contain or otherwise bend the leviathan to his superiors' will. And he watched on, and fear took him when the leviathan seemed to turn its irate gaze towards him. He refused to see there were people in this formidable amassment of forces, for they were too alien to his understanding of how a crowd operated; and here, it was like each protester had become enmeshed with the protestors around him, and had attained a new power of some sort.\n\nFacing the monster was a thin cordon of his own comrades, experienced policemen, and hardened anti-riots experts, fighting shoulder against shoulder. Sometimes they pressed on, and the tide seemed to turn for a moment, but it took Ayumu a breath for the leviathan to force the policemen back by a few steps. And though they looked like they were fused with the streets, and not moving by more than an inch, the law enforcers backed step by step.\n\nHis guts were now like molten rock, and he felt like he was fighting back his own liver as it tried to climb out of his throat. Fear had him in her icy grip for good, and he stared blankly at the monster, now coming for him. He thought he could make up some details of the beast, and he recognized what appeared to be its brain, and before it, enormous jaws ready to crush him, swallow him, and turn him to charred remains. Almost oblivious to his retreating comrades, he lifted his baton up, shakingly facing the inhuman beast.\n\nLike a shadow, the sea came to him, and he knew nothing else."
jap_oil.19.a: "The sea giveth, the sea taketh away"

#PM Event Chains - Rally the Diet
jap_oil.20.t: "The Waves Tamed"
jap_oil.20.d: "This new struggle amused Takagi. It was at the same time so similar to and different from ones that had come before. It fit the way Japan had transformed during his tenure.\n\nPolitical intrigue was still a constant in spite of his reforms. Under the eaves of the venerable National Diet building Reformists and Independents whispered and at times shouted among themselves. The Technocrats and Conservatives continued to be divided. Deals and proposals had been made en masse since the crisis began.\n\nBut it was accompanied by something new, brought about by the past season of reform, the volume of the voices of the people. While protests took place in Tokyo and elsewhere across the Home Isles, not say of the other territories, on the regular, petitions came flooding in from local authorities and civil society organizations at a rate yet unheard of. Even more surprising was the fact that for some reason the government felt compelled to listen to them, if only a little.\n\nTakagi knew he'd have it harder than, say, Ikeda might. Yet a deal was still being hammered out. Despite his worries, despite the efforts he was putting into negotiations, he could not help but feel a certain growing energy observing the way things play out.\n\nIn fact, he felt he could put the old adage on its head."
jap_oil.20.a: ""The more things stay the same, the more they change.""

jap_oil.21.t: "The Eleventh Hour"
jap_oil.21.d: "The crisis had reached a critical point. Decisive action had to be taken, and Ikeda Masanosuke had to be the one to do it. He had to pull the Conservatives through this, even if it meant working so late into the night, even if it meant doing it every night.\n\nThe Diet had devolved into shouting matches, polemics being traded back and forth, bogging down the advance of much needed legislation. It all echoed in his head, over and over, his own supporters sparring with the Technocrats, then turning on the Reformists. Around and around, each day bringing new targets to insult and denigrate. How long would it take for them to turn on him? Would it take just a moment of weakness? He could not afford such a risk.\n\nA single moment of weakness could unravel it all. To be seen reaching out to any other faction, begging them, it might spell his doom. All his work to rebuild Japan in his vision; he could not tolerate the risk of having it swept away into obscurity, to have his name spoken with the same tone as that of Ino. He could not afford such gambits.\n\nThe unrelenting grind would continue. Drafting policy, forcing it through that damnable Diet, managing the Oil Crisis, carefully guiding his partners in the Zaibatsus to assist in those efforts, all while keeping the Conservatives in lockstep behind him. His legacy would not be one of failure. He could not afford to end up like his predecessor.\n\nAnd before he knew it, another sleepless night would pass."
jap_oil.21.a: "All for the Empire."

jap_oil.22.t: "A Forward Plod"
jap_oil.22.d: "It was at times such as this that Kaya Okinori really felt that his place in the world was beginning to fade away. Being forced to negotiate to preserve the policies that he had never really wanted in the first place was the sort of torture that, on reflection, he might think twice before inflicting on even the Americans.\n\nOther people had different perceptions of the situation. If one listened to Shiina and Kishi talk, the YSK was under the total control of the Reform Bureaucracy. Yet the Diet was still in chaos. It was not only that the remainders of the enemy factions were in full cry, blaming hardline policies for the destabilisation of the Japanese state in the Oil Crisis, it was that seemingly 'hardline' parliament were themselves developing minds of their own and contradicting the policy priorities of the government.\n\nAll the while, outside the angry shouts of the people echoed, demanding true reforms, they demanded everything he did not, everything he could not, give them. Kaya couldn't help but think that were it not for his own position he might be joining them out there by now.\n\nBut he could not. Over the past days, that had become the justification for many things. He could not see through Kishi's schemes, he could not overcome them, he could not stand up to defend his friend and he could not uphold his duties. These days it felt like all that he could do was sign his name on whatever demands the Hardliners had."
jap_oil.22.a: "And that is what he did."

jap_oil.23.t: "A Forward March"
jap_oil.23.d: "It was at times such as this that Kaya Okinori really felt that his place in the world was beginning to fade away. Being forced to watch the bureaucratic machine grind to a slow halt was the sort of torture that, on reflection, he might think twice before inflicting on even the Americans.\n\nBut he was not alone in this struggle. From places where one might not have expected at the start of his premiership there came support, or at least a willingness to negotiate. Kidoites and Conservatives all seemed likely to reach agreements on the measures that would prevent a government collapse and the chaos that seemed to follow it.\n\nThe Zaibatsus that survived the threats of dismantlement and central economic planning that the likes of Kishi had spouted too made offers. As a result, they also came around with good news, pledging to follow the developmentalist line for at least as long as was needed to ensure the stability of the national body.\n\nThough the headache that pained him did not fade, amidst the crisis and the accompanying hue and cry that came from the civilian population, Kaya felt an increasing sense of calm. Peace would come one way or the other..."
jap_oil.23.a: "...And Japan would continue to march forwards even after he was gone."

#PM Event Chains - Rally the Diet
jap_oil.24.t: "Dried Blood on the Dunes"
jap_oil.24.d: "A sea change had come and went.\n\nJapan reformed into a more stable and just society during Takagi's tenure as Prime Minister, but change is gradual. The Yasuda Crisis tested the old order and proved it was flawed. The Oil Crisis tested the new order and proved that it was the right path to walk. From Mukden to Kōshu, the economies of the Sphere were slowling recovering from the Crisis, from Hanoi to Beijing there was growing unrest and a burning desire for further change. Change that the Home Isles would continue to provide. Slowly but surely, the crisis had began to subside. Slowly but surely, change would continue to come.\n\nA solution had emerged after all. Amidst the wars of the Middle East, the Imperial Government had identified factions they could work with, vulnerabilities they could exploit, and people they could connect with, and as Takagi, Prime Minister of Japan, looked at the results.

jap_oil.25.d: "A sea change had come and went.\n\nJapan adapted during Ikeda's tenure as Prime Minister, but adaptation is a continuous process, the Oil Crisis proved this.

Slowly but surely, the crisis would begin to subside. Slowly but surely things will return to normal.\n\nA solution had emerged after all.

jap_oil.26.d: "A sea change had come and went.\n\nJapan rationalised and innovated its governance during Kaya's tenure as Prime Minister, but change is gradual.

#PM Event Chains - Rally the Diet
jap_oil.27.t: "At the Edge of Time"
jap_oil.27.d: "Years had passed since Ino Hiroya had made a complete pig's breakfast of Yasuda and forced a fundamental realignment in Japanese politics of the day. To the shock of all but the Emperor and Takagi himself, the result was a sort of posthumous reassertion of the ways of Yonai Mitsumasa and Yamamoto Isoroku. Reformists under the old admiral swept into power, doing away with the "dying soul" of the old YSK.\n\nNow a moment was set aside for rest, and Takagi gathered his thoughts. He reflected on everything that had played out. All the debates in and out of the Diet. Facing down the House of Peers, and negotiating through the consequences of his reforms. The blowback from a nation freed to think and act for itself, to decide how it would promote Japan's interests in a hostile world.\n\nOutside, however, things were becoming worrisome. The ferment in Asia was taking a different form. The tensions with and within China had spiked since the start of the decade. Meanwhile, the Russians were centralizing their fractious lands, and seemed liable to come back for what they once called Primorye.\n\nYet just as Takagi had found a way past the collapse of the YSK, he would find a way forward here too. With that confidence in his mind, he sat back and relaxed a little."
jap_oil.27.a: "Just long enough to still his mind before he got back to work."

jap_oil.28.t: "Saionji's Successor"
jap_oil.28.d: "Years had passed since Ino Hiroya had made a complete pig's breakfast of Yasuda and forced a fundamental realignment in Japanese politics of the day. Ikeda Masanosuke, the pragmatic conservative and prominent friend of the zaibatsus, had managed to leverage his powerful faction and take power. Now, at long last, he could begin to take a little bit of rest and contemplate how things had played out.\n\nLike flipping through the newspapers he used to work for long ago, Ikeda's political career passed in front of his eyes. He contemplated the compromises and the achievements of his premiership. He interrogated his choices of allies, his decisions, the ideas he promoted and those he rejected. Though the Oil Crisis was over, things were now more uncertain than ever.\n\nHe thought about diplomacy - the Americans, the Germans, a thousand other countries besides. Diplomacy would soon no longer be enough though. The tensions with and within China had spiked since the start of the decade. Outside of the Sphere things were worse, this talk of the reunification of Russia disquieted him greatly. The coming years would prove to be another test for the Empire, one greater than anything he had faced before.\n\nIkeda sighed. He would continue to do what he was best at, adapt. Japan would adapt. It had to be enough. His voice cracked as he repeated himself."
jap_oil.28.a: "It had to be enough."

jap_oil.29.t: "Finality"
jap_oil.29.d: "It had been years since Ino Hiroya had made a complete pig's breakfast of Yasuda and forced a fundamental realignment in Japanese politics of the day. Amidst the chaos, it was the Technocratic faction of the YSK that assumed power under Kaya Okinori who then had to defer to the hardline faction of Kishi and Shiina.\n\nContinuous successes had followed—for them, not him; meanwhile his old friends.The thought terrified him. He didn't even know what happened to Aoi or Fukuda, or maybe he did not want to, he could not accept what his actions caused for them.\n\nWhoever else took over from him, as if it was even a question as to whom, would not have it easy, with Japanese politics left to rot under the Reformist Bureaucrats, not to say of the demands foreign powers would have, of diplomacy. But diplomacy would have no place in the world he created. The tensions with and within China had risen since the start of the decade and he could see the inevitable and he knew what the Hardliners response would be. Outside of the Sphere things were worse; the Reunification of Russia would alarm even Kishi if that demon had any sense left over in him.\n\nKaya had no illusions: the coming years would prove to be another test for the Empire, one greater than anything it had faced before, but it would not be his test. He had done enough work for three lifetimes. He felt no further obligation to worry about it, and even if he did, he lacked the will to give any more.\n\nA shuddering breath left him."
jap_oil.29.a: ""No more.""

jap_oil.30.t: "Finality"
jap_oil.30.d: ""I'm so tired," that thought had become increasingly common for Kaya Okinori ever since the Oil Crisis.\n\nIt had been years, after all, since Ino Hiroya had made a complete pig's breakfast of Yasuda and forced a fundamental realignment in Japanese politics of the day. Amidst the chaos, it was the technocratic faction of the YSK that assumed power under Kaya Okinori, and then assumed a rational, developmentalist line in accordance with his, but more importantly, Fukuda's beliefs.\n\nSuccess had followed success. But that did not make the old man feel any less cantankerous. His rest and relaxation were by now long overdue, and he could hardly wait to have Fukuda assume the position he had earned.\n\nFukuda and Aoi, as well as the rest of their cabinet, would not have it easy, the increasing tensions with the Americans, the Germans, and a thousand other countries besides ensured it, but he had faith in them. Still, the coming years worried Kaya. The tensions with and within China had risen since the start of the decade. Outside of the Sphere things were worse; the talk of the Reunification of Russia disquieted him greatly.\n\nHe had no illusions: the coming years would prove to be another test for the Empire, one greater than anything it had faced before. And he knew they would need all the help they could get, but not from him. He had done enough work for three lifetimes.\n\nSo Kaya raised a glass of sake in the vague direction of Fukuda's office, and murmured,"

jap_oil.36.d: "In the aftermath of the collapse of Italo-Egyptian rule over the region known as Sudan, opportunities have emerged for us to invest in the government that has emerged in the southern reaches of that region. Specifically, the region of South Sudan poses an interesting opportunity for our Empire as they have recently exited a Civil War and are in dire need of funding to recover from it.\n\nThe South Sudanese based around their capital Juba, differ starkly from their northern counterparts in ethnic and religious composition, and therefore cannot rely on anything making it to them from their northern neighbors, nor from across the Congo Jungles.\n\nThe Imperial Government could provide the funding required to help their recovery process via an infrastructure funding plan, doing this would open the door to further investment into the region, allowing us to exploit potential resources found inside their borders and inevitably, through the flux of investments and transactions that they would come to rely on, bring them into our Economic sphere.\n\nWhile the short term gains from such endevours may be limited, the region of South Sudan would allow multiple opportunities in the long term that may make this investment worth taking."

It is a test of every branch of our government. A test of every man's mettle, no matter what land they call home.

JAP_Oil_Keep_It_Flowing_desc: "Our Economy is heavily dependent on foreign resources, most tragically of all, on the black gold that flows across the now devastated Arabian subcontinent. For our economy to be able to recover, we must seek a secure link to these resources, be it from within the Sphere or from outside it.\n\nTo ensure a quicker recovery from this Crisis, we must also take a side in this conflict and align with either our old allies in Italy which hope to maintain their rule or with the ambitious Saudi family which hopes to cement its own influence in the region."

JAP_Oil_Ally_Ita: "Reaffirm the Old"
JAP_Oil_Ally_Ita_desc: "We must reinforce our ties with Italy, our de-facto ally in both World Wars. We are in a similar situation as theirs: guiding a diverse and resource rich continent into a prosperous future. A future that is now threatened by the possibility of an Arab Spring. Their success in this crisis is our success."
JAP_Oil_Protect_Ita: "A Duet Against Death"
JAP_Oil_Protect_Ita_desc: "With our economies working in tandem and our bonds stronger than ever, the time has come to begin the duet.\n\nA competition between the combined might of our two Empires and that of Washington and Germania, whose stakes are the future of the Middle-East.\n\nA dance, against the death defeat will bring. We are set for a truly dazzeling duel, like those in the coliseums of old."

JAP_Oil_Ally_Saudi: "Forge New Bonds"
JAP_Oil_Ally_Saudi_desc: "Siding with Italy would mean ignoring what this crisis truly represents: an opportunity.\n\nAn opportunity to seize the Middle East from their vestigial Empire and turn it into a bastion of Pan-Asianism that bends to the will of Asia's true master.\n\nThe best way to attempt this would be to ally with Saudi Arabia, a regional power in the Middle-East which is equally discontent with the status quo and similarily seeks to profit from the opportunity it presents.\n\nThough we may disagree on some matters, they are our best choice to secure the Black Gold that flows in Arabia's veins, we shall immediately begin talks to work together in managing this Crisis."
JAP_Oil_Protect_Saudi: "Preparing the Salafists"
JAP_Oil_Protect_Saudi_desc: "The Oil Crisis has caused a tidal wave of unrest to spread across the Middle East, and none are more at risk of suffering from than the state stuck figuratively and geographically in the middle of it.\n\nAs part of our negotiations with Saudi Arabia, we will begin training and supplying the armed forces so that they may be prepared for any attempts to spread the Ba'athist revolution to their country."

JAP_Oil_Twin_Blades: "Prepare the Twin Blades"
JAP_Oil_Twin_Blades_desc: "Joining forces with the Arabs as they protect their continet from foreign Imperialism is a noble quest. One which must be safeguarded by our armed forces.\n\nNo matter what their petty rivalry may have meant in the past, the IJN and IJA must stand together now as we embark on a journey to bring the light of Pan-Asianism to Arabia by land,sea and air.\n\nNothing shall stand in the way of the combined might of the world's greatest navy and armed forces."

JAP_Oil_Prevent_Uprisings: "Prevent Local Escalations"
JAP_Oil_Prevent_Uprisings_desc: "Tragically, the Crisis that grips the Middle-East has spread all across Asia.

We must crush any such attempts before they can escalate, no matter the cost."

JAP_Oil_Ally_Ventures_desc: "Dissent comes in many forms and while crushing it abroad, we must make sure it does grow at home.

JAP_Oil_Call_Favours: "Cash In Every Favor"
JAP_Oil_Call_Favours_desc: "During the span of our premiership we have inevitably drawn closer to groups of a certain reputation.

JAP_Oil_Continued_Prosperity: "Ensure Continued Prosperity"
JAP_Oil_Continued_Prosperity_desc: "The chief duty of any government is to ensure the continued prosperity of those it governs over, and in these troubling times we must not forget that.\n\nWhile bailing out businesses is key to ensuring economic recovery, we must not forget about our populance. A series of stimulus checks will be handed out to those in need as well as increased funding to social services like pensions and unemployment subsidies.\n\nThis will ensure that the population can survive and recover and by extension, help our economy recover from this crisis."

Jap_Oil_Crown_Jewel: "The Crown Jewel"
Jap_Oil_Crown_Jewel_desc: "Saudi Arabia has been blessed by the discovery of vast reserves of oil across its territory, but the Kingdom's worth extends far beyond the momentous wealth that flows under its sands.\n\nOver the past years, Saudi Arabia has built a subtle but massive network that spans all of Arabia, with deep connections to many of the Islamic groups that rose up during this Crisis. That is where the value of an alliance with them comes.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the Crown Jewel of the Oil Crisis. Whoever controls Saudi Arabia, controls the Middle East."

Jap_Oil_Oman: "The Cape of Muscat"
Jap_Oil_Oman_desc: "Oman is the closest Middle-Eastern nation to our Sphere and as such, it is strategically important despite lacking resources compared to the other countries.\n\nBy securing Oman, we will be provided with an advantageous position to kickstart and expand operations across the peninsula.\n\nThe oil fields in Muscat an added benefit and another reason to justify our efforts.\n\nThe Cape of Muscat must be secured."

Jap_Oil_Iraq: "The Cradle of Civilization"
Jap_Oil_Iraq_desc: "Iraq is a nation with an abundance of many things: a rich land fit for grand agricultural endeavors, a rich supply of oil to fund the state's efforts, and an abundance of chaos wrought from the recent crisis, the latest chapter of its long history of domination under foreign empires.\n\nAs the protectors of Pan-Asianism it is our duty to intervene and help this state, which boasts an abundance of potential, achieve it.\n\nOf course, to do that, we first have to help the right government end this chaos, but soon after, the Cradle of Civilization shall be cradeled by the spirti of Pan-Asianism."

Jap_Oil_Egypt: "The Gateway into Europe"
Jap_Oil_Egypt_desc: "Egypt is famous for many things, but perhaps none matter more than its position as the link between Asia and Africa by land, and Europe via the Suez Canal.\n\nIt is a place with rich history, a prize that many Empires have tried to claim, each of them building its wealth and making the region more valuable for the next.\n\nMay Pan-Asianism break this chain and bring Egypt into the fold, so that it may stay with us forever."

Jap_Oil_Sudan: "The Diamond in the Rough"
Jap_Oil_Sudan_desc: "One could be forgiven for thinking Sudan to be the least valuable. The region's lack of petrol and developed natural resources, as well as its poverty, present the picture of backwater, but the truth is that Sudan is far more than that.\n\nSudan's valuable port in the northeast connects the interior of Africa to the rest of the world via rail, a naturally beachhead for expanding our influence into the continent, with all of its mineral riches waiting to be discovered and tapped.\n\nThe region is a true diamond in the rough."

JAP_Oil_Sunrise_Across_Dunes: "Sunrise Across the Blood-Red Dunes"
JAP_Oil_Sunrise_Across_Dunes_desc: "With the last of our investment projects complete and the Crisis brought under heel, the time has come to rest and enjoy the sun rise over a new era.\n\nFor now, we should enjoy the moment of peace and serenity, time has shown they grow increasinly rarer.\n\nWe have carried Japan through its worse Crisis since Yasuda, we have done so much more than that, all for the good of our nation. And we will do so much more in the future, let that be a promise.\n\nMay the light of Pan-Asianism shine forevermore."

# Resignation Events

 japresignation.1.t: "Threats from Within"
 japresignation.1.desc: "Hatoyama Ichirō almost seemed glad to see the Deputy Prime Minister. So glad in fact, that Hayato Ikeda believed the man had cognitive dissonance when he spoke. "Elements within the House of Peers and the Privy Council are upset, Hayato. Some of the Jushin are talking dissent, and the bureaucracy reeks of anger over these recent changes. It's bad, but it is only a simmer now."\n\nThe man's grin disappeared. He propped himself forwards across the table, his face so close to Hayato's that he could smell his minty breath. "We need to act now, while these groups are unorganised. They are all unsure of each other, but give them a week, a fortnight..." He sat back down, his face a grim picture. "The whole government could be removed."\n\nThe man let Hayato think. He could only control politics to an extent, especially as the Deputy Prime Minister, but Ichirō was correct. Whatever problems these factions had could be dealt with, while his own faction still had the power. They had to move fast, else the very worst could come to pass. In a month's time, it would already be too late. Would a month be enough time to act?"
 japresignation.1.a: "Hopefully, it will be"

 japresignation.2.t: "Threats from Within"
 japresignation.2.desc: ""It's bad, Sōkichi." Zenjiro Horikiri said. "Very, very bad." Kido Kōichi echoed. "It's Konoe." Zenjiro said, and frowned. "Konoe Fumimaro." Kido nodded. "And Higashikuni Naruhiko." He echoed. The grave faces they wore suggested very bad news indeed. Each of them seemed unwilling to talk, glimpsing at the other, waiting to see who made the first move.\n\n"They're unhappy. To say the least. They both have long, long lists of problems with you and your government they would just love to bring up." Zenjiro said. "And they're both Jushin, old, respected ones at that. They won't roll over like any others. No, that they definitely won't. They're both making their plans, Takagi, it won't be long until they strike." Kido added.\n\nThe two politicians were correct. This was bad. It was all Takagi Sōkichi could do to not scream, to not shout and smash down his fist in rage. Couldn't these Jushin see they were on the same side? "No", the Prime Minister thought. Takagi Sōkichi was always calm, no matter the situation. It would not do to break that persona now. "When will they strike?" He asked, his voice still as water.\n\n"A month from now." Zenjiro said grimly. "Else... the worst. The very worst, Sōkichi." Kido seemed to have nothing to add aside from another hard, grim face. Takagi frowned. A month. Would it be enough?"
 japresignation.2.a: "Hopefully, it will be"

 japresignation.3.t: "Threats from Within"
 japresignation.3.desc: "Kazuo Aoki's face was a depressing combination of fear and paranoia. His eyes jittered just beneath his wire spectacles, almost unable to address Kaya Okinori directly, or even look him in the eyes. Whatever he needed with the Prime Minister, it had to be urgent; he had arranged this meeting near midnight.\n\n"Uh, Mr Kaya, uh, welcome." He smiled a smile that faded in almost a second, his pale face almost twitching. "It's bad boss, real bad. It doesn't seem like it on the surface, but beneath? Beneath its some whole fucking web of deception and- "\n\n"Ok, alright, enough of this Aoki. You're stuttering. Take a breath, talk to me when you're ready. We'll have more than enough time to fix whatever it is you are concerned about." Kaya said. "More than enough time. So you take yours."\n\n"It's the House of Peers, and the Privy Council." Kazuo said suddenly. "They are planning treason, Mr Kaya. Some of the Jushin are pushing for a removal of your position, and the cabinet as a whole as well as a few other choice officials. Some of these Jushin have valid complaints, and a whole lot of them. It is going to be hard to get these men to cooperate." Kazuo sucked in breath, and, it seemed, his confidence too. "Damn hard. But I believe we can mend these issues within the month."\n\nA month. Whatever problems these factions had could be dealt with, while his own faction still had the power. They had to move fast, else the very worst could come to pass. In a month's time, it would already be too late. Would a month be enough time to act?"
 japresignation.3.a: "Hopefully, it will be"

 japresignation.4.t: "Too Late to Act"
 japresignation.4.desc: "It was easy enough to guess at what Hatoyama Ichirō and Satō Eisaku would've wanted at three in the morning. It was over. It may not yet be official, but he was defeated all the same. Defeated before the battle had begun, outmaneuvered before he had even drawn up his plans. He had failed to act.\n\nHayato Ikeda received their resignations, and heard each man out for a moment. "The House of Peers is pushing for a vote, a vote to remove the Prime Minister from office, along with his cabinet. It is expected a majority will vote in favour, and that is not to mention what the Privy Council or the Jushin think about the matter." An expression of anger bloomed in Ichirō's face. "I warned you Hayato. None can say I didn't." He slammed the door as he left.\n\nIf Ichirō had a lot to say, Satō Eisaku had little. "Give my farewells to the boss, alright?" He smiled, and stood up. "Good luck, Hayato." The door hinges fared a lot better when Eisaku shut it. The same could not be said for the Deputy Prime Minister. What had Hayato done to deserve such disservice? He thought he had served the nation well, yet the House and the Council saw it well and proper to stab him in the back. It wasn't until midday that Hayato left that little meeting chamber, a man infinitely times more miserable."
 japresignation.4.a: "How could this have happened?"

 japresignation.5.t: "Too Late to Act"
 japresignation.5.desc: "If the two men were talkative beforehand, they were as silent as the grave now. His assistant had woken Takagi up at just three in the morning, saying that both Zenjiro Horikiri and Kido Kōichi were waiting in an audience chamber for the Prime Minister, with a most urgent announcement. He had dressed himself into a black suit with a dull sense of fear, drove himself to the chambers with a moderate sense of panic, and walked into the meeting place feeling as if his heart would give out.\n\nWhen they finally spoke the words, it sat with Takagi surprisingly well. "I'm sorry Sōkichi." Zenjiro said, speaking his name as if he had died. "They acted, Konoe Fumimaro and Higashikuni Naruhiko, both. At midnight." Kido added. Takagi would've laughed aloud, if the situation wasn't so awful. "Deeds done in darkness indeed," he thought.\n\n"They have managed to sway a majority from both the House of Peers and the Privy Council. It is accepted that both chambers will consent to a vote to remove you from office." Zenjiro said. Kōichi sighed. "I'm sorry Sōkichi." Time seemed to freeze. What had Takagi done to deserve such disservice? He thought he had served the nation well, and these two men, Konoe and Higashikuni, seemed it well and proper to stab him in the back.\n\n"At midnight, no less," he thought, a laugh gathering in his throat. He decided it would be best to swallow it.\n\nHe looked from Zenjiro to Kōichi, both refusing to make eye contact. "That is it, I suppose. No reason to fight against this, it seems." Takagi smiled. "I will cooperate, and step down honourably. They cannot deny me that.""
 japresignation.5.a: "How could this have happened?"

 japresignation.6.t: "Too Late to Act"
 japresignation.6.desc: "Konoe Fumimaro, Kido Kōichi, Higashikuni Naruhiko. The Prime Minister had a hypothesis about what a meeting involving these three would be about. Especially at this hour of the night. His assistant had woken him up, violently at that, at three in the morning to attend this damn meeting. Now that he was finally here, none seemed willing to break the news to him.\n\n"Both the Jushin and the Privy Council have rescinded support for the government, Mr Kaya." Kōichi finally said. "While the House of Peers is still on side for now, I fear that their support is flimsy at best, if their support could see us through the rest of your Prime Ministership anyhow." He shook his head. "I'm sorry, Okinori. I fear it is over, they're calling for your resignation."\n\nKaya turned to the two Jushin, both seemingly as distant as the other. "We tried to sway the others, Mr Kaya, but it just wasn't enough." Konoe said. "We're sorry." Higashikuni added. None of the three men seemed willing to meet his eye after that, but what of it? They had said their piece. "That will be all. You three may leave. You will hear of my decision soon."\n\nWhat had Okinori done to deserve such disservice? He thought he had served the nation well, yet the Jushin and the Council saw it well and proper to stab him in the back. Politics had an endless appetite for betrayal, it seemed to the Prime Minister. Whatever had brought about it, though, it was apparent to Okinori that he would serve a good deal less time as Prime Minister than he would've hoped. There was no use contemplating his fate however; he was the one who had brought it about, after all. He would serve his final days honourably, at least. None could deny him that."

 japresignation.7.b: "I won't pray myself,\nFor I refuse to stay and watch my life end."

 japresignation.8.t: "Politics is Numbers"
 japresignation.8.desc: "For the second time in a decade, the YSK's conservative wing had been found utterly wanting when entrusted with the reins of government. They were left adrift in the wake of Ikeda's disgrace, certain only that they would not be so lucky to have a third chance.\n\nThe Imperial Diet, the newspapers, and the populace all agreed: the status quo was broken, and it was time for something new.\n\nIn the political vacuum, Takagi's reformists and Kaya's technocratic corporatists wasted no time in selling themselves as the 'only' feasible alternative in the YSK. Through curated press releases, parliamentary 'study sessions', and night after night of ryotei banquets, Takagi and Kaya spared no expense to sway the YSK's rank and file towards their camp.\n\nThe remaining conservatives were under no illusion that this courtship would last beyond the selection of the next prime minister, after which they would truly fade into the backbenches. But until that time, they were still needed. Still valued - for the weight their numbers could provide, even if their ideas had turned to dust in the wind."

 japresignation.9.t: "Takagi's Choice"
 japresignation.9.desc: "No matter how civilized it looked on the surface, Takagi thought that politics had plenty in common with war. The sea of handwritten notes and printed documents, overflowing from his desk, immediately reminded him of similar stressful moments in Navy service.\n\nThe grappling with uncertainty. A clash of wills and preparations, held in secret from the enemy. The buildup to a single, culminating moment - where one would either revel in victory, or swallow defeat.\n\nAnd if politics was similar to war, then it stood to reason that only a fool went in on equal footing with the enemy. Only with an overwhelming advantage could a battle be called fair - and in the all-important race to become Prime Minister, that meant winning the favor of the Jushin, those political grandees who recommended a 'suitable' candidate to the Emperor.\n\nEven if they remained on the sidelines, the Jushin were watching every move, every word coming from the Diet. Takagi's sway over the membership of the YSK was surely important - but equally so would be how his policies affected the Jushin's position, and the welfare of the nation.\n\nTakagi stood, taking a momentary break to observe the scene outside his office window. If the men and women outside - and surely amongst them, the Jushin - could see inside, what would they see?\n\nWould they respond better to the image of an admiral, the esteemed captain arguing change was needed to stabilize the ship of state?\n\nOr was it time to embrace his transformation - into the fervent believer in reform his faction needed him to be?"

The page in front of him was splattered with ink, a forest of lines striking through names and numbers.\n\nEvery line signaled one unknown eliminated, a name sorted between declared support and identified opposition. Every morsel of knowledge rolled back the fog of uncertainty just a bit further, chasing fear away.\n\nKaya leaned back in his seat, looking at the last few names left unmarked in his notebook. Former prime ministers, imperial nobles, and decorated advisors - the Jushin, those men with the ear of the Emperor himself. Their favor could illuminate Kaya's future in brilliant light; their disfavor would cast him irretrievably back into the shadows of lesser men.\n\nKaya chewed on a cigarette butt as he tapped a pen impatiently against his desk. Would the most esteemed politicians of the Empire understand the urgency of the situation - the dangers they courted if they kowtowed to the masses, instead of projecting strength?\n\nOr would Kaya's record as an elder statesman in his own right - an architect of the wartime state, an insider with conviction instead of greed - make him the safer choice in uncertain times?"

Don't keep them waiting.\n\nThe mad rush to get dressed and marshal a household to receive a guest of the highest caliber would only be completed as the sound of an approaching car could be heard in the distance. As the engine grew louder, and then stopped, the entire scene would fall silent, the anointed host standing at attention behind the door.\n\nOne knock. Then two. There would not be a third; it would be rude to keep the Imperial emissary waiting.\n\nThe door would be opened, and the host would bow, as would his entire entourage. The guest - a court messenger, dressed in embroidered Western court attire, a vestige of a bygone age - would not cross the threshold. Instead, they would relay a simple message:\n\n"His majesty, the Emperor, hereby orders his loyal subject to assemble the ministers of his government."\n\nA silence, ordained by custom, heavy with the weight of the Emperor's trust. Finally:"

 # Iranian Civil War
 jap_fopo.1.t: "Start of the Iranian Civil War"
 jap_fopo.1.d: "After the assassination of the Shah, Iran has collapsed into Civil War. The late Shah's wife Farah Pahlavi has assumed the role of regent and has rallied loyalists to the old government in the North to prepare a defence against the coalition of revolutionary forces that has emerged the rid the country of German influence.\n\nWhile currently united in a common goal, the coalition is an uneasy alliance between various disparate groups and the prospect for unity long term remains slim. Military Intelligence and the Foreign Ministry have therefore recommended we focus our efforts to providing support and assistance for the Islamic Republic of Iran, suggesting it represents our best chance to gain a strong ally in the region.\n\nThe Republic's leader, Khomeini commands strong popular support, and his anti-imperialist rhetoric fits well with our own, with our initial diplomatic advances having proved positive. With his popular support, and our supplies and military assistance we have a golden opportunity to gain a powerful ally in the region."
 jap_fopo.1.a: "Begin our preparations at once."
 jap_fopo.2.t: "Defeat in the Iranian Civil War"
 jap_fopo.2.d: "Despite widespread popular support Kohmeini's forces have been defeated. We have now lost the potential to gain a key ally in the region which will hurt our ability to project power and gain influence in the Middle East significantly."
 jap_fopo.2.a: "Unfortunate."
 jap_fopo.3.t: "Victory in the Iranian Civil War"
 jap_fopo.3.d: "Khomeini's forces have triumphed in the Iranin Civil War. After the collapse of the Anti-government coalition in Iran the Islamic Republic of Iran remains as the last faction standing. Thanks to our support for his regime this will be a significant boon for our influence in the area."

 # DEPRECATED - Indonesian Civil War
 jap_fopo.4.t: "Mapping"
 jap_fopo.4.d: ""These maps are all wrong, here, especially on Sulawesi. If you compare it to these reports... It says that the local resistance have all closed up shop in the south and are now residing within this portion of the island, mainly concentrated around the north east. That'll have to be corrected, but the worst maps are the ones of Papua. Not that that matters, at least not for my garrisons. Have these ones fixed, I've got some relics of my own to update."\n\nBrushing away his aide after the man had tucked away the five, meter long maps underneath his shoulder, another one of his aides entered the room, facing straight towards Botan.\n\n"General Botan, Lieutenant General Hiroto is booked in for his meeting. Should I send him in?"\n\n"I'm ready for him."\n\nIt hadn't been less than a minute until Hiroto entered the doorway, dressed sharply in his Army uniform. The man had his own maps tucked underneath his shoulder, plus a briefcase held in his right hand. He sharply saluted, and made himself seated.\n\n"Those are the maps I managed to draw up, like you asked for a week ago." Hiroto stated, punctual as ever. "And this... is a documentation of the three wartime governors of Sulawesi and all of the changes they made to the state over their tenure. Tons of this shit is nearly useless, but some... some of these notes are actually valuable. I hope."\n\n"I hope so too." Hiroto said, thinking to himself about the odd connections between himself and a bureaucrat. Perhaps he should employ a couple... "Stay tuned, Hiroto. We'll add to the maps together. In private, however, I have found the need to retract my predecessor's orders for the garrison. It's time for Indonesia to return to progress.""
 jap_fopo.4.a: "One step at a time."
 jap_fopo.5.t: "Capital Letters"
 jap_fopo.5.d: "Tedium was a constant in all work. Asahi knew that, and a diplomat's career was no exception. He sifted through the documents usually sent his way; a Chinese governor requesting an extended budget on some construction project, a list of profits made by state-owned companies in Shanghai, the construction of new military installations along the porous thing that was the Manchurian-Russian border. Underneath it all, however, laid a most surprising development.\n\nIt heralded from the capital of Indonesia. He deftly opened the letter, and read the thing top to bottom. Then a second time. The contents of it were unbelievable.\n\nInside the document was a formal request to establish an embassy in Tokyo, a lift on the ban on Indoesnian travel, the re-establishment of trade plus flight and sea lanes. While the document said nothing about formal recognition between the two states, nor the open hostility shown towards Indonesians still residing in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the fact that this letter even existed was shocking enough to Aashi.\n\nIt was odd, for sure. He filed it away, and sent it up the chain."

 # Philippine Reconstruction
 jap_fopo.6.t: "REPORT ON THE ORIENT PEARL"
 jap_fopo.6.d: "DISPATCH — Dai 14-gun Shirei-bu, Manila\nRECIPIENT: PMO, DAIHON'EI, DAITOASHO\nSUBJECT: RECOVERY OF THE PHILIPPINES\n\nRespected Prime Minister,\n\nThe Philippines Government has also proven more capable than we had expected. Crisis recovery is proceeding at an acceptable pace following our intervention in the process. Elections have been scheduled by the end of the year to ensure a more stable government.\n\nThanks to our brave and diligent soldiers as well as the support given by the Imperial Government and the General Staff to our noble efforts to drive out the American-backed agents of imperialism as well the communist terrorists from the Philippines, we have managed to root out the vast majority of rebel forces.\n\nOf note however is that in spite of our best efforts, such elements are likely to remain a threat for the foreseeable future. More information is provided on the map showing strong-points of resistances attached to this communique.\n\nThe 14th Army has achieved a great success in our duties to uphold Pan-Asianism in the Orient Pearl. Our work will continue to ensure the Philippines never again find themselves in situation the likes of what occured earlier this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\nINADA MASAZUMI"
