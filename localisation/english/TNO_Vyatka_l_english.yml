 # Leaders
 VYT_Vladimir_III: "Vladimir III"
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC: "Born into exile in 1917, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov became head of the exiled Imperial Family of Russia in 1938 following the death of his father Kirill Vladimirovich, cousin of the late Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nResiding in Brittany when the Second World War started, he soon found himself and his family in German custody. At the 'insistence' of German authorities, he soon began collaborating, making radio broadcasts encouraging Russian defection from the Soviet regime. Offered the regency of Ukraine at the end of the war, he turned it down on the grounds that it would unacceptably divide Russia.\n\nDespite the war's end, however, Vladimir could not return to Russia - the Germans were concerned that, like as had happened with Vlasov, his popularity could undermine their rule. It wasn't until the West Russian War that he was able to convince them to permit his rallying a division of monarchists and exiled Whites to lead a wildly successful counteroffensive. As the Wehrmacht offensive stalled, Vladimir's did not, breaking through to establish a pocket of monarchist rule in Russia.\n\nIn the years since, the newly-proclaimed Tsar Vladimir III has had little success in expanding that pocket, and has found many domestic headaches besides. Now the Tsar waits, biding his time until the moment where he can strike, and reclaim all of Russia - his by divine birthright."
 
 VYT_Boris_I: "Boris I"
 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC: "The story of West Russia's last monarch, Boris I, is a bizarre, yet fascinating one. Boris Mikhailovich Skosyrev was born to a rich family in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire. While he was a member of a family that belonged to the gentry, he was never a claimant to any throne by birth - but what he couldn't get through his bloodline, he would earn on his own.\n\nWhen the October Revolution broke out, Boris fled and became one of the many émigrés. He would soon distinguish himself in the British Foreign Office, partaking in many missions before arriving in the Netherlands and then finding where his most famous adventure so far would unfold: the country of Andorra. After carefully plotting, he took the title of Prince with popular support in the 1930s, and promised to bring Andorra into the modern age. He would soon be arrested and imprisoned, but luckily, after spending a few years in prisons around Western Europe, he would be released by the Nazi occupation authorities and begin to collaborate with them. With the advent of the West Russian War and Tsar Vladimir's expedition, he gladly joined him, and stood by him as a loyal liaison - until it became inconvenient to do so.\n\nSkosyrev would not stay idle as the Anti-Communist Guard achieved victory after victory. One day, as the troops came closer to Vyatka, he would come to the city center, guns blazing, and declare the former West Russian authority to have ended, replaced by Kirpichnikov's army. In the place of the city's corrupt rulers, Boris I now rules as Prince of Vyatka and guardian of the frontier, in the name of the Anti-Communist Guard and the Russian people. For how long this principality will last, who knows."

 VYT_Vladimir_Kharzhevsky_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LA veteran of both World Wars, Russian Civil War, and the West Russian War, Vladimir Kharzhevsky now sits at the right hand of the Tsar himself. Serving with Pytor Wrangel's front as a major general and commander of the Drozdovsky Division, he fled with Wrangel with his men into exile after their evacuation from Crimea, Vladimir bounced around Europe throughout the 20s and 30s aimlessly. He only truly gained a calling when Tsar Vladimir III proclaimed himself Tsar and agreed to work with the Germans. Moving to Germany, he soon sent an offer to the ROVS and was promptly reappointed as a major general and the newly revived Drozdovsky Regiment.\n\nVladimir served the Tsar faithfully, fighting with the ROVS and their German masters for over a decade. He even formed a close personal relationship with his monarch, becoming one of his closest political advisors. When the ROVS moved to break with the German lines and seize Vyatka during the tail end of the West Russian War the head of the ROVS, Alexei Aleksandrovich von Lampe, resigned from command due to his disagreeing of breaking relations with the Germans. This left Vladimir has the easy choice to succeed Alexei as leader of the ROVS and by extension, de facto Head of Government of the newly formed Principality of Vyatka.\n\nNow Vladimir sits at his Tsar's side, dispensing advise to his friend. Vladimir also finds himself exasperated at the bickering of the émigré factions, but whatever may happen with them, the Tsar will always have an ally in his most trusted friend.§!"
 VYT_Roman_Gul: "Roman Gul"
 VYT_Roman_Gul_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\nLiberal Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LCan someone be both a White émigré and a liberal at the same time? Enter Roman Borisovich Gul, a veteran of both the First World War and the Russian Civil War who fought with Lavr Kornilov's Shock Regiment during the First Kuban Campaign, Gul emigrated to Berlin and became a liberal writer. This drew the ire of the Reich when they rose to power during the 1930s, and he was quickly thrown into a concentration camp for his writings. He barely escaped with his life from Germany into France and became the writer for several liberal émigré magazines. When the Germans successfully invaded France in 1941, Gul was forced into hiding to avoid being captured by the Germans, working in a glass factory and taking a new identity.\n\nWhen the Tsar officially gave his support to the Germans, Roman smelt an opportunity. Taking a gamble, Roman sent Tsar Vladimir a letter stating that in exchange for the Reich giving him a pardon, he would become the ROVS's propaganda minister. Appealing to the Germans, the Reich begrudgingly granted the Tsar's request and Roman became the propaganda minister for the entire ROVS.\n\nHowever, Roman never truly abandoned his liberal ideals nor his hatred to the vile Germans. When the opportunity presented itself for the Tsarists to break with the Germans and attempt to form their own state, Roman was a fierce advocate for it. When they finally took Vyatka, Roman and other like-minded émigrés reformed the old liberal monarchist Kadets, and has now become the most prominent liberal reformer in Vyatka with him having an ever fierce rivalry with the more reactionary factions. Time will tell if Vyatka will follow Gul's path, or if he will be left in the dust.§!"

Born to a middle-class family of Scandinavian ancestry, his family was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1924 and settled in the Baltics, where he completed his schooling at a German-sponsored school. When the Baltics were invaded in 1940 this education, along with his Germanic-sounding name, was enough to allow him escape to Germany proper.\n\nIn 1942, studying at the University of Breslau, he joined the Solidarists and this, combined with a developing Orthodox faith, caused him to gradually move into the orbit of the monarchists still under German protection. During the West Russian War, he attached himself to Tsar Vladimir's military effort and upon that victory followed them to, and settled in, Vyatka.\n\nThe reputation of loyalty and reliability resulting from that was sufficient to elevate him to the Imperial Council, where he now serves faithfully as the Solidarists' representative.§!"

 ### Ideas ###
 VYT_unrepentant_reaction: "Unrepentant Reaction"
 VYT_unrepentant_reaction_desc: "Ever since the fall of the old empire Russia has suffered, crushed beneath one tyrant after another. Communism, and its cloaked agent socialism, have worked tirelessly to take away what little the Russian people have left, and to this the Tsar has proclaimed 'No more!' The Empire will rise again, the communists will be destroyed, and with the Tsar's just rule, peace will again return to this great land."

 VYT_Imperial_Market: "The Empire's Bounty, for the World!"
 VYT_Imperial_Market_desc: "The idea that a monarchy cannot compete in the cutthroat market is naive at best, and ignorant at most, for the Russian Empire lays upon what is easily the world's richest resource bounty on the planet: steel, oil, the riches of Russia go out for the highest bidders with their full coffers entering the treasury, to later return as investments to bring the Tsardom and Russia to the modern age.\n\nSoon, there will be a time we will not be a provider but a seller, but it will make do for now."

 VYT_officer_infighting: "Military Infighting"
 VYT_officer_infighting_desc: "The White Army, or what remains of it, has never been a unified front. Though a shared hatred of communism unites them, the question of how a unified Russia should be governed threatens to shatter the unity of the Tsar's armies. While some believe in the old ideals, others petition for democracy, and a few even speak of the strengths of fascistic regimes. The Tsar alone is the only thing keeping them in line, and even then only just. It is clear that if the state is to rebuild what was once lost, it must ensure that the army stands united."

 VYT_officers_reigned_in: "Officers Reined In"
 VYT_officers_reigned_in_desc: "Though difficult, the state has succeeded in curbing both the worst influences of, and actions taken by, its military officer corps. Though it will take time, political influence, and cause manpower disruptions as problematic officers are cashiered or prosecuted, the Tsar can be confident that his officers will soon be united in purpose. Divided leadership will no longer negatively affect our armies."

 VYT_the_tsar_and_himself: "The Tsar and Himself"
 VYT_the_tsar_and_himself_desc: "Like in the old days, the Tsar rules with absolute power. Lately, however, he has witnessed the rise of liberalism and democratic ideals within the hearts and minds of his subjects. Though many advise him to ignore these developments altogether, the Tsar knows well that he stands on a precipice, where the love of his people could very quickly turn into hatred, the way it has before. He must, therefore, soon make a choice: To rule alone, as his ancestors did, or to give the people their own say in his government."

 VYT_the_peoples_tsar_idea: "The People's Emperor"
 VYT_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc: "In keeping with his effort to demonstrate solidarity with every one of his many subjects, the Tsar has embarked on a whirlwind tour of the many factories and industrial facilities in the state, meeting with workers and acting to solve the problems that most affect them. Though none can find fault with the political benefit of doing so, and while the Tsar's personal attention will no doubt result in factories doing their best to demonstrate elevated production levels, it is likely that efficiency will be hampered as the declared 'solutions' are suddenly implemented."

 VYT_imperial_detachment_idea: "Imperial Detachment"
 VYT_imperial_detachment_idea_desc: "The Tsar's decision to preserve that intangible aspect of character critical to his role as a monarch, as well as to focus on matters of state rather than matters of publicity, has resulted in his personal withdrawal from many events, even as his person remains in the minds of all those present. While this is no doubt reassuring to many, who can be secure in the knowledge that their Tsar is fixing problems before they become apparent to society at large, making his position known to the public through functionaries does require additional efforts to be made."

 VYT_kirov_vodka: "Vyatka Vodka"
 VYT_kirov_vodka_desc: "The Vyatka distilleries are in full operation, producing enormous quantities of high-quality spirits that can be consumed at home, exported abroad, or used in medical and military settings as a high-quality antiseptic. Although it might seem humorous to some, vodka is a Russian staple, and with thoughts of an united motherland accompanying every bottle consumed, all are inspired to work harder and waste less in pursuit of the dream of unification."

 VYT_modern_age_okhrana: "A Modern Age Okhrana"
 VYT_modern_age_okhrana_desc: "The Tsar has wisely reconstituted the Okhrana, the Imperial intelligence and counter-revolutionary police force. With resources so dedicated, and with the knowledge that they shield the state from enemies both foreign and domestic, they will act to improve the state's cryptographic capabilities as well as minimize the operations of bandit and partisan strikes on its forces. In addition, and through the sharing of obtained information, they will also serve to better the tactical dispositions of military commanders in the field."

 VYT_modern_age_okhrana_2: "A Shackled Okhrana"
 VYT_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc: "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 VYT_modern_age_okhrana_3: "A Strengthened Okhrana"
 VYT_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc: "Without the constant vigilance of the Okhrana, the Tsar's government would have long ago fallen to revolutionaries, traitors, or worse. It must therefore be given wide latitude to intercept and eliminate potential threats before they become real ones. Though it is likely that some 'mistakes' will be made, it is a small price to pay to ensure the security of the state."

 VYT_white_army_traditions_idea_desc: "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities.

 VYT_imperial_special_forces_desc: "As part of the state's reorientation away from tradition and towards modern approaches to warfare, an increased focus has been placed on the selection and training of specialist formations. While this focus certainly increases the efficacy of these special units, the stringent requirements for induction within them has resulted, at least temporarily, in an overall reduction of recruitment efforts."

 VYT_strength_in_numbers_idea: "Strength in Numbers"
 VYT_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc: "Holding true to the classical Russian focus on manpower and numerical superiority, the state's military has vastly expanded recruitment, relaxing standards and searching for recruits outside traditional areas. While this does mean many more soldiers will be entering the Tsar's armies, it also means that they are, at least for a time, likely to be somewhat less effective as training programs are stretched beyond their natural limits."

 VYT_return_of_the_tsar: "Return of the Emperor"
 VYT_return_of_the_tsar_desc: "The emergence of Vyatka, a monarchist state, in a land that had executed its previous monarchs was one of the stranger outcomes of the West Russian War. And yet, to many, it was understandable.\n\nCommunism had utterly failed the Russian people, leading them into subjugation under a foreign regime, and a return to earlier times, when Russia imposed its will on others, rather than being imposed upon itself, was inherently attractive.\n\nTsar Vladimir has shown to the people the qualities expected of an Emperor, sharing in their pain from and anger at the German bombers that terrorize them regularly. And he has pledged that, in due time, he will see their skies cleared, their land reclaimed, and their Imperial eagle proudly displayed from the Volga to the Amur."

 VYT_an_economic_graveyard: "An Economic Graveyard"
 VYT_an_economic_graveyard_desc: "Across all of Western Russia, regular bombing missions by the German Luftwaffe make it impossible to maintain an economy of any reasonable size of complexity. Anything resembling a factory is identified, targetted, and destroyed. This is by design. The Germans know that if they can keep us from industrializing they can keep us from unifying against them.\n\nWe may not be able to build an industrial base at the moment, but that does not mean we must remain idle. We can evaluate our resources, identify skilled workers, and plan future development sites. We can prepare as much as we are able. If we are to reclaim Russia for the Romanov dynasty, we must have industry.\n\nOne day, the bombings will, must, stop. And when they do, we will be ready."

 VYT_the_vyatka_distillery: "The Vyatka Distillery"
 VYT_the_vyatka_distillery_desc: "To many Russians, a stable supply of good-quality vodka is considered as essential as food itself. As a result of devastation from both the war and the German bombing campaigns, such a product has become scarce. And therein lies an opportunity that the Tsar has proposed to exploit.\n\nPotatoes will be planted and farmed in bulk, providing food, employment, and raw materials for the spirit. Distilleries will be reclaimed and reconstituted to transform those materials into high-quality vodka, proving yet more employment, addressing domestic demand, and supplying the state with a valuable - and highly desired - trade good.\n\nThe revenue from selling vodka all over Russia will finance other projects, and with every bottle sold, one more Russian will know that their Tsar understands their needs."

 VYT_alternative_uses: "Alternative Uses"
 VYT_alternative_uses_desc: "The high-quality alcohol produced by state distilleries, though eminently valuable for trade, can also be used as an effective antiseptic. In Russia, where injury is a fact of life and medical infrastructure is frequently fragile, this is valuable almost beyond compare.\n\nBy constructing laboratories adjacent to our new distilleries, we can render some of the produced spirits into medical-grade disinfectant, and supply both our civilian and military hospitals with a reliable and steady supply. We can, in a similar fashion, also package some of it for export, increasing trade, generating capital and, perhaps, civilizing warfare in Russia ever so slightly."

 VYT_the_imperial_potato_act: "The Imperial Potato Act"
 VYT_the_imperial_potato_act_desc: "The success of the Tsar's initiative to develop a distillation industry has been successful. Too successful. While employment has risen and much needed hard currency, earned from export, has begun to enter the economy at long last, we have a serious problem. There are simply not enough potatoes to keep up with demand. We must take action.\n\nThe solution is the Imperial Potato Act, providing increasing subsidies in taxes, land, and labor for farmers who agree to dedicate certain percentages of their arable land to potatoes.\n\nThe increased production will allow for more vodka to be bottled, which will also allow us to begin increasing the amount of it we export. It won't be long until the Dutch, French, Germans, and more all agree that the finest Russian vodka comes from Vyatka."

 VYT_find_new_markets: "Find New Markets"
 VYT_find_new_markets_desc: "Optimizations made to the Vyatka distilleries in recent times have resulted in even greater production than before. We simply cannot sell it all, on either the domestic or local foreign markets, without an unacceptable reduction in price. The solution, therefore, must lie further afield.\n\nThe Netherlands, or what remains of it under the Reich, has in recent years embraced an identity as a nexus of legal and extralegal trade, and this offers an opportunity. Although sales likely won't reach the same levels as in Russia, they will act to reduce our vast stockpiles, protect our prices, and bring in hard currency besides."

 VYT_rolling_on_the_river: "Rolling on the River"
 VYT_rolling_on_the_river_desc: "River transport has long been a mainstay of Russian commerce and trade. Transport along them is often much faster than moving overland, and this is doubly so in current times, given the state of Russian infrastructure. Though we no longer control great rivers such as the Dnieper, the Don, or the Volga, we do control the Vyatka River, and it connects into a vast network of other rivers across Western Russia.\n\nBy re-opening the city's wharves and promoting the construction of river barges and other tradecraft, we can compensate for our infrastructure and increase trade both internally and externally. Perhaps, in time, Vyatka itself will become a hub for such activity."

 VYT_the_kostroma_pipeline: "The Kostroma Pipeline"
 VYT_the_kostroma_pipeline_desc: "The establishment of trade connections with the Dutch has proven very beneficial, allowing us an outlet for our excess production of both alcohol as well as other goods. But the Netherlands are far away, and transporting good there is in itself a risk. We need somewhere closer.\n\nKostroma, the city situated on the border of the German sphere, is perfectly situated. The porous border allows for the easy transport of goods into the Reich, and while the Germans are not our friends any longer, their money is just as good as anyone else's. We will take it. Until the empire is strong enough not to need to."

 VYT_a_new_hub_of_trade: "A New Hub of Trade"
 VYT_a_new_hub_of_trade_desc: "Our efforts to encourage trade have proven wildly successful. With the identification and prioritization of key trade goods, the development of international connections, and the promotion of rapid and efficient arteries of trade among the Russian waterways, Vyatka has exploded in activity. The city's wharves are bustling, merchants are moving ever larger carhoes, and revenue increases month-over-month. However, the Tsar and those who advise him are always looking forward.\n\nA plan to establish Vyatka as a central trade hub for Western Russia has been put forward and accepted. Infrastructure will be vastly expanded, allowing for consequent expansions in trade and other forms of commerce and ensuring a dominating future position for Vyatka as a city, and contributing to a strong financial base for campaigns to come."

 VYT_imperial_austerity: "Imperial Austerity"
 VYT_imperial_austerity_desc: "Following an exhaustive audit of the Principality's economy in its entirety, both the Tsar and his ministers have been shocked to learn of its true, highly decrepit, state. Factories lie abandoned, as artisans produce what little they can in basement workshops. Fields lie fallow, as farmers focus on subsistence farming to feed themselves and their families. If action is not taken, our fragile economy will soon collapse entirely.\n\nTo address this, a plan for austerity has been put before the Tsar. Severe cuts to services, education, and security will be painful, especially for the many already suffering. But they are necessary. And the Tsar has been very clear - they will not last forever."

 VYT_moderate_austerity_programs: "Moderate Austerity Programs"
 VYT_moderate_austerity_programs_desc: "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has chosen to moderate the proposal. Cuts will be made, some quite painful, but they will be compassionate. The Tsar will not impose undue burden on his people, and sectors that are identified as critical to the basic needs of the population will be spared the worst of the reductions. A Russia without its people is no Russia at all."

 VYT_public_works_projects: "Public Works Projects"
 VYT_public_works_projects_desc: "Two horrific wars, a breakdown of central authority, and the regular German bombing of anything of value has resulted in the almost complete destruction of any Russian infrastructure worthy of the name. In both our state and elsewhere, ordinary Russians rely on local paths and trail guides for most travel. That naturally strangles trade, industrial and economic development, and military operations. It must be addressed.\n\nTo solve this, the Tsar and his government will fund public works projects throughout the Principality, building new infrastructure and repairing the old while also providing employment. The Germans will destroy some of it, of course, but we will maintain commitment, whatever the cost. The future demands it."

 VYT_imperial_bank_of_russia: "Imperial Bank of Russia"
 VYT_imperial_bank_of_russia_desc: "The breakdown of Russia's industrial economy was accompanied by the breakdown of any reliable system of banking. The result has been the near-complete absence of appreciable investment or credit, lack of confidence in currencies, a return to the hoarding of precious metals, and the development of a barter-based economy amongst citizens.\n\nWith the establishment of public works and austerity programs, the next step is to rectify this critical issue through the creation of a central bank. Such a creation will help to legitimize, promote trust in, and set policy for our currency. Further, it will allow for both the stimulation and regulation of commercial and private lenders, encouraging economic growth in all sectors."

 VYT_more_extreme_measures: "More Extreme Measures"
 VYT_more_extreme_measures_desc: "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has made that hard choice. Infrastructure, healthcare, social programs, and more will be cut to the bone in order to establish the state's financial security and provide a basis for our future designs of territorial reclamation. The people will not be happy, but in time they will learn that the Tsar is planning for their future just as much as his own."

 VYT_divert_funds_to_the_military: "Divert Funds to the Military"
 VYT_divert_funds_to_the_military_desc: "Though painful, our severe cuts to the state budget have resulted in a surplus of assignable funds. Dedicating them to the military is an obvious choice - without secure control of our lands we cannot accomplish anything of note. Additional resources will allow them to recruit more soldiers, acquire more equipment, and improve their readiness.\n\nWe do, however, expect a negative response from the public, given what they have had to surrender in order to make this military expansion a possibility. Nevertheless, we are committed - regardless of the unpopularity of this action, we are preparing for the future of all of Russia, and in time the public will understand."

 VYT_tax_the_commoners: "Increase Taxes"
 VYT_tax_the_commoners_desc: "Despite our harsh austerity measures, we have not reduced expenditures to a sufficient degree. Revenue must therefore increase, and the only appreciable way to do that is through significant increases in taxation. Levies on a wide basket of basic and consumer goods should be sufficient, and though it will cause further public discontent, there is currently no other choice available.\n\nIt is, however, believed that this measure should be the last required in order to obtain the funds needed for significant public investments, which would then permit the relaxation of austerity programs. We will show our citizens that their anger has been misplaced. But they must endure for a little while longer."

 VYT_start_of_the_recovery: "Start of the Recovery"
 VYT_start_of_the_recovery_desc: "The light can finally be seen. Although painful, the austerity measures we imposed managed to prevent total collapse, and the strategic investments made are finally beginning to have an effect. Economic activity has sharply increased, and new workshops and industries have begun to appear organically.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, however, expanding previously reduced programs as revenues rise and instituting reforms as needed. The road ahead to complete unification under the Tsar is and will be a long one, but we have done what we can to give ourselves, and our people, the best start possible."

 VYT_legacy_of_the_tsardom: "Legacy of the Empire"
 VYT_legacy_of_the_tsardom_desc: "Decades ago Russia, the Third Rome, was a great nation. And then the communists tore it down. They seduced her peasants with lies. They seized the great wealth of her learned classes. They murdered her rulers as if they were ordinary criminals. And then they failed, twice, at protecting her from rapacious invaders.\n\nAlthough the scars of their crimes remain, there is still hope. Tsar Vladimir, proud scion of the Romanovs, has returned. It is his divine right to rule Russia and its people, and when opportunity presents itself, he will crush the bandits, fascists, communists, and fanatics that have conspired to tear Russia apart.\n\nThe Third Rome will rise again."

 VYT_a_tangled_web: "A Tangled Web"
 VYT_a_tangled_web_desc: "The fall of the old empire was accelerated by poor administrative capability, which then allowed for both economic malaise and communist extremism to spread. Apart from the Tsar himself, we are seeing this in the Principality, with many of the 'temporary' government organs established years ago still in operation. We must learn from the past, and not allow it to be repeated.\n\nConsequently, we will act decisively to untangle this web, clearing out redundant offices, formalizing needed governmental services, and dispatching with wasteful excess. In such a way, we will strengthen our control over both our current, and future, territory."

 VYT_the_great_game: "The Great Game"
 VYT_the_great_game_desc: "Influence peddling is a component of any government, and the Tsar's administration is no exception. On a daily basis deals are made and broken, favours are traded, and information is exchanged amongst the many functionaries of our state.\n\nBut there is a limit, and the degree of these exchanges have, recently, threatened to divide the government to an unacceptable degree. The Tsar is not blind to this, and he knows that such efforts distract from any eventual efforts to reunify the nation. But he also knows that to act to reduce it could engender the opposite effect. Prudence is required.\n\nHe will therefore demonstrate his public displeasure with such actions, weakening the positions of those engaging in them without provoking conflict. But he will not forget, and when the state is more secure there will be a reckoning."

 VYT_fifty_shades_of_monarchism: "The Many Shades of Monarchism"
 VYT_fifty_shades_of_monarchism_desc: "Monarchism is not in itself an ideology, and as such it tends to attract a coalition of those of many different political persuasions. Our Principality is no different. While all agree that Tsar Vladimir is the rightful ruler of all of Russia, they disagree on how his rule should be expressed.\n\nAbsolutists believe he should be unrestricted while constitutionalists believe there should be checks on his authority. Fascists, socialists, and others also routinely present their own views. All of these forms of monarchy, and a great deal more, are regularly advocated for. But none can say which will, eventually, emerge to dominate the others."

 VYT_utilize_the_okhrana: "Utilize the Okhrana"
 VYT_utilize_the_okhrana_desc: "Despite the Tsar's righteous rule, there are those who would see him shackled, deposed, or worse. Every society has its dissidents, and they must be watched. The Okhrana - the Tsar's secret police - was created to monitor and curtail the actions of those who wished the destruction of Russia. Though they failed in their mission, the lessons learned through that failure have not been forgotten.\n\nTo combat these dissidents, the Okhrana will be recreated, and the issues that led to their previous failure will be corrected. Once again they will watch over and guard our Tsar, our state, and our way of life. In so doing ensure the stability of our Principality and, one day, our Empire."

 VYT_form_the_imperial_council: "Form the Imperial Council"
 VYT_form_the_imperial_council_desc: "Even a man as dedicated and righteous as Tsar Vladimir cannot rule alone. Loyal retainers are needed, both as territorial administrators and as advisors on matters of state. As such, an Imperial Council will be established, allowing for the collection and application of the finest minds of the Principality to critical matters.\n\nThose so identified will include eminent figures in arts and sciences, experienced government functionaries, skilled military officers, and more. Their learned counsel will inform the Tsar about anything to which he is not aware, and should he be incapacitated for whatever reason, they can be trusted to maintain a regency until such time as the Tsar's duties can be resumed."

 VYT_the_peoples_tsar: "The People's Tsar"
 VYT_the_peoples_tsar_desc: "Though the Tsar is a man blessed and chosen by God to lead Russia onwards, he is, just like his subjects, a Russian. He understands the needs of the common man, and knows well that, but for the chance of divinity, he would be amongst them in the fields, the factory, or the social club. No longer will he remain in his palace. He will travel far and wide, he will speak directly to petitioners, and he will demonstrate his love for the country and the people firsthand.\n\nBy doing so, he will inherently disprove the propaganda of our enemies, who claim him a distant, tyrannical, and uncaring despot. And he will bind our people together, leading them towards the future, and securing peace and prosperity for all Russians - great and small alike."

 VYT_imperial_detachment_desc: "The Tsar is a Russian, yes, but he is also more than that. He is a symbol. An ideal. A figure that can be aspired to, and worked towards, but never reached. He is a man who can be trusted to remain above petty rivalries, factionalism, and self-interest, and dispassionately look at an issue from all sides before making the best decision possible. This identity, this image, must be protected.\n\nThe Tsar will remain separate from the people, interacting with them through ministers, functionaries, and officers. In this way he will always be present in their minds, a reassuring presence, every time they see our flag or speak to a representative of the state. This will be how we safeguard Russia against the destruction that once consumed it, and it will be how we guarantee prosperity and peace to our children."

 VYT_a_cultured_court_desc: "For generations, Russia's Imperial court was known the world over for its splendor, its opulence, and the concentration of artists and intellectuals that surrounded it. If our goal is to revive Russia in body, we must begin by reviving Russia in spirit, and so re-establish its cultural and intellectual heart.\n\nWe will generate and distribute generous grants to artists, poets, musicians, and intellecutals. We will invite them to our court and grant them citizenship in our lands, and commission vast quantities of artwork, composition, poetry, and more. We will usher in a new generation of Russian culture and, in time, Russia will once again be known as a beacon of culture and the arts, with the Tsar as its greatest patron."

 VYT_the_tsars_speech_desc: "The Tsar's frequent radio addresses to the Principality are, naturally, a great source of comfort for its citizens, demonstrating to them that their monarch carries them in his thoughts at all times. Following yet another German bombing raid, he has decided to give another.\n\nUnusually, he has taken an active role in its drafting, carefully determining both the content and method of presentation, and word has spread that this address is unlikely to be like all the others. From all corners of our realm, the Tsar's subjects huddle around radios, improvised or otherwise.\n\nAnd await the words of their sovereign."

 VYT_the_bishop_of_vyatka_desc: "Historically, the role of the Orthodox Church in the Russian state was almost as central as that of the monarchy itself. Despite this, the relationship between the Tsar and the Church in recent years has been, if not antagonistic, fairly cold. Many within believe the Tsar insufficiently pious, and this is beginning to affect his perceived legitimacy. A solution must be found, and quickly.\n\nThe Diocese of Vyatka is currently vacant, and if a bishop were appointed it would, in addition to publicly confirming the Tsar's dedication to the Church and acting to reaffirm his bond to it, provide valuable moral guidance to our citizens, ever in danger of being led astray."

Many of them took their riches along, and many others still have found wealth and success in their new homes. But they have not forgotten their old one.\n\nThe Tsar still possesses contacts from his time spent living in the Pakt, and through them he would be able to establish contact with the most prominent of their number. Many of them desire to once again see the Imperial eagle fly above a united Russia, and would be willing to provide both financial and political support."

That our once-great nation is reduced to this is a tragedy beyond measure, but it is not yet beyond hope. Russia is no stranger to suffering, or to staring over, but it needs leadership, strong and noble, in order to do so. And we will provide it.\n\nJust as Peter the Great elevated Russia to its deserved position as a world power, so too will Tsar Vladimir. He will make it clear that order, strength, prosperity, and faith will be returned to our country, whatever the cost.\n\nWe will reclaim our birthright."

Here, hundreds of 'merchants' flagrantly flout the Principality's laws, depriving our state of taxation and legitimate trade. The time has come to respond. Decisively.\n\nWe will increase our military and police presence along the border, arresting known dealers, inspecting all passing cargoes, and raiding discovered hideouts. Seized goods will be either sold or incorporated into stockpiles as necessary. In addition, and once the smugglers are dispersed, we will then encourage and promote legitimate commerce in replacement, and thereby turn a weakness into a strength."

By 1917, it had progressed so far that not even the then-Tsar's personal intervention could save it, and its deficiencies were laid bare in its crushing defeat by the communist revolutionaries. But its earlier legacy still remains.\n\nWe will reinstate the practices that made the Imperial armies great, once upon a time, and put in place stringent regulations to ensure that the practices that led to failure are not repeated. We will continue the legacy of the Russian Army of old, and under that banner, our brave soldiers will march forward, and reclaim the Motherland for themselves, their state, and their Tsar."

We have carried the torch of the Russian Empire through the darkest of days, and emerged in the light, strong and ready to march forward once again.\n\nWe will prepare for the campaigns to come, for the efforts to spread the culture and splendor we have built here, Russian splendor and culture, to all Russians. We, led by the Tsar, are the stewards of this great nation, and we will return it to greatness!"

It is that bond of mutual faith that gives us strength, and ensures the stability of our lands. But these lands are not enough. Russia is a vast country, and much of it lies shattered and broken under the heels of extremists, fanatics, and criminals alike.\n\nThe Tsar can no longer bear to see his people suffering so. Until the Imperial eagle flies from the German border to the Far East his, and our, mission will not be complete. Our disciplined armies, supported by a devoted populace, stand ready to carry the Tsar's standard forward, and all they need is the order to march.\n\nS nami Bog!"

Beyond our borders, in the rightful lands of the Tsar, millions of Russians lie crushed under the boot of oppression and poverty, and they must be rescued. Our enemies move to do so themselves, and so we must strike first.\n\nThe time for talking is over. The Imperial Council will be called, and plans will be made to march forward.

Often quite literally.\n\nMore than one assassination of a senior officer has occurred at the hands of a colleague or subordinate, and cliques within the military have acted, in some cases, to protect those murderers. This is completely unacceptable.\n\nThe Council will mandate the Okhrana to establish a supervisory office within the military command structure, to identify both cliques and criminals within it, and to bring them to justice. The army will, must, be united, indivisible and loyal only to God and the Tsar!"

If the Tsar is to reclaim Russia, this cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nThe Council will issue directives in order to put an end to the worst expressions of disorder, and officers identified as reformers will be promoted.

However, there is a time and a place for everything, and it is not now, with war on the horizon, the time for democracy.\n\nThe Council will issue directives making it clear that, while political reform is and will be coming, it will not occur until after both the consolidation of the region and the centralization of the Tsar's government is accomplished."

While all acknowledge the value of the monarchy, all have different views on what form it should take, and these differences have, in some regrettable cases, led to violence. This is unacceptable.\n\nWe are all Russians, striving for the same goal, and the Council will therefore coordinate with the Tsar to bring the leaders of each faction to the palace in a fashion that will not provoke further conflict or suspicion of the motives of the others. The Tsar will make his plans and requirements clear, and in so doing, stabilize our political situation for the conquests ahead."

Opposing political factions are treating each other with civility if nothing else, and the military has shed much of the disorder and inefficiency it once displayed.\n\nBut we must not become complacent. The divisions are still there, beneath the surface, and we will have to deal with them in time. However, they are currently united behind our goals, both to consolidate control over the region, and to establish a basis for the true expansion of the Tsar's authority over all of Russia. That will have to do, at least for now."

 VYT_the_imperial_russian_army_desc: "Russia has a long and storied military tradition of struggle, success, and visionary leadership. Unfortunately, however, the military of the late Empire, as well as our own, cannot be said to live up to this legacy. Our soldiers are poorly trained, our equipment outdated, our doctrine inflexible, and our support elements nearly nonexistent.\n\nIf we are to extend our influence across the statelets surrounding us, let alone over all of Russia, this must be addressed. We will determine a consistent doctrine, improve our training regimens, and fortify critical sectors. In so doing, we will possess a solid basis on which to launch external campaigns."

His defensive actions during Napoleon's invasion are legendary, leading to the near-annihilation of an army initially considered far superior to his own. To ensure that our territory is secure from attack while our army is on campaign, we must prepare proper defenses.\n\nDefense Plan Kutuzov will therefore be assumed, and a series of fortifications, simple as they may be, will be constructed along our borders.

Unfortunately, too many of our own officers developed their 'skills' under that system, or progressed through no system at all, and thus threaten the efficacy of our own army. We will take action to correct this.\n\nBy working with both experienced senior and innovative junior officers, we will develop a training curriculum for our officer corps and make its completion mandatory across all officer ranks.

And yet, in certain situations when properly applied, the armies saw great success against their enemies. Failures were the result of implementation, not foundation.\n\nThere is no need for us to redesign our entire approach. Russian approaches to warfare, tried and true, are still effective.

The era of massed infantry charges has long passed, of course, but numerical superiority allows for many options, both strategic and tactical, that would not otherwise be possible.\n\nThe Russian Army of the future will therefore be as large as is reasonable, capable of conducting vast offensives over large fronts. In so doing, they will utterly overwhelm our enemies, and carry the Tsar's banner forward to victory!"

Our soldiers now march in disciplined ranks, are watched over by skilled, motivated, and innovative officers, and possess pride in both their nation and their Tsar.

To bring Russia back from the brink, the Empire must be restored, and we must strive to embed this truth within our borders first and foremost.\n\nState media, journalists, radio broadcasts, everything will be used to spread this message, for our enemies will surely seek to undermine this message.

With the Emperor's blessing, a specialized organization will be made to combat this problem, and restore the tracks to working order once again, even modernizing them should we have enough time."

 VYT_let_the_past_fade: "Let the Past Fade"
 VYT_let_the_past_fade_desc: "The monarchy has triumphed over its greatest enemy, perhaps for the last time. With the communists defeated, and their ideology in ruins, it is time to return to our original goal, and build a worthy Russian empire. Obsessing over the ideology which saw Russia destroyed would serve no one, and continued focus on it would only serve to divide our countrymen, and make them turn on one another in heated debate and argumentation. No, simply staying the course and defining them as another enemy we have dealt with will smother the embers of socialism far better than trying to douse the fire ourselves.\n\nThose who wish to become martyrs for a cause must exalt themselves through trial by fire. Those people are best undone through obscurity, and when they become but a memory, our final triumph over socialism will be complete."

 VYT_bind_them_through_memory: "Bind Them Through Memory"
 VYT_bind_them_through_memory_desc: "With the gears of war slowly coming to a halt, we once more turn to matters of internal policy. The myriad of factions and political elements surrounding the Emperor once more start to bicker, and we return to a state of being from before. It was foolish to hope the peace could last for long, but we may yet make it last just that much longer. We will stoke the embers of hatred, exaggerate the threat of the enemy within, bring about the shadow of Lenin, all so that we may bring the Emperor's closest together, for one final push against the communists. Who cares if they cannot fight back? Their ideology will serve our interests from beyond the grave, one final time.\n\nFor the tsars of old smile down upon us, while Lenin weeps."

 VYT_the_empire_strikes_back: "The Empire Strikes Back"
 VYT_the_empire_strikes_back_desc: "For the first time since 1917, a Romanov once again controls a significant portion of the Motherland. We have come far from our humble beginnings in Vyatka, and we will continue to strive for the total unification of the nation, which lies under the control of those whom we have yet to meet.\n\nFor now, Western Russia will be our new heartland, a shining phoenix rising from the ashes to bring about the rebirth of an empire, our empire - his Majesty, Emperor Vladimir III's empire. All we need now is to focus on what path this new Russia shall take, and for that, we need to turn our attention back inward.\n\nNonetheless, this was a true triumph for not just us - but for Russia as a whole."

 ### Regional political tree ###
 VYT_the_sovereignty: "The Sovereignty"
 VYT_the_sovereignty_desc: "Absolute rule may have been suitable during the early, desperate days in Vyatka, but it is no longer so. The Sovereignty is a true country, with all that requires, and one man cannot rule millions.\n\nThis presents us with the opportunity to create the first legitimate, and Imperial, Russian government since the end of the Russian Civil War. Though consolidation of our rule must still occur, a proper cabinet can be formed and a true government constructed. If all goes well, negotiations with the political factions within our government should proceed smoothly."

 VYT_the_congress_of_vologda: "The Congress of Vologda"
 VYT_the_congress_of_vologda_desc: "Before our conquest of it, Vologda, and the Neutral Zone that extended around it, acquired a reputation for peace and stability. We can use this to our advantage. The Congress promised so long ago must take place, and it can take place in Vologda.\n\nWith representatives from all major political factions invited, deliberations will proceed until a cabinet for the Tsar's first true government is formed. It is expected that there will likely be considerable discord between the factions, but regardless of what may occur, the Congress of Vologda will be historic - establishing the first monarchist government in Russia in forty years.\n\nWe will not let that opportunity escape us."

 VYT_the_bright_hour_knocks: "The Bright Hour Knocks"
 VYT_the_bright_hour_knocks_desc: "As many had expected under a monarchist regime, reactionary sentiment has prevailed in the Sovereignty. The staunchly conservative National Union of Solidarists, led by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, has emerged victorious following weeks of debate in Vologda, to the fears of many, more liberal, candidates.\n\nThe Solidarists have declared their support for civil liberties and democratic values, while also professing a desire for an increase in the role of Orthodox Christianity and cooperation between social classes.\n\nSolzhenitsyn, invested with the Tsar's full confidence, is now tasked with building confidence in and support for his policies. It remains to be seen, however, if such a strong shift towards traditionalist policies will be accepted by the Russian people at large."

 VYT_for_the_good_of_the_cause: "For the Good of the Cause"
 VYT_for_the_good_of_the_cause_desc: "In the minds of the Solidarists, long years of war and poverty have led to a sharp decline in traditional Russian morality. A decline which must be corrected if the nation is to prosper. Now invested with true political power, they can finally do so.\n\nReligion will be re-emphasized, the absurdity of class division will be combated, and traditional values central to the Russian spirit will be promoted. In due time, and despite the complaints of more liberal factions within the government, the Russian people will see the value in remembering, and returning, to their roots."

 VYT_a_temporary_dictatorship: "A Temporary Dictatorship"
 VYT_a_temporary_dictatorship_desc: "Russia remains in chaos, and the first step in correcting this is to ensure that there exists order and stability within the Tsar's government. Without a strong, benevolent leader, it is inevitable that democracy will be lost to demagoguery, populism, or worse, socialism. The Tsar can be that leader, but he needs the Solidarists' help.\n\nConsequently, Prime Minister Solzhenitsyn has submitted legislation to grant himself emergency powers during this period of instability. His opponents call him a dictator, but they simply do not understand the enormous problems Russia currently faces."

 VYT_the_old_ways_triumphant: "The Old Ways Triumphant"
 VYT_the_old_ways_triumphant_desc: "Striking a middle path between reformist and reactionary sentiment, the Congress of Vologda has chosen the conservative All-Russian National Union, led by Vasily Shulgin, to form government.\n\nInvested with power long-desired, they will act to preserve and empower monarchist institutions, and keep the Tsar and his desires at the centre of government policy, while pursuing a program of nationalist re-unification besides.\n\nIt is expected that Shulgin and the Tsar will work closely together in positive fashion, acting to suppress or block the influence and proposals of the Kadets and Solidarists alike."

 VYT_ensure_stability: "Ensure Stability"
 VYT_ensure_stability_desc: "Although Imperial rule has, at long last, returned to Russia, many are still hesitant to embrace it. They see only the failures of the Bolshevik revolution, and not the successes of the centuries prior. They must be reminded.\n\nAlthough it will take both time and several token reforms, the people will soon see that conservative monarchism in the old tradition can and will provide the stability that Russia has not seen for a very long time.\n\nAfter all, Romanov rule endured for centuries. It can endure for centuries more."

 VYT_the_status_quo_secured: "The Status Quo Secured"
 VYT_the_status_quo_secured_desc: "In securing political power for the centre, away from the quasi-socialist Kadets and the quasi-fascist Solidarists, the Union has preserved the stability of the state. And it will continue to do so.\n\nThe radical proposals on either side can only lead to ruin, and so the Union will look in a different direction: the past. Tried and true methods will be relied upon as opposed to dangerous reforms. The Tsar and his court will be preserved and advised. In these dangerous times, to do otherwise would be foolish."

 VYT_victory_for_the_kadets: "Victory for the Kadets!"
 VYT_victory_for_the_kadets_desc: "To the surprise of many, especially in a monarchist state, liberalism has triumphed at the Congress of Vologda. The Constitutional-Democrats, better known as the Kadets and led by Roman Gul, have secured the majority of delegates, and will soon form government.\n\nThe Kadets have declared their intentions to institute reforms they have long championed, and intend to focus overwhelmingly on promoting social mobility and personal freedoms.\n\nAlthough the relationship between Gul and the Tsar is likely to be an uneasy one, the Tsar has accepted and supported the electoral results. It is not yet certain, however, whether the nation at large is prepared for such a drastic shift in governmental priorities, and Gul will have to work hard to prove their worth."

 VYT_begin_the_reforms: "Begin the Reforms"
 VYT_begin_the_reforms_desc: "After years in the political wilderness, the Kadets have, against all odds, secured a governmental mandate. Invested with that mandate, they can now act to implement reforms considered long overdue.\n\nAlongside many other reforms, democratic principles will be enshrined and expanded, and market regulations will be loosened. Although this will draw the ire of reactionary and conservative elements alike, they will see, in time, the value of empowering the ordinary Russian with dignity and freedom.\n\nFor if the man is empowered, so too is the nation."

 VYT_an_empire_of_equals: "An Empire of Equals"
 VYT_an_empire_of_equals_desc: "With reforms well underway, the Kadets have turned their attention to a population often ignored and oppressed by government and citizen alike in equal measure: ethnic minorites.\n\nIn keeping with their principles of equality, legislation has been introduced that will extend official recognition of and protection to the varied minority groups within the state.\n\nAll the peoples of the Empire are, in truth, Russians. An attack on the rights of one is an attack on the rights of all, and this will no longer be permitted."

 VYT_the_imperial_constitution: "The Imperial Constitution"
 VYT_the_imperial_constitution_desc: "With the close of the historic Congress of Vologda, the selection of a cabinet, and the appointment of a prime minister and governing party, the time has come for the final step - drafting the constitution.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly, as this Imperial Constitution, the founding document of Russian monarchism, will define politics in the state for years to come. The eyes of all are on the delegations as the debates begin."

 VYT_securing_the_realm: "Securing the Realm"
 VYT_securing_the_realm_desc: "To ensure stability in the Sovereignty, it is critical that we focus on addressing domestic issues, the first of which is the proper administration of our territory. There is simply too much to effectively control, and both bandits and remnants of past enemies abound within it. We must take action.\n\nTo this end, we will focus the political, economic, and military strength on the security of our realm. By combining the efforts of the Imperial Army, the Okhrana, and the legions of administrators now entering government, we will ensure stability in our realm against the partisans and dissidents that threaten it!"

 VYT_carte_blanche_for_smyslovsky: "Carte Blanche for Smyslovsky"
 VYT_carte_blanche_for_smyslovsky_desc: "The Chief of the Okhrana, Boris Smyslovsky, has proven a loyal and dedicated servant of the Tsar. Under his watch, dissidents, partisans, saboteurs, and spies alike have been found and excised from our nation. And he can be even more effective with additional support.\n\nBy increasing both the funding and operational latitude of the Okhrana, Smyslovsky will be able to more efficiently take care of problems before they become such. It is possible that his zealousness may cause some damage to the Tsar's image among the people, but we think the stability it will bring is well worth the cost."

 VYT_reign_in_the_okhrana: "Rein in the Okhrana"
 VYT_reign_in_the_okhrana_desc: "Although the Okhrana, ably led by Boris Smyslovsky, has undoubtedly been effective in recent years, they have also caused us problems. In times of war and crisis, their services are vital, and overzealous 'mistakes' can be overlooked. But in times of peace, this is no longer the case.\n\nThe excesses of the Okhrana can damage the public's support of the government, and so it will be made clear to Smyslovsky that he will no longer be permitted to operate without supervision. Efficiency will be hampered somewhat, but it is a small price to pay to ensure that anger is not redirected towards the government nor the Tsar."

 VYT_the_partisan_problem: "The Partisan Problem"
 VYT_the_partisan_problem_desc: "While we defeated our enemies, we didn't kill every last one of their supporters. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a number of partisan holdouts that stretch from Arkhangelsk in the North to Samara in the south - a patchwork of fortresses, bandits, and leftover, disenfranchised soldiers all believing in a myriad of ideologies and owing loyalty to one man or the other; communist, fascist, and even radical democrats are present in these holdouts.\n\nEven if they weren't raiding our caravans, attacking villages who have professed their loyalty to us, or slaughtering soldiers when they get a chance, they would be presenting an issue. But right now, they're rampant. We have to deal with this problem as soon as possible, to ensure that the Tsar's rule is secured."

 VYT_root_them_out: "Root Them Out"
 VYT_root_them_out_desc: "The partisans are proving to be more difficult to defeat than was previously anticipated. There are too many of them, and they are too well-concealed in the vast forests that dot the Sovereignty. We must take more drastic action.\n\nWe will employ every tool at our disposal. The Okhrana, collaborators, overwhelming military strength, whatever is required. It will be expensive, and more blood will be shed than is likely needed, but this problem must end. It is making the state look weak, and surrounded by potential enemies as we are, such a perception cannot be afforded."

 VYT_offers_of_amnesty: "Offers of Amnesty"
 VYT_offers_of_amnesty_desc: "The partisans are proving to be more difficult to defeat than was previously anticipated. There are too many of them, and they are too well-concealed in the vast forests that dot the Sovereignty. We must take more drastic action.\n\nYet, to simply use more force would be counterproductive. Instead, let us offer amnesty to any willing to come forward. The hardliners will refuse, of course, but any wavering compatriots will not, and as more amnesties are granted, the bands will become both less able to conduct major operations and more susceptible to defeat by local forces, leading to victory over the long term."

 VYT_the_emperors_peace: "The Emperor's Peace"
 VYT_the_emperors_peace_desc: "Though hard work and focused effort we have managed to pacify many of the partisan bands that have plagued our nation. Though bandits and criminals will always exist, an end to large scale disorder means a consequent rise in both popular confidence regarding and political support of the government.\n\nWe can now turn our attention to one of the other many matters requiring attention, confident that, at least internally, our security situation has been rectified."

 VYT_an_empire_reborn: "An Empire Reborn" 
 VYT_an_empire_reborn_desc: "With the Congress of Vologda completed and the partisan situation addressed, the Sovereignty has, at long last and with the shedding of much blood, secured both internal physical and political stability.\n\nWestern Russia has had little of either for decades, and with their existence now being understood, popular and political support for the government is increasing across all sectors and social groupings. There still remain many problems, of course, but to many they are of less than the fundamental physical security of themselves and their families, and the Tsar can take heart that he has finally provided such to millions of Russians long deprived of it."

 VYT_the_imperial_recovery_committee: "The Imperial Recovery Committee"
 VYT_the_imperial_recovery_committee_desc: "With the establishment of the Sovereignty, we can no longer rely on a vodka distillery to provide a significant portion of the state's budget. We must instead develop and execute an integrated economic plan on a national scale.\n\nTo do this, the Tsar has announced the formation of the Imperial Economic Council, which will assemble experts from both the nation and émigré communities and task them with overseeing such development and implementation. Through intelligent and consistent planning, the economy and industrial base will both grow, improving the lives of ordinary Russians while also preparing us for the eventual campaign of national unification."

 VYT_economic_recovery: "Economic Recovery"
 VYT_economic_recovery_desc: "The initial policies of the Imperial Recovery Committee have already shown effect. Although the decreases in poverty and hunger, and corollary increases in industrial output and wage growth are minimal, they are nonetheless observable.\n\nBut we cannot stop here. There is much work to be done, and the Committee's work has only just begun. Still, it has already an impact for the better on the lives of many of our citizens, and that must be applauded."

 VYT_invite_foreign_capital: "Invite Foreign Capital"
 VYT_invite_foreign_capital_desc: "In addition to its many other problems, one issue facing the Sovereignty is a near-total dearth of foreign capital investment. Securing such investment would allow for the pace of economic development to be rapidly accelerated, and as such the Imperial Recovery Committee has asked both the Tsar and the Foreign Ministry to reach out to foreign powers, both near and far, and offer significant incentives in order to promote investment.\n\nWhile doing so would certainly have significant economic benefit, numerous side benefits, including increased foreign recognition and a more rapid decrease in unemployment, have also been identified."

 VYT_the_witte_currency_reform: "The Witte Currency Reform"
 VYT_the_witte_currency_reform_desc: "The eponymous Witte Currency Reform, named for the member of the Imperial Recovery Committee who designed it, council minister and member of the Imperial Recovery Committee who suggested it, focuses on both the introduction of a single centralized currency and the mandate of it as the only form of legal tender within the Sovereignty.\n\nThis will act to combat the continued use of regional currencies, inequalities in purchasing power stability, and black market transactions and exchanges besides. The result has been promised to be, after an initial period of disorder as the system is converted, an overall increase in coordinated economic activity."

 VYT_reorganize_the_ministry_of_finance: "Reorganize the Ministry of Finance"
 VYT_reorganize_the_ministry_of_finance_desc: "The Ministry of Finance was originally established to manage the economy of the lands in and around Vyatka during the days of the German bombing campaigns. Those days are long past, but the Ministry is still organized as it was at that time, in a fashion wholly unsuited to the administration of an economy on a truly national scale.\n\nAt the request of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the Ministry will be restructured, instituting proper local, regional, and national hierarchies to better address the economic concerns of different national areas. It will also assess the skills of its employees, and hire new ones, in order to ensure efficient and continued operations across the entirety of our territory."

 VYT_the_principles_of_solidarism: "The Principles of Solidarism"
 VYT_the_principles_of_solidarism_desc: "The victory of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Solidarists at the Congress of Vologda has, as in all other aspects of our government, had an effect on the Imperial Recovery Committee. Firmly committed to corporatist ideals, the Solidarists have required their implementation as part of any economic recovery plan.\n\nWith a focus on the organization of the economy around identified interest groups and production sectors, it is expected that the overall efficiency of our industrial base will increase."

 VYT_continue_the_austerity_programs: "Continue the Austerity Programs"
 VYT_continue_the_austerity_programs_desc: "With the victory of Vasily Shulgin's All-Russian National Union at the Congress of Vologda, new directives have been issued to the Imperial Recovery Committee. Programs of austerity introduced long ago are to be extended until such time as the government deems otherwise.\n\nThough this is an unpopular move, the All-Russian National Union is adamant that until the military situation can be considered resolved, no deviation from the focus on military production in favor of social or economic programs can be entertained."

 VYT_economic_liberalisation: "Economic Liberalization"
 VYT_economic_liberalisation_desc: "The victory of the Kadets under Roman Gul at the Congress of Vologda has paved the way for the integration of economic liberalization into the policies of the Imperial Recovery Committee.\n\nWith a focus on encouraging free market principles, ending austerity measures, and normalizing the markets, the Kadets are hopeful that the Sovereignty's economy can be induced to rapidly expand, and reap subsequent reward."

 VYT_the_miracle_on_the_vyatka: "The Miracle on the Vyatka"
 VYT_the_miracle_on_the_vyatka_desc: "The efforts of the Imperial Recovery Committee have, despite some political opposition, had a real and significant impact on the overall economic health of the Sovereignty. Domestic product has risen sharply, the sophistication of our industry has increased, and foreign capital is finally once again entering Russia.\n\nThese advances, combined with a dramatic increase in administrative efficiency as resulting from further reforms, has provided the nation with a robust and future-oriented industrial base by which to effect eventual unification.\n\nThe Tsar has put in motion plans for each and every member of the Committee to receive a national award, presented by himself. If a soldier can receive a medal for helping one fellow Russian, so too can the Committee for helping millions!"

 VYT_academic_recovery: "Academic Recovery"
 VYT_academic_recovery_desc: "For a very long time, available education in Russia has been minimal, when it has been available at all. As our economy continues recovery, this deficiency can, and must, now be addressed. Without educated citizens, we cannot continue to develop our economy beyond subsistence levels, and so we will invest in it.\n\nAt the insistence of the Imperial Recovery Committee, a comprehensive plan for the development of a national educational infrastructure, from primary to tertiary, will be created, and resources allocated to implement it. In this way, we can prepare for the future, and leave as part of our legacy a generation of intelligent, innovative, and forward-thinking Russians."

 VYT_reopen_the_universities: "Reopen the Universities"
 VYT_reopen_the_universities_desc: "With significant funding now available for education, we must act to reopen the many institutes of higher learning long closed in Western Russia. These institutes, unused and unneeded during the many years of division and conflict in the region, are essential if we wish to ensure that the Sovereignty possesses the means by which to generate the next generation of administrators, industrialists, researchers, and more besides.\n\nAn inventory of campuses will be completed, and reconstruction priorities will be subsequently assigned. Once in operation, we are likely to notice both an increase in our ability to develop innovative solutions of or improvements to problems."

 VYT_the_kazan_science_academy_idea: "The Kazan Science Academy"
 VYT_the_kazan_science_academy_idea_desc: "The Russian Academy of Sciences was, for many years, the preeminent educational institution in the Empire, producing many great inventors, engineers, thinkers, and cultural icons. That Academy is now far behind German lines, and utterly inaccessible. To complete our plan of academic revitalization we will replace this now-lost institution with a new one.\n\nThe Tsar has decreed the construction of a new Academy of Sciences, this time in Kazan. With time, patience, funding, as well as some luck, it will become a beacon of advancement, and prove to the world that Russia is no longer a backwards-thinking nation."

 VYT_industrial_recovery: "Industrial Recovery"
 VYT_industrial_recovery_desc: "Industry in Western Russia has not yet even fully recovered from the German bombing campaigns, let alone from the devastation inflicted during regional unification. The Imperial Recovery Committee has therefore identified the fundamental reconstruction of the extant industrial base as a primary objective, in order to permit its contribution to further projects.\n\nFunding has been dedicated in order to ensure that reconstruction is completed as quickly as possible. This is but the first step towards rapid expansion, but it must be taken nonetheless."

 VYT_connecting_our_realm: "Connecting Our Realm"
 VYT_connecting_our_realm_desc: "The widespread destruction of national infrastructure is another legacy of the chaos that once engulfed Western Russia, and this severely limits the civilian economy, both in absolute size as well as in expansion and development potential. Thus a focus will be placed on the construction of new railroads and highways between our major economic centers and ports.\n\nThis will promote the movement of people and goods as rapidly as possible and in as large a grouping as possible, and so encourage further economic expansion within the Sovereignty."

 VYT_rebuilding_the_civilian_sector: "Rebuilding the Civilian Sector"
 VYT_rebuilding_the_civilian_sector_desc: "Owing to our previous efforts towards both reconstructing extant industry and constructing new infrastructure corridors, we can now take efforts to expand the civilian economy. Through strategic spending as well as the provision of attractive subsidies, we can encourage the construction of factories focused on the production of domestic goods.\n\nThe value of even the most basic amenities in ensuring societal stability and public support of the government should not be underestimated, and by encouraging their creation we not only obtain that support, but increase employment and domestic product besides."

 VYT_invest_in_russian_business: "Invest in Russian Business"
 VYT_invest_in_russian_business_desc: "Russian business has, for a long time, barely existed. Owners lost their factories either to communist expropriation or German bombers. But times have changed. In even the relatively short time since unification, we have observed the organic development of small-scale industry among some of our more enterprising citizens. This presents an opportunity.\n\nBy investing in these businesses, and subsidizing the formation of new ones, we can accelerate the generation of domestic industry by citizens, rather than by direct government intervention. The Imperial Recovery Committee has been very clear that such is the pathway towards true economic growth, and neither we nor the Tsar have any reason to disagree."

 VYT_reevaluate_the_armed_forces: "Reevaluate the Armed Forces"
 VYT_reevaluate_the_armed_forces_desc: "The performance of the Imperial Army in securing the territory now comprising the Sovereignty was laudable, and should be recognized as such. But this should not mean we can overlook the potential for improvement. In pursuit of national unification, it will be a long, hard trek to the Pacific, and we must be ready.\n\nWe will therefore begin a thorough examination of our campaigns and once again make unified decisions on our overall strategy for the development and expansion of the Imperial military, as we did once before. That examination enabled us to achieve victory, and this one cannot but do the same."

 VYT_learning_from_the_western_reclamation: "Learning from the Western Reclamation"
 VYT_learning_from_the_western_reclamation_desc: "The triumph of the Western Reclamation, the establishment of the authority of the Tsar over our region, was a great victory, given to us by the Imperial forces. In order to ensure that upcoming campaigns of national unification are similarly successful, we will examine the western campaigns in great detail once again.\n\nIn so doing, we will learn where our officers, men, equipment, and doctrine excelled and, also, where they were found wanting. Though it will be difficult to admit our failures and identify avenues towards improvement, we must do so, both for the future of the Sovereignty and for the fortunes of the Tsar."

 VYT_sticking_to_our_guns: "Sticking to Our Guns"
 VYT_sticking_to_our_guns_desc: "Some time ago we considered orienting our military towards ensuring numerical superiority, leveraging Russia's traditional population advantage over our enemies. In the time since, we have acquired millions of new citizens, potentially making this approach even stronger.\n\nAs a result, and despite the objections of some of our more innovative officers, we will decisively choose to orient the Imperial Army towards massed formations. While this is likely to cause some administrative strain on divisional staffs, it will ensure that our formations are quickly reinforced, something that will no doubt be useful on the long future journey eastwards."

 VYT_new_schools_of_thought: "New Schools of Thought"
 VYT_new_schools_of_thought_desc: "Some time ago we considered orienting our military towards lessons learned from studying the approaches of other nations such as America, Britain, Germany, and Japan. In the time since, we have acquired vast new territories and the industrial bases within them, which are critical to the production of the equipment needed for modern warfare.\n\nAs a result, and despite the objections of some of our more traditionalist officers, we will decisively choose to orient the Imperial Army towards specialist training and recruitment. While this is likely to cause a reduction in recruitment efforts owing to the stringent requirements of such programs, it will ensure that those same specialist formations are capable of performance beyond that which might otherwise be expected."

 VYT_celebrate_the_heroes: "Celebrate the Heroes"
 VYT_celebrate_the_heroes_desc: "The Imperial Army is nothing without its valiant soldiers. Men who could, and did, give their lives for God, country, and Tsar in the campaigns of regional consolidation. We must make the stories of these heroes known.\n\nIn so doing, not only will our current and future soldiers be motivated by the stories of those who came before them, but efforts to promote our campaigns will simplify. The general populace cannot but support the aims of our military, once made aware of the many stories of noble action and sacrifice contained within."

 VYT_the_imperial_navy: "The Imperial Russian Navy"
 VYT_the_imperial_navy_desc: "It has been nearly forty years since a vessel bearing the flag of an Imperial Russia has sailed the seas. With the capture of major ports during our regional consolidation, this should be rectified. An investment will therefore be made in the development of naval technology, and the administrative infrastructure needed for a navy will be created.\n\nWe may not be able to match the size of the major navies for many years to come, but we can promote and protect trade, secure our territorial waters, and carry our flag around the world, making the return of the Tsar known to all."

 VYT_the_imperial_air_service: "The Imperial Russian Air Service"
 VYT_the_imperial_air_service_desc: "The particulars of Western Russia made it, for many years, extremely difficult to maintain an air service of any kind. German interdiction, maintenance and training, and material production and repair were all often, at least partially, beyond our resources. That situation has now changed. Considerably.\n\nWith the Sovereignty now unified and, at least relatively secure, the time has come to invest in the creation of a formal Air Service though direct state investment in aeronautical technologies. Though any such service will begin small and likely remain so for some time to come, our soldiers and civilians alike can take heart in the knowledge that their brave compatriots fly high above, protecting them from harm - and inflicting the same on the enemy."

 VYT_modern_training_methods: "Modern Training Methods"
 VYT_modern_training_methods_desc: "Discipline is key in any military. Without it soldiers cannot be relied upon, officers may disobey orders, and larger tactical and strategic plans are doomed to failure. In the past, we have noticed several displays of ill-discipline within the Imperial forces, and while that might have once been acceptable, it is no longer.\n\nAccordingly, we will reorient our military training programs to place greater emphasis on discipline and unit cohesion. By doing so, we will ensure that, when the campaigns eastward begin, the integrity of our formations will remain, even over the vast distances that will be encountered."

 VYT_expand_the_special_forces: "Expand the Special Forces"
 VYT_expand_the_special_forces_desc: "The creation and deployment of specialized formations, such as the fabled 'Bridgeburners,' during our regional conquest proved highly effective in achieving victory. It has therefore been proposed that we expand these formations. This proposal will be accepted.\n\nThrough direct investment, we will optimize the structure, doctrine, and materiel requirements of these formations, and thereby promote the creation of more of them within the military command structure. When the great campaigns of national unification begin, they will facilitate our advance towards victory through the acts of great skill and daring for which they have become known."

 VYT_invest_in_izhmekh_desc: "The Izhevsk Mechanical Plant has, for many years, been a key factor in the proper equipping, and thus victory, of the Imperial military. With the resources of the Sovereignty now at our disposal, the plant can be both invested in and expanded upon, in order to compound the advantages it offers us.\n\nWith the expansion of the industrial facilities at and around the complex, we will greatly expand the state's ability to produce the vast amounts of equipment needed for modern warfare and our eventual drive to the east. All that is needed is the Tsar's word."

 VYT_a_new_generation_of_officers: "A New Generation of Officers"
 VYT_a_new_generation_of_officers_desc: "As the upper command structure of our military ages, it is critical that we ensure there is a new generation of innovative, loyal, and skilled officers to replace them. The creation, years ago, of the Vyatka General Staff Academy, has helped tremendously in this effort, but as our nation has grown, so too have the requirements for leadership. Investments must be made.\n\nThe operating budget of the Academy will therefore be greatly increased, allowing it to not only graduate more officers for command, but also provide them with superior training in the many fields to which an officer must be made aware. When we begin our drive to carry the Tsar's flag to the Pacific, we can be confident that the best officers in Russia will lead the charge."

 VYT_updating_our_designs: "Updating Our Designs"
 VYT_updating_our_designs_desc: "The near-total destruction of Western Russia's industrial and academic base resulted in, among other things, a consequent lack of innovation in military designs. Many patterns were copied from foreign sources, or were crude makeshift solutions produced in a decentralized manner. Our current position, however, allows us to rectify that.\n\nInvestments will be made in the design of various types of materiel, and coordination councils with military manufacturers will be formed in order to promote the physical production of them. In this way, we will ensure that Russian designs are built by Russian factories for an Russian army experiencing Russian conditions. Truly, we could not ask for more."

 VYT_the_imperial_army_marches_on: "The Imperial Army Marches Forwards"
 VYT_the_imperial_army_marches_on_desc: "As the result of our doctrinal, equipment, and leadership reforms and investments we have, once again, achieved a remarkable modernization and professionalization of the Imperial military. Operational plans are drawn and executed faster, administrative staff control of formations has improved, and the disposition of our forces has been considerably strengthened.\n\nThe military stands prepared and ready to begin the inevitable campaigns of national reunification, and though none can say what, or who, it will face, all can say that they are confident in its ability to achieve victory in the name of the Tsar."

 VYT_reestablishing_contacts: "Reestablishing Contacts"
 VYT_reestablishing_contacts_desc: "With the establishment and political stability of the Sovereignty established, it is now time to do something that no Russian state has done in a long time, and begin a coordinated, and global, diplomatic campaign. We have many resources to offer the world, and need just as many advancements and investments in return.\n\nSerious investment will be required, in both the establishment of reliable diplomatic infrastructure as well as the standardization of treaties of recognition, trade, and extrnational representation. They will be made. Russia will no longer stand alone on the world stage."

 VYT_the_imperial_diplomatic_corps: "The Imperial Diplomatic Corps"
 VYT_the_imperial_diplomatic_corps_desc: "In order to achieve our diplomatic goals and open our nation to the world, the Sovereignty must have a capable and professional diplomatic corps. Sufficient investment will therefore be made to ensure that we do.\n\nThe Imperial Diplomatic Corps will be prioritized in order to ensure that it attracts the best and brightest and, sent around the world, they will secure advantage for the state. Agreements of diplomatic recognition, trade, mutual protection and, perhaps eventually, global alliance can and will be pursued. In so doing, Russia will prove once again that it is at least a regional power and should be negotiated with as such."

 VYT_trade_with_the_ofn: "Trade with the OFN"
 VYT_trade_with_the_ofn_desc: "The OFN is the natural global counterbalance to the 'alliances' of Germany and Japan, both of which, even if their crimes against the Russian people were overlooked, will count among our greatest rivals once national unification is achieved. As such, alignment with the block will be useful not only currently, but also in the future.\n\nWe can begin doing so through the establishment of unofficial trade agreements, with cargoes funneled through the port of Arkhangelsk. As we grow more comfortable and trusting of each other, we will lay the groundwork for future collaboration. Who knows what the future may hold?"

 VYT_an_embassy_in_washington: "An Embassy in Washington"
 VYT_an_embassy_in_washington_desc: "As part of our efforts to ingratiate ourselves with the OFN, and thus the Americans, we will act to achieve formal diplomatic recognition by the United States as the legitimate Russian government. Once so achieved, we will petition them for the right, as with any other legitimate government, to establish an embassy in Washington.\n\nIt will not be an easy goal to achieve, but we will focus the entirety of the Diplomatic Corps' resources on it. Achieving recognition from the Americans would tremendously strengthen our claim to Russian lands on the international stage, permit greater economic and trade opportunities to be explored, and could not but allow for more cooperation with them in the years ahead."

 VYT_european_overtures: "European Overtures"
 VYT_european_overtures_desc: "Europe has long been a continent of monarchy, even if the Reich that now occupies so much of it despises even the concept of the institution. Some monarchies remain however and, owing to his possession of the grand Romanov bloodline, our Tsar is connected to many of them through old marriages, alliances, and partnerships.\n\nThese relations have lied dormant for many years, but it is now time to revive them for the modern age. We will, using the increasingly-experienced persons of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps, open relations with these countries, establish mutually beneficial initiatives, and cement our status as a regional power. Dreams of further expansion notwithstanding, of course."

 VYT_swedish_royal_ties: "Swedish Royal Ties"
 VYT_swedish_royal_ties_desc: "The Kingdom of Sweden, one of the few European nations to escape the grip of German tyranny, is an ideal candidate for one of our first diplomatic overtures. King Gustaf VI Adolf, though himself a constitutional monarch, is reportedly a measured character, and the country's lack of alignment with any one geopolitical faction ensures that we will not make enemies by extending relations.\n\nThe decision has therefore been made for the Tsar himself to visit the country, departing by ship from Arkhangelsk. His visit will not only facilitate the drafting of formal recognitions and trade agreements with the Swedes, but will also act to further strengthen our legitimacy on the world stage."

 VYT_roman_holiday: "Roman Holiday"
 VYT_roman_holiday_desc: "Italy, though once among the nations that invaded our land, is and remains the most powerful monarchy in Europe. In many ways, it exemplifies the Tsar's own goals - a strong and prosperous land, with large swaths of territory in which to secure resources, and with a loving people democratically participating in government under a respected King. We will therefore reach out to them.\n\nMembers of the Diplomatic Corps will travel to Rome and attempt, with all effort, to secure formal relations with them. If they are successful, a corresponding increase in our national legitimacy, along with future beneficial trade prospects, can be realized."

 VYT_a_trip_to_madrid: "A Trip to Madrid"
 VYT_a_trip_to_madrid_desc: "It has been decided to next focus the efforts of the Diplomatic Corps on Iberia, through the dispatch of a mission to Madrid. As a major regional power in Europe, but also with itself untied to the German power bloc, it is an ideal candidate for the establishment of favorable relations with our nation.\n\nAs one of the members of the Corps who both speaks Spanish and possesses experience in Iberia, our diplomatic mission will be led by one Boris Skosyrev. Though some have raised the concern that his troubling past in Andorra could complicate matters, Skosyrev has dismissed them. Time will tell if he is the correct choice."

 VYT_our_place_in_the_world: "Our Place in the World"
 VYT_our_place_in_the_world_desc: "The frenzied efforts of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps over recent months have proved, in general, to be highly successful. Despite some failures encountered, by and large the state has seen the development of successful trade relations with both major and minor countries, the expansion of formal recognition, and more besides.\n\nAs we continue to expand our temporal authority, over both our own lands and those to the east, there will no doubt be more diplomatic challenges encountered. But just as they have so far, the Diplomatic Corps will overcome them, in the name of the state and the Tsar."

 VYT_the_solidarist_revolution_desc: "Our victory in the Congress of Vologda, and the installation of our leader Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as the state's first Prime Minister, has allowed, at long last, for our beliefs to become state policy.\n\nSoon, we will reveal our program to the people of Russia, and prepare a publicity campaign that will ensure its support. We will appoint both our own as well as sympathetic officials in positions of influence, so as to ensure that other factions within the state do not attempt obstruction.\n\nTruly, the dawn of a great is has arrived."

 VYT_zemskaya_democracy: "Zemskaya Democracy"
 VYT_zemskaya_democracy_desc: "The "zemstva," a system of provincial assemblies created under the old Empire, were judged by many as inefficient and irrelevant. They did, however, solve many local problems, and so they can still be effective - as long as reforms are introduced.\n\nWe will therefore restore the zemstva across the Empire, and permit the free election of anyone not holding anti-monarchist sympathies to them. Furthermore, the system will be expanded to the national level, allowing for the creation of a national legislature, governed by the constitution and presided over by the Tsar."

 VYT_lessons_from_stolypin: "Lessons from Stolypin"
 VYT_lessons_from_stolypin_desc: "Pyotr Stolypin, a prime minister under the old Empire, remains notable for the reforms he introduced into the Duma, the then-legislature. By modifying electoral laws, and thereby reducing the voting power of certain classes, the Duma was rendered loyal to the government's, and thus the Tsar's, agenda. We can emulate this.\n\nBy modifying small portions of our own electoral laws, we can ensure that the Solidarist agenda maintains legislative support, while also maintaining democracy as an overall institution. It will simply now just be a more 'correct' democracy."

 VYT_the_political_integration_of_the_military: "Political-Military Integration"
 VYT_the_political_integration_of_the_military_desc: "To protect the overall stability and integrity of the state, it is crucial to ensure that it is supported by the military. Many of our military's most senior ranks are occupied by those we would not consider supporters of the Solidarist movement, and this must be rectified.\n\nWe will therefore act to promote the retirement of many of these senior officers while simultaneously supporting the positions of known Solidarist members or sympathizers to replace them. In doing so, the political reliability of the military towards our movement and our government will be ensured, preventing the other factions from attempting to destabilize the state."

 VYT_the_principles_of_dirigisme: "The Principles of Dirigisme"
 VYT_the_principles_of_dirigisme_desc: "Although communist policies are, to a one, completely unworkable in any reasonable modern economy, this does not mean that state participation in economic affairs should be entirely absent. Regulation and strong direction of developmental factors are critical in order to maintain stability, and we will act to maintain these.\n\nBy drafting and implementing these policies of 'dirigisme' we will ensure that while our economy is free of crushing interference and able to respond to market factors, it is also proceeding in a direction that supports the interests of the state and of our government."

 VYT_the_guiding_strata: "The Guiding Strata"
 VYT_the_guiding_strata_desc: "In these difficult times, Russia requires strong and capable leadership capable of swift decision-making. By applying the strict principles of class coordination that the Solidarist movement was founded upon, we can provide this leadership.\n\nBy creating a rigid, yet carefully defined hierarchy throughout the executive, the governmental bureaucracy, and the military, we can ensure that the state is capable of reacting properly in any situation encountered. Though this will naturally reduce the direct political participation of some sectors, when the people at large see the wisdom of this policy, they cannot but understand and accept it."

 VYT_the_spiritual_restoration: "The Spiritual Restoration"
 VYT_the_spiritual_restoration_desc: "Although reuniting Russia under strong and centralized Imperial authority was difficult, we won that war. We must now, however, win the peace, and our government has realized that many people within the state either actively disapprove of or are apathetic to our rule. This must, and will, change.\n\nWe will accomplish this change by reminding the Russian people of their traditional moral and social values. Community, family, loyalty, and hard work - all tenets of Solidarism - are virtues that once defined the Russian people and bound them together as a whole. With the right campaigns, they may yet do so again."

 VYT_the_russian_question: "The Russian Question"
 VYT_the_russian_question_desc: "Great Russia once referred to the heartlands of the old Empire, running from St. Petersburg to Ukraine and providing a great deal of the then-state's industrial and agricultural output. This land is currently occupied and systematically oppressed by the Reich. Though we do not yet have the means to reclaim them, that does not mean we must remain idle.\n\nBy communicating to our people the plight of their brothers and sisters across the border, we will stoke their sense of proper Solidarist nationalism, and thereby build support for the wars yet to come."

 VYT_the_moral_purification: "The Moral Purification"
 VYT_the_moral_purification_desc: "Decades of communist rule, under the Soviets or otherwise, has left a cancer, that of revolutionary ideals, within the hearts and minds of the Russian people. We must act to excise it, and thereby destroy the poisonous thinking that once destroyed this country.\n\nBy approaching the many prominent former communists and revolutionaries in our prisons, and offering them amnesty in exchange for public repudiation, we will show both the mercy of our government and the ease by which such ideals can be abandoned. Properly accompanied by a suitable propaganda campaign and further supported by the wholesale destruction of any literature or objects potentially communist in nature, we will soon eradicate this abomination from our lands."

 VYT_the_reinvigorated_sobornost: "The Reinvigorated Sobornost"
 VYT_the_reinvigorated_sobornost_desc: "Sobornost is an old concept describing the joint spiritual community of living Russians. It emphasized the need for cooperation among all the Slavic peoples of Russia for mutual benefit, and with so many of them living under oppression, whether in German lands or otherwise, this need for cooperation could not be more severe.\n\nWe will support this policy, and integrate it into our government's social and economic policies. In this way, we will bind our country closer together, and prepare it for when it can, and will, welcome all of its brothers and sisters back home."

 VYT_our_august_leader: "Our August Leader"
 VYT_our_august_leader_desc: "Under the old Empire, the Tsar's will was absolute. This allowed him great power with regards to reshaping Russia, but it also made it trivial for him to abuse his position, raise the enmity of the people, and, eventually, give birth to the cancer that was communism. These memories still persist among some of our citizens, reducing support for the Tsar, and thus for our government.\n\nTo counteract this, we will promote a reimagining of the Tsar's role and position. He must, and will, be seen as the manifestation of the national collective will, and as the staunch defender of the Imperial constitution. It will be made clear that, in stark contrast to the old Empire, the Tsar of the new wields his divine authority for the betterment of the people and of his government, and not for the betterment of himself."
 
 VYT_reconquest_of_the_urals: "Reconquest of the Urals"
 VYT_reconquest_of_the_urals_desc: "The lands surrounding the Urals have been constituent components of the Empire for centuries, and the brief interruption of our mandate of rule by the communists, the Germans, and the other statelets matters not. These are Russian, populated by Russians, and crying out for liberation by the true Russians. And we will answer.\n\nWe will make it clear to the 'rulers' of these lands that they will submit to Imperial authority and surrender the temporal control of them to the Tsar's government. In so doing we will bring to these millions of Russians the enlightened governance that they deserve.\n\nAnd if the bandits refuse, they will be dealt with most harshly."
 
 VYT_optimal_assistance: "Optimal Assistance"
 VYT_optimal_assistance_desc: "Although a critical passageway between distinct portions of our Empire, the Urals have long been neglected and underdeveloped. Those of our citizens who live there have spent generations neglected by the central government, surviving as best as they were able. In the modern age, this form of survival is no longer viable.\n\nWe will bring industry to the Urals, and challenge those living there to integrate themselves with it. With characteristic Russian fortitude and hard work, along with some minor assistance for those less able, we will bring these brothers and sisters of ours into the modern Russia."
 
 VYT_political_investigation_campaign: "Political Investigation Campaign"
 VYT_political_investigation_campaign_desc: "Despite many efforts to the contrary, there still remain political dissidents, originating from the vast patchwork of statelets conquered by our forces, within many of our cities and territories. Although most are not currently problematic, this could swiftly change, and we will not permit dangerous ideologies to maintain a foundation from which to build, should domestic circumstances change.\n\nAccordingly, the Okhrana will be given free rein to investigate, identify, locate, arrest, and eliminate these ideologies, ensuring that, upon completion, the only political doctrines remaining are those currently represented in our government."

 VYT_groundwork_for_the_new_russia: "Groundwork for the New Russia"
 VYT_groundwork_for_the_new_russia_desc: "Creating an entirely new political infrastructure, as we have done repeatedly, is always difficult. Hierarchies must be established, jurisdictions codified, regulations created, and people found. Nowhere is this more evident than in our own efforts to shape our national government under the Tsar and enshrine the principles of Solidarism within it.\n\nWhile, unlike in many newly acquired territories, the constitution may limit what we can do on the national level, we can still work to promote our goals. Ensuring that the proper candidates are chosen for influential positions, that the right bills are advanced, and that the right committees are dominated by our supporters will all contribute towards building the groundwork for the new Russia. One where we are at the forefront."

 VYT_rebuilding_russia: "Rebuilding Russia"
 VYT_rebuilding_russia_desc: "Even after everything we have done in the political, economic, and military spheres, it is clear that Russia, hampered by so many years of conflict and devastation, is simply not comparable to the major world powers, despite having both the population and resource base to be one.\n\nWith that being said, however, our prospects are promising. Political stability is ever increasing. Our industrial base is developing at a rapid pace. Our schools are graduating more scientists, engineers, and doctors. Our military is expanding and increasingly professionalizing. And quality of life for ordinary Russians, millions all, is higher than it has been in decades. The Imperial flag flies high above Vyatka and the Empire.\n\nAnd one day, it will fly over Moscow too."

 VYT_do_not_forget_the_poor_man_desc: "Within our newly unified lands, there are millions of Russians who suffered under regimes that cared little for either their fortunes or their suffering. Who watched their meager holdings destroyed under years of German bombings alongside. We cannot tolerate this situation any longer.\n\nFor the sake of all our people, and to set an example for those soon to be liberated, we must invest into social services of all kinds. So lifted out of poverty, these millions will then themselves contribute to the nation, raising the potentials of all."
 
 VYT_nor_abandon_the_disenfranchised: "...Nor Abandon the Disenfranchised..."
 VYT_nor_abandon_the_disenfranchised_desc: "One of the most repulsive practices of the old Empire was its treatment of minority populations. Wanting only to live in peace and in accordance with their traditions, they were oppressed and marginalized without pause. And when they, eventually and inevitably, revolted, they were slaughtered en masse.\n\nWe will not allow this to happen again. From this day forward, minorities within the Empire will be permitted limited self-governance and autonomy, and these rights will be enshrined in law. Russia is a country for all its inhabitants, and we will prove that."
 
 VYT_nor_lay_down_the_sword: "...Nor Lay Down the Sword..."
 VYT_nor_lay_down_the_sword_desc: "Though it is our intention to focus on the many domestic injustices and equalities that have long failed to be properly addressed, we cannot and will not forget our mission of reunification. Accomplishing that mission will, however, require a modern and nationally supportive military, and steps must be taken to ensure the existence of it.\n\nCorruptive and reactionary elements have long embedded themselves in the very fabric of the Imperial forces, and they continue to stress our institutions.\n\nWe must eliminate these influences, and in so doing ensure a military that is politically compliant to the democratically-elected government."
 
 VYT_who_will_build_the_empire: "...Who Will Build the Empire..."
 VYT_who_will_build_the_empire_desc: "The Imperial economy has expanded dramatically over the course of our regional unification. Industrial expansion, trade connections, and the integration of workforces have brought our people great prosperity, especially in comparison to those around us.\n\nHowever, we are no longer a small nation of limited means, and the needs and challenges of our economic paradigm have changed dramatically. We must therefore reforge and refocus our economic plans and procedures to address them.\n\nOur budget will therefore be amended to fund integrated industrial ventures across the nation, and reduce the barriers that impede business growth."
 
 VYT_and_rebuild_the_spoiled_land: "...And Rebuild the Spoiled Land..."
 VYT_and_rebuild_the_spoiled_land_desc: "Even years removed, the effects, visible and otherwise, of the decades-long German terror bombings still scar our nation. The conflicts of regional unification only amplified them.\n\nOne of the most important impacts was on the proper utilization of arable land. Much of it currently lies fallow or poorly used, and this is leading to rampant food insecurity across the Empire. This must be corrected with all haste.\n\nWe will invest into agricultural reconstruction and mechanization, and encourage farmers to return to their fields."
 
 VYT_who_will_defend_the_empire: "...Who Will Defend the Empire..."
 VYT_who_will_defend_the_empire_desc: "Though victorious during our regional unification, the Imperial forces must continue to improve their capabilities if we are to reclaim the lands claimed by our rivals. This improvement will require expansion, in both men and materiel.\n\nTo that end, we will increase funding dedicated to the expansion of productive capacity. By doing so, we will ensure that, as more men are recruited and trained, the weapons and equipment required to provision them are available."
 
 VYT_and_bring_ruin_to_the_enemy: "...And Bring Ruin to the Enemy..."
 VYT_and_bring_ruin_to_the_enemy_desc: "Despite all our reforms and advancements, the fact remains that the Imperial forces as they exist are simply not the equal of those of the other major powers. This is especially true in the case of advanced weapons and strategic capability.\n\nIf we want to be accepted as a great, or even regional, power, we must act decisively to continue our programs of modernization and technical innovation. Additional funding and resources will be made available for this purpose."

 VYT_for_the_eternal_russian_tsar_desc: "The Empire lives once again!\n\nThough once lost in the fires of revolution, invasion, and civil war, the spirit of monarchism imbued with liberalism, preserved in the figures of the Tsar and our government both, has proved stronger than all.\n\nOur military stands supreme within Russia, our progressive government is working to ensure the prosperity and democratic rights of all its citizens, and our economy is ever expanding. We stand today a monument to the strength and courage of the Russian spirit.\n\nFor the Eternal Russian Tsar!"

 VYT_reassure_the_emperor_desc: "It is no secret that Tsar Vladimir is not a supporter of our agenda. However, regardless of his personal opinions we were chosen, by the people, to form government, and he must accept this. He must be seen to accept this.\n\nBut we need not force this upon him and promote further discord. Prime Minister Gul will make a personal appeal to the Tsar in the interests of the nation, and reassure him that, whatever our personal political differences, we only have the Empire's long-term interests at heart."

 VYT_roll_back_on_the_okhrana_desc: "Although the Okhrana has proved itself highly capable in defending the state, it has also proved itself nigh-uncontrollable, acting in a nearly autonomous fashion and with excessive brutality. This can no longer be tolerated under our administration, and poses a danger to stability besides.\n\nWe will therefore conduct a full and independent investigation into their operations and affairs and, once completed, drastically reduce their budget. The Okhrana will survive, but it will be as a smaller and more responsible tool of the state."
 
 VYT_guarantee_personal_freedoms: "Guarantee Personal Freedoms"
 VYT_guarantee_personal_freedoms_desc: "As the Okhrana are returned to proper oversight, control, and position, we must ensure that the legal practices which allowed it to become so powerful are amended as well.\n\nWe will pass legislation to guarantee more personal freedoms for all citizens, particularly as they relate to unlawful detainment and their rights when under questioning or arrest.\n\nThough seemingly minor, such rights will act in the future to help prevent the excesses of the past, and therefore protect the democratic state as a whole."
 
 VYT_the_ural_drive: "The Ural Drive"
 VYT_the_ural_drive_desc: "Both Western Russia and Western Siberia are bountiful lands, not only in mineral and agricultural wealth, but in population as well. However, the infrastructure in both regions is terribly underdeveloped, and this leads to the isolation of these same resources and people from the state.\n\nWe must act to re-integrate them, through a concerted drive of infrastructural construction, repair, and realignment. Not only will this improve extractive capability, but it will show to these people that life under the Empire is no longer represented by neglect and stagnation, but by investment and eternal progress."

 VYT_trans_russian_railroads_desc: "It is undeniable that one of the old Empire's greatest achievements was the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, linking Moscow and Vladivostok - and thus the entire country - in a way not before experienced.\n\nWith our efforts towards the continued expansion of state infrastructure, we may be able to connect and integrate both old and new networks.\n\nBy doing so, and working to create an all-encompassing Trans-Russia Railway, we will connect our millions of citizens as never before, and enjoy the resulting social, economic, and military benefits it would bring."
 
 VYT_the_rights_of_loyal_subjects: "The Rights of Loyal Subjects"
 VYT_the_rights_of_loyal_subjects_desc: "Ever since the initial establishment of Imperial rule in Vyatka, all forms of media have been subject to oversight and some measure of state control. It is impossible to truly call oneself a democracy as long as the press is shackled, and so we will act to remove those restrictions and introduce legislation protecting the rights of a free press.\n\nAlthough the Tsar is likely to be hesitant in supporting such a move, given previous experiences, we will impress upon him the necessity of such reforms. The rights of citizens to question or criticize their elected government should never be in danger, and free speech must be protected besides."

We are healing the traumas of wars past while also modernizing and enlarging our army for the wars to come.\n\nMost importantly, we have confronted the sins of Tsars and Empire past, taken responsibility, and made amends.

That its 'antiquated' system of government and refusal to reform doomed the monarchy to disaster. This could not be further from the truth.\n\nThe stability of the empire was not lost - it was stolen. By Bolsheviks. By liberals. By those in its own government who did not keep their faith in the Tsar. We will make sure those who claim such understand this.

 VYT_reshuffle_the_ministries_desc: "Despite our formation of government, dissent still exists among the representatives and officials whose sympathies lie with the Kadets or Solidarists. This dissent not only frustrates our efforts, legislative or otherwise, to return dignity to the Empire, it makes us look weak on the world stage.\n\nWe will act to correct this by 'promoting' prominent figures in both factions to positions where they can do little harm.

Some such challenges simply didn't exist years ago, yet must be addressed all the same.\n\nSome reforms, limited in scope and highly targeted, are necessary to ensure continued stability.

That being said, there are certain aspects that are, like serfdom once was, better left in the past. One of which is the appointment of unqualified nobles to positions of government.\n\nThese nobles have seen our ascendency, and already ask for the influence they consider their right. We will find suitable positions for them, with high title and no power, and so remove them from any concrete management of state affairs."

Tsar Vladimir is an intelligent, well-read, and determined ruler who can no doubt offer much advice to his government, and it would be a waste to toss that advice aside.\n\nWe will take heed of his words and suggestions on our politics, for the Tsar is the embodiment of Imperial authority and, ultimately, all is done in his name."

 VYT.1.t: "All Roads Lead to Romanov"
 VYT.1.desc: "On the 17th of July, 1918, Emperor Nicholas II was murdered. The Russian Civil War that followed, and the eventual Soviet victory in it was, for many, the death knell of Russian monarchism.\n\nIt may well have been, but for the actions of one man. Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov may have been born into exile, watching first from France and then Brittany as communism crushed his ancestral land under abject tyranny, but he has at last returned home.\n\nStyling himself as Tsar Vladimir III, and raising a German-sponsored force of exiles, émigrés, and any others who would fight, he captured the city of Vyatka amid the chaos of the West Russian War. Soon after, he declared the revival of the Russian Empire in both the city and the lands surrounding it.\n\nAs 1962 begins, the Tsar finds himself facing a series of monumental tasks. He must address the crippled Russian economy, an openly rebellious governor, hostile neighboring statelets, a divided army, an apathetic population and, greatest of all, how to advance his goal of the eventual unification of Russia under the Romanov dynasty.\n\nThe death of Nicholas II threw Russia into a chaos from which it has never recovered, but with the return of Vladimir III perhaps that chaos can be quelled, and a new, strong Imperial Russian state can rise from the ashes!"
 VYT.1.a: "You will be avenged, Uncle."
 
 VYT.2.t: "Hill 483"
 VYT.2.desc: "Ever since the return of Tsar Vladimir to Russia - alongside the German military response in the West Russian War - he has, unsurprisingly, faced accusations that neither he nor his military have sufficiently distanced themselves from the forces of the Reich. With many of our officers carrying German equipment and having received German training, we have long looked for an opportunity to demonstrate our separation from the German regime. While we hesitate to call it 'fortunate,' one such an opportunity has presented itself.\n\nOur commanders have received reports that a small hilltop community near Izhevsk has been attacked by a group displaying common Nazi symbols. Although it is unknown whether they are a German raiding party or merely bandits from the fanatics of Perm, it is known that they are currently besieging the settlement, and that it cannot hold out for long.\n\nIn response, the Tsar has ordered a small task force, 300 strong and equipped with heavy weaponry, be dispatched to break the siege of the settlement, marked on military maps as Hill 483. In doing so, not only will the Tsar protect his people, but he will also prove that neither he nor his military have any remaining sympathy to Nazism or the odious individuals who practice it."
 VYT.2.a: "A first step on a great journey."

 VYT.3.t: "Hill 483 - Success!"
 VYT.3.desc: "The special task force dispatched by the Tsar engaged the attacking raiders on the slopes of Hill 483, following initial scouting action.\n\nAlthough the raiders were apparently aware of their own numerical inferiority, they committed themselves to holding their position, trusting in both the terrain as well as their own rough fortifications. They clearly did not expect our forces to have brought artillery.\n\nTrapped between our soldiers and the community militia they had besieged, those raiders not eliminated by artillery fell quickly to gunfire from either the front or rear, and survivors quickly surrendered.\n\nAlthough a small action, our men received a heroes' welcome from the community, demonstrated their competence and professionalism, and showed both their own, as well as the Tsar's, willingness to directly confront Nazism in defense of the people."
 VYT.3.a: "A wonderful outcome."

 VYT.4.t: "Hill 483 - Failure!"
 VYT.4.desc: "The special task force dispatched by the Tsar engaged the attacking raiders on the slopes of Hill 483, following initial scouting action.\n\nAlthough the raiders were apparently aware of their own numerical inferiority, they committed themselves to holding their position, trusting in both the terrain as well as their own rough fortifications. In retrospect, this was clearly the optimal choice.\n\nAs our men advanced, the artillery commander refused the order to fire, citing unacceptable risk. Unsupported, our soldiers found themselves pinned down by machine gun fire, and suffered heavy casualties before being forced to retreat. So motivated, the raiders quickly overwhelmed the civilian militia atop Hill 483 and sacked the community before withdrawing from the field.\n\nAlthough a small action, our performance has led to accusations of both the possible incompetence of and Nazi sympathies within our military. Additionally, it would seem our neighbors have taken notice of our prior performance as well."
 VYT.4.a: "What a mess."

 VYT.5.t: "An Imperial Donation"
 VYT.5.desc: "As a result of the chaotic and violent nature that dominates Western Russia, the people are quick to repeat and embellish the stories and achievements of those considered legends. One group so considered is that of the Free Aviators, former Red Air Force pilots who, from their airfields in the frigid north, rise to engage the German terror bombers whenever and wherever they can, including over our territory.\n\nAlthough they are communists, they are, unlike many of their ideological brethren, fighting selflessly to protect both Russia and Russians from foreign invaders. As such, in an attempt to boost his public perception, secure additional legitimacy, and support these brave pilots, the Tsar has, at personal expense, secured a number of previously decommissioned aircraft, as well as a large number of replacement parts for both them.\n\nHe will dispatch all of this, free of charge, to the Free Aviators, and in so doing help them fight for the nation he, one day, intends to rule in its entirety."
 VYT.5.a: "Heroism should always be acknowledged."

 VYT.6.t: "The Emperor on the Radio"
 VYT.6.desc: "Following a number of attempts to demonstrate we are no Bolshevik or fascist warlord here to inflict more misery to the Russian people and a steady rise in popular support, Emperor Vladimir has decided to address the people of Vyatka and beyond via radio. Emperor Vladimir's voice over the radio is by no means a new occurrence to the Russian people; many having heard him sing the Reich's tune during the war. But now the Emperor intends to make a very different speech to his people."
 VYT.6.a: "We're live in three, two, one..."

 VYT.7.t: "The Tsar's Speech"
 VYT.7.desc: ""My countrymen, good evening. In these difficult times, I thank you for taking the time to listen to me, wherever you may be. I understand that many of you do not believe me a man to be trusted, a man unconcerned with your welfare, and so for the next few minutes I ask to speak to you not as your Tsar, but as a fellow Russian."\n\n"For almost twenty years we have been crushed under the weight of oppression. To the Soviets we were little more than cogs in a machine, and to the Germans we were, and still are, seen as little more than animals. Now, it is true that, for a time, I worked with the Germans. At the time I justified it as using one enemy against another. That was wrong, and I now understand why. Only a Russian can understand the depth of suffering, and the degree of need, of this great country, and I now well understand both. I now pledge to dedicate all my efforts towards counteracting that suffering, and satisfying that need."\n\n"You, we, are all Russians. We are not cogs in a machine. We are not animals to be hunted. We are human beings who want only that peace and prosperity which so many others take for granted, and together we will obtain it."\n\n"I do not ask for you to blindly trust me, for I know to ask a Russian for trust absent action is folly. I ask only that you watch me earn that trust. I ask only that you allow me to prove the status to which family and God has entrusted me."\n\n"Russia is in shadow, and I think none would argue that. But, together, we will find the light, and I ask that, in time, you trust me to lead the way. May God watch over us all.""
 VYT.7.a: "Well said, Your Imperial Majesty."

 VYT.8.t: "The Court Tongue"
 VYT.8.desc: "As the Tsar solidifies his control and moves to codify court procedures and expectations, the issue of language has suddenly arisen.\n\nThough ethnic Russians of course dominate the lands that we control, Russia as a whole encompasses many more ethnic groups and languages besides.\n\nAs a result, a question regarding the official language of the court has been raised. Many are surprised that such a question is even being entertained, firmly believing that Russia is a nation for Russians and that, since Russian is the majority language of the court regardless, it is inherently its official language.\n\nOther courtiers, primarily those younger and more liberal-minded believe that to codify Russian as the sole language would be a step backwards in our attempts to modify the Imperial system for the modern age.\n\nBoth arguments have merit, and exactly what the Tsar's decision is going to be is therefore a topic of great debate."
 VYT.8.a: "Russia speaks Russian, and so shall the court!"
 VYT.8.b: "If the Emperor can speak multiple languages, so can the court."

 VYT.9.t: "Equality Before the Law"
 VYT.9.desc: "Yet another matter has been raised before the Tsar's court, this time concerning prerogatives as it relates to the aristocracy and the legal code.\n\nApparently, one of our aristocrats quite brutally assaulted a man suspected of carrying on an affair with his wife. Although arrested at the scene, he was released shortly thereafter due to inconsistencies in the law as it applies to those with noble title.\n\nThe incident has caused outrage among the people of Vyatka and has also divided the court. Reformists, advocating as always for a more open and liberal society, strongly believe that the law should apply to everyone equally, regardless of status. Conversely, many of the older aristocrats believe that certain exemptions must be granted to the ruling classes in order to maintain stability and continuity.\n\nThe factions cannot come to agreement, and the Tsar must therefore make a decision."
 VYT.9.a: "Clinging to the past killed the Romanovs of old, enforce the rule of law!"
 VYT.9.b: "The rights of the aristocracy cannot be ignored, they will have their exemptions."

 VYT.10.t: "The Vyatka Distillery"
 VYT.10.desc: "Whilst the Emperor has tasked his advisors to devise economic strategies to kickstart our crippled economy, seeking to lead by example the Emperor has put forward a proposal of his own to his advisors.\n\nWhen our forces secured the city of Vyatka from the Bolsheviks, one of our units stumbled upon a bandit operation in the city producing moonshine in an old distillery. Attempts to remove the bandits let to a firefight and their wholesale deaths, but much of the equipment and the building was left intact.\n\nWith large scale industry rendered impossible due to Luftwaffe bombings the Emperor has instructed that the distillery should be at last re-opened and put to work producing one of Russia's most treasured resources: high quality vodka. Such small scale industry but with a significant market across Russia would provide an excellent boost to our economy, the Emperor believes, and will open the door to more substantial industry in our future.\n\nIt will be some time before we can produce vodka en masse, and of a worthwhile quality, but the Emperor has authorized the necessary subsidies and investments to allow production to begin. All that remains is to clear up the distillery and get to work."
 VYT.10.a: "Selling vodka to Russians? We may as well have liquid gold!"

 VYT.11.t: "From Berlin with Love"
 VYT.11.desc: "Just like everywhere else in Western Russia, the German Luftwaffe regularly flies over the Principality to dispense terror, misery, and death from on high.\n\nThey bomb everything they see, and nothing escapes their efforts. Not schools, hospitals, factories, houses, and farms, or anything that could be considered to have economic, military, or social value has escaped them.\n\nFor twenty years this has continued, shaping the thoughts and practices of an entire generation, and utterly destroying any possibility of a real industrial base in our, or anyone else's, territory. We cannot stop them, but that does not mean we must remain idle.\n\nWe can investigate alternative economic methods, plan for future expansions, and lay the groundwork for rapid development when, not if, the bombers stop. The resources of the Reich are not infinite, even if it may seem that way to many of our citizens, and when the day comes that our skies are once again clear, we will be ready."
 VYT.11.a: "One day the bombs will stop. One day."

 VYT.12.t: "Imperial Austerity"
 VYT.12.desc: "With the lamentable state of the current economy, the Tsar's advisors are united in the opinion that a program of austerity must be implemented, immediately, in order to prevent imminent total collapse. There is, quite simply, no money to spend, and in order to obtain capital for investment and development, cuts to other sectors must be made. The only question is how severe the implementation of this austerity should be.\n\nThe majority of advisors have suggested moderation, applying significant, yet reasonable cuts to various public services, including education and healthcare. Some, however, have advised the Tsar that drastic times require drastic measures, and that the only way to ensure success is to enforce extreme reductions in the budgets of every government service, excepting only the military and specially identified initiatives.\n\nCuts of any kind will not be well-received by the populace, and so the Tsar must decide how much hardship he believes his subjects will be willing to face."
 VYT.12.a: "A moderate program of austerity will do."
 VYT.12.b: "An extreme program of austerity is our only choice."

 VYT.13.t: "The Risks of Doing Business"
 VYT.13.desc: "For the first time in decades, the river ports of Vyatka bustle with trade. Stevedores move cargo, exchanging the crude jokes of rough men. Pursers surrey along the quays, checking and rechecking manifests. Officials do the same, searching for smugglers and ensuring proper taxation is levied. Around them all the engine of commerce hums.\n\nFrom the Imperial barge, modest as it may be, Tsar Vladimir looked on, watching as his people work contendently and allowing himself to feel accomplishment at having enabled them to do so, even as yet another migraine throbs at his temple. So focused, the Tsar did not notice his guest, a merchant captain, approach him.\n\n"Majesty?" the captain asked, "Are you all right?"\n\nVladimir waved him away. "I'm fine," he lied. "Thank you." He swept his arm outwards, gesturing to the docks. "What was it you were saying earlier, Captain?"\n\n"Pirates, your Majesty," came the captain's reply. "It is known that there are river pirates downstream, along the major riverine trade routes. Both I and the other merchants have requested more guard detachments, seconded from the Imperial armies."\n\nThe Tsar hid his dismay, strong enough to break through even the intense discomfort of the migraine. Securing such detachments would require forcing a compromise between Gul, Shulgin, and Solzhenitsyn. As his head continues to throb, however, he responds:"
 VYT.13.a: "And you shall have them."
 VYT.13.b: "You will have to make do without."

 VYT.14.t: "Raid on the Vyatka - Raiders Fought Off!"
 VYT.14.desc: "The raiders made their approach to the Imperial trade barge in the dead of night, with faces blackened and small boats riding low in the water. Avoiding the barge's lights, they aligned themselves with it and threw hooks up and over the side with the practiced ease of men who had performed the action dozens of times before. This time, however, things would be different.\n\nOn the deck, one of the additional guards assigned by the Tsar heard a noise and, investigating more closely, saw the hooks. Shouting an alarm, he kicked the hook away and began firing into the darkness, soon joined by both the barge's crew as well as other guards. When everything had calmed down and the sun began to rise, the guards found that the pirates had retreated without casualty.\n\nBut, at least for once, they had been denied their prize. And word would spread that the Tsar's soldiers now protected the river craft."
 VYT.14.a: "Another victory for the Tsar."

 VYT.15.t: "Raid on the Vyatka - Raiders Win!"
 VYT.15.desc: "The report had just arrived.\n\nOne of the river barges, the one belonging to the captain he had spoken to only a few days previous, had been found by a military patrol, beached and looted. Nearby, the bodies of its crew, the captain among them, were found in a pile, having either been killed in an attack or executed following surrender. The work of river pirates - the same ones that the captain had feared. And that he had dismissed.\n\nThe cargo was gone and would not be recovered, and the pirates themselves would likely not operate within the Principality for some time - thereby escaping punishment. A feeling of guilt washed over the Tsar.\n\nSlumping in his chair, he felt it consume his thoughts. He had sent good and loyal men, men who had believed in his program of riverine trade, to their deaths. He had ignored their concerns. And though he knew the more important impact would be the loss of confidence in the program as a whole by the merchants, he could not get the captain's face out of his head.\n\nHe set the report down, and sighed again. A migraine was coming on."
 VYT.15.a: "A terrible price for a slight mistake."

 VYT.16.t: "The Law of the Land"
 VYT.16.desc: "The soldiers had entered his village three days ago, claiming to serve the Tsar. He wasn't sure what they had meant - the communists had shot the last Tsar decades ago - but they had not yet tried to steal anything. Moreover, they promised protection from the bandits who had plagued the settlement for years. And all they had asked for in return was accommodation.\n\nThe man had let one of them stay in his house, in the room of his late wife. Every morning they would share a meal before the soldier joined his compatriots on patrol, and when he returned they would share another. For two weeks this ritual repeated, and he had even asked the soldier, to a shrug in reply, why he was even here at all.\n\nBut eventually that question was answered. Armed men under a strange banner were spotted nearby, and the soldiers quickly manned the positions they had been preparing for weeks. When the attackers - black-clad men with hateful fanaticism in their eyes - arrived, they charged headlong into the village. They were cut down where they stood.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers assembled for a headcount, and all were present - except one. A search quickly found him lying behind an earthwork, shot through the chest, with blank eyes staring up at the sky. The man recognized the soldier from their shared meals, but hid his emotion with the ease of one long practiced in doing so.\n\nThe next morning, he volunteered to dig the soldier's grave, and fashioned a rough cross to mark it."
 VYT.16.a: "Every victory has its price."

 VYT.17.desc: "The newly-appointed bishop of Vyatka, having completed the Divine Liturgy, stepped in front of the gathered congregation. Before him were the Orthodox faithful of the city, representing all stations and walks of life. The cathedral was plain, its interior undecorated. But the cross, and the altar, were all that one truly needed.\n\n"Friends," the bishop began, raising his hands, "compatriots of Christ, it is no secret that Russia, this bastion of the Lord's true faith, is in great danger. We fight amongst ourselves and," he pointed to the sky, "the Devil's own jackals rain death upon us from high above. But not all is lost! There is one man, one faithful servant of God, who stands against the darkness like a beacon."\n\n"That man is Tsar Vladimir! He has blessed us with his patronage, and his armies have protected the faithful as best as they are able, turning this city into a bastion of godliness. Even now our congregation expands, bringing salvation, respite, and comfort to all those who need it." He took a step forward, looking at each of those present in turn. "The Tsar will lead us forward, and shine the light of the lord into all the shadowed corners of Russia where it has been suppressed."\n\nThe bishop lowered his voice, imparting finalty on his words. "So say a prayer for the Tsar, my faithful, every night. Because he prays for you, he prays for Russia, and he prays for the grace of God to return to this land!""

I'm sorry to report, sir, that it's going to be a while longer before they'll make it to the men." Cherdenko tried his best to mask his frustration.\n\n"I don't understand, Lieutenant," Gavrilov replied, "The guns are in the warehouse. All you needed to do was sign for them and be on your way. So what's the delay?"\n\nCherdenko sighed. "They delay, sir, is that nobody seems to have the authority to actually release the rifles to me. Every agency sends me to another bureau, and every bureau sends me to another department. And all seem to require approval from one another." He took a risk. "I've never seen so much red tape, sir!"\n\nOver the telephone, Cherdenko heard a grunt. "Calm down, son," Gavrilov said. "I understand your frustration, but this is how things work around here. I'll make some calls, but you'll just have to go through the process until we get our guns. Understand?" Gavrilov's tone was clear.\n\n"Yes, sir." Cherdenko replied. "I will."

This meeting, yet another of the many between the representatives of the most prominent political factions in the Principality, namely Roman Gul, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Vasily Shulgin had, predictably, devolved into little more than a shouting match.\n\n"You would have us speak of 'liberalisation' and 'democracy' when we have barely secured our borders?" Solzhenitsyn shouted with incredulity.\n\nGul shot upright in protest. "I would!" he cried. "Russia's future is at stake, and all you promote is the same thinking that empowered the communists in the first place!" As Solzhenitsyn's face purpled with rage Vladimir felt a migraine coming on, the stress having aggravated it. But the sudden intervention of Shulgin refocused him on the meeting.\n\n"My liege," he said respectfully, "would you care to add your insight to this exchange? You have been rather quiet today." Vladimir cursed internally. Shulgin strongly supported him, of course, but the old man was never able to understand when he just wanted to be left alone. After a long moment, the Tsar spoke.\n\n"You have all spoken well today," he began, using words long practiced, "and I will require time to consider them. Time I will take presently." Rising and departing to respectful glances from all those present, Vladimir retreated down the hall as muffled shouting resumed behind him.\n\nThe migraine was pounding at his temples. Perhaps he could ask his physician for some relief."
 VYT.19.a: "When will the bickering end?"

 VYT.20.t: "A Lucrative Offer"
 VYT.20.desc: "Our agents in Kostroma have reported back to us that they have been approached with a rather interesting proposal from a most unexpected source: Vyatka. It would appear that Emperor Vladimir's government has recently constructed a vodka distillery within their territory and is looking for buyers. Well, if smuggling alcohol out of Russia is their goal, they could hardly have picked better people to do it. The only question is whether or not we will accept the deal.\n\nThe Emperor's men drive a hard bargain: since the end of the Second World War, Russian-brewed vodka has been in short supply in the West. Indeed, the very first shipment received will probably pay itself back several times over. Collaboration with one of the only vestiges of monarchism in Russia would also serve to ingratiate ourselves with White Émigrés, many of whom sit upon large piles of cash. The opportunities that trade with Vyatka could present to us are numerous, but so are the risks.\n\nBesides the resources that will be needed to establish the route, our greatest problem will be getting the vodka across Europe in the first place - a treacherous journey through German-occupied territory and the banditry that plagues Russia. Even as few as a dozen crates being lost per month could substantially cut into our profits. There is also the issue of the general instability of Russia as a whole. Vyatka could easily cease to exist in half a decade, and our relations with them would hardly endear us to whoever takes their place.\n\nWith all of this in mind, should we accept the Emperor's offer with a handshake, or politely turn it down and search for better opportunities? Our men in Kostroma are eagerly awaiting a response."
 VYT.20.a: "Fine liquor is in constant demand, and this could prove to be a reliable source."
 VYT.20.b: "Trading with monarchists? What nonsense."

 VYT.21.t: "The Dutch Connection"
 VYT.21.desc: "Our contacts in the city of Kostroma have reported success. Following aggressive negotiations, the Dutch have agreed to act as an intermediary for the export of large quantities of spirits worldwide. Though they will of course take a significant cut, we can expect large returns of foreign capital once the pipeline is established.\n\nWe must, therefore, set that pipeline in motion. Already the first convoy of Vyatkan vodka has been transferred to Dutch control, and it will soon begin its long journey to the Netherlands. Once there it will be prepared for export and sold by the Dutch to whomever is willing to buy.\n\nThe Dutch have promised the first payment in a month's time, and already the Tsar's advisors are determining both the best way to invest the proceeds as well as methods to improve production should demand prove high enough.\n\nBefore long, the entire world will have heard of our Principality, and the quality of our product will ensure that they think of it fondly."
 VYT.21.a: "Russia's new number one export."

 VYT.22.t: "An Offer Refused"
 VYT.22.desc: "Unfortunately, it seems the Dutch were not wise enough to accept our more than generous offer. Our agents in Kostroma have reported back that their mutually beneficial offer has been politely turned down even after substantial concessions were made on our part. Cited were the risks of transporting the vodka across Europe and our "questionable ability to meet demand." This is a grave mistake on the Netherlands' part, of course, but it seems that they have made up their mind.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that our distillery will have to remain focused on domestic production. Overall this has been a major blow to our efforts to obtain foreign currency, and for the foreseeable future it seems we will have to continue relying on that which we receive from émigrés abroad.\n\nNonetheless our distillery is still proving to be a worthwhile investment, and all hope is not lost for trading our vodka abroad. Several of our closer neighbors could still prove to be interested in acquiring more alcoholic beverages, and as our power grows we could easily end up doing ourselves what we have had to rely on the Dutch for at present."
 VYT.22.a: "Perhaps it is better to avoid entanglements with the black market."

 VYT.23.t: "Chernaya Rabota"
 VYT.23.desc: "In an unnoticed farmhouse, just outside Vyatka, the agents carried the bodies to shallow graves that had been earlier prepared. Neither of the agents felt any sympathy for the men they had killed. After all, as Smyslovsky had told them, to be in the Okhrana one had to be tough. Enemies of the state could be shown no mercy, lest disorder spread.\n\nThey had been turned onto the men following one of many raids on suspected communist safehouses, where a coded letter had, after being deciphered, led them to a warehouse. There the men had been found, suspected of aiming to subvert the Tsar's regime on orders from Arkhangelsk. Like all committed 'revolutionaries,' the men had resisted. But the agents knew their task, and knew that everyone, eventually, breaks. And one of them did.\n\nHe revealed the existence of a revolutionary cell in Vyatka, with the ultimate goal of toppling the Tsar's government and establishing control for the Revolutionary Front, before expiring. His companion, interrogated separately, corroborated the story before exiting in similar fashion.\n\nAfter the agents buried the bodies, they prepared their report. These men were just the beginning, and there would be much more work ahead."
 VYT.23.a: "Stability must be ensured."

 VYT.24.t: "Matters of State"
 VYT.24.desc: "With all of Western Russia secure, and with the establishment of the provisional civilian government well underway, a sense of normalcy had returned to the lives of those who lived under the Tsar.\n\nWith civilian rule came additional advisory bodies for the Tsar, and one of them was meeting today. As its members arrived, they spoke quietly amongst themselves. The Tsar had made it clear that he wanted to deal with the myriad internal issues facing the Sovereignty before any talk of further unification would be countenanced, and political jockeying had already begun.\n\nAs the Tsar arrived and the meeting commenced, one member proposed to focus state efforts on infrastructure, while another wished to focus on internal security, and others wanted attentions placed elsewhere besides. By the time the meeting finished, several hours later, some progress, less than was hoped but more than was feared, had been made on several of those issues.\n\nLater that evening, Vladimir thought on the events of earlier. There were differing opinions, and arguments, and debates of all kinds in between. But all were dedicated to the Sovereignty, to him, and to preparing the country for its ultimate goal of eastwards unification, regardless of personal interest.\n\nHe would accept that."
 VYT.24.a: "A true state develops."

 VYT.25.t: "Promises of a Congress"
 VYT.25.desc: "It was most unusual for the Tsar to call a meeting of his council without the agenda having been established beforehand. Thus when he did, as he had just done, the representatives of Vyatka's political factions knew something important was about to happen.\n\nAs Roman Gul, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Vasily Shulgin sat down across from him, he welcomed them in turn, took a deep breath, and spoke.\n\n"I have called you here," he began, "because I believe that the time will soon come for a general congress to be held. I have heard, as you have, the calls for democracy increase day-by-day, and I do not believe that modern Russia can endure the rigid autocracy of my ancestors."\n\nGul, the eternal reformer, spoke first. "Majesty," he said, his eyes shining and a smile spreading across his face, "this is excellent news, and most heartening besides. The people will deeply respect this choice. But-"\n\n"When will it happen?" Solzhenitsyn interrupted, his own eyes narrowing.\n\n"As soon as we are secure." Vladimir gestured above himself. "With the end of the bombing raids the generals have told me that it is imperative we move quickly to secure the region, before others do the same. As soon as that is achieved, the congress will be called." There was more said, but the most important message had been conveyed.\n\nAs the three men left the room, Shulgin hesitated before closing the door behind himself, and spoke. "Majesty, I wanted to thank you. What you have said here today has helped an old man have confidence that his life of dedication has not been wasted."\n\nAlone again, Vladimir looked out his window. With any luck, very soon his domain would extend much further indeed."
 VYT.25.a: "Always towards the future."

 VYT.27.desc: "As had become distressingly common, Tsar Vladimir woke to a terrible pounding in his skull. Reaching over to the bottle of painkillers, his use of which had become all too regular, he swallowed one, and felt the pain subside. For now.\n\nEverything seemed to cause the migraines these days. Council meetings that ended in shouting matches between his advisors. Reports of military discontent and confusion. Even perhaps, the Tsar thought, punishment from God for his many sins. He wasn't even free from them while sleeping anymore.\n\nWhen he had first marched into Vyatka all those years ago, he could not have imagined that things would be this way. He had grown on stories about the wonders of the monarchy and the power of the Tsar. He now knew them to be lies. His government was divided, his army was paralyzed, and his people were deprived. And very often he felt as if he had no power at all, an observer along for the ride.\n\nBut those stories of glory and power had always been accompanied by very serious talks of duty. He had a duty to his people and to Russia, and those simply could not be abandoned, no matter how much he sometimes wanted to leave and return to Brittany or somewhere farther afield.\n\nHe was the Tsar, and he had his duty.\n\nWhich, for now at least, involved rousing from bed and preparing for the day."
 VYT.27.a: "A noble burden indeed."

 VYT.28.t: "The Toll"
 VYT.28.desc: "Despite the power of the position, and the critical role it plays in state security, it is a near universal truth that border guards are both underpaid and often extremely bored, and Vyatka's border guards were no exception. But there was one benefit to the position - one that would be loudly denied were any officers within earshot.\n\nEvery so often, at certain crossings known to be amenable and at times when certain officers were known to be on duty and others known not to be, specific trucks would approach. Pulling up to the gate, the driver would smile at the guards and, when handing over his identification and manifest, would also include an envelope.\n\nThe guards would then inspect the papers and manifest and return them, the envelope having somehow disappeared. They would then open the gate, and the truck would drive through, it being trusted that the goods on the manifest were in fact the goods in the truck.\n\nYes, being a border guard meant consigning oneself to low pay and mind-numbing periods of inactivity. But the value of that one benefit could compensate indeed."
 VYT.28.a: "And so corruption spreads."

 VYT.29.t: "Berezniki Blues"
 VYT.29.desc: "Alexander Kazembek, a White Russian émigré, first became involved in politics prior to the Second World War as the leader of the Young Russians. Encompassing beliefs from across the political spectrum, some quite radical, many struggle to understand its, and by extension his, ideology and ultimate ambitions.\n\nDespite this, he was a loyal follower of the Tsar during the West Russian War, and following it was rewarded with the governorship of Berezniki. Berezniki, a frontier territory surrounded by radicals, was eventually pacified by Kazembek and his followers, and despite all likelihoods to the contrary the territory, now a viceroyalty of the Mladorossi, has both survived and thrived.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Tsar's representative, Boris Skosyrev, have described both significant industrial developments as well as the sustainable exploitation of local natural resources. These resources, including critical oil and petroleum products, are regularly dispatched back to the Principality, under the careful political supervision of Kazembek himself. Thus, he is crucial both to maintaining peace in and delivering resources from the region, and as long as he does that, carefully supervised by Skosyrev, he will maintain his position.\n\nDespite this, however, suspicion from members of our government towards Kazembek continues, and many say that his resource deliveries will continue only until he sees an opportunity to fully divorce himself from the Tsar's authority. For now, though, Kazembek's true motives remain unclear."
 VYT.29.a: "Would he dare turn against us?"

 VYT.30.t: "The Mladorossi Betrayal"
 VYT.30.desc: "Boris Skosyrev, the Tsar's official representative in Berezniki, looked out the windows of his office and watched as the soldiers of 'Governor' Alexander Kazembek approached at speed.\n\nIt had been long feared that, one day, the independent-minded Kazembek would stop listening, answering, and sending resources to the central government in Vyatka. And that day had now come. The Okhrana's report, and warning, on Kazembek's imminent display of disloyalty had arrived by special messenger less than an hour ago. Far too late to do any good. But just long enough to allow him to burn everything of value.\n\nHe signed. Kazembek had never been an agreeable choice as governor. His belief in the syncretism of monarchist ideals with communist influences was not only laughable, but also a starting point from which today's ending was inevitable. He just hoped that the Tsar would be able to reclaim the rogue territory before the religious fanatics to the north or the ideological fanatics to the south moved to claim it.\n\nTurning away from the soldiers, Skosyrev tossed one last document into the fire beside him, hefted his pack, and checked the rifle by the door. He might not have wanted to see this day, but he had planned for it. A route through the forest had been scouted, and a boat by the river concealed. If he was lucky, he would reach the border with Vyatka shortly, and if he was luckier, he would be permitted to accompany the army on its return to Berezniki.\n\nSkosyrev smiled at the thought. He wanted to be there when Kazembek was hanged."

 #Okhrana chain
 VYT.31.t: "Vyatka Confidential"
 VYT.31.desc: "Valentin and Yevgeny, agents of the Okhrana, were confused as to why they had been called to investigate a murder. The crime itself was not particularly rare in Russia, and was typically the responsibility of the ordinary police. Yevgeny was the first to arrive, and it took him only a few moments after proving to the suddenly skittish police officers who he was to understand why he had been called. Arriving later, Valentin understood similarly quickly.\n\nThe existence of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the Tsar, had recently been discovered. The dead man, an official from the Ministry of Finance, had had his name flagged in connection to it, and having been assigned to the task force looking into the cell, they both knew, immediately, that there had to be a connection. Why this man had been killed, and by who, was still unclear.\n\nBut to do so was an enormous risk on the part of the cell, and there had to have been a reason. A reason that could be identified, understood, and followed. A reason that could, in time, lead them to the resources and connections of the cell, and thereby destroy them."
 VYT.31.a: "This could be more important than it seems."

 VYT.32.t: "Investigating the Leads"
 VYT.32.desc: "Valentin and Yevgeny began their investigation by searching the house where the body had been found. Following the training they had been given by Smyslovsky's instructors, they first moved to determine the place and instrument of death. That, at least, proved simple.\n\nThe man had been shot from behind in the kitchen by, judging from the wound, a small caliber pistol. The casing was bagged and would be examined to determine the type and origin of the gun. The next step was to look for evidence that might connect the man to the cell, in order to trove the suspicions of him that had arisen before his death.\n\nThis was similarly found in a box of letters. Amongst the many sent to the man from family and friends, one stood out. Sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka," an import/export company that operated throughout Western Russia, it indicated that the man had been involved in moving unspecified cargo for them in and out of the industrial city of Izhevsk.\n\nAnother such letter indicated that he had recently facilitated the purchase of a small warehouse for the company here Vyatka itself, and had specifically ensured that it was in a lesser-traveled part of the city. Both were promising leads, but the agents had to choose which to follow themselves."
 VYT.32.a: "Go to Izhevsk immediately."
 VYT.32.b: "To the warehouse, then."

 VYT.33.t: "Warehouse Clues"
 VYT.33.desc: "Following several days of surveillance, Valentin and Yevgeny concluded that the warehouse was deserted. So convinced, they quickly broke the look on one of the doors and entered. Inside, the cavernous space was mostly empty, and so the agents began searching the office for shipment records.\n\nIt did not take long for them to discover a lead. Amongst the many mundane manifests, a series of shipments between the Kachestvennaya Dostavka warehouse and locations in Izhvesk were found, all facilitated by the same man - Koronovanny Byrukho.\n\nAlthough the agents suspected the name to false, after noticing it in several other documents they retreated to the Okhrana offices to pour through official records. Before long, they discovered it again - in a register of addresses. Without delay, they set out to find the man with the strange name."
 VYT.33.a: "Let's follow the trail."

 VYT.34.t: "Searching the Residence"
 VYT.34.desc: "The residence of "Koronovannyy Bryukho" was anything but. The small house, though well-kept on the outside, was nearly bare inside, containing only the most bare necessities and little else. To the trained eyes of Valentin and Yevgeny, this meant one of two things. Either the man was an extreme ascetic or, more likely, this was a safe house.\n\nLeveraging their training and experience, they began searching the house for clues, physical or otherwise, and it did not take long before they found a well-concealed false floor panel. Underneath, a ladder descended into a crudely excavated cellar, and inside they found what they had come for.\n\nOn a desk covered in maps and folders, one in particular stood out. Stamped 'Confidential - Plan Eagle,' the papers inside the folder seemed to describe an upcoming sabotage operation against an industrial plant in Izhevsk, using materials shipped from the warehouse they had investigated earlier. Knowing time was of the essence, the agents gathered up the folders and returned to the Okhrana headquarters. They needed to report to Smyslovsky immediately."
 VYT.34.a: "Finally, something concrete."

 VYT.35.t: "The Izhevsk Connection"
 VYT.35.desc: "Within the Principality, the industrial city of Izhevsk is well known for its many factories that persist even in the face of German bombing. Amongst them, none were more important than the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, and as Valentin and Yevgeny arrived in the city, they knew that if the plot did extend here, the plant was likely to be at least one of its targets.\n\nThe link between the deceased official from the Ministry of Finance and Izhevsk was one that had to be pursued, regardless of any other obtained information, and so the agents spent their day investigating every associate the man had had in the city. Other Ministry agents were gently interviewed, companies he had worked with were contacted, and offices he had worked in searched, all to no success.\n\nHowever, there remained several specific factories that had been identified in his letters, and which could still be explored. Perhaps additional leads could be found there."
 VYT.35.a: "Continue the search."
 VYT.35.b: "Alert the local authorities on the sabotage plan!"

 VYT.36.t: "Factory Explosion!"
 VYT.36.desc: "This factory, just like all the others that Valentin and Yevgeny had investigated during their time in Izhvesk, was busy. And, just like all the others, careful searches of its records had turned up nothing of interest. That changed, very suddenly, when an enormous explosion rocked the building, heaving the floor to one side and throwing the agents down to it.\n\nKnowing that the timing of the explosion was too perfect to be a coincidence, and further knowing how fortunate they truly were to be on site at the time of it, rather than arriving after the fact, the agents scrambled to recover. Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby. A figure that appeared all too calm.\n\nCalling out to Valentin, Yavgeny drew his weapon and rushed towards the figure. He knew, in the way that only an investigator can, that the figure was involved. He would not let it escape."
 VYT.36.a: "He has to be part of the spy ring!"

 VYT.37.t: "Suspicious Activity"
 VYT.37.desc: "Deciding to eschew investigating contacts of the murdered official and focus upon the identified plan of sabotage, Yevgeny and Valentin informed the local Okhrana bureau of the discovered plot.\n\nTogether with local agents, they assembled and dispatched small teams to many of the city's most important factories, in order to look for suspicious activity and, if detected, take immediate action. Joining one of the teams themselves, the agents found themselves watching one such factory, the primary target listed in the plan discovered in Vyatka.\n\nWith long-developed and well-practiced skills of surveillance, it was not long before Yevgeny first saw the figure first approaching, and then entering, the factory. Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge. The figure immediately took off running.\n\nAs Yevgeny and Valentin began to give chase, the local agents moved to take care of the device, and Yevgeny gave thanks that the agents had been there to assist. He didn't want to think about what might have happened had they not been."
 VYT.37.a: "Catch him!"

 VYT.38.t: "The Chase"
 VYT.38.desc: "Noticing Yevgeny's approach, the figure had taken off running through the factory complex, using the myriad pipes, machines, and other obstructions to break line of sight and attempt escape. But if the figure thought such would work, he had clearly never been chased by the Okhrana.\n\nChasing the figure across a floor, through an emergency door, and down the stairwell beyond, Yevgeny was able to, for the first time, catch a good look at his quarry. The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides. Fit enough that he was pulling ahead of the agent.\n\nAs Yevgeny emerged into the cold Izhvesk air, Valentin following closely behind, he knew that he would have to make a decision as to the best way to catch the likely saboteur."
 VYT.38.a: "Continue running behind him."
 VYT.38.b: "Split up and try to cut him off."

 VYT.39.t: "The Saboteur Escapes"
 VYT.39.desc: "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. Unfortunately however, and although he pushed his body to the limit, the saboteur continued to pull ahead.\n\nAs they approached the exit to the factory grounds, the saboteur grew even more distant. Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace. This was a major defeat."
 VYT.39.a: "A dead end for the investigation."

 VYT.40.t: "Early Retirement"
 VYT.40.desc: "Yevgeny and Valentin stood in the office of their superior, knowing what was about to happen. They had both seen it happen to others, many times before. But, just like those others, they had always believed it would not happen to them.\n\nTheir superior heard their recounting of events. How they had been on the scene during the Izhvesk attack. How they had detected the saboteur. And then how, unforgivably, they had allowed that saboteur to escape, robbing the Okhrana of the opportunity to interrogate them and discover other members of the cell. They were dismissed soon after\n\nIt took several days before the decision was actually made, but all knew what it would be. The services of Yevgeny and Valentin would no longer be needed. They had proven themselves unable to protect the Tsar and his nation, and the Okhrana did not tolerate failures in its ranks.\n\nNow civilians, the agents would need to find a new purpose in life. A purpose that did not involve a world of secrecy and intrigue. They had shown that they did not have the skill for it."
 VYT.40.a: "In this environment, success is a necessity."

 VYT.41.t: "The Agents Reprimanded"
 VYT.41.desc: "Although the attempted bombing of the Izhevsk factory had been foiled, Yevgeny and Valentin were met with a cold reception upon their return to the Okhrana headquarters.\n\nOn the surface, it had been a good week. A major attack, an attempt by a foreign-sponsored, anti-government cell to destabilize the Tsar's country had been detected and defeated. But the saboteur had escaped, and with them went any chance the Okhrana had of further penetrating, and thus defeating the cell itself. The Okhrana was not known for being kind to those who did not complete their missions to the fullest, a classification Yevgeny and Valentin found now applied to them.\n\nThey would not, despite their achievements, be acknowledged as respected defenders of the nation. No, they would be reassigned to desk jobs in a regional office, far away from capital or any investigations of importance.\n\nThey would still serve the Tsar, of course, but in a manner more befitting of their 'skills.'"
 VYT.41.a: "The Okhrana does not suffer fools."

 VYT.42.t: "The Saboteur Caught"
 VYT.42.desc: "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. As Yevgeny pushed himself and his body to the limit, the saboteur tried to create obstructions behind him to slow the agent down. That was a mistake.\n\nAs he ran, Yevgeny heard, in his mind, the voice of Smyslovsky cursing out another agent for doing the same thing. Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints. They found themselves smiling at each other. This was a major victory."
 VYT.42.a: "He will talk. They always do, eventually."

 VYT.43.t: "Moderate Success for the Okhrana"
 VYT.43.desc: "The day after the factory explosion, it was important news. A terrible accident, the rough newspapers and static-filled radio stations proclaimed. But what was to the public an accident was a far more serious affair to the Okhrana.\n\nThe successful capture, and subsequent interrogation, of the saboteur allowed the Izhvesk Case, as it became known, to become the foundation by which the Okhrana moved against the revolutionary cell that had been identified some time previously. As an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."
 VYT.43.a: "Sometimes, sacrifices must be made."

 VYT.44.t: "Massive Win for the Okhrana"
 VYT.44.desc: "In a nation ravaged by civil war, espionage is a critical tool of the state. Equally important, however, is that state's defense against the espionage of others. Evidenced by their rapid, decisive, and successful action, clearly few were more skilled at providing that defense than the Okhrana.\n\nThe Izhvesk case, as it became known, was later used as a textbook example of exceptional fieldcraft. Yevgeny and Valentin had acted, using both training and intuition, to rapidly pursue the leads obtained from investigating the deceased official. In so doing, they not only prevented a serious terrorist attack at a critical manufacturing facility, but also captured the would-be saboteur for interrogation.\n\nInterrogation that soon led to the arrests of others, members all of an experienced and dedicated subversive cell. The destruction of which did much to protect the state while simultaneously blinding and blunting the efforts of its enemies.\n\nThe agents themselves were richly, if covertly given the classified nature of the entire operation, rewarded. Both elevated in rank, they worked to shape their respective departments, increasing their efficiency and skill at defending the state and, through such efforts, the Tsar himself."
 VYT.44.a: "Men must work for the Emperor, not against him."

 VYT.45.t: "Always Another Job"
 VYT.45.desc: ""Wetwork" was the term used for a number of the many less-savory tasks that the Okhrana was responsible for. Thus, becoming both skilled at wetwork, whatever it may be, and even better at keeping the confidence of just what was done was the primary method of acquiring the capital needed for internal advancement. This was a system that Yevgeny and Valentin did use, and had used, to great effect in their careers.\n\nSometimes the tasks were simple. Intercepting communications, raiding suspected safe-houses, interrogating denounced dissidents, and the like. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry. Almost to a one, those men were never seen again.\n\nYes, the Okhrana valued efficiency, and Yevgeny and Valentin had mastered the art of being so, through training, practice, and long hours of actual work. What else could one call the feat of securing the critical lead in an offensive against a foreign-sponsored insurrectionist cell?\n\nWith every task completed, with every enemy neutralized, Yevgeny and Valentin advanced just that much higher in the Okhrana's hierarchy, their ultimate aim to serve and protect the Tsar, no matter the cost or consequences."

 VYT.46.t: "A Day in the Life of Yakov Rivkin"
 VYT.46.desc: "Carefully, gingerly, Yakov Rivkin placed the two candles into metal candlesticks, themselves treasured inheritances from his father. In twenty minutes, the sun would set, work would cease, and the Sabbath would begin.\n\nStriking a match, he moved to light them, the warmth in his hands reminding him of his wife and family, as well as feelings about them that he had thought long forgotten. As the candles took the light, and as the sun began to set, shadows began to dance around the room. The two points of light in front of him became blazing towers, calling him to prayer before the eyes of the Lord - and before the day of rest began.\n\n"Blessed are You, Lord our God," he began, drawing his breath deep and closing his eyes, "King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles."\n\nThe Sabbath had begun, but Yakov did not open his eyes. He thought of the Jews of the world, so many stolen away. He thought of his wife and children, turned to ash. And as he began his final blessing, he could not stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks."
 VYT.46.a: "A silent prayer against the din of the world."

 VYT.47.t: "The Attack"
 VYT.47.desc: "Hearing the exclamation from behind, Yakov Rivkin thought he knew what was about to happen. The men of the Russian Protective Corps, an antisemitic band of thugs masquerading as a monarchist militia, had taken to harassing him on the street, aware of his heritage. They would insult him, block his way, and most generally act in whichever fashion caused him the most trouble. But today was to be much different. Much worse.\n\nAs they moved to surround him, he moved to walk away, but for the first time one of them grabbed his shoulder. Tightly. By the time he let go, Yakov was surrounded. And then the insults began, and Yakov grew scared. This time, they not only came faster but were also more screamed than spoken.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known scion of an uptown family that was close to the Tsar, withdrew a strip of bacon from his pocket and offered it to Yakov, only to watch him shake his head in reply.\n\nAnother of the thugs laughed. "Boris," he began, speaking to the scion, "I think the dirty Jew doesn't value your generosity." Before Yakov could speak, could try to deny the man's words, Boris had pulled a club from his belt and swung. As Yakov fell to the ground, clutching his head in pain, the rest of the men withdrew their own clubs and began swinging as well.\n\nWhen they had finished, and begun searching his body for gold, rubles, or other valuables, Yakov was unconscious. Those on the street did not intervene, scared of the influence of Boris' family.\n\nBut from a discreet corner, however, a camera captured the scene and the faces of the perpetrators. In monochrome to be sure, but also in clear definition."
 VYT.47.a: "There will be a reckoning."

 VYT.48.t: "Imperial Response"
 VYT.48.desc: "Tsar Vladimir sat in stunned silence as Boris Mozhayev, the son of one of his senior councillors, recounted his actions.\n\nThe publication of a photo showing him, along with several others, brutally beating one of his Jewish subjects had spread like wildfire, and while the Tsar had always known the young man to be an idiot, he had not previously known him to be a virulent antisemite. The connection between the young man's father and himself was being spoken about more and more, and Vladimir knew he had to take action, and quickly. When he said as much, the young man's eyes went wide.\n\n"Sire," he began, voice trembling, "I know I have caused you both injury and concern. But I beg you to grant mercy. If not for my sake, then for my father's, who fought with you all the way from Brittany to your palace here." He swung an arm towards the window. "Our family has always been supportive of the crown, and if you grant mercy I pledge that my father, and I after him, will always be indebted to you, regardless of need. Please, majesty, do not let the matter of one Jew undo all that we have done for you."\n\nVladimir considered his words for a long moment. He had to show contrition for the injured man, of course. But Mozhayev's family was influential, and to make enemies of them, after so many years of loyalty, could inspire others to ask if their own long loyalties would be similarly treated so poorly. After a moment, he spoke.\n\n"Fine. I will be merciful. This time. It will not happen again. And now you may leave. We are busy." Falling over himself with gratitude, Mozhayev rapidly retreated as the Tsar called for a secretary to compose a letter to the injured man.\n\nHe hoped it would be enough."
 VYT.48.a: "But is it enough?"

 VYT.49.t: "Protests in Vyatka"
 VYT.49.desc: "From the desk in his study, Tsar Vladimir could hear the crowds outside, calling for a stronger response to the attack on Yakov Rivkin.\n\nThough they had remained peaceful, and there had been no reports of disorder from the guards watching them, he wished they would go away. He didn't think his migraine would stop until they did. Opening a desk drawer, he withdrew another painkiller from it, swallowing the pill quickly. A knock on the door a moment later refocused his attention, and he called the visitor to enter. Roman Gul, the leader of the reformists, stepped inside a moment later.\n\n"Yes?" the Tsar asked, unable to hide the exhaustion from his voice. "Does the Council need something?"\n\nGul shook his head. "No, sire, not currently." He smiled and spread his hands. "They just asked me to check on you. We all know how difficult this is." A flash of embarrassment crossed the minister's face. "I wanted to say that we are all confident you did the best you could in an unexpected situation. In the Russia I remember from childhood, nobody would have even considered protesting for the rights of a Jew."\n\n"Times are different now," the Tsar replied sharply. "Clearly."\n\nGul nodded. "Yes, sire, they are. And for the better, I would say. Even if things could have perhaps been handled better at the start, I, we, know that you will do the right thing."\n\nGul opened the door again and, with a quick bow, stepped outside, leaving the Tsar with his thoughts, the sounds of the crowd outside, and his migraine. It would not stop pounding.\n\nHe opened the drawer again, and withdrew another painkiller."
 VYT.49.a: "How does an emperor do the right thing?"

 VYT.50.t: "The Emperor's Collaboration"
 VYT.50.desc: "EMPEROR FOUND AS COLLABORATOR!\n\nInvestigating further the circumstances surrounding the assault of Yakov Rivkin and the continued lack of punishment for Boris Mozhayev, the Vyatka Tribune has discovered shocking levels of past, and potentially present, collaboration with the German Reich at the highest level.\n\nIt is no secret that Tsar Vladimir III, ruler of the Principality and claimant to the Russian throne, assisted the forces of the Reich during the West Russian War. He has claimed, however, that such assistance was not wholly voluntary on his part. Documents obtained by the Tribune make it clear that such claims are false.\n\nCopies of messages passed between the Tsar and German representatives in Brittany, the Tsar's former residence during his years of exile, detail the story of an ambitious monarch willing to compromise both his ideals and the security of his country in the pursuit of personal power.\n\nDocuments have been reprinted in their entirety within...\n\n(continued on page 2)"
 VYT.50.a: "An avalanche builds."

 VYT.51.t: "Damage Control"
 VYT.51.desc: ""This is a complete mess," Roman Gul said, tossing the latest edition of the Vyatka Tribune onto the desk in front of the assembled palace functionaries, "and the Tsar wants its dealt with. Now."\n\nYears ago, Gul had worked for several Soviet and other publications, and that had apparently been qualification enough for the Tsar to appoint him to run damage control.\n\n"For now," he began, "revoke the Tribune's credentials and respond to any inquiries about the story with a claim of slander." Some of the functionaries began to move about. "And then," he continued, "schedule interviews with their primary competitors. We need to get our side of the story out."\n\nTo the staff arrayed around him, Gul projected confidence. But inside his own mind, he knew there would be no victory here. The allegations were out, their damage already done. And further claims were already being made.\n\nThe Tribune, along with many other anti-governmental publications that had coalesced around it, had begun publishing stories about the Tsar's family. About other aspects of his character. About Gul himself, once he was thrust into the maelstrom.\n\nHe knew that, eventually, he would be able to stop the flow of negative press. Every newspaper required access to the government to function as anything other than a seditious newsletter, and the Tribune was no exception. They would learn that in short order. But it was the time before that happened that concerned him.\n\nAnd the only person who could shorten that period, by going straight to the source of the whole matter, was the Tsar himself. Gul only hoped that he would make the right decision."
 VYT.51.a: "At least someone is doing their job right."

 VYT.52.t: "A Different Approach?"
 VYT.52.desc: "Tsar Vladimir sat at his desk, and looked at the letter in front of him. The last few weeks had been a hell unending. The press, the Council, his subjects, and even the few 'ambassadors' within the Principality had not let him escape, even if for a moment.\n\nFirst it was the attack on Rivkin and his handling of Mozhayev. Then it was his connections with the Germans while living in Brittany. And then it was his response to those events themselves! If it had not been for the loyal service of Roman Gul, Vladimir did not think he would have made it through. But the councillor had shown his dedication, and given him good advice, besides. Advice that now rested on his desk.\n\nHe had written a personal letter to Yakov Rivkin. He had spoken of his failures, of his regrets, and he had humbly offered compensation while asking the man for forgiveness. It would get out and be reprinted, of course, and he would be again hounded for his attempts at mitigation. His attempts at concealment. But still, the Tsar knew in his heart that sending it was the right thing to do. He knew that he should have done this from the start\n\nAs a migraine yet again began to develop, however, a part of him rebelled. Why should he, a Tsar and proud member of the house of Romanov, debase himself in front of a commoner? Why should he not burn this letter now, and treat this matter with the same disdain that his family would have done fifty years ago?\n\nHe knew he had to make a decision. The migraine was killing him.."
 VYT.52.a: "Send the letter."
 VYT.52.b: "Burn the letter."

 VYT.53.t: "A Letter in the Life of Yakov Rivkin"
 VYT.53.desc: "Dear Mr. Rivkin,\n\nEsteemed Citizen of the Empire,\n\nSeveral weeks ago, you were attacked by miscreants in the streets of our capital, an event you no doubt remember with great pain and anguish, the cause of which was your ethnicity and religion. As your sovereign, we apologize in the name of our crown, as well as for the callous letter, not written in our hand, that we sent without serious thought.\n\nIn the time since we have vacillated between denouncing the hatred that harmed you and protecting our own position, and we would like to apologize, in the same fashion as above, for the same.\n\nWe also realize that our apology will likely have little meaning to you unless accompanied by action. We will therefore take it. For you and your family, we shall compensate for whatever loss was incurred by the attack. For you personally, we shall give a position that my Imperial authority shall protect. For all the Jews in our Empire, we shall denounce the hatred that has, for so long, harmed their livelihood and survival.\n\nOur trusted advisor, Roman Gul, had implored us since the beginning to do the 'right thing.' A nebulous concept for a monarch, who must not dwell in the morals of their actions, indeed.\n\nHowever, I dedicate this last paragraph to you, not as your Tsar, but as one person to another. I do not know if you will find this letter sufficient, but if you will allow me the opportunity to redeem my past actions I promise, in the presence of the God we both venerate in different ways, that I will try.\n\nSigned, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov."
 VYT.53.a: "A semblance of justice."

 VYT.54.t: "Greener Pastures"
 VYT.54.desc: "Yakov Rivkin turned to look one last time at the forests and rivers that surrounded the city of Vyatka, the capital of the nascent 'Empire,' as well as his home of many years. But it was no longer.\n\nWith one arm still in a sling, he hefted a large leather case, containing both of his father's candlesticks as well as everything else of value he possessed, in the other. The wind that blew through it had once reminded him of his home of long ago. Of his past family, once again. His life had changed once then, and it was changing again now.\n\n"Yakov!" a voice called out, "Don't go ahead by yourself!" Beside him walked Rahel, a widow of the West Russian War and, as far as he was concerned, an angel sent by God. She laughed at the sight of him. "Your arms are not fully well yet, Yakov," she admonished. "Here. Let me help." Taking the suitcase from him, she turned to look at the city as well. She had cared for him when no-one else would, and when he had told her of his plans, she had asked to come. An angel sent by God.\n\nThe journey to their new home, wherever it might be, would be long and dangerous. But Yakov was not scared. He had kept faith with God for so many years, and God had kept faith with him in return. Though he would have liked to remain.\n\nThe callous, curt letter that the Tsar had sent came to mind. Yakov understood, and indeed believed, that the Tsar himself held no hatred for him or his people. But the court had made it clear that antisemitism was still alive and well amongst Russians. And so he had to leave.\n\nTurning his back on the city for the last time, and with Rahel at his side, Yakov began to walk towards his new life."
 VYT.54.a: "Perhaps he will find a better home."

 VYT.55.t: "The Firebrand"
 VYT.55.desc: "Surrounded by confederates within the National Union of Solidarists (NTS), it was nevertheless clear to any observer that Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn stood above them in both vision and support.\n\nNo matter where he went, Aleksandr, a man of humble origins, was congratulated on his achievements. In truth he had achieved much in his leadership of the NTS, assumed upon the rapid 'departure' of his predecessor to the Komi Republic following one too many failed gambits.\n\nToday, however, he was addressing a party conference, and as he stepped up the podium his audience waited for their charismatic leader to speak. But even they did not expect him to speak so clearly about the future, and eventual goal, of the party as a whole.\n\nHe spoke about the many, myriad flaws of the communist regime. He spoke about the many, myriad flaws of the old empire. And then, at last, he spoke about a vision for the future. About a Russia reborn, built upon a strong foundation of nationalist pride and military strength, striking out to reclaim all of her constituent lands.\n\nBy the time he was finished all in attendance, himself included, could not but be certain that Russia would, inevitably, return to glory once more. And that the NTS, under Solzhenitsyn, would lead that charge."
 VYT.55.a: "The path to reclamation is difficult."

 VYT.56.t: "The Reformer"
 VYT.56.desc: "Roman Borisovich Gul was once again on the streets of Vyatka, campaigning with his followers for democracy and minority rights - and ignoring the ever-present danger of German bomber raids. Marching towards the city centre, he made sure that all those who saw him knew that, fundamentally, he was calling for equality within the Principality.\n\nAs his march continued, he was heartened by the many citizens who expressed their support and admiration for his efforts, directly or otherwise. He hoped that, one day, Tsar Vladimir would say the same. Though he did not expect it would come soon.\n\nFor Roman, who had supported this agenda of reform ever since the establishment of the Principality after the West Russian War, leading these marches, and calling for these reforms, had become second nature. Indeed, even if he did not believe his actions to be groundbreaking, he knew that if he could just earn the favor of the Tsar and his ministers, real change could be brought to Vyatka.\n\nThe shadow of authoritarianism would be dispelled by the light of democracy, and through the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, Russia could honor its past while at the same time marching towards its future."
 VYT.56.a: "A noble goal."

 VYT.57.t: "The Sage"
 VYT.57.desc: "Placing the finishing touches on a document, Vasily Vitalyevich Shulgin looked out the window of his office, and watched people walking and cars traversing the city centre of Vyatka.\n\nHe intended for the proclamation he had just finished to be read by all the people of the Principality, and potentially also by those elsewhere in Russia, and so it had to be perfect. So few still alive remembered the times of the old Romanovs, having succumbed to age, Bukharin's communist propaganda, or the violence and war that had consumed Russia, and Shulgin believed it his duty, his purpose, to spread that knowledge once again. In his mind, if he could do so, if he could show the people an alternative to instability and strife and a pathway to greatness, he could help promote the eventual restoration of the Tsar's authority over all of Russia.\n\nAfter hours of review, Shulgin inspected his document one final time. A proud declaration of the resilience of the Russian people and the glory of monarchism, it would no doubt bolster the morale of the Principality's citizens. Shulgin was no propagandist, but he well understood that, in hard times, the people needed to be reminded of both the dedication of their Tsar to them and the similar dedication expected from them in return.\n\nShulgin believed, with every fiber of his being, that the only thing that could save Russia was a return to the empire he had once lived in, and to the strong central authority of the Tsar.\n\nWith deep respect, he signed the document and left it on his desk. He would send it to the printing shop tomorrow."
 VYT.57.a: "A return to the ways of old."

 VYT.58.t: "The Reich Lands on the Moon!"
 VYT.58.desc: "Crushed under decades of oppression, poverty, war, and terror, there is very little that can still shock a Russian and thus capture their attention. And yet such an event has occurred - it has been announced that the Reich has landed a man on the moon, extending the reach of humanity within the solar system.\n\nAlthough many within the government and nation, surrounded as they are by destruction and want, have taken this as yet another reminder of how far Russia has fallen, not all are reacting similarly. Indeed, others are being galvanized to action.\n\nOne of these others is the Tsar himself, who has read numerous reports about a sudden surge in interest in scientific pursuits, aeronautical engineering, and other elements of higher education among the populace. He has consequently encouraged expanded instruction in these fields, as much as is reasonably possible, in the Principality's schools.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe, just maybe, one day a Russian will make it to space as well."
 VYT.58.a: "One day."

 VYT.59.t: "The Sovereignty of Western Russia"
 VYT.59.desc: "For the third time, Tsar Vladimir fixed his collar, even though he knew none would see it.\n\nHe had just finished recording the address to his nation - now the Sovereignty of Western Russia - and he looked to the technicians for confirmation that it had been properly collected. As they nodded in reply, too focused on the electronic equipment to show correct respect, the Tsar rose and exited the room.\n\nAs he walked down the hall, he wondered how many millions would hear it. All Russians in his own lands would, of course. As would those, and others, in America, Japan, Germany, and Italy, when it was rebroadcast later in the day. But would it reach those Russians to the east, spread out from the Urals to the Pacific? Would the rulers there, who had largely consolidated their own realms, allow it to be? He hoped so, even if he knew the opposite was likely to be true.\n\nBut he also knew that, in time, he would reach them. Monarchism had not been popular in Russia for a long time, and yet he had triumphed here. He had made people believe in him. In the dynasty. He would help them to believe as well.\n\nHe returned his attention to the moment. Campaigns to the east were far in the future. There were still many issues to deal with here, ranging from debates of the future of democracy, to remnant partisans of the many nations and ideologies crushed under the Imperial forces, to the ever-present disputes over trade and commerce.\n\nVladimir knew that many more hard choices would have to be made to solve both them, as well as other problems. He just hoped he was ready to make them."
 VYT.59.a: "With great power comes great responsibility."
 
 VYT.60.t: "The Spymaster"
 VYT.60.desc: "The building was nondescript, and the office within it unadorned. The man who stood in the doorway was unremarkable. The desk that he looked at was itself unembellished, a plain wooden block with a faded mat on top. But there was one element atop it that kept his attention - a small bronze plaque engraved with a name: Boris Smyslovsky.\n\nTo anyone else this building, this office, would have been unacceptable, but to Smyslovsky, the newly appointed head of the Tsar's Okhrana, it was perfect. It was the culmination of decades of work, two wars, endless political machinations, and a most regrettable collaboration with the Germans besides. But all of that was in the past, and he only had eyes for the future.\n\nMoving to sit behind the desk he began picturing the items that would soon cross it. Maps. Lists. Numbers. And more. Despite the mundane appearance of building, desk, and man, all three would soon become involved in some of the most momentous work in all of Russia. At that thought, Smyslovsky cracked a rare smile.\n\nOh yes. He was going to love being the head of the Okhrana."

 VYT.61.t: "From Distant Shores"
 VYT.61.desc: "As the small transport ship pulled into a Persian harbour, none took notice of the grey-haired and bewhiskered old man who had paid the fifteen dollars necessary for passage, but not the twenty necessary for a cabin. If they had, they might have noticed both a fire in his eyes and a surprisingly muscular figure that his somewhat tattered clothes could not entirely conceal.\n\nNikolay Rumyantsev was a man destined from birth to be a soldier. Born in the days of the old Russian Empire, he had seen the corruption and rot present in his homeland and could not accept it. Unable to stomach the army of his country, but still wanting to fight, he had therefore joined the French Foreign Legion.\n\nMarching from one desert fort to another, making friends and enemies alike, he in time saw France as his new home, and did not ever think he would return to Russia. But the war changed everything. With German victory came a malaise in the Legion, and once more Rumyantsev eventually found himself adrift. He had considered finding some other small war to die in, but defeat had awakened something long forgotten. He was a soldier, yes, but he was also a Russian.\n\nWhen word reached him of Tsar Vladimir's return, and the establishment of a monarchist state in Russia dedicated to fighting communists and fascists alike, he realized, eventually, that he had to return to the land of his birth, find his Tsar, and serve him in one last war.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, he would die as he had lived: fighting."

 VYT.62.t: "Broken Wing"
 VYT.62.desc: "On a moonlit winter morning, the sky shook with the roar of a hundred engines. It was not an uncommon thing in the Russian Anarchy to hear planes overhead, but they usually heralded the arrival of Luftwaffe bombers hellbent on destruction. The sirens would sound, civilians would seek shelter, and the soldiers would fire their rifles to try and scare the enemy away. Once the Germans had had their fun, the damage was surveyed. Factories would be repaired, the dead would be mourned, and life would carry on. But not today.\n\nToday was a day of clear skies and a contented people. The planes of the Imperial Air Force soared overhead, smoke trailing behind them as they crossed in the air, every maneuver met with a series of gasps and applause by the audience below. The display had been planned in the Tsar's honor, a show of the nascent air force's strength, but it also served as rare entertainment for the people of Vyatka. All non-vital workers were permitted to attend at no cost, though the nation had certainly given up a large share of fuel and spare parts for the event.\n\nUnfortunately for the man of the hour, the air show was a nerve wracking experience. Tsar Vladimir was proud of the fleet of planes at his command, one of the largest in Russia, but he was under no illusions as to the reality of the situation. Shoddy pre-war fighters were piloted by undertrained airmen that seemed only seconds away from crashing into one another at any given time. It was a miracle they had managed to get so many planes in the air without a disaster.\n\nStill, even as Vladimir's fingers dug into the arm of his chair, he could not deny the beauty he saw in their potential. Maybe with the right funding and training, this meager convocation of eagles could learn to rule the skies."

Each stood ready with a rifle in hand, anxiously waiting for a signal they had already heard a hundred times that day.\n\nThe whistle blew. The soldiers moved as one. Sprint to the far wall - keep your guns up. Don't stop until you've hit solid cover. Breathe. Watch your flanks. Stack up on the door. The man at the front blows out the hinges. Point man kicks in what's left and leads the way in. The stack follows one at a time. Two stay by the doorway to watch for any surprises. Each movement is controlled, precise. Practiced. Eyes on every angle, guns at every corner. All except for one.\n\nA cold metal barrel pressed against the neck of the point man. "Bang, you're dead," came the dreaded rebuke. "You're all dead. You're fucked. Do you know why?" The men looked to their boots or to the sky, but none dared look Lieutenant Matveyev in the eye. "You're fucked because you're acting like common soldiers instead of Imperial Commandos. You clear the house the same way ninety nine times. The whistle blows, you run, you stack up, you breach. You let it become routine. So on the hundredth time when your dear Lieutenant is waiting in the cupboard instead of down the hall, what happens?"\n\n"We... get fucked?" came a nervous voice from the back of the gathered soldiers.\n\nLieutenant Matveyev laughed. Maybe they'd be special forces material yet. "You get fucked. Good. Get back to the start. We're running it again.""

 VYT.64.desc: "It was thankless work to labor in the rain with rust-eaten saws and chipped axes, but it was necessary work, too. For Alexiy and Kirill, it was the only work they had known since their conscription. Tearing down derelict buildings to salvage the material, digging trenches and shoring up whatever defenses they could - anything to fortify Vyatka's borders against the threats that lurked without.\n\n"I don't know," Alexiy said, "Wasn't it a bit... bigger, before?" The young conscript wasn't wrong. The old bunker had seen better days. The underground foundations of the shelter were truly sprawling, a maze of holdfasts fit to house more than a hundred men. It had taken them the better part of a day to clear the rubble from where the roof had caved in. Now the bunker would be home to whatever men could be spared for sentry duty and the roof was a series of logs coated in mud to help keep the rain out.\n\n"It was," Kirill replied. "But it'll have to do. We're not made of concrete." Supplies were always spread thin in the Russian wasteland. One learned to make do with what they had if they wanted to survive. In fort building, that meant using old Soviet installations. If there wasn't concrete available, you looked for solid stones. If the stones weren't stable, wood made up the rest. And when there was nothing left but dirt, trenches were dug and lined with bags full of the very same soil.\n\nTheir current project was a sight better than when they had first arrived. What had started as a pile of shattered concrete and rusted metal lugs was now a half respectable redoubt on Vyatka's northern border. It wouldn't stop a determined assault, but for the purposes of making would-be raiders think twice it was adequate. And adequate would have to do."

Most likely, though, it was because scores of them were now trying to kill him.\n\nThey had poured across the border in waves, making a mad dash towards the trenches that guarded Vyatka's eastern front. Visily had seen them first and raised the alarm. Visily had been shot in the neck shortly thereafter. The rest of the garrison manned their positions. Isaak's ears were ringing, but he could see that his fellow soldiers were firing. So he fired, too. He squeezed the trigger. Pop. He squeezed it again. Nothing. Was the gun jammed? He looked at his rifle in confusion. Oh, the bolt. He needed to cycle the bolt. He did. He fired again. A Nazi fell over. They were running away. Had they won?\n\n"CEASE FIRE!" Sergeant Ismaylov screamed. "We are low on ammunition!" Isaak wished to ask the Sergeant how this was possible, but then there was a pop and half of Sergeant Ismaylov's head was missing. Blood. Brains. He threw up. The others were yelling. More were coming? He looked over the top. They were getting closer. How many? He lifted his rifle again. Hands were shaky. Pulled the trigger. One fewer, now. He remembered to cycle the bolt. Squeeze. Click. Nothing. He looked to the others. He needed more bullets. More bullets to kill more Nazis.\n\nThey were all empty. Isaak's ears were still ringing. His comrades looked scared. They had run out of bullets before the Nazis had run out of Nazis. What do we do, they asked. Isaak did not know. He said what came to his mind. "Fix bayonets!" They looked confused. Maybe they didn't hear him. He said it louder. They fixed bayonets. Then they were over the top. Rushing forward, screaming, rifles raised. Closing the gap. The Nazis did not want to be stabbed. The Nazis fled."

He could not recall once having a full night's sleep since establishing his fledgling empire in Vyatka. There was always some matter or another that required his attention. The Luftwaffe's terror bombings were a threat they could not yet contest, and though the men of the Imperial Army watched the borders it was all too often that they bled for it. That was not even to mention Vyatka's internal issues -- from endless bickering about the monarchy's future role to a shattered economy, the keys of power had to be carefully managed. So it was that in spite of a torturous migraine, the Tsar threw off his covers, dressed, and answered the door.\n\n"Your Majesty," the flustered guardsman said, "I beg your pardon for the interruption, but there is a man outside demanding a personal audience. He refuses to leave, he will not see reason."\n\nVladimir frowned. Such strong willed petitioners were not unheard of, but they usually 'saw reason' at the end of a rifle if they did not relent. Were his own Life Guards afraid of a single persistent agitator? "And why have you not made him leave?" the Tsar asked with poorly concealed annoyance.\n\n"Your Majesty, the man claims he was a member of your cousin's Imperial Guard."\n\nThat gave him pause. Such survivors were few and far between. Those that had not defected to the Bolsheviks had fought them in the bloody aftermath of their revolution. Many had started new lives as émigrés. More had died. If this man was who he said he was, what did he seek?"
 VYT.66.a: "Let him in. I will speak to this man."

 VYT.67.t: "An Audience with a Ghost"
 VYT.67.desc: "Stepan Alexandrovich Novikov had not been what Tsar Vladimir expected. He was a weathered remnant of the past, leaning on a long defunct rifle to support his weight. He was missing two fingers on his left hand and another on his right. His beard was grey and comically uneven, as if he had tried to groom it for his audience. Most quaint of all, the old man was quite talkative, a trait not often sought in guards nor appreciated in the presence of emperors. Since introducing himself he had hardly paused to breathe.\n\nStepan spoke of his pride at being selected for Tsar Nicholas II's Imperial Guard. He spoke of his disgust as hundreds of his compatriots abandoned their monarch in the face of revolution. He spoke of his relief that he might fight for the Tsar again in the White Army, then of his sorrow at their bitter defeat. He spoke of his refusal to serve the Union and his time as an émigré in France. He spoke of his return to Russia when France fell. He spoke of long years spent in a motherland that no longer felt like his own, watching it be torn apart first by oppression and second by invasion. He spoke of the thousands of men and women he saw die for a regime that did not value them. He spoke of war and slaughter and collapse, of a shattered Russia in need of hope. He spoke of trying to join the monarchists in the West Russian War only to be captured by Soviets before he could. He spoke of imprisonment and hard labor and torture. He spoke of the daring escape that nearly cost him his life and his journey to Vyatka. He spoke until Vladimir interrupted him.\n\n"What is it that you would ask of us?"\n\nStepan finally paused to take a breath."
 VYT.67.a: ""Your Majesty, I would serve in your Life Guard.""

 VYT.68.t: "An Emperor's Confidant"
 VYT.68.desc: "It was raining in Vyatka. Though the sounds of the storm would normally be soothing it had become torturous for Vladimir. The Tsar's frequent migraines had worsened as of late and every droplet landing on his window was like a fist to the head. Wasn't it enough that he had to deal with vicious shouting matches and dire budget reports during the day? Could his nights not be his own? Thunder struck again. Vladimir would find no respite in his chambers. He rose from his bed and grabbed his cigarette case. Maybe a walk would help.\n\nThe halls of the Imperial Residence were sprawling, if sparse in decoration. It was laughable to call it a palace, an honorific that Vladimir had refused to bestow upon his current seat of power. But it was his, every splintered stairwell and every faded portrait. Would that be his legacy? Dust gathering on his likeness in some forsaken hall?\n\nThe Tsar's musings were interrupted by a familiar voice. "Your Majesty," rasped Stepan Novikov with a well practiced salute. "Is everything alright? The hour is late."\n\nThe newest and oldest member of Vladimir's Life Guard was nothing if not vigilant. In the weeks since his induction he had proven more than capable of performing duties that men half his age complained about. Vladimir considered his question. What harm was there in being candid with a man sworn to him? "No. My head is fucking killing me."\n\n"Shall I send for the doctor, Your Majesty?" There was concern in his eyes. Genuine.\n\nVladimir waved a hand dismissively, drawing a cigarette out from its case and offering it to his venerable protector. "No. But you can smoke with me. And you can listen.""
 VYT.68.a: "Uneasy is the head that wears the crown."

 VYT.69.t: "A Visit to the Front"
 VYT.69.desc: "One could never rest easy in the Russian Anarchy. This was as true for the individual as it was for the state, and nowhere was this more apparent than on Vyatka's eastern border. Past a series of bunkers and trenches lay the vile fief of the Aryan Brotherhood. They had grown bolder lately, and though their advances had been checked each time there were inevitably casualties. So it was that the Tsar and his entourage journeyed to visit the men that guarded the Empire from unspeakable horror.\n\nVladimir's advisors had protested his choice to visit the front. It was dangerous, they warned. They had protested even more at his choice of escort for the event. They did not think Stepan Novikov was fit to protect him. There were many younger and stronger men that would gladly give their lives for him. But Vladimir did not need the vigor of youth at the border. He needed a watchful eye and a careful ear. Stepan had both.\n\nThe outpost was ready for his arrival. Vyatka's flag flew proudly outside the barracks, and at its foot two score soldiers stood at attention -- the noble defenders that had repelled an Aryan raid only two days earlier. The Tsar walked past them one by one, offering a warm smile or a firm hand on the shoulder. It was a solemn affair nonetheless. He did not doubt that each man there had lost a friend to the front. As he continued down the line he saw a soldier reaching into his pocket. A gift?\n\nThen Vladimir was on the ground. A series of pops. Screaming. He tried to stand. Blood. So much blood. His own? No. The gunman was wrestled to the ground. A dozen men surrounded the Tsar. But not Stepan. Where was Stepan?\n\nIn that moment Vladimir knew whose blood stained his clothes."
 VYT.69.a: "A Life Guard's final sacrifice."

 VYT.70.t: "A Life's Valor"
 VYT.70.desc: "It was raining in Vyatka.\n\nIt was fitting for the skies to weep on such a sorrowful day. Stepan Novikov, Life Guard to Tsar Nicholas II and Tsar Vladimir III, had performed the ultimate sacrifice. Because of his vigilance and quick action, the Emperor still lived. The old soldier's funeral was a grand affair, a public event that saw the streets of Vyatka swell with mourners. Soldiers lined the roads, guarding the carriage-led procession on its journey to the Imperial Residence.\n\nVladimir knew he was expected to speak at the end of the procession. But all he could think about were the moments that should have been his last. The pops. The screaming. The blood. Stepan's blood. A noble man that had searched over four decades to serve the rightful Tsar. A brave man that had died only months after he found what he was looking for. What could be said about him that would do justice to such a soul? What could be said that was not already clear by his deeds? In the brief time Vladimir had known Stepan Novikov, there was one immutable tenet that guided him -- service. Service to his Tsar, to his Motherland, to its people. He gave his all to what he believed in.\n\nAs the funeral procession drew closer, Vladimir walked to the edge of his balcony. He saw the rain beating down on buildings with leaky roofs and walls without enough insulation. He saw hundreds of soldiers marching in jackets that were too thin with rifles that were too old. He saw thousands of men and women following them with worn out shoes and empty stomachs. He saw the future of Russia. He saw Vyatka. He saw a country in need of service. A country that he would serve.\n\nVladimir stood at the podium and prepared to speak."
 VYT.70.a: "We gather today to honor the life of Stepan Alexandrovich Novikov..."
 
 VYT.71.t: "Break It Up"
 VYT.71.desc: "Tsar Vladimir III sat within his office in the Imperial Palace of Vyatka. He awaited the arrival of the leaders of the Principality's political factions, as he had called them together to discuss the future of the nation. At twelve o'clock he heard the raised voice of Solzhenitsyn coming from behind the doors. The man was a shrewd politician, of that there could be little doubt, but by God was he loud. The doors to his study swung open as the three most powerful men in Vyatka strode into the room. Solzhenitsyn had, thankfully, quieted upon entering the room. They greeted the Tsar and took their seats.\n\n"Welcome gentlemen, I thank you all for coming," the Tsar began. With the usual pleasantries out of the way, Vladimir spoke again. "As you all are well aware, we are poised to begin the reclamation of Russia within the coming months. However, if we are to have any chance of success in this coming trial, we must go forth as a united front. The traitors and cultists that surround us will use any sign of division among us to bring about our demise. I implore each of you, set aside your differences for the time being. All of our efforts must be towards the pacification and unification of Russia."\n\nFor a moment he could see hints of surprise on their faces, unused as they were to the firm tone he used. Roman was the first to find his voice, "I am sure I speak for us all when I say that we would be happy to put aside our differences for the betterment of Russia." Shulgin and Solzhenitsyn nodded as he spoke, though Solzhenistyn seemed reluctant to do so. "However, my Tsar, we all understand that the status quo is unsustainable in the long run. There must be some resolution once West Russia is in our hands."\n\nVladimir nodded in agreement, "I agree. When the wars for West Russia are over, we must finally decide the future of the Empire." The meeting would last well into the evening and, as Vladimir prepared to go to his chambers for the night, he downed a particularly large dose of painkillers to mute the migraine he had nursed throughout the day."
 VYT.71.a: "A temporary solution."
 
 VYT.72.t: "Do Your Part!"
 VYT.72.desc: "Aleksandr Igorevich Samarin sat in the living room after a long day of factory work. He leaned over and turned on his father's old beat up radio and listened to the music coming through. After a while, the music cut out for the ad break. Aleksandr was prepared to tune it out before a rousing military march began to play. Slightly startled, he paid special attention to what it had to say.\n\n"Young men of Russia are heeding the call of duty to their Tsar and their country to bring salvation to all of Russia. From the most remote villages to the most bustling cities, young men and veterans alike have joined the Imperial army. In these uncertain times of strife and war, we must remain vigilant. Nazis and communists assail our great Empire and you could be the driving force between victory and slavery."\n\n"Those brave souls who enlist today will be given the chance to serve their fellow man in the grand armies of the Tsar! Build lasting friendships and a sense of brotherhood with their fellow soldiers! Protect your loved ones from the predations of the fascist and communist alike!"\n\n"All those who enlist will be entitled to extra rations for their families along with a pension and assorted other long term benefits. Would you like to pursue an education beyond the rudimentary level? All enlistees will be granted subsidised secondary and tertiary education. Would you like to know more? Then head to your nearest recruiting station today! And remember, service guarantees prosperity!"\n\nAs the ad faded and the music started once again, Aleksandr could not help but be absorbed in the thought of enlisting. It wasn't necessarily a matter of patriotism, he honestly didn't care for politics, but the benefits were enticing. It would be dangerous, yet he could not help but think of his parents. They were getting on in age and could certainly use the help.\n\nHe would sit there for hours mulling things over before he grabbed his coat and strode into the cold air, his mind made up. Early the next day he was shipped off to boot camp, to fight for the Tsar."
 VYT.72.a: "Marketing at its finest."
 
 VYT.73.t: "The Marching of Boots"
 VYT.73.desc: "Dimitri watched the Imperial Guard march in the streets from his apartment. This had been the first time in Dimitri's life he had seen them so... lively. He was just a worker, barely making a living in Vyatka as a farm hand before coming to work at the Imperial Distillery. Even when he was just a farm hand, the military rarely came around and only to collect taxes or clear bandits. In the city, they acted as more of a police force, but they still weren't rigid to the bone. Now, they were a true, disciplined army.\n\nHe had heard from some of his friends that the factories were being shifted to focus on military production. Propaganda leaflets and radio ads could be seen and heard throughout the city, encouraging young men like him to join. Dimitri had no interest in this, for he wished to live. After all, he had seen the end of the bombings he had had to learn to deal with all his life, he wasn't going to die now after they had just stopped dropping the bombs.\n\nHowever, he also knew what this meant for the city. Vyatka was out in the open and easy to attack. Bandits had not tried to attack the city due to their disorganization and the defenses of the city, but Vyatka did not plan on going against bandits. No, the Tsar wished to go to war with his enemies in the name of restoring his hold over all of Russia. That meant that the city would go under martial law, and the army would protect the city against any foe. He worried that the city may even become a battleground, blown to shreds by artillery shells.\n\nBut there was no point in worrying himself over what could happen, for it would bode well for his mind. His mother always did say the mind was sometimes the greatest enemy of a man, and she was right. He had to keep working, for if he didn't, who knows what would happen. So he went to work at the distillery as soldiers continued to march in the streets, their officers shouting orders at them and war on their very lips."

 vyatka.smuta.1.t: "The Vyatka Parade"
 vyatka.smuta.1.desc: "While waiting for the parade to begin, Vladimir was on the edge of his seat - both metaphorically and physically.\n\nSitting in the front row of a boxy car recently repurposed for the occasion, all Vladimir could think of was what could go wrong. To be fair to him, there were more than enough reasons to be worried. Much of the army was composed of new recruits, fresh-faced boys who hadn't even participated in a parade before, let alone fought in war.\n\nMany questioned the nation's ability to unify the surrounding statelets - not just his enemies, but those within the country, too. This parade needed to prove to them that his army was at least the equal of the others. Success, then, would be critical.\n\nBut as the car began to move along the road, with the crowds cheering, his fear and skepticism began melting into a cautious optimism. Around him, columns of soldiers in freshly-pressed uniforms marched in disciplined unison, the sound of their boots a steady metronomic beat. On their faces was a steely, unbroken, determination. If he didn't know any better, Vladimir would've assumed that this parade was one of a proper European army, or even the Imperial Russian army of old.\n\nThe vehicle stopped before a stage, and the tsar methodically walked up to the lectern. This was deliberate, because while sitting in the car he'd realized that the speech he'd so meticulously planned the night before - filled with all sorts of exhortations to improve - was useless. He went to the microphone, and tapped it once before speaking.\n\n"Loyal citizens. It has been a long wait."\n\nHe let the silence rest in the air, the gathered crowd bursting with anticipation."
 vyatka.smuta.1.a: ""We are ready. It is time to take back our country.""
 
 vyatka.smuta.2.t: "The Soldier's Tsar"
 vyatka.smuta.2.desc: "If you asked him - privately, so that the bureaucrats wouldn't hear him - Vladimir would probably admit that he enjoys this part of the job more than his normal work. Sure, there's something to be said about the intellectual challenge of grand strategy and ambitious plans, but it was incredibly detaching to stay in the palace for long periods of time.\n\nBesides, sometimes Vladimir needed the truth, and there wouldn't be anything closer to the truth than seeing his soldiers firsthand. Or at least he thought that was going to be the case, before he arrived. This particular visit to one of the frontlines seemed so carefully choreographed that the tsar thought he was just another puppet in some child's playset.\n\nMany of the soldiers seemed more awestruck than anything else. Vladimir's mind floated off in the middle of trying to look regal on top of a tank, but watching the steely faces of the men quickly snapped him back to reality. Yes, this work was boring, but the soldiers' task was to fight - to suffer, to die - for their country. He was just here to take a couple of photographs, and raise their morale a little if he could. How difficult could that be?\n\nSo he smiled for the soldiers, gliding and glad-handing through the crowds. Now the formalities were gone, in its place all the affable friendliness he could muster. The conversations flowed naturally, becoming easier minute by minute. He could tell the soldiers were enjoying it, and - really - he did too.\n\nAs he was soon whisked away by his advisors as their time came to a close, he reflected on the singular hour he had spent there. Certainly, it felt a lot shorter. And while he couldn't say that they'd consider him their friend, he hoped they'd at least think of him as one of the people."

The Tsar himself was present, and in full regalia today. His face, stern as a schoolteacher's even on the happiest of days, was now frozen in thought, inscrutable.\n\nWhen everyone was seated, Vladimir began speaking, notably dispensing with the formalities, and reading from his prepared script.\n\n"Good morning," Vladimir began. "Friends, our nation has grown much in these last few years. For that we have much to celebrate. But as we have grown in prosperity and strength, so too have our enemies. This is why we are here today."\n\nHe paused. When he spoke again, his voice was stronger; more forceful.\n\n"For those who continue to defiantly stand against the empire, listen! You may evade us, hiding from Justice long overdue - but you will not escape us forever. And when you are caught - and you will be - you will face the people's judgment of the Imperial Tribunals."\n\nThe gathered crowd rose to applaud, and shouts of joy rang out as the sound of clapping echoed in the hall. Vladimir couldn't help but smile, then took a moment to adjust himself. As the applause quietened and the crowd sat down, he prepared his next words: assertive, but quieter than before.\n\n"Do not mistake us. We are slow to anger - but we will not shy away from our duty to our people. Bandits, collaborators, and communist traitors alike will be judged - but judged fairly! Be grateful: you will not face my judgment but instead the people's fair justice.""

All of this would continue, the young man said, if he just did the right thing.\n\nThese last few hours were very different in tone - and method. He wasn't sure how much time had passed since the interrogation began, but the short bursts of pain seemed to stretch out into eternity, pausing only briefly for the young man to whisper how easy it'd be to make it all stop. It took all his strength to hold out, but his many years of experience had served him well. He would not give in so easily.\n\nSuddenly, finally, the pain stopped. The young man got up to leave. Despite the lack of progress made, he seemed remarkably unworried, even chuckling as he went out. Weak as he was, this unsettled old Leonid, who asked the young man why he seemed so joyful.\n\nThe man paused before turning back around. "Just look at you! So proud, so strong, so defiant. But we've dealt with those like you before: everyone has their breaking point."\n\nHe shook his head in disdain. "You resist, and for what? A dead nation? Your friends, who ran at the slightest trouble? Don't think for a second that anyone will rescue you. Your Communism is as dead as your decaying comrades, most of whom have groveled at our feet. Now then, good night. I trust you will make the right decision."\n\nThe door closed, and old Leonid was left to think alone. Even as he tried to sleep, he couldn't shake the thought out of his head.

He and his colleague had just disposed of an enemy officer in an alley. The initial plan - to 'transfer' the officer to a place where they could more easily liquidate him - had failed, so Oleg went immediately to plan B, which was firing his pistol at the poor man's face.\n\n"What a nightmare, huh?" His colleague exhaled, poking his foot at the dead body. "Chubby man. Too much food: had a lot of blood in him. We should've shot him closer to the ditch. Now moving this fatso's going to be difficult. Hey, can you help?"\n\n"I don't know, man." Oleg replied uneasily. The blood pooled in thick ugly clumps at the corpse's feet: a sweet metallic smell flapped through the night breeze. "It just feels like there's an easier way to do this. Don't we have our prisons, our courts? We can handle them there just fine."\n\nHis colleague stopped and stared at him. "Listen. Let's say we leave one of these men alive. What do you think they'll do? Let me remind you that you are a subject of the very Empire that the Communists tried to dismantle. They're going to go after us! They almost destroyed Russia once before. Given the chance, they'll do it again."\n\nOleg didn't respond, an uncomfortable pause lingering in the air. Sighing, his colleague continued, this time more measured.\n\n"Look, just remember this - it's not like we have a choice. It doesn't seem like much, but our work keeps our country stable. Think of us as society's shield. Remember our guiding principle: all for the empire."\n\nOleg let out a loud sigh, nodded, then bent down to grab the body."

They'd gone from a fiefdom to a proper state in what seemed like the blink of an eye, and this against all expectations, including his own. The communists thought they had killed the empire long ago, that the imperial regime was dead and buried. Instead, like Lazarus, the Russian Empire rose again, returning to its proper place: a miracle if anyone ever saw one.\n\nBut this period of reflection led him to other thoughts, too, the first of which was how much there was still left to do. Certainly West Russia was an achievement, but the greater challenge lay in the years ahead. It was one thing to unify this region - It was another entirely to stretch out their borders across the Ural Mountains, let alone march the thousands of kilometers to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA more immediate concern was that Vyatka's messy politics would rear its ugly head once more. There was no more placating them anymore - the process of making Vyatka a proper constitutional monarchy would need to begin, and so would their first elections need to be held. Vladimir wasn't looking forward to that at all. He'd need to get involved in that business, and plunge his elbows deep into the muck to wrest some order out of it. Unpleasant, but necessary, because what other choice did he have?\n\nHis headache returned - that damned piercing pain in the front of his skull. He got up to find his medicine, resolving to put the thoughts out of his mind for now. After all, these concerns could wait for another day."

 vyatkaexp.1.desc: "For many years Alexander Kazembek and Tsar Vladimir III of Vyatka were political allies. Indeed, it was the Tsar who appointed Kazembek as governor of Berezniki and permitted him to continue to grow the Mladorossi movement there.\n\nAlthough relations broke down some time ago, and Kazembek separated us from the central government in Vyatka, it would appear that the Tsar is determined for his authority to return to Berezniki, one way or another.\n\nWhile we are willing to fight, the Tsar's army is much larger and better equipped than our own, and so the offer for Kazembek and the Tsar to meet and discuss terms was a welcome one. If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

Though the terms reached were not wholly satisfactory to either party, they were enough to establish acceptance.\n\nKazembek has agreed that he and his Mladorossi will return Berezniki to state control, allow us to appoint central administrators to oversee the territory, and will remove themselves from its current government.\n\nIn return, the Tsar will grant amnesty to the movement's members, guarantee equal political participation by the movement in any future elections, without harassment or impediment by state organs and, most important, relax restrictions on the formation and operation of labor unions within state territory.\n\nThough not all are happy with the Tsar's concessions, most agree that a bloodless solution to the situation is far superior to its alternative, and none can argue with the resumption of resource collection from the governorate."

 vyatkaexp.3.desc: "The meeting between Kazembek and the Tasr began tensely, and remained so throughout. No terms were reached, and it now appears that war is all but inevitable.\n\nThe Tsar made it clear, following a military conference soon after his return, that he now formally considers Berezniki a state attempting secession, and has instructed that the government make all efforts to return it to central control as soon as possible.\n\nMilitary units are already on the move towards Berezniki, and before long it is expected that they will meet Mladorossi militias. Kazembek made his choice, and now it seems as if both states will suffer for it."

 vyatkaexp.4.desc: ""Alexander Lvovich Kazembek," the judge began, "you have been found guilty of insurrection, abuse of authority, treason..." The judge continued, his words ending a trial whose outcome had never been in doubt.\n\nSitting across the courtroom, Kazembek listened in silence. He knew that his actions had been right, regardless of where he now found himself. The people of his country needed emancipation from the regimes they found themselves crushed by, and that emancipation would not come at the hands of a Tsar, just as it would not come at the hands of a communist. It would come from what he had strived for: something in between. Unfortunately, Russia was simply not yet ready to hear it.\n\nAs the judge proclaimed his sentence - lifetime imprisonment - Kazembek held his head high. He knew he was right. He knew he always had been, and that he always would be. And one day, when the unmoderated tyranny of the Tsar was ended by the acts of more successful men such as he, he knew would walk to freedom, vindicated by all.\n\nWhen the guards escorted Kazembek, still defiant, out of the room and towards the waiting transport, all eyes were upon him. Nobody noticed the frowning man in the corner, disappointment written on his face. Boris Skosyrev had hoped to see Kazembek hang, but he accepted that he would have to be content with the outcome nonetheless."

He was a caring figure, but that care was tempered with the detachment necessary of a man who had to make momentous decisions. And he was no ardent supporter of the monarchy. At least not yet.\n\nAs talks continued, the real question was soon asked - what would the Tsar have to do to ensure the peaceful integration of the Order into his realm? Antipin replied immediately, clearly having prepared a response long in advance.\n\nTo the south, in and around Perm, lay the lands of the Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a fanatic and clearly insane sect, and one that had long troubled both the Tsar and those protected by the Order. If the Tsar wanted to prove his piety to both God and the Order, if he wanted to prove his dedication to the common people of Russia, he would have to exterminate this abomination, root and stem.\n\nTsar Vladimir carefully considered Antipin's words.

How else could he have made the choice to invade the lands of the Order, sack the Fortress-Monastery, and kill so many of Daniil's fellow monks?\n\nDanill had spent most of his young life in the order, believing absolutely in its holy mission to protect the weak and downtrodden from the jackals that surrounded them. But he had failed. They had failed. And now when he spoke to God, he didn't hear anything in response except the screams of his brothers as the soldiers shot them down.\n\nBut he was still alive, and he would avenge them. It was a long way to Vyatka, through hard terrain and even harder soldiers. But he would make it. He knew he would. He shifted as he felt the rifle dig into his side. It was in Vyatka that the false Tsar made his home, and though Daniil knew he would die, he also knew he had a duty to protect millions of other Russians from the honeyed words and false promises of this hateful Romanov.\n\nHe only needed one shot."
 vyatkaexp.6.a: "He did not even come close."

 vyatkaexp.7.t: "The Grandmaster Refuses an Audience!"
 vyatkaexp.7.desc: "Unfortunate news has been communicated to our representatives, following the dispatch of an Imperial envoy to the lands of the Order of Saint George. The envoy, attempting to arrange a meeting between the Order's Grandmaster Antipin and Tsar Vladimir, was informed that no such meeting would be possible.\n\nThe actions of the Tsar's government, with regards to the reintegration of the Mladorossi movement's adherents in Berezniki, appears to have greatly upset the order, who are militantly opposed to communism in any form. The Tsar's concessions to the movement regarding labor unions seems to have triggered particular outrage besides.\n\nWhile we have attempted to explain the position of our government on the matter, the Order has indicated they are not interested in further communication. Foreign relations between our states are now non-existent, and it would appear that the only way we will secure the lands around Gayny will be through war."
 vyatkaexp.7.a: "An opportunity missed."

 vyatkaexp.8.t: "Challenge Accomplished"
 vyatkaexp.8.desc: "Grandmaster Antipin was deep in prayer when he was interrupted by a brother informing him that representatives of the Tsar had arrived at the monastery.\n\nMoving to greet the visitors, a small party of Imperial officers in several vehicles, he was driven to sudden and apoplectic rage when their leader, after offering respectful greetings, suddenly withdrew a tattered flag from his vehicle. A tattered flag bearing the hooked cross and weighted tricolour of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nFurious that such an icon of blasphemy had been brought to his lands, the Grandmaster only paused when the officer smiled wide. "You don't understand, Grandmaster," he said, eyes twinkling, "this was the first flag of the Brotherhood. Taken from their 'Fyurer's' personal quarters. They're defeated."\n\nAs quick as his rage had formed, it had subsided, and Antipin quickly snatched the flag and tossed into a nearby fire. As it burned, he gave thanks to God that the jackals had been defeated by one so righteous as Tsar Vladimir, and he gave the officer the response he knew the man wanted.\n\nThe Tsar had proven himself worthy, and so the Order of Saint George would join him, for the good of all Russia."
 vyatkaexp.8.a: "A righteous effort."

 vyatkaexp.9.t: "The Legacy of the Swastika"
 vyatkaexp.9.desc: "It had been days since Vadim had last seen the sun. Or had it been weeks? It was easy to lose track of time in the lands of the Brotherhood, after all.\n\nIn the factory, Vadim was forced, day in and day out, to assemble munitions for the vicious men in German uniforms. Sleep was a luxury. Food a boon. A day without beatings nonexistent. On this particular day, however, there were far fewer guards than usual, and Vadim wondered if it had anything to do with the explosions in the distance. Explosions that had been getting closer every day.\n\nSome time later, Vadim realized with a start that the guards, all of them, were gone. The gate was left open. And, as he looked at it, a man in a uniform he had never seen before stepped through. More followed behind, and began spreading through the complex. Stunned, overwhelmed, Vadim stood still, frozen in place. Until, from the highest tower, the one the guards used as a sniper's nest, the flag bearing the hated swastika was cut down, and the tricolour of the Imperial state was unfurled.\n\nVadim fell to his knees, his muscles suddenly weak, and tears streamed down his face. He, along with everyone else in the factory was, at long last, finally free."
 vyatkaexp.9.a: "Free at last."

 vyatkaexp.10.t: "Minority Rights?"
 vyatkaexp.10.desc: "As portions of the Idel-Ural fall under the state's control, along with large numbers of Tatars and Bashkirs, fierce debate has broken out between the factions of our government on the positions of the state towards the twin issues of cultural assimilation and regional autonomy.\n\nThe reformist Kadets, under Roman Gul, point to the long and distinct history of the Turkic peoples, and advise that, so long as they remain loyal to the state, they should be permitted both regional autonomy and the opportunity to practice their cultural traditions absent interference.\n\nThe Conservatives, under Vasily Shulgin, believe that the regions should be integrated as regular governorates, and a policy of general Russification, through education, language restriction, and the banning of certain cultural practices, be introduced.\n\nFinally, the NTS, under Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, has advised a middle path, where autonomy is rejected alongside Russification policies, and with rights to distinct cultural practices enshrined.\n\nAs in many such cases before, the Tsar and his advisors must make the final decision."
 vyatkaexp.10.a: "Side with the Kadets."
 vyatkaexp.10.b: "Side with the Conservatives."
 vyatkaexp.10.c: "Side with the Solidarists."

 vyatkaexp.11.t: "Religious Freedom?"
 vyatkaexp.11.desc: "As the Idel-Ural continues to fall to state control, we find ourselves with not only cultural minories, but religious minorities as well. Large numbers of practicing Muslims now live in our lands, and as an ostensibly Orthodox Christian nation, we must decide what to do with them.\n\nAs usual, Roman Gul's Kadets have suggested that the Tsar's government adopt a policy of complete and total religious freedom for all subjects.\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Solidarists, being founded on the principles of Christian solidarism, argues for a moderate approach, with religious freedom permitted, but with an official acknowledgement of the historical importance of the Orthodox Church, combined with school programs including such in their curricula.\n\nVasily Shulgin's Conservatives, counting many devout Orthodox faithful as well as those holding antisemitic opinions amongst their number, supports enshrining Orthodox Christianaity as the state religion and encouraging minorities to convert.\n\nSo far the Tsar has refused comment. But a decision will need to be made, and soon."
 vyatkaexp.11.a: "Side with the Kadets - Uphold complete religious freedom."
 vyatkaexp.11.b: "Side with the Conservatives - Enshrine Orthodoxy as the state religion."
 vyatkaexp.11.c: "Side with the Solidarists - Acknowledge Orthodoxy as dominant."
 vyatkaexp.11.d: "Listen to the Order of Saint George."

 vyatkaexp.12.t: "The Komi Radicals"
 vyatkaexp.12.desc: "Having served in the Tsar's army on a number of campaigns, Mikhail was well-used to the sound of gunshots. But these were different. Gunshots in battle were rapid and infrequent. Gunshots applied in execution were slow and regular. These were the latter.\n\nSyktyvkar was supposed to have been pacified weeks ago, after orders had come from the government to leave responsibility for the city, apart from the area immediately around Mikhail's military garrison, to local collaborators in the so-called 'Royalist Guard of Syktyvkar.' But still the gunshots continued. Gathering a small party of soldiers, he moved towards the sounds, and as he grew closer his heart began to sink. The gunshots were being joined by screams.\n\nAs he finally reached the origin of the noise, he knew immediately what it was - a cleansing. A party of the Royalist Guard had rounded up a group of citizens and, after short 'interrogations,' executing them.\n\nStorming forward, he demanded a stop to the shootings, and further demanded to know what was going on. The commander just smiled and showed him a pass signed by the city's military governor. The captives were socialists, he said, members and saboteurs of the Revolutionary Front, and he was simply taking care of them.\n\nMikhail could see he had no power here. Were the captives truly socialists? Truly saboteurs? Or were they simply political enemies from the old Republic? Or personal enemies? An order to return to base came over his radio, and with one last look at the terrified captives, he obeyed.\n\nMikhail had once thought that using collaborators meant there would be less bloodshed. He did not want to speak to another one ever again."
 vyatkaexp.12.a: "The cost of trusting in radicals, indeed."

 vyatkaexp.13.t: "Royal Pardons"
 vyatkaexp.13.desc: "As the Tsar consulted with his generals about the upcoming assaults on the final positions of the Russian Liberation Army (ROA), an issue that he had not previously considered was suddenly raised.\n\nMany ROA officers, particularly those among the senior ranks, had been captured in battle. It was being suggested by some that, owing both to their competence and their absolute opposition to communism, they could potentially be recruited into the Imperial Army. The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma. Would he ignore the past of the ROA generals in the interests of pragmatism? Or would he conclude the cost was not worth the reward?\n\nHe had to decide."
 vyatkaexp.13.a: "They are tainted. Let them rot in prison."
 vyatkaexp.13.b: "Recruit our old allies."

 vyatkaexp.14.t: "A Ministry for Kazembek?"
 vyatkaexp.14.desc: "Negotiations with Kazembek continue, and though a deal is close at hand, he has made one final stipulation - a cabinet position, in the government, for himself.\n\nThe demand made sense. The man was a very capable politician and administrator. And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."
 vyatkaexp.14.a: "Agree, and give him a ministry to manage."
 vyatkaexp.14.b: "Refuse, and explain to him why."

 vyatkaexp.15.t: "Avenge the Fallen"
 vyatkaexp.15.desc: "The trial of the Revolutionary Front's senior commanders was held, under the strictest security, in Vyatka. Present were all those who had not died, taken their own life, or fled in disgrace.\n\nTo a man, they were brought before the judge and charged with crimes spanning decades, for some all the way back to he Russian Civil War. The evidence against them, from witnesses and otherwise, was damning, and was supported to great effect using documents, carefully organized and reviewed by the Okhrana, from the archives in Samara.\n\nSeveral of the revolutionaries, long used to bombastic speeches, spoke for hours at length about their own accomplishments, the Tsar's failings, the lack of authority of the court, and many other things besides. But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced. They had sent thousands to their deaths after similar trials, and they knew what was coming. Death, for most. Lifetime imprisonment, for some. Long sentences, for a few, to allay allegations of forced harshness. They had spent their life in opposition to the concept of the Imperial state, and now it was finally punishing them.\n\nAll over Russia, both inside the Tsar's domain and without anti-communists rejoiced. Even if they did not personally support the Tsar, they were at least relieved that, at long last, justice had been served for many of the communist era's worst crimes."
 vyatkaexp.15.a: "The era of the Tsar."

 vyatkaexp.16.t: "The Tsar Visits the Troops"
 vyatkaexp.16.desc: "The 631st Battalion had been assigned to security operations along one of the state's crucial highways towards the Ural Mountains.\n\nSuch a posting involved frequent clashes with bandits, scattered remnants of the Brotherhood, communist partisans, and more besides. Its men had won many decorations, and proved their loyalty to the Tsar many times over. It was thus the perfect unit for him to visit.\n\nEscorted by both bodyguards and senior officers, Vladimir arrived at the battalion's camp in the early afternoon, beginning with a tour of its fortifications and general construction. Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalion's soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."
 vyatkaexp.16.a: "More visits will be arranged."

 vyatkaexp.17.t: "The Berezniki Situation"
 vyatkaexp.17.desc: "Many of the Tsar's generals, several exceptions aside, were veterans from the Russian Civil War. And one thing they all shared was a hatred of communism in every form.\n\nThat made things difficult where Berezniki was concerned. The territory and its valuable resources needed to be brought back under state control, but the way in which to do so was causing debate. The syncretic ideology of monarchism and socialism that its rogue governor, Alexander Kazembek, professed was anathema to the military, and nearly to a man they advised their Tsar to give the order to prepare and execute an invasion.\n\nOther, more moderate members of government believed that those same monarchist beliefs of Kazembek could be appealed to in order to negotiate peaceful re-acquisition of the territory. They did concede, however, that some concessions would be required in order to do so.\n\nIn the end, as in nearly all things, the final decision was made by the Tsar."
 vyatkaexp.17.a: "A peaceful solution can be found."
 vyatkaexp.17.b: "A military solution is required."
 
 vyatkaexp.18.t: "Boris, Bars, and Big Finns"
 vyatkaexp.18.desc: "Boris Skosyrev sat at the bar and ordered his third shot of vodka. His week had been spent traveling through Onega before finally arriving in Helsinki to discuss the Onega situation. After hours of boring negotiations, Boris was glad to relax and have a few shots.\n\nBoris went to stand up and his arm flailed wildly, knocking over the man's drink next to him and spilling its contents all over the floor. "Hey, watch it!" Said the man in Russian, a burly Finn, appearing to be an old vet from the winter war. "You knocked over my drink you stupid Karelian! You're going to pay for that!"\n\n"Karelian, I'm no Karelian!" Boris blurted, drunkenly staggering. "I am the Tsar's Chief Foreign Minister on a diplomatic mission, and I don't need to pay for ANY Finn's drink!"\n\n"Is that so, little Russian?" The Finn said, pulling up his sleeves. "Because back in the war I killed thirty Russians when they tried to take our land. It won't be hard to add one more to that list."\n\n"Thirty, you say?" Boris staggered over to the crowd that was beginning to form, waiting for what Boris would say next. "When the Russian army breaks through Onega, you'll see what Russia is truly capable of! You Finns are barbarians and the enemy of the Russian people! You may kill thirty of our own, but for each Russian killed fifty of your own will fall once we reach Helsinki!"\n\nSome of the crowd gasped, more began to surround Boris as he continued ranting. "So, you Russians are planning on invading us again, huh?" Said the large Finn. "Perhaps if we make you an example, your lot will think twice before invading Finland again.""
 vyatkaexp.18.a: "...Maybe I'll just head back to the hotel."

 vyatkareg.1.t: "The Congress Begins"
 vyatkareg.1.desc: "The Tsar has announced, effective immediately, the formation of the Congress of Vologda, in order to address the continued controversy over his own personal rule.\n\nPromised by the Tsar prior to the campaigns of regional unification, the Congress is intended to determine the first Imperial government, chosen through the election of delegates by universal vote. Three parties have risen to offer their electoral platforms.\n\nThe Constitutional-Democrats, better known as the 'Kadets' and led by Roman Gul, have pledged to run on a platform of liberalization and reform, continuing the development of constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe All-Russian National Union, led by Vasily Shulgin, are expected to run on a much more conservative platform, with a focus on returning to the values and organizational structure of the old Empire, with a strong Tsar at its head.\n\nThe National Union of Solidarists, led by Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, promises national strength and security, of a Russian state secured for Russians under an empowered central government.\n\nThough none can be sure which party will prove victorious, all can agree that the outcome of the Congress will be extremely influential in shaping the direction of the revived Imperial state."
 vyatkareg.1.a: "Let the campaigns begin!"
 
 vyatkareg.2.t: "The [GetYear] Election Results"
 vyatkareg.2.desc: "As the Congress of Vologda progressed, delegates from the various factions made their voices and position heard, each trying to influence the will and build the support of the Russian people. Each was given a chance to speak, and each believed, in their heart, that they would be victorious.\n\nThe Constitutional Democrats, better known as the 'Kadets' and under the leadership of the eternal reformist Roman Gul, pledge to make Russia a place for all its peoples, Russian and non-Russian alike. They promise regional autonomy, the respect of cultural and religious tradition, and the liberalization of the Tsar's regime, believing that to do so would create a state that all could be proud to be part of.\n\nThe Conservatives, under the leadership of the old Imperial bureaucrat Vasily Shulgin, promised a return to the values of the Russian Empire. They vowed to ensure strength and stability under the guidance of a strong and centralized government watched over by an equally strong and authoritative Tsar.\n\nThe Solidarists, under the leadership of the firebrand Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, offered an alternative direction, based on anti-communist thought. They pledged great victories and new glories for Russia and her people, under the guiding hand of the Tsar and his government.\n\nAs the end of the Congress drew near, the millions of votes cast across the Sovereignty were counted, and the delegates waited with baited breath."
 vyatkareg.2.a: "The votes are in!"

 vyatkareg.3.t: "The Solidarists Victorious!"
 vyatkareg.3.desc: "Among the thousands of supporters of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, gathered together in the Congress' grand meeting hall, was a young man named Mikhail.\n\nMikhail had been a Solidarist from the moment he discovered politics in Vyatka, utterly entranced both by Solzhenitsyn's fiery rhetoric and by the grand futures and prosperity for Russia that it promised.\n\nHe had watched as his friends were seduced by the old relics who aligned themselves behind Shulgin, or the effeminate and 'western' weaklings who supported Gul, and he did not understand it. The Solidarists offered the future, and the others offered only stagnation or collapse in turn.\n\nWhen the results were announced, and Solzhenitsyn was proclaimed Prime Minister-elect, Mikhail had to find a place to sit down, overcome with emotion.\n\nEverything he had hoped for Russia, from those early days in Vyatka through the news of Imperial conquest throughout the now-Sovereignty was now about to come true. Solzhenitsyn and the Solidarists, ably helped by men such as he would, regardless of what the failures in the other factions would say or try, bring glory and strength to Russia.\n\nAnd in so doing, claim the future for themselves."
 vyatkareg.3.a: "To glory!"

 vyatkareg.4.t: "The Old Guard"
 vyatkareg.4.desc: "In the grand convention hall in Vologda, Vasily Shulgin sat with his confederates in the All-Russian National Union, awaiting the moment he had been working towards for almost fifty years.\n\nHe wanted nothing more than to serve another who wore the crown of the Tsar, who ruled over a worthy successor to the Empire of his youth, and as the official entered the room and walked to the podium Shulgin could not pull his eyes away. With an almost agonizing slowness, the man prepared to speak.\n\n"By the will of the Russian people," the official said, "the All-Russian National Union shall form this first Imperial government." Concealing his light-headedness, and to the sound of applause from all present, Shulgin took the podium a moment later.\n\n"My fellow Russians," he began, taking care to enunciate each word clearly, "it will be my honor to form this first government, and become your Prime Minister. This is a day of great rejoicing for all of the Tsar's subjects, and for all of those who desire a strong and stable Russia. Together we will re-unify our fractured motherland!"\n\nAs he continued to speak, Shulgin could feel some of the old fire of his youth, fire he thought long gone, return. He knew now that he could spend his final years without regret."
 vyatkareg.4.a: "The old guard returns."

 vyatkareg.5.t: "A Democratic Empire"
 vyatkareg.5.desc: "Far away from the Congress of Vologda, in the city once again known as Perm, Alexander Medvedev sat in front of his small radio.\n\nThe former Red Army soldier and partisan had resumed his life following the defeat of the monstrous Aryan 'Brotherhood,' hanging up his rifle and returning to his previous occupation as a lumberjack. Having now lived under two failed and brutal regimes, he was willing to give the so-called Tsar a chance. So far, as much as he could tell, the Romanov scion had done right by the people of Russia.\n\nHis attention was returned to the radio as the results of the Congress were announced. A victory, in a surprisingly clear majority, for the Constitutional-Democrats, or Kadets.\n\nMedvedev had not expected that. The Soviets had long taught that monarchism was inherently, and inexorably, reactionary. Instead, however, this new Empire seemed to be marching in the opposite direction, towards liberalism and democracy. He was not yet sure what to make of such a change, but he did know that he was looking forward to seeing what it truly meant.\n\nWith that thought, Medvedev finished his tea and went to bed. It was a new day tomorrow, and he had many more trees to cut."

The morning's cases had already arrived.\n\nAs he read the file he silently gave thanks, once again, that the division had been further expanded. When he had begun, there were far, far, far too many cases for himself and the other investigators to pursue, and he knew that malfeasance had subsequently often gone without punishment. While the caseload was still heavy, even now, it was manageable, and that meant he could pay proper attention to those cases assigned to him.\n\nSuch as the current one - describing shockingly negligent actions by one field agent that had cost the state millions of rubles and injured three citizens, besides. Seeing that the agent in question was a repeat offender, Alexei recommended him for immediate interrogation and began arrangements for likely dismissal.\n\nHe looked at the stack of other cases beside him.

As he did so, he saw that he had clearly interrupted a meeting, and seeing one of its attendee's begin to raise a rifle of their own, he held down his trigger.\n\nThe firefight was brutal and, thanks to the effects of automatic weapons in close quarters, extremely brief. When it was over, Andrei counted six dead partisans, among them a boy of no older than 15.\n\nHe swore to himself - killing boys, themselves likely forced into participation, was not part of the plan. But it was what had happened. Placing sentries outside the cottage, he and the others got to work searching for documents, messages, radio frequencies, or anything else that could lead them to other groups.\n\nWord had come down from the top to focus on looking for such, and Andrei was not a man to disobey orders."

Internal security has been achieved, through the efforts of military and security services in combating bandits, partisans, and revolutionaries of all kinds.\n\nAs a result, millions of Russians within the Imperial borders are feeling something they have not felt for a very long time: hope.\n\nThe Sovereignty moves forward into an age where a functional and united Russian Empire is within its grasp. New challenges will be faced, and hard decisions will, as always, have to be made.

However, at the Tsar's direction, the Imperial Recovery Committee has drafted a comprehensive plan of construction and reform.\n\nThey pledge to focus on the repair and construction of domestic industry, the reestablishment of a competent academic base, and the introduction of significant currency and financial reforms. Direct foreign investment will also be vigorously pursued.\n\nThough it will be very difficult, and require hard decisions to be made, the experts of the Committee are confident that, if the course is stayed, their plan will succeed. They further state that such success will not only serve the millions of Russians crying out for prosperity, but also provide the economic base needed to reasonably pursue further unification efforts.

Vast distances, extremely varied terrain, and stronger enemies will be encountered, and the military must be ready to encounter them all.\n\nWe must conduct a comprehensive inventory of our efforts to date, and identify needed avenues of improvement. We must decide, decisively, upon a unifying doctrine for our formations. We must build public trust and support. We must establish support units. We must expand production, train new officers, and update our equipment besides.\n\nClearly, there is much to do. But we are determined and dedicated, and will address each issue in turn. Though painful examinations and admittances will have to be made, with each will come improvement, and when we reach the end of this long path we can be confident in our ability to carry the Tsar's banner all the way to the Far East."

Legitimacy, critical for our claims over the rest of Russia, can be obtained through connections with both the Organization of Free Nations as well as a number of European monarchies.\n\nThe more positive relationships we can build, the stronger our nation will be. With each new treaty, agreement, understanding, and friendship, Tsar Vladimir demonstrates his leadership, and thus his right - beyond bloodline - to rule over Russia in its entirety."

 vyatkareg.13.t: "The Imperial Diplomatic Corps"
 vyatkareg.13.desc: "As an ostensibly legitimate nation, the Sovereignty must open up the world, both in venturing out and in allowing others inside. But to do this, we need the skill and experience to do so.\n\nThat skill will come from the Imperial Diplomatic Corps, newly formed by Imperial and governmental decree. The Corps will act, domestically and otherwise, to improve both the image and the connections of the Sovereignty to any who are amenable to either. They will also, however and of course, focus their efforts when needed on specific goals, regions, or nations that are provided to them, and some such focuses of attention are under consideration.\n\nShould their competence, and our international position, develop sufficiently, it may even be possible to open dialogue with the other regimes occupying Russian territory to the east. It may sound farcical, but if unification could be achieved absent bloodshed, it would be a worthy goal to pursue."

In return, we can offer them not only resources, but a potentially friendly nation closer to their enemies than they.\n\nAs such, we should begin pursuing a positive relationship by establishing trade agreements with the United States as well as other OFN members. Industrial expertise, military equipment, and connections further afield are all potential outcomes of such trade, and all would be useful to our new and growing nation.\n\nWe should, however, remain vigilant.

Advice from the State Department as to a potential response is mixed.\n\nMany support the proposal, citing the reasonably palatable nature of the regime, especially compared to other possibilities. They also identify valuable resources that could be exchanged for American expertise and developmental assistance, as well as the fundamental benefit of carrying the message of the OFN, that of the free determination of peoples, forward.\n\nOthers claim that granting the Sovereignty's government recognition would be premature at this stage, as well as potentially causing diplomatic friction with Germany at a time when tensions are already high. They also claim that, if the Sovereignty were to fail at their goals of reunification, it could be damaging to American prestige abroad.\n\nA decision must be made."

With American recognition and, therefore and in short order, recognition from the OFN, the legitimacy of the Sovereignty and the Tsar has been hugely increased.\n\nEven now, the we are receiving requests from numerous smaller nations to begin trade negotiations.

They have also identified a potential lack of desire on the Americans' part for additional diplomatic tension with Germany, which a recognition of ourselves would certainly provoke.\n\nRegardless of the cause, however, the fact of their refusal remains.

Though they may, in most cases, not hold the direct authority that our Tsar does, they are still monarchs, and among all monarchs there is a common bond.\n\nConsequently, efforts in this direction will begin.

Respectfully shown towards the King's study, where the real discussion would take place, he prepared himself.\n\nKing Gustaf received him warmly, speaking excellent Russian. More warmly than he had expected. It soon became evident that the King greatly enjoyed receiving someone, especially another royal, who was not part of Germany's sphere. Before long, Vladmir knew he had found strong common ground with Sweden, and discussions turned to trade.\n\nBefore days end, the deal had been struck.

Nothing like the skyscrapers. Nothing like the number of cars. And, above all else, nothing like the feeling of tranquility. He wished he could spend more time in this beautiful city.\n\nBut, he reminded himself, he was not here for a vacation. He was here for his people. He was here to obtain both diplomatic recognition and economic opportunity. But progress had been slow, and he was frustrated, no matter how much his advisors reminded him that such was normal when it came to diplomacy. And so his mind wandered towards reflecting on the beauty of Rome.\n\nOne day, he promised himself, Russia would have buildings, cities, like this. Would it have already been possible, had not the communists, and then the Germans, not destroyed everything in their path? If his family had kept their throne?\n\nHe pressed those thoughts aside, and instead pictured a Vyatka dominated by skyscrapers. He liked that thought."

As they did, Skosyrev could tell that Serrano was distant, and he thought he knew why.\n\n"Francisco," he began, "I want this mission to be successful, and so I think I we should address history." Serrano didnot respond as he continued. "That affair with Andorra was many, many years ago. Why, I'm sure the new bishop doesn't even remember what happened! And, you know, if you could help smooth over any lingering feelings from others, I would be most appreciative..."\n\nSerrano's eyes left the road for a moment as he quickly inspected the thickly-wrapped roll of money that Skosyrev had removed from his pocket. "Are you trying to bribe me, Skosyrev?" he chuckled. "Nobody remembers Andorra - I just haven't driven in some time. And if that was your intention, you should have thought harder on it. Russian money doesn't have a very favorable exchange rate." Skosyrev looked down at the bills in disbelief. Rubles! What good was a counterfeiting operation if it didn't even print the right money!\n\nAs Skosyrev cursed his 'reliable' counterfeiter back in Arkhangelsk, Serrano continued driving."

Our relations with nations outside the German sphere of influence, both in Europe and elsewhere, have become much stronger, and we now stand far apart from the many statelets that came before us.\n\nThis increase in international political relationships was also matched by a corresponding increase in economic relationships as well. The vast resources of our lands have found many markets abroad, and both technical expertise and foreign capital flows back to the Sovereignty in return, providing opportunities and prosperity both for our government and for millions of Russians besides.\n\nTruly a great success, and a portent of futures to come."

A rare evening of peace in the Anarchy had allowed the heiress to exhibit her exquisite collection of priceless artwork. She stood, resplendent in a ruby dress, at the center of the gallery. The artwork that surrounded her and the guests were of the finest of Russian artists, saved from the fires of the Nazis of Perm.\n\nMany of the works on display were from the times of the old Tsars. Works from the minds of such great painters as Ivan Shishkin and Valentin Serov, masterpieces of Issac Levitan, and a scant few pieces of the great Wassily Kandinsky. The guests were enthralled by the works around them, some of the oldest among them remembered the grand exhibitions of the old Imperial court that this event tried to replicate. The air was heavy with the nostalgia for the old days, when the Russian Empire stood tall and its people did not bend to foreign invaders. The mood was one of longing, for the best of the old times, and yet under it all there was a current of hope. As the many nobles of the new Empire passed by the art of their forebears, as the longing passed from their hearts, they were filled with a strange resolve. The Russia of their grandfathers had not died, though the enemies of Russia had tried their best to kill it, it was merely asleep in the hearts of its people.\n\nAs Viktoria mingled with the myriad nobility, she drifted to the centerpiece of the exhibition. The final piece that had been saved from Perm, as Vagner's cult burned away the masterpieces of Russia's past. By far the oldest piece on display, and guarded by a brother of the Order of St. George, the icon of Christ the Redeemer. In the hearts of everyone present, the one constant was a desire to redeem the Empire, in the eyes of God and the people.\n\nAs the event came to its end, Viktoria found herself in front of the Icon again, praying that the future was one that would make it all worth it."

 vyatkareg.24.desc: "Deep in the forests around Arkhangelsk Captain Pavel Kirillovich Shepovalov sat hunched around the fire with his men. Pavel had served under the WRRF since the West Russian War, and when the Tsarists had taken his hometown of Arkhangelsk he had vowed to fight to the end, even after the Marshall was forced to surrender. It had been easy at first. The Tsar's forces were overstretched and unable to cope with the guerrilla war that he and other remnants of the Red Army were waging. More recently, Imperial forces had been reinforced and bolstered with new weapons and veteran troops. As a result, raids on Imperial supply lines had gotten more and more difficult. His men were starving and their weapons were running dangerously low on ammo. So, when one of his men handed him a letter from the Tsar himself he didn't immediately throw it in the fire. Pavel broke the seal on the letter and began to read.\n\n"To the valiant soldiers of the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\n\nEven as we are at odds, I cannot help but feel a sense of true admiration for your valor and tenacity. You have continued to fight, against all odds, long after any reasonable man would consider your job done.\n\nI know that you have no reason to trust in the Imperial system, the flaws of the old Empire were many and the people suffered greatly for it. However, I must ask that you lay down your arms for the good of the Russian people. The future of Russia is at stake and in order to lessen the harm on the people we must reconcile.\n\nIn the interests of peace and unity in the Empire I offer to you and all of your compatriots amnesty against all charges that could be levelled against you in exchange for your surrender. You have my word that I will not allow any harm to come to you.\n\nSigned, Tsar Vladimir III."\n\nPavel stared hard at the letter in his hands as he weighed his options. In the end, it was the hunger that gnawed at his gut that forced his hand. He threw the letter into the fire and called for his men to assemble. Their war was over."

The Tsar felt a strange sort of apprehension from the victory of the Conservatives at the Congress of Vologda. While a return to the old ways of his forefathers was an attractive thought, he could not help the apprehension that it brought. The destructive and murderous end of the old Tsardom weighed heavily on his mind.\n\nAs if sensing his fears, Shulgin spoke. "My Tsar, I understand your worries. Though I look on those days quite fondly, I am not blind to the flaws and excesses of the old Empire. We have been given a chance to rebuild and use what we have learned to build a stronger Empire. I know that the transition will be a strange one for us all, until now you have ruled much like your ancestors once did," Shulgin knew all too well of his Tsar's fears. Until the Congress he had been the undisputed power in Vyatka, his every word had been law. To have to give that up would be difficult for even the purest of men.\n\nShulgin knew that, even more than the loss of personal power, the Tsar feared for the ability of his party to protect his people. For all that you could say about the Tsar and his mistakes, one thing that could not be overstated was his care for the people. When he had unilateral powers he could ensure that his people were taken care of directly. Now he had to place his trust in political creatures like Shulgin and his party. "I understand that it is difficult to put your trust in me. You must know that I will do all that is in my power to ensure the prosperity and protection of our people."\n\nThe Tsar sat in silence for a time, mulling over a thousand and more thoughts in his head. He knew that his privileges and powers would be limited going forward, but at the same time the Conservative constitution would give him wide latitudes to ensure his vision of the country would survive. Vladimir looked at Shulgin then and had to concede that, if nothing else, he had the experience to ensure the prosperity of the Empire and its people."

A meeting of the council had been called by Prime Minister Solzhenitsyn to discuss the future of the Empire. The doors of the room opened and the Prime Minister strode in with a small group of party functionaries at his back. Once the usual pleasantries were exchanged he began the meeting.\n\n"Honorable members of the council, I am sure you are all interested in the purpose of this meeting. I have come straight from the latest session of the Duma with news that is vital to this Empire." The councilmembers glanced among themselves with some apprehension. They were usually privy to the goings on within the Duma, but they had been summoned early in the day before any of them could hear news from the session. Solzhenitsyn continued: "As of the end of today's legisaltive session I have been granted emergency powers for unilateral action within the Empire. The Duma has granted me these powers in order to allow the Empire to better end the instability that has ruled Russia for these past decades. Know that I take these powers with much reluctance and will relinquish them when the crisis has passed and Russia has been united under our rule."\n\nSurprise could be seen on the faces of those present. The Tsar himself only just kept his composure as the words left his Prime Minister's mouth. Solzhenitsyn spoke as though a great burden had been placed on his shoulders, but Vladimir could see the pleasure in his eyes. He gave off the impression of a cat that had just caught the canary, A sort of smugness that was at odds with the front he put up for the other men of the council.\n\nDespite the reassuring words that came out of the Prime Minister's mouth, Vladimir could only feel a cold weight settle into his gut. He remained silent throughout the meeting, unable to properly find his voice. When it was all over he retired to his study, to deal with the migraine that troubled him throughout the day."

I'll be in my office."\n\nClosing the door behind him so he could have at least some quiet, Boris peered out the window to watch his workers, who were mostly poor and unemployed peasants who could do nothing else. He just hoped they could execute his perfect plan well enough. This was his best idea yet!\n\nA knock came from the door and his assistant walked in. "Sir, we may have a slight problem. They changed the design of the five hundred rubles, so we're going to have to throw all those out."\n\n"THEY DID WHAT?" Boris yelled. "Let me see that new design." Checking it over, Boris fumed as he noted how the new design was entirely different from the old. "Go tell everyone they'll be working overtime for the next week. I also want all the old ones burned so we don't have any leftover evidence."\n\n"Yes, of course," replied the assistant. "Oh, and by the way, you might want to check the one thousand rubles the guys printed." The assistant handed him one of the notes.\n\n"Is this supposed to be Vladimir! He looks like a little girl!"

Most of the primary three factions were in full attendance, well prepared for the goings on within the Congress. As a hush fell over the buzzing crowd of attendees, opening statements, minutes and other obligatory introductions were made before cutting to the chase -- the three factions laying out their arguments.\n\nThe Kadets began first. Predictably, their rhetoric tended toward reform. They proposed rights for minorities, movements toward a progressive future and most importantly, the creation of a constitutional monarchy with a strong democratic system.\n\nThe VNS, in their own stuffy way, argued their points passionately. Recalling the nostalgia of the old empire, they made it clear they fought for conservative but democratic values. Little arguments for reform could be found among their statement, and they ultimately established themselves as a clear status quo candidate.\n\nNext came the speech from the NTS. Populism, nationalism, freedom and monarchism were their four key sticking points. They made a firm argument towards rejecting the ideas of both liberalism and communism, of holding the Russian man above any such system. They, however, were not without testaments toward democracy; how authentic that claim or its execution is or will be is unclear.\n\nReactions are mixed at current and only time will tell who will get their way."

It had been hard yet simple life, where he didn't have to worry if his head would be shot off tomorrow morning.\n\nHe grew up around the city, on a farm just south of it. Sergey had a happy life, he remembered, until he was forced to fight for the Tsar in the First World War. He remembered how he fought, first for the Tsar, then the Provisional Government, and then the Bolsheviks. He remembered the bleeding, how they fought and lost, and how he had now been forced to now beg on the streets to survive.\n\nThat is why didn't say anything as the Front rose and fell once more, and he remained silent as the Imperial Eagle flew once more over the city. Sergey didn't believe in the communist dream anymore, but these men... they fought for a man who fought with the Germans during the West Russian War; In them, they carried hope. He chuckled to himself as he sat on the street corner, troops marching in the streets. In his life, he had learned one thing, one simple truth: Politicians and Generals fought, but people like him would always be forgotten in the end. However, as he watched those young men smile, he felt conflicted. Perhaps... perhaps they would be different in the end. Maybe an old man's cynicism would be proven wrong.\n\nHe laid back, and as his eyes grew heavy and breathing grew heavy, his thoughts were of home.

Strife and warfare had been constants in his life which he rarely shied away from, yet as he walked down the aisle leading to His Imperial Majesty's suites, a slight feeling of nervousness rose in his chest as he prepared himself for his scheduled meeting. Gul took a deep breath before entering Vladimir's bureau.\n\nIt was like entering another world, one frozen in time: relics of another age presented all around he who dared to enter, Imperial furnitures striking Roman's gaze. And there was his liege, sat at his desk and seemingly having been awaiting the Prime Minister's arrival.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty!" He said, in accordance with Imperial etiquette "I trust that you're doing well today?"\n\n"Prime Minister Gul," Vladimir retorqued in a formal tone "A slight migraine but nothing but nothing too serious. Please, take a seat, I'm sure you have much to tell me."\n\nGul executed himself. As thoughts raced in his mind, Roman started elaborating on his reform plans to the Tsar:\n\n"As I evoked in the past Your Imperial Majesty, we cannot go on with how poorly regarded personal freedoms are in Russia: the people, Russian and non-Russian speaking citizens, is - and should always be - our priority. Each and every one of your subjects deserve better lives, brighter futures, and though much has been done under your reign, absolute rule and austerity measures cannot be the norm forever. Now that Western Russia is stable, I come seeking your blessing and help in enacting a better tomorrow for our countrymen. Lest we fall to chaos and infighting again if their words cannot reach us."\n\nGul wasn't wrong: Western Russia was under complete control and those pesky austerity measures could be loosened, if not removed entirely. Yet, the weary middle-aged Tsar, minding to keep a composed facade, couldn't help but be somewhat worried of how far Roman's reforms will go at the expense of the Crown's power."

Words like "Emergency Powers", "Restructuring from Above", and other authoritarian, autocratic terms flitted across the sheets in red ink.\n\nThe more he looked at it, the more he couldn't help but remember communiques from the past, when he had marched into Russia- and that fact did not put him at ease. "My Tsar." A voice interrupted his private musings, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn took two steps towards him, and the documents he had been handed. "I understand your hesitation- or any concerns, but Russia is plagued with instability; and these measures are an important step to securing everyone's future." Aleksander's words had a certain logic to them- but his tone had cooled, and Vladmir felt a single pang of uncertainty ringing at the back of his mind like a siren, a small little warning bell that kept ringing even as Aleksander spoke. "I assure you, that these reconstructive measures are only for the common good- and that once Russia is unified, these measures will become less restrictive...""

The air has agreed with me much more as of late. Maria has been taking advantage of the clear skies as well. It has been a long time since I have seen her so happy." A rare smile crossed the Tsar's face at the thought of his daughter. Vasily was heartened to see the Tsar in good spirits and felt all the more comfortable talking to him at this time.\n\n"I am glad to hear that your family is well. I am hesitant to take you out of such happy thoughts, but I have come here today for a reason, my Tsar. We must talk about your role in the new government. As we both know, the days of the absolute monarch have come to their end. However, it is imperative that you remain active in the governance of the Empire. You will be a key component of the Imperial government, and will have the final word in the Empire. You cannot simply be complacent on the sidelines." Shulgin, above all else, was a proponent of stability in the Empire. The Tsar was the greatest unifying symbol in the Empire and his wholehearted participation in the government was a key point to ensure stability.\n\nThe Tsar took a moment to gather his thoughts. "I understand my duties, Vasily. I know what I must do for the success of the Empire, but I am only one man. I do not have any desire to manage every aspect of the nation." Vladimir understood all too well what lay at the end of that road, the death and hardship.\n\n"Of course, my Tsar.

I have been elected with the expectation that the people of the Empire, be they Russian or otherwise, will be given the treatment they deserve. The Empire of old was plagued with chauvinism and hatred for the minority populations that helped make it strong. We have a chance, here and now, to build a better state for all of the people of Russia." Ferdinant listened to the prime minister's voice with a sort of detachment. The words he spoke were all well and good, but they were the same words they had heard for generations.\n\nTimur looked excited. Even if he had heard it all before, he was always the most optimistic of them. The prime minister continued, "As I speak, a series of initiatives are being drafted to ensure the liberty of every citizen of this Empire. On the floor of parliament laws enshrining the rights of ethnic minorities in the Empire are being passed.

We are seeing the beginning of a brighter future for all the myriad peoples of the Empire, and it is my greatest honor to help bring the empire to that new future."\n\nTimur was even more excited than usual.

The Tsar's speech came to its end and the crowd erupted into applause. The students in the crowd were excited to begin their path into the world of the sciences. Many of them had been born into the anarchy and were, while more well off than most, unable to acquire more than a simple education. Those of the nobility were better prepared for the days to come, but even they were less well off than their parents had been.\n\nThe faculty were the best prepared of them all. They had all been a part of the old intelligentsia and remembered the days in which Russia was a leader in the sciences. If they had anything to say about it, the scientific community would beg for the attention of Imperial scientists again in the near future."

 vyatkareg.36.desc: "Russia was so fucking cold.\n\nThose were the thoughts of Waylon Anderson, an American PR representative from Anheuser-Busch and makers of Budweiser. He was here to strike up a deal with the Imperial government to gain an exclusive license to export Vyatka vodka to the United States. Just like how Budweiser was the default beer of choice to the American public, Vyatka vodka had become the vodka of choice of the West Russian public. The hope of Anheuser-Busch was that if they secured an exclusive license with the Sovereignty, they would be able to corner the cheap alcohol market in the US.\n\nThat is why they sent Waylon, for he was one of the few PR people who knew a bit of Russian. Waylon had never been to Russia, and only knew Russian due to the fact he studied it alongside German, Spanish, and Italian. Used to the warm summers and mild winters of California, Russia was like a slap in the face with its winter. It wasn't helped by the locals in Vyatka always just... staring at him. He guessed that most had never seen a foreigner in their lives, and they were clearly hesitant around him.\n\nHowever, that did not matter, for Waylon was here for the vodka, not the people. He eventually arrived at the Vyatka distillery, being greeted by a large man shouting "Greetings, my American friend! Welcome to Russia, where vodka drinks you every day!"\n\nWaylon looked at the man, asking "Uh, what?"\n\nThe man looked confused for a second before shaking his head, saying "Oh, sorry, my friend! I meant you drink vodka every day! My English is not good, I am sorry,"\n\n"No, you are-"\n\nSuddenly, Waylon would be hugged by the large man in a nice, warm bear hug. Sighing, Waylon thought to himself."

 vyatkasuper.1.t: "Imperial Triumph"
 vyatkasuper.1.desc: "Bringing his mouth closer to the microphone, Prime Minister Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn prepared to address the nation and briefly exhort the victories of his Solidarist government in the Siberian campaigns.\n\nTsar Vladimir had departed for Omsk, where he was to inspect the captured factory complexes as well as meet with local political supporters who had kept their monarchist loyalties long- and well-hidden under the previous regimes. He would be touring many of the region's cities over the next few days, showing the people that their monarch had arrived to return them to the legitimate Russian government.\n\n"Good evening, people of the Empire," Solzhenitsyn began, "I speak to you tonight of victory in many forms. I speak to you first of military victory, as the last remnants of the enemy state have surrendered to the officers of our brave Imperial Army. I speak to you of economic victory, as production levels of consumer goods have reached their highest-ever recorded levels. I speak to you of social victory, as millions of Russians have been freed from tyranny and returned to their rightful brothers and sisters."\n\n"In the days to come, know that details of these victories will be made clear. Know also that this is not the end. There are more victories to be won - and they will be won. For now, however, be content in the victories themselves, only made possible through your continued dedication and hard work to the state, the Tsar, and to each other."\n\nSolzhenitsyn turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair. He thought he had done rather well."

 vyatkasuper.2.desc: "Tsar Vladimir sat in his dimly-lit office, took a painkiller to deal with yet another migraine, and despaired.\n\nThings had not gone as he had expected. When he had first come to Russia, when he had led his people from the dreary lands around Vyatka to dominate over all of Western Russia, he had been a monarch with power. Real power, like the Romanovs of old. But ever since the conclusion of the Vologda Congress, that power had been taken away from him, piece by piece.\n\nThe Solidarists had triumphed, their message of national strength and reclamation resonating with the - his - people, and Solzhenitsyn had quickly moved to consolidate his government's power, both within the constitution and outside it.\n\n'Temporary' laws were passed in his name, and 'national security' initiatives restricted the rights of millions of Russians. And there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nOh, he gave speeches, visited factories, and presided over the now-defanged Council. But the speeches were delivered to him, the tours were guided, and the Council packed with Solidarist sympathizers. He knew that his ancestors would never have allowed such to happen. But, clearly, he was not like them at all.\n\nAnd so he sat in the darkness, considering who he had been, and who he would never be."

 vyatkasuper.3.desc: "With the state's efforts towards the reclamation of further territory well underway, attention has now been given to enemies that remain within our borders.\n\nAlthough most of the millions of Russians in our nation support the Tsar and his government, there are many who still hold true to previous ideologies. In particular, there remain many adherents to the great cancer that is communism. They must be rooted out, lest the ideology that led Russia to abject ruin and tyranny resurface to do so once again.\n\nProactive measures will be taken. A combination of propaganda efforts and a national re-education campaign, along with a coordinated offensive between the Okhrana, ordinary police, and military forces, will be put into action. Communism will be destroyed, and in its place will be enshrined a new Russian spirit, marshaling the people for the bright future ahead."

Interrogation of these individuals, in turn, provides additional intelligence on others, and as such the pace of our efforts are accelerating.\n\nHowever, we must also report that efforts to secure local support through the use of targeted informational campaigns have proven less successful, and can likely be attributed to anti-monarchist sentiment reinforced by previous regimes. We do believe, however and despite the cost, that continuing them, until such time as they are effective, is a worthy investment. Without constant local repudiation of your government, and with additional economic investment within the region forthcoming, in time support can be achieved.\n\nWe will, in any case, continue to ensure the security of the state.\n\nYours,\nBoris Smyslovsky\nChief of the Okhrana."

 vyatkasuper.5.t: "A Strong Empire"
 vyatkasuper.5.desc: "Although many would term Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a cruel man, the Prime Minister did not think of himself in such a way.\n\nAfter all, the Solidarists believed strongly in community and cooperation, and a natural corollary to that was acting, as strongly as necessary, against those outside that community. Which, to Solzhenitsyn, meant everyone outside of the Solidarist movement.\n\nIn stark contrast, within the movement he was seen as a hero, the one man willing to do what was necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire. To do what was necessary to prepare it for the no-doubt terrible hardships and conflicts ahead. If they had known what he really thought, however, he doubted they would idolize him so.\n\nHe was well aware of his own, and his movement's, mortality. Fundamentally authoritarian, he knew that the history books of generations to come were unlikely to be kind to him. But that was a price he was willing to pay. For the moment Russia needed to be strong. Not good, or equal, or even honest. But strong. Survival was, for the foreseeable future, more important than happiness or freedom.\n\nHe looked out the window, towards the west where he knew the work crews would be moving to build the roads he had authorized earlier that day. Roads that the Imperial Army would, one day, march along towards Moscow.\n\nHis nation was strong again, and soon it would be whole. What anyone thought about him did not matter in the least."

It was far, far less opulent than the one he remembered from many years ago. Perhaps that was the point.\n\nHe rose as the Tsar entered, pausing at the sight of his sovereign in attire other than the official state regalia. Wearing a relaxed shirt and comfortable shoes, he looked almost human. Something that Shulgin knew could not be countenanced outside of these private rooms.\n\nHe watched as the Tsar dismissed his valet, crossed the room, and sat in his char. "Sit, Vasily," Vladimir commanded, a slight smile on his face. Shulgin obeyed.\n\n"Majesty," he replied, "thank you for making time for me. I am most pleased to have been invited to form your government, and I pledge to serve you, and this Empire, faithfully." He could help but feel the weight, the responsibility, of those words.\n\nVladimir smiled again, and Shulgin could not help but, for a moment, see the Tsar as a boy. A boy from a family that he had failed once, long, long ago. A family that he was determined never to fail again.\n\nThe Tsar thanked him, and asked about his plans both for the cabinet and for the nation at large. It was many hours before either of the men left the room."

 vyatkasuper.7.desc: "For the umpteenth time, Roman Gul again reviewed the electoral figures from the Congress. It was as if they were mocking him.\n\nHe and his Constitutional Democrats had been considered the underdogs by all, but they had proven that estimation false, performing far above predictions in nearly every district, from Arkhangelsk to Samara. They had come so close, so close to achieving a position of power from which real change could be promoted. But, in the end, it had not been enough.\n\nThe people had chosen tradition over progress, and it would not be the Kadets, but Shulgin and his Conservatives who would form government. Still, he had thought, not all was lost. Enough Kadets had been elected to constitute a major power bloc, and he had hoped they would be able to both negotiate for positive reform and obstruct stagnation, where possible. And then he had been granted a 'prestigious' appointment in Syktyvkar - by the Tsar himself.\n\nOne could not refuse an Imperial appointment, and so he had packed his bags, made his way to the conquered capital, and assumed his, as he quickly discovered, powerless post. Shulgin had sent him somewhere he could not cause trouble. Could not push his agenda. But even subjected to internal exile, Gul would not allow the ideals to which he had dedicated his life be forgotten.\n\nMany in Komi were facing discrimination, and if he filed his report on time, there remained a chance that someone with real power might do something about it.\n\nHe had gambled on longer chances before."

The effects of those policies have now had time to become apparent, and in working towards the ambitious future he once promised, Prime Minister Shulgin continues to possess my full confidence."\n\n"But we have not yet reached that future, and we must continue working for it. It is a future of reunification of land. A future of reunion of family and people. A future of liberation for millions living under the tyranny of occupiers and false despots alike. It is a future that we will march towards together, united in purpose."\n\n"Indeed, it is a future to which all of you have already contributed. Each of you who cast a vote, whether you be a farmer, laborer, soldier, doctor, politician, or Tsar, proved your dedication to our great nation as it emerged from its chrysalis."\n\n"The last few years have not been easy, and I cannot promise that there will not be similar hard times ahead. What I can promise, however, is that both myself and the Prime Minister will not rest until Russia is reunited, and all our people know the freedom that has now become known to you all.

Beside him, his friend Konstantin was also putting up posters, albeit in a much more relaxed and less proficient fashion. Grigory elbowed him in the side.\n\n"Speed up!" he hissed. "If we don't get this street done within the hour they won't give us another box."\n\nKonstantin shrugged in reply. "I don't know why they're even bothering with this, you know," he said. "Nobody's even reading them. They're not going to stop calling it Sverdlovsk, so why is the mayor even doing this?"\n\nGrigory looked at him in disbelief. "You don't know? How-" he took a deep breath, and hammered another poster into the wall before continuing. "Sverdlovsk is where the Bolsheviks shot the old Tsar. They're planning a big memorial on the next anniversary, and the mayor is trying to curry favor by changing the name back from what they changed it to."\n\nKonstanin looked surprised. "Huh. I thought the old Tsar and his family were hanged in Moscow. At the end of a big trial."\n\nGrigory sighed again. "Well they weren't." He handed Konstantin half of their remaining posters.

That was before he realized that almost all of the new customers were Russian.\n\nAn Udmurt living among the Bashkirs in Ufa, Ven knew well what it meant to be a minority. He was also very practiced at identifying the ethnic composition of the places where he lived. And that practice was telling him that there were suddenly far more Russians in Ufa than there had been only a short while before.\n\nSure, he thought, Ufa had been growing even before reunification, but not enough to attract so much Russian settlement so quickly. So quickly that, if the trend continued, ethnic Russians would constitute a plurality just in time for the municipal elections.\n\nHe looked at the envelope on the counter - a letter from his sister in Izhvesk. He had not returned to Udmurt lands in years, for he had until now very much enjoyed living in Ufa. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god, but he had been welcomed all the same. In Ufa, all those who had lived in the Russians' shadow for so long were welcome to share in the sunlight.\n\nBut now the Russians had returned, for better or worse, and how long would it be before he was once again seen as an outsider in a Russian city? No, he would rather live among people who welcomed him as one of their own, even if it meant leaving this life behind.\n\nThe time had come to pack his bags."

He knew that all would hear his speech. And all would understand the enormity of what it promised.\n\n"Citizens of the Empire," he began, "tonight I speak to you about a great mutilation. A great mutilation inflicted upon Russia by forces both within and without."\n\n"Within by the Bolsheviks, who treacherously killed their Tsar and plunged the nation into darkness with their incompetence, stupidity, and bloodlust. Without by the Nazis, who carved millions of Russians away from their land, subjected them to abhorrent slavery, and stole their, and your, future besides. And I say to you, no longer!"\n\n"The Tsar, and therefore my government, will not rest until we reclaim what is rightfully ours. Until all of his subjects are liberated, and all of his lands, from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok, are reunited and prosperous. This mutilation will be healed. Healed by you. Healed by my government. Healed by His Imperial Majesty!"\n\n"So, people of the Empire, join me in this righteous struggle! God and the Tsar stand with us, and when they join the children of the motherland, marching in unison, we are all, together, unstoppable! Russia shall be glorious once more!"\n\nThe speech continued, but in truth none could hear it, Shulgin's voice being drowned out in a cacophony of cheers."

Destruction of the horrid legacy of the hated Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a necessary task both for Russia and for those who had lived in a once-grand city that could, in time, be grand again.\n\nOn the city's outskirts, Alexander Medvedev returned home, having paid respects to his late wife. As he had every night since the election of Prime Minister Gul and his Kadets, Medvedev prepared a simple meal and sat down in front of the radio. But unlike every night, there was a speech by that same Prime Minister about to be broadcast. And, after a short transition, that speech began.\n\n"Good evening, fellow citizens," Gul began, "I speak to you tonight, as your Prime Minister, to offer a promise. A promise that I affirm before all the peoples of Russia, from Arkhangelsk to Samara, and from Moscow to Vladivostok, that you shall know a better tomorrow."\n\n"My government, working closely together with the Tsar, a man whose dedication to liberation has never wavered, will act to ensure the fundamental and deserved freedoms of every citizen in the Empire. It matters not one's faith, or culture for they, and you, be Russians all. Russians all who will, one day soon, live in peace and prosperity under the Imperial flag!"\n\nThough Medvedev's radio was a simple one, even he could hear the sincerity in Gul's words ring out across the room.

And now, as he observed the new recruits receiving their basic training, he felt a deep melancholy.\n\nHe believed in Tsar Vladimir's cause to secure a future for the lands of his ancestors, but he could not forget the lives that had already been lost in pursuit of it, and of those that would be further lost as that pursuit continued. Especially once the inevitable campaign to secure the German-occupied lands to the west began.\n\nThe boys in front of him were strong men, driven by righteous anger, and they would be well trained. But he knew that they were not ready to face the true depravity of the German menace. Not ready for the meat grinder that they would be thrown into.\n\nBut he would not allow that to stop him.

And he saw it, as he entered the kosher butcher shop, on the face of Isaak, whose eyes brightened and smile widened in a way Yakov had not seen in many years.\n\n"Yakov!" Isaak exclaimed. "How are you, my friend?"\n\n"Better than I have been in a long time, Isaak." Yakov replied truthfully. The days since his vicious beating at the hands of the Russian Protective Corps had brought real change indeed, both to his life and to those of the wider Jewish population of Vyatka. "I'll take the usual again. Rahel and I are having dinner tonight." He looked through the window. "I noticed that the RPC doesn't seem to be around here anymore."\n\nIsaak chuckled in reply as he gathered Yakov's items. "Not anymore, no. The police carted them off a short while ago. The Prime Minister seems to be serious about his promises." He continued as he bagged the goods. "You know, I've started seeing more business since his election. More gentiles, even."\n\nThat surprised Yakov, even if it was most heartening.

As Vladimir welcomed him cordially and invited him to sit, Gul offered his respects, and began to speak.\n\n"Thank you, your Majesty, for this meeting. I know that you and I do not see eye to eye on many things, but I want you to know that both I and my government desire nothing more than to see the Empire brought forward into the modern age."\n\nThe Tsar nodded slowly.

I know that I, or rather we, were not likely your personal preference to form government, but we entirely share your views on the aggressive pursuit of reunification. I must stress, however, that the mistakes of the past, the rigidity of policy that allowed communism and fascism alike to divide Russia, will not be permitted to take hold again. And in order to ensure stability, the monarchy must be seen to be supportive of its government's agenda."\n\nThe Tsar was silent for a long moment, and Gul feared the worst. And then Vladimir nodded again, but this time his expression was more thoughtful. "I understand, Roman" he said, clearly having made a decision. "We shall work together."\n\nThe meeting would continue, but when it ended, many hours later, Roman Gul felt confidence, for the first time in a long time, that things were actually about to improve."

In so doing, all they accomplished, all they had ever accomplished, was to expose the state to subversive agents. To dissidents. To communists!\n\nOnce Gul was through with it, the funding that the Okhrana received would barely be enough to maintain basic operations, let alone run meaningful investigations or recruit agents. What was worse, those still sympathetic to the Okhrana's true purpose had told him that Gul intended to demand his resignation.\n\nHim! He who had build the Okhrana from nothing to one of the most efficient and feared services Russia had ever seen. He who had protected the state and the Tsar from plots innumerous! He who had no intention, whatsoever, of resigning.\n\nBut for all of Smyslovsky's acumen in the world of intelligence, he was no politician, and when he tried to call men he thought his allies in an attempt to avoid the inevitable, none would accept his call.

Better than expected.\n\nGul had proven a most capable administrator, and his dedication to ensuring the stability and prosperity of both the state and the Russian people could not be denied. Vladimir knew that, with or without him, the Empire would expand, and become a better place for all of its people, Russian or otherwise. It would be an Empire in which he would be proud to see his daughter grow.\n\nAs the Tsar thought of that future, however, he also thought of his past. Of the dark days of collaboration. Of decisions made in error. Of the many questions he had asked himself. And he found that he was closer than ever to answering many of them. The Empire had a long way to go, and he had an ever longer road to follow. But he would walk that road, head held high.\n\nVladimir stood, and as he did so, he saw the drawer.

Yet, that idea was being challenged by Gul and his reforms that ever transformed the Russian monarchy into a constitutional one.\n\nThe Tsar and his Prime Minister were both sat on an Imperial styled couch that Vladimir had come into possession of, a memento of sort of a bygone era that he'd never come to know personally.

However, I can assure you that they shan't be taken away in any circumstance, as you remain the Tsar first and foremost, but also because you are a symbol to the people."\n\nVladimir listened with great attention, nodding to Gul's reassurances while a small weight was being lifted off his chest. Perhaps the Prime Minister had not been entirely honest with him and only time would tell if that was the case, but in this instant Vladimir had for the most part utmost confidence in Gul's words."
