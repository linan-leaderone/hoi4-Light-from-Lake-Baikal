  ## Colombia ##
  COL_La_Violencia: "La Violencia"
  COL_La_Violencia_desc: "Colombia has found itself in an intermittent state of violence since the assassination of President Gaitán in 1954. Old grudges and hatred between the Conservatives and Liberals led to a climate of brutality that saw both sides committing hideous crimes as Bogotá was razed to the ground in a pogrom. The defection of sectors of the army to the revolted sides and the mounting radicalization of all militants effectively collapsed the authority of the government over large parts of the nation.\n\nA ceasefire to stop the bloodshed has been in place since 1956 and has been enforced thus far. However, the cracks are showing, skirmishes and the growingly precarious food scarcity are building up tensions that threaten to end the peace and throw Colombia into chaos once more."

  COL_Shoulder_of_Giant: "On the Shoulders of a Giant"
  COL_Shoulder_of_Giant_desc: "Who assassinated Jorge Eliécer Gaitán? That is the question that all Colombians ask themselves, and depending on whom you ask, you will find a different answer. "It was the Church" say the Liberals, "it was the Jews", say the Conservatives. The Japanese, Americans, Iberians, even the Dominicans are blamed for the loss of the beloved caudillo.\n\nOf course, there is a cynical reason behind this. As Gaitán's figure is respected by all, it's used by political actors to invoke legitimacy for their cause and generate hatred against their enemies, who are accused of being the ones responsible for the deed."

  COL_Agrarian_Crisis: "Agrarian Crisis"
  COL_Agrarian_Crisis_desc: "The usual problems of the rural Colombian, its poverty, dependency and exploitation by large landowners have not been solved or disappeared by the civil war, on the contrary, they have made a turn for the worse, a situation that appears to not have any proper solutions in sight.\n\nBesides these old problems, a new one is increasingly growing its importance: food insecurity. The killings, repression and the displacement of the rural population puts our food production in jeopardy and threatens the entirety of Colombia with the prospect of hunger and starvation."

  COL_Sham_Democracy: "Sham Liberty"
  COL_Sham_Democracy_desc: "If you were to listen to the Bogotá government, you would hear its self-praise. The government presents itself as a beacon of liberty and democracy, qualities that its militant counterparts, the representatives of despotism and chaos, lack.\n\nOf course, reality is different. The liberty presented by Bogotá is a liberty in which repression, martial law, rigged elections and political assassinations are part of daily life. This state of affairs is not lost on the common person, who is progressively growing tired of the lies and the fake liberty Bogotá offers."
  
  COL_The_Collapse_of_Colombo_American_Cordiality: "The Collapse of Colombo-American Cordiality"
  COL_The_Collapse_of_Colombo_American_Cordiality_desc: "Colombia and the United States never have been this distant, ever since the neutrality declaration of 1940 and our negative to participate in the American war effort, tensions began to rise between the two nations, culminating in the definite collapse of diplomatic relations by 1956 when the last American diplomat was recalled from Bogotá, leaving the question of diplomatic proximity with our old partner open for the national government to discuss."

  COL_Off_to_a_Fresh_Start: "Off to a Fresh Start"
  COL_Off_to_a_Fresh_Start_desc: "After a successful negotiations process, the United States and Colombia have restored their relations in full and a bright future awaits for this newfound friendship."
  
  COL_Colombo_American_Treaty_on_Friendship: "Colombo-American Treaty on Friendship and Diplomatic Cordiality"
  COL_Colombo_American_Treaty_on_Friendship_desc: "Our coordinated efforts resulted in the restoration of relations with the US in an almost complete level, with most of the pressing issues of our agendas being successfully conciliated, a healthy relationship begins to be consolidated."
  
  COL_Leaving_past_Grudges_Behind: "Leaving past Grudges Behind"
  COL_Leaving_past_Grudges_Behind_desc: "After the negotiations, an initial settlement with the United States of America has been worked out, and while there is still a long agenda ahead of us, it's with great hope that we can say that the rebuilding of our friendship has begun."

  COL_Large_Scale_Offensive: "Large Scale Offensive"
  COL_Large_Scale_Offensive_desc: "With the restart of hostilities in Colombia, the factions involved in the civil war have intensified the offensive with the support of their foreign patrons. The conflict rages across the mountains and the jungles, until only one faction remains."

  # Leader Descriptions
  POLITICS_LAUREANO_GOMEZ_DESC: "Believed by his supporters to be sent by God himself as a scourge to the pathetic democratic establishment, the Basilisk is fundamentally tied to La Violencia, from which he has emerged victorious and fulfilled his goal of punishing 'Jewishness' in Colombia. If he sees anyone interfering with his plans, Gómez will have them murdered, like how the Basilisk turns all those caught in its sight into stone.\n\nA Bogotá native, Gómez began his political career in 1911, and became the leader of the Conservatives in 1932, proving to be one of the most brilliant and potent orators in Colombia. Under him, the party was united but also corrupted - it praised the Axis powers and anti-Semitism, doubled down on its elitist beliefs, and opposed everything the Liberals did on the grounds that it'd lead to the death of Colombia. When Dr. Gaitán ascended to the presidency, all Gómez saw was the majoritarian tyrant he'd been warning against his whole life.\n\nNow the Caudillo is dead, and Gómez is President. Promising to uphold law and order, he has fulfilled his campaign promise. The police and army gun down Liberal protests, Francoist money fills government coffers, and it's an open secret that the fascists in New Granada enjoy government backing. The late Caudillo ruled by passion - Gómez rules by fear."
  POLITICS_GUSTAVO_ROJAS_PINILLA_DESC: "General Rojas Pinilla has shattered Gómez' tyranny, and now stands alone on the peak as the republic's savior, save for the whining of those exiled politicians that call him dictator. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rojas is the Caesar of the Andes, popular defender of Colombia against all radicals, establishment elitists, and foreign puppets.\n\nBorn in Boyacá, Rojas's long military career, including stints as attaché to both Germany and the USA and the intellect behind El Dorado Airport, seemed destined to peak with him rescuing Bogotá from the devil's hands. Aside from pursuing military interests, he has studied the tactics of successful Liberal leaders like Gaitán and Pumarejo. Despite being a military officer, Rojas never liked being Gómez's attack dog, and took his chance to exact vengeance on those who would sell Colombia out to Iberia and the fascist powers.\n\nNow Rojas calls the shots, and seems to embody the reformist caudillo, ruling by decree while pushing progressive change. A mystery is his total lack of alignment; he appears to be courting all three major powers, happily playing them off for the best deals. But whatever his goal, both his supporters and critics agree that he is an ever-smiling patriot who puts Colombia's interests first and foremost."
  POLITICS_COL_LLERAS_CAMARGO: "Having become a rougher and more experienced man after witnessing all the chaos brought by political violence in Colombia, Alberto Lleras Camargo has sworn to himself that he will fix the country once and for all now that fate has put him in charge for a second time.\n\nDespite having the illustrious Lleras surname, Lleras Camargo was born to a humble family. One that needed to be taken care of after his father passed away. Luckily for the young Lleras Camargo his uncles, Nicolas and Santiago, were there. Being taken into their wing ended up being a positive experience, as Santiago took special interest in his nephew's education and constantly tested the progress of the young boy, while giving him access to his library, which cultivated Lleras Camargo's interest in the written word.\n\nThis passion led to him becoming a journalist, and his work both at home and abroad his new career in politics, in which he quickly succeeded, climbing up the ranks and ending as the Interim President of Colombia after Pumarejo's resignation.\n\nAnd now that he finds himself in power again, Lleras Camargo has come to a conclusion. For peace to exist in Colombia he can't act as another caudillo, he would rather die than allow his fatherland to fall again into the violence that caudillismo brings. To heal Colombia and to protect both democracy and liberalism he has to work with the Conservatives, even if his gut tells him to not do it so."
  POLITICS_COL_LEON_VALENCIA: "It seems fitting that one of the men who played a key role in the campaign that brought down Pinilla is now the President of a new democratic Colombia and the leader of a new kind of conservatism.\n\nGuillermo León Valencia was born in the bosom of a wealthy family from the city of Popoyán, being the son of the prestigious poet Guillermo Valencia Castillo. From an early age he showed interest in the human sciences, in subjects such as philosophy, history and the grammar of the Spanish language. He quickly joined the Conservative Party and began his career in politics, becoming with time one of the most important conservative leaders, standing out as a moderate in a party which had increasingly become more pro-fascist and authoritarian.\n\nHaving watched the developments of the least years, León Valencia has come to a conclusion about what he shall do during his presidency to heal the country after all these years of violence. The old conservative political doctrines were wrong, and he will make amends for their mistakes. God commands that stability and order must be brought to Colombia, and to do that he needs to work with the Liberal Party, building bridges with them to overcome years of hatred between liberals and conservatives."

  CLC_Reactionary_Den: "Reactionary Den"
  CLC_Reactionary_Den_desc: "For all the talk about the regime of New Granada being against the degeneracy and chaos of the liberal and Marxist order, the truth is that it Alzate Avedaño's project is nothing more than a den of fascists, reactionaries, spies, mercenaries, arms dealers and other outlaws or lowlifes from across the world that have nowhere else to go.\n\nWhile this has lowered New Granada's political stability to a less than ideal value, it has its benefits. Sustaining and funding the war effort and other activities comes as fairly cheap, and the international connections built by the criminal networks gives the state plenty of opportunities to exploit."

  CLC_Saints_Sinners: "Army of Saints and Sinners"
  CLC_Saints_Sinners_desc: "When building an army to fight for a cause, one could not be enough of a fool to aim for an angelic force that is free from all the earthly temptations that war brings with it, the common case is that men of all calibres and human qualities are sent to the front so as to defend the grand ideals of those who remain behind, however, in Colombia the bar for those admitted to the fight has been set too low, as pillagers, bandits and murderers are abundant among our the lines of every unit. Perhaps when the war ends those who are righteous may find the time to be hailed as saints, but for now their job is to stand side to side with the most terrible sinners this land has ever bred."

  CLC_Back_To_Basics_desc: "In difference from the degenerate and unstable Ariocriollo ideologues, Chairman Schwartau has promised to practice an orthodox vision of National Socialism where more classical views are predominant and its implementation depends on a less altered program from the one that gave Germany its astounding successes in Europe."
  
  CLC_DIN: "The DIN's Ever Present Surveillance"
  CLC_DIN_desc: "The National Department of Intelligence (DIN), has grown to become a healthy branch of political suppression and administrative surveillance, as most of it has been shaped according to Schwartau's experience as an Abwehr agent, the organization is characterized by both its ruthless professionalism and its efficiency in silencing the voices against the league's leader."

  CLC_The_Foreigners_Stigma: "The Foreigner's Stigma"
  CLC_The_Foreigners_Stigma_desc: "Colombians have grown particularly suspicious and resentful of most foreigners during the acute period of violence that followed the death of president Gaitán, and Heriberto Schwartau, despite being born in Colombia, isn't seen in any different manner from any other foreigner, exposed to public opinion and far away from the ever-Germanophile party circles, the leader of the National Socialist League may need to win over the hearts of the Colombian people if he expects to ever rule the land."

  CLL_Salvation_And_Its_Costs: "Salvation and Its Costs"
  CLL_Salvation_And_Its_Costs_desc: "Despite the mostly democratic and anti-party upbringing of the Salvation Junta, the necessity to secure guns and military support has forced the civilian committees to accept help from both criminal leaders and former party leaders, namely, from the so-called Panida faction of the Nationalist Action Party, taking in both members and leaders, while this has contributed to the Junta's militia solidification, the unstable compromise has raised doubts about the future after the war."

  POLITICS_GILBERTO_ALZATE_AVEDANO_DESC: "It is a common joke outside of New Granada that Alzate Avedaño was compared to Mussolini so many times that he decided to become Colombia's very own Mussolini. But as far as the population of New Granada is concerned, Alzate is El Duce, who will drive out the godless Gaitanistas and deceitful democrats to bring a prosperous and holy order to the lands once governed by Simón Bolívar.\n\nBorn in Manizales, Alzate became an oligarchs' lawyer, and joined the Conservatives just as Laureano Gómez swung it further and further to the right. A good friend of Gómez, Alzate became a member of the Leopards, Conservatives who preached fascism as Colombia's saving grace. As the fascist powers conquered Europe, their dissident wing of the party grew stronger until it became mainstream, obsessed with the strength of Mussolini's and Hitler's states. The lone figure stopping their march was the anti-fascist Caudillo; President Gaitán.\n\nWith Gaitán now dead, El Duce marched. Uniting all Conservative paramilitaries under him, Alzate and his Blackshirts sowed terror, from slaughtering villages to bringing Kristallnacht to Bogotá, and founded New Granada to extend that terror to all of Colombia. Just like the late Duce he emulates, Alzate possesses a ferocious spirit and aims to have his will unopposed, no matter the price, no matter the dead that he must put under his throne."

  CLD_Jose_Camacho_Carreno_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nAriocriollismo§!\n--------------\n§LIf Uribe Misas is the brain of the Nationalist Action Party, then Jose Camacho Carreno is its face. His quest for political power began early, a 17 year old college freshman when he, along with likeminded right-wing activists, founded 'Los Leopardos' in 1920. The Leopardos initially aimed to push the Conservative Party toward nationalism and corporatism, using newspapers to persuade voters. Carreno proved himself to be an excellent orator, becoming the face of the new generation of conservatives, expertly riling crowds with immense national pride and disdain for establishment politics. In 1938 he became a founding member of the Nationalist Action Party, and from the beginning has been second only to Misas in power.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Axis would defeat the Allies, the conservative party would fail to enact their agenda, and the liberal party would be overrun by leftists, all of which enabled Carreno to pull more and more public support towards the AN and its Ariocriollo mission. With the outbreak of La Violencia, Carreno's previous calls for right-wing militias appeared immensely prescient, while his promises that AN would free Colombia from vice, corruption, and Judeo-capitalism, inspired thousands to join the underground Second Patriotic Army. Since the Barranquilla uprising, hundreds of thousands listen to his nightly radio messages, and while his listeners may understand that Misas is the leader, it is Carreno whom they truly follow.§!"
  CLD_Klaus_Wilhelm_Lehder_eco_desc: "§YEconomy Minister\nAriocriollismo§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1904 in Hamburg, Klaus Wilhelm Lehder was but one of many German professionals who settled in Colombia in the first decades of the 20th century. But when he first arrived in 1927, he was one of the only National Socialists on the continent. As a young man Lehder owned a popular hotel in Quindío where he met a number of prominent German business leaders. Among them were Hermann Kühl, the de-facto head of the Deutsch-Kolumbianischer Bund, and aviation industry pioneer Peter Paul von Bauer, who hired Lehder as an engineer for his airline SCADTA. Through SCADTA, Lehder became acquainted with fellow nationalist Uribe Misas, the firm's legal representative at the time.\n\nWhen Misas founded the National Action Party, Lehder was among the very first to follow, his talents in management proving invaluable in shaping the party's internal structure. In the midst of La Violenca, he managed the ever growing pool of plundered goods that financed the AN's growth. When Kühl was killed in a car bombing in 1956, Lehder rushed to acquire his and other Bundists' assets for the party. For this, Misas promised Leider the future position of Economy Minister upon the creation of his Ariocriollo Utopia, a dream which both have absolute confidence in.§!"
  CLD_Luis_Lopez_de_Mesa_Gomez_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\nAriocriollismo§!\n--------------\n§LBorn to wealthy academics in 1884, the 'godfather of Ariocriollo Thought' Mesa spent his formative years immersed in social science literature. This childhood fascination developed into a project to use sociology to perfect Colombian society. As a member of the Liberal Party, from 1917 to 1934 de Mesa rose from city councilor to cabinet member, spearheading education reforms in Pumarejo's first term and being appointed Foreign Minister by his successor, Santos. As the world was engulfed by war, de Mesa used his position to advance his racial ideology. He prohibited the entry of European Jews - including those who were Colombian citizens - as they fled from the Holocaust, while simultaneously working to isolate Colombia from the United States. These deeds made him a legend in the eyes of the far-right.\n\nThe Gaitan administration's decision to enact an open borders policy further fueled de Mesa's certainty of a Jewish plot to destroy Colombia, and he joined the Nationalist Action Party in 1951. For the next decade, he would regularly speak at DKB and AN events and publish papers outlining a Cold-War era agenda for advancing the Criollo race, ideas which would form the core of Misas' Ariocriollo Manifesto. Though today a fragile and sickly old man, de Mesa remains a highly valuable asset for the Second Patriotic Army, enabling it to outwardly portray itself as Colombia's legitimate government, rather than merely a German-controlled terrorist group.§!"
  Heriberto_Schwartau_sec_desc: "§YHead of Intelligence\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1917 to two German immigrant parents in Colombia, Heriberto Schwartau Eskildsen was already infatuated with National Socialism before Hitler became the Führer. After graduating highschool he purchased a ticket for voyage to Hamburg, wh Upon arrival in Germany, Schwartau officially joined the NSDAP and trained to fight in Hitler's army. In 1941, he was pulled from the Heer to serve the Abwehr instead, and Schwartau soon found himself back at sea, returning to Colombia to operate a pro-Axis radio station as part of Operation Bolívar. After the arrest of his superior in 1944, he became Head of Intelligence for the Abwehr in Colombia.\n\nAfter the chaotic elections of 1946, seeing the rise in partisanship and political violence as an opportunity, the Abwehr commanded Schwartau to organize Operation Lafitte, a mission to boost the influence of the National Action Party and further align its politics with that of the Reich, while also undermining public confidence in democracy by fanning the flames of political violence. Through a front company he established in Barranquilla, Schwartau began to smuggle German weapons, which he proceeded to sell to right-wing militias and crime syndicates through a network of locally recruited agents. When Schwartau revealed Operation Lafitte to Uribe Misas, they began a deeper cooperation. Schwartau's intelligence and supplies were essential to planning the Barranquilla uprising. Upon the successful seizure of Barranquilla, Misas appointed Schwartau as the head of the new Security Agency, through which he works to systematically undermine resistance to the new regime.§!"

  POLITICS_ALFONSO_URIBE_MISAS: "Nazi, Charlatan, Mob Boss, Lunatic. All insults commonly hurled his way, but not bothering him; liberals and communists would not mock him so intensely if they did not see him as a threat. Born in 1896, Alfonso Uribe Misas is a lawyer by trade. His successful defense of the DKB-linked SCADTA after a highly publicized plane crash left him in a position to negotiate an alliance between the DKB and far-right 'Leopardos', in 1938 creating the 'Nationalist Action Party.' Misas narrowly secured the AN's nomination for the 1946 presidential election, and his unexpectedly high vote percentage of 20% cemented him as the party's leader. Over the subsequent decade, increasingly certain of his own genius and disgusted by the wave of miscegenation and liberalism sweeping the country, Misas' thoughts converged on National Socialism.\n\nIn his 1953 'Ariocriollo Manifesto', Misas asserted that the 'Criollos' - Colombians of European ancestry - were the Master Race of the Americas, just as the Nordic Race were the masters of Europe. Though roundly mocked by wider society, it would inspire the formation of far-right militias whom Misas assembled into the 'Second Patriotic Army' (SPA). In the early weeks of La Violencia they killed hundreds in "peacekeeping" attacks against leftist rioters until driven underground by General Rojas Pinilla's forces. Protected by German-Colombian industrialists and armed by the Abwehr in 'Operation Lafitte', it would quietly develop into the best equipped rebel force in the country, and devise a plan to overthrow the Bogotá government.\n\nWhen full-scale war resumed, the SPA rapidly overwhelmed army and police garrisons in Barranquilla. While most Colombians (including 'Criollo') still despise Misas, as his revolutionaries now march across the country, all are now forced to reckon with the idea that the 'Ariocriollo State' will indeed take shape."
  POLITICS_HERIBERTO_SCHWARTAU: "Though born on Colombian soil, Heriberto Schwartau has never regarded the country he now rules to be his homeland. Born in 1917 to German immigrant parents, as a teenager he boarded a ship bound for the Fatherland so that he could fight for the cause of National Socialism. Assigned to the Abwehr, Schwartau soon found himself back in Colombia, and became the head of all Abwehr operations in Colombia in 1944. In this position, he masterminded 'Operation Lafitte', a two decade conspiracy to fan the flames of political violence in Colombia, undermine faith in democracy, and provide arms and training to Uribe Misas' so-called Second Patriotic Army.\n\nHowever laughable a distortion of National Socialist ideals his "Ariocriolloismo" was, Schwartau understood the need to work with Misas, and maintain unity of the Nationalist Action alliance to defeat the Reich's enemies in Colombia. But now, with the liberals and communists defeated, Misas himself dead, and the Nationalist Action Party hijacked by General Gil, such ideological excesses can no longer be tolerated. Who but Heriberto Schwartau has both the political acumen and the Aryan blood to bring National Socialism to Colombia? And who but Heriberto Schwartau can guarantee that Bogotá and Germania are forever adjoined?"

  ## Liberals ##
  CLL_La_Violencia: "La Violencia"
  CLL_La_Violencia_desc: "Colombia has found itself in an intermittent state of violence since the assassination of President Gaitán in 1954. Old grudges and hatred between the Conservatives and Liberals led to a climate of brutality that saw both sides committing hideous crimes as Bogotá was razed to the ground in a pogrom. The defection of sectors of the army to the revolted sides and the mounting radicalization of all militants effectively collapsed the authority of the government over large parts of the nation.\n\nA ceasefire to stop the bloodshed has been in place since 1956 and has been enforced thus far. However, the cracks are showing, skirmishes and the growingly precarious food scarcity are building up tensions that threaten to end the peace and throw Colombia into chaos once more."

  CLL_Shoulder_of_Giant: "On the Shoulders of a Giant"
  CLL_Shoulder_of_Giant_desc: "Who assassinated Jorge Eliécer Gaitán? That is the question that all Colombians ask themselves, and depending on whom you ask, you will find a different answer. "It was the Church" say the Liberals, "it was the Jews", say the Conservatives. The Japanese, Americans, Iberians, even the Dominicans are blamed for the loss of the beloved caudillo.\n\nOf course, there is a cynical reason behind this. As Gaitán's figure is respected by all, it's used by political actors to invoke legitimacy for their cause and generate hatred against their enemies, who are accused of being the ones responsible for the deed."

  CLL_Agrarian_Crisis: "Agrarian Crisis"
  CLL_Agrarian_Crisis_desc: "The usual problems of the rural Colombian, its poverty, dependency and exploitation by large landowners have not been solved or disappeared by the civil war, on the contrary, they have made a turn for the worse, a situation that appears to not have any proper solutions in sight.\n\nBesides these old problems, a new one is increasingly growing its importance: food insecurity. The killings, repression and the displacement of the rural population puts our food production in jeopardy and threatens the entirety of Colombia with the prospect of hunger and starvation."

  CLL_OFN_Support: "OFN Involvement"
  CLL_OFN_Support_desc: "Despite the historical American animosity against leftism, the Colombian Revolutionary Union receives support from the OFN and is the friendliest side towards it in the Civil War. This is due to the pro-Americanism of the Gaitanistas and the fact that the enemies of the Revolutionary Union are aided by the Dominicans and fascists.\n\nFor now, the OFN and Venezuela have provided plenty of support to the movement, and they will continue to do it so unless the situation were to radically change."

  CLL_Saints_Sinners: "Army of Saints and Sinners"
  CLL_Saints_Sinners_desc: "When building an army to fight for a cause, one could not be enough of a fool to aim for an angelic force that is free from all the earthly temptations that war brings with it, the common case is that men of all calibres and human qualities are sent to the front so as to defend the grand ideals of those who remain behind, however, in Colombia the bar for those admitted to the fight has been set too low, as pillagers, bandits and murderers are abundant among our the lines of every unit. Perhaps when the war ends those who are righteous may find the time to be hailed as saints, but for now their job is to stand side to side with the most terrible sinners this land has ever bred."

  POLITICS_GUADALUPE_SALCEDO_UNDA_DESC: "Despite a wish for stronger institutions, Latin Americans cannot help but admire the romantic guerrilla leader. The old revere Bolívar and Sandino, the youths and intellectuals salute Fidel Castro, and the communists hail Che Guevara. For many Colombians, hope is embodied in their very own Capitán Salcedo.\n\nBorn in an Arauca cattle village to a Liberal family, Salcedo like many country boys was imprisoned for cattle theft. Upon release he was swept up in celebration - Dr. Gaitán, the campesinos' hero, had become President. Gáitan created a paradise for the long-suffering campesinos, taught them the power of direct democracy, and kept the fascists who threatened their traditions at bay. To Salcedo and many others like him, Gáitan was the warm and kindly sun in the sky- and when Gáitan was murdered, an eclipse had descended upon Colombia as the Blackshirts marched. A talented horseman, Salcedo rallied the surrounding villages together and expelled the fascists with his daring guerrilla attacks.\n\nNow the Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Eastern Plains, Salcedo has sworn before his hero's portrait to fight for his menaced ideals, to defend the poor and oppressed and wretched. He sees himself as the modern General Rondón, commanding the cavalry into patriotic salvation, and the utter defeat of the fascist oligarchs who want to rob Colombia of its independence. Gaitán told the people to charge forwards to victory, and Salcedo will lead their charge."

  ### EVENTS ###
  GER_colombia.1.t: "SUBJECT: Status of the Segundo Ejército Patriótico in Atlántico"
  GER_colombia.1.d: "1. At approximately 4:00 AM (UTC-5), the Second Patriotic Army (SPA) initiated a large-scale offensive which in a matter of hours captured the invaluable port city of Barranquilla for use as a springboard in its National Socialist revolution. In speed and unit cohesion, the SPA greatly outperformed our expectations, and suffered half the expected casualties.\n\n2. Colombia is of immense geostrategic importance to the Reich, with the potential to provide access to the Pacific Ocean, hinder US efforts to promote far-left groups in Ecuador, Peru, and Paraguay, and enable deeper ties between Germania and other South American countries. Further, the SPA's leadership is all but unconditionally supportive of the NSDAP, and has privately indicated enthusiastic willingness to join the Einheitspakt.\n\n3. Colombian Armed Forces have so far succeeded in containing the SPA to the Atlántico Department, but lack the heavy equipment and manpower needed to launch a counteroffensive for the foreseeable future. However, the civilian population has been generally uncooperative with the SPA, and frequent encounters with communist insurgents and narcotics traffickers are rapidly depleting military equipment stockpiles. These issues render the SPA unable to expand its territorial control at present, and may become an existential threat to the movement. Without considerable external assistance, the chance of the SPA establishing a National Socialist government is miniscule.\n\n4. Recognizing these circumstances, our agents recommend in the strongest possible terms a further escalation of UNTERNEHMEN CATTLEYA. in particular, the scale of arms-smuggling operations should be greatly expanded, and civilian advisors should be sent to prepare Misas' administration.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

  IBR_colombia.5.t: "Una Segunda Reconquista"
  IBR_colombia.5.desc: "Cartagena traced its history back to the conquistador Pedro de Heredia, who travelled the West Indies in the early 16th century and founded the city with two hundred men. Between the rivers Magdalena and Sinú the city was strategically important for the Spanish Empire in the Americas, and it grew flush with Spanish capital. Three centuries later, Spanish capital returned to Cartagena with the conclusion of La Violencia.\n\nPerhaps it is unfair to suggest it is solely Spanish capital here. There are Portuguese contractors too, such as Atílio Salgado, a specialist in infrastructure who walked along Central Caribbean Road with a notebook, recording road widths, the poor quality of the gravel and the damage it sustained in the battle to capture the city. But most of the Iberians who came to Cartagena were Spanish. Sergio Diaz held secret meetings with the new mayor, seeking favourable terms for his construction company. At the port, Oier Tarragona oversaw the first merchant ships from across the Atlantic docking, bearing peninsular supplies and ready to receive Colombian treasures. Biel Francisco Gallego stepped off one of the ships, suitcase in hand, ready to enter this newly-opened market.\n\nAnd in the streets of Cartagena, a young diplomat goes walking through the bustling crowd, ecstatic with their newfound freedom and an end to the violence that plagued this country for years. Jose Manuel Peralta held in his hand a large manila folder, inside which was a report from the Iberian embassy. It talks of the new government preparing elections, the hopeful mood in the streets, the eagerness for Colombia to return to the world; it speaks also of the government's appreciation for Iberia, and the assets their liberalisation has opened up. He entered the post office and handed the envelope to a clerk; FOR URGENT DELIVERY is stamped on the front, underneath which is the address of the Iberian Union's foreign ministry. Peralta returns to Cartagena with a light heart, eager to embrace the city he would come to think of as a home away from home."

The situation in Colombia had been deteriorating for weeks, this report was just the final pronouncement. He would spare himself the gory details.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang. This did not surprise him either, and he knew exactly who it was. Picking up the receiver, he was met with a slew of Portuguese profanity from his fellow caudillo. He set the phone down on his desk to let Salazar get it out of his system. And it's not like he didn't deserve it. He was the one who had convinced Salazar that this adventure in Colombia would be worth it. He was the one who had spoken of reclaiming old glories, of Iberia once again having a place in the New World. But those days were gone, and this was the proof.\n\nWith a sigh, he picked up the phone.\n\n"I agree, Antonio. It was my mistake. We need to cut our losses and pull out everything.""

  IBR_colombia.7.desc: "It was late into the night when the cargo ship bearing the defeated cruised into the harbour, emerging from the fog at a languid pace. They had all been woken up by the call of "landfall," and they were all gathered around the edge of the ship to look upon their homeland, but there was no jubilation to be found in returning home. They all felt empty, confused and tired.\n\nThey had lost, and the men who sent them to this defeat were gone. They departed with the knowledge that they had failed Iberia - but on the voyage back home, they wondered what they were fighting for anyway. What was there in Colombia that was worth sending Iberians to die? Their comrades died for a cause they could no longer recall; all the survivors had were their lives, irreparably scarred by this failure.\n\nIn the distance, the lights of the harbour glittered. The air was pleasantly cold and dry, welcome relief from the Colombian jungles. No longer would they suffer the oppressive wet heat; no longer would they suffer communist or republican bullets and blades; and no longer would they suffer the dreams of old men in Madrid.\n\nEach man carried a testimony of regret, failure and betrayal they would not only carry in their hearts, but testify to all Iberia. They would tell it in the family home, fathers recalling sanitised versions of the war for their children. They would tell it in the inns and pubs of Iberia, drunken wretches crying into their cups for lost comrades at three in the morning. Some would even tell it in the courts as men considered what compensation they could receive for their sacrifice."

  IBR_colombia.8.t: "The Vultures' Auction"
  IBR_colombia.8.desc: "Twenty rich men gathered in the vast conference room, in the largest hotel in Bogotá that had not been bombed. Across the room from them was an auctioneer, a government representative and a map of New Granada. They had overlaid lot numbers on the map: the positions of rich estates, fertile valleys and fields most suitable to growing Colombia's finest crop.\n\nIn the estates, a colonel enjoys the first day of his retirement. He intended to grow fat on the lucre he had won from the civil war - half of which he had stolen from Jewish families marked traitors to the state by Alzate. The estate was a beautiful colonial holdover, atop a great hill underneath which were vast fields, and a little town that had grown around a small lake. But he did not own it all, not truly. He knew he was but the representative of another man, who let him play landlord for a reasonable fee. "Sold, to the gentleman from Sapporo, for three million."\n\nA group of farmers were held up by the roadside. Patted down, humiliated, struck in the stomach with the butt of a rifle. New Granadan soldiers raided their caravan, took the crops they had wanted to send to market. Their commander thought himself fair, and left behind a bill with El Duce's face on them. Dejected, the farmers trekked back to their fields, only to find more men bearing a deed to the land, and an order to kick out the squatters. "Sold, to the gentleman from Milan, for four million."\n\nThe village tried to put the war behind them, but the scars remained. When they closed their eyes they still saw the militias descending upon the valley like an avalanche. When they left, seven were dead. The soldiers called them Marxist saboteurs - their only crime was being a village in URC territory. But they were poor, and thought themselves below the attention of anyone else, until a strange man had come and taken samples of their soil. Then came a hundred speculators from distant lands.

  USA_colombia.7.desc: "In an air-conditioned corner of Bogotá, three floors above the city, Dirk Holden watched the traffic and sipped that ever-delightful Colombian coffee. In his typewriter was the last page of a report that would launch his career in the Company into the stratosphere: a report on the success of the URC in the Colombian Civil War. Washington would hear of the crucial role he played in the affair, and they would reward his ten long years trapped in what he once thought was a God-forsaken jungle. Perhaps the coffee was a little bitter, but his victory tasted sweet.\n\nThe victors were an odd bunch: a popular front of democrats, liberal reformists, left-wing activists and a smattering of communists. Holden would assure his superiors that the latter would not interfere with the general pro-American sentiment of the URC. Gaitán was himself a staunch pan-American who sought to warm his country with the torch of freedom, and the Gaitanistas held onto those beliefs from the beginning. All Washington needed to be cautioned against was overt interference with their markets. He couldn't help but editorialize: let the Colombians develop their economy, offer them capital and let them decide for themselves which foreign companies should be permitted to invest. You'll still get a grip on their economy, and everyone will be happy.\n\nIt wasn't patriotic pride that made Holden smile. It was pride in his own efforts. Ten long years in Colombia, helping run this bureau, and he had an entire nation to show for it. He took a sip of his bitter coffee, the prized crop of this country. At first he hated it - his cups were once always three-quarters milk - but over time he grew to appreciate its strong, bold flavour. His appreciation for Colombian coffee grew with his appreciation for Colombia, from hated exile to proud caretaker. America had won here, and America - or, at least, her intelligence services - would come to know the vital role he played in securing their position in Colombia."

Henry never liked him, and had privately called him an "FBI bastard", but that didn't matter now. The revolutionaries had been routed, and they were on the run. Henry could hear the government soldiers advancing, seemingly just at their heels.\n\nHolden slumped wheezing against a tree. Henry turned and yelled "What the fuck are you doing?"\n\n"Just need to get my brea-" Holden's words were cut off by a gunshot followed by a scream. Henry ran with doubled speed. Bursting through the trees, he found himself staring down at the Orinoco River. Henry took a deep breath and leapt off the edge of the bank.\n\nHe had planned to swim to the other side, but found that impossible. His eyes burned in the murky water, and the rush of the river stole all sound from his ears. He tried to push in the direction he assumed was the opposite shore, but his muscles quickly tired and his lungs burned. When a hand grabbed his back and pulled him from the water, the relief almost drowned out the fear.\n\nHe was sprawled on the deck of a small motorboat, driven by a soldier. Another soldier sat near him, his gun at the ready. Henry sat up and looked to the shore they were headed for. On it he saw several more soldiers and Holden, sitting with a bloody bandage on his leg. The situation wasn't ideal, but it at least seemed like they wouldn't be killed."

  USA_colombia.9.desc: "Dirk Holden tried to summon the information in his head: the field manuals, the informational movies, the conversations between veterans he overheard. Only a jumble emerged, thousands of scraps fighting for relevance in his mind as his body marched through the Colombian jungle. He was stripped and blindfolded, forced to march through the unforgiving jungle by a victorious enemy. He tried to explain who he was - not an agent, not a soldier, but a secretary. His captors do not care. He marches to his death with the rest of the Yankees.\n\nPeeled bark and fallen branches crunch and splinter below his bleeding feet. The cold barrel of a rifle presses into his back, driving him forward whenever his body tries to rest. Holden wishes he could hear the birds above him clearly. He would like to die with their song to comfort him, but the jeering of soldiers and the loud crunch of the debris below him drown out their song.\n\nIn the din of his mind, new thoughts emerge, memories of reports terrifyingly clearer than the ones he tries to remember. New Granadan forces had been creative with their torture of local collaborators. Holden read the reports; he even wrote a few of them. They had long eschewed conventional force and developed new ways of inflicting pain on men. They had even taken to mimicking medieval forms of torture. He tried to fend off these thoughts, but once they revealed themselves it was impossible to forget. Holden's legs almost gave out, but another sharp thrust of a gun barrel in his back forced him to keep stable and walk towards horrors he'd only read about.\n\nSome four thousand miles away, a report crosses the Resolute Desk. It puts the Colombian situation in plain terms: assets that have not been extracted at the time of writing are considered lost. The torch of liberty shall not fall on New Granada. With sorrow, anger or boredom - few know now, and none will remember later - the President accepts this information and passes it along the desk like a clerk."

  BRA_colombia.3.t: "Life After Wartime"
  BRA_colombia.3.desc: "There's a kind of hush that settles over a land immediately after war. People stumble out of their shelters and foxholes, tentative steps towards their old routines, watchful for a moment in which it all blows up into chaos again. A man might lose control of his horses, his mind occupied by the wife he lost in a skirmish, and the entire town locks themselves away against the stampede. Fishermen and tappers hesitate to set sail across the border in the Amazonas. Shelled-out housing complexes are quietly abandoned, their old tenants forced to migrate; nobody wishes to inhabit the husks left behind by war.\n\nBogotá felt that hush at first. People walked hesitantly, close to the entrances of buildings, ready to dive into cover once the shooting started again. But slowly, people understood that it was over. Brazil's men won in Colombia, and peace was in their foreseeable future.\n\nAnd with peace came foreign investment. Though foreign ships bearing unfamiliar flags startled many, the Brazilians came with open arms and heavy purses, ready to help the rebuilding effort and reap a good reward in response. Delegations met in the least-affected hotels of Bogotá to draw up trade deals, presidents exchanged telephone calls to congratulate Colombia on their newfound victory. Fishing ships hail each other, discuss the day's catch, exchange smokes and pleasant conversation about the clear blue sky.\n\nThere's still a hesitation in the air. La Violencia clouds the minds of many Colombians. Many feel as if all this is some dream world, and when they wake up the paramilitaries will come back, raping and pillaging and plunging Colombia into another nightmare."

  BRA_colombia.4.desc: "Less than a mile north of the Cuiari River was a small campfire around which lost sons of Brazil huddled for warmth. The collapse of the frontlines had driven them all into the jungle, in a pathetic display of panic and disorganisation that saw agents and officers of the Brazilian army stranded in the Colombian jungle. On the edge of the camp's light Lieutenant Vitor Pires Cabral carved his and six other names into a tree with his clip-point knife: LEAL, ALVAREZ, CLEMENTE, MARTINS, FONTANA, ESTEVES. He expected them all to die; he did not want them all to be forgotten.\n\nThe other six gathered around the campfire and discussed their next move. All were in broad agreement that they had two options: follow the Cuiari to the Amazon, and follow the waters to somewhere populated. Risky, for they may risk capture by the enemy, no doubt patrolling for the stragglers they routed on the battlefield. Leal proposed the other option: they head south, through the jungle, and hope they hit Brazil. Alvarez pointed to the map, pointed out they are only twenty klicks from the Içana river, within Brazil's borders. Clemente chewed them both out: don't they know how lost they are in the jungle? Martins tried to calm them all down, but cannot deny that he thinks entering a town is dangerous if they are allied with the new government. Fontana pointed out the obvious: whatever the outcome, if they stay here, they are dead.\n\nWhen Cabral returned to the group, Esteves was putting out the fire. He told him to rest up. They will march south at first light. He crawled into his bedroll and tried to go to sleep, but chirping insects, soft rains and the fear of an enemy patrol kept him from truly resting."

A long time ago both of our nations were partners, but they refused our pleas for help in World War 2, instead declaring neutrality. The final straw was when President Gabriel Turbay Abunader nationalized our businesses under the absolutely flimsy pretext of a state emergency. We severed relations, and it has been that way since.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Republic of Colombia emerged victorious in the Colombian Civil War, defeating the brave Colombian Revolutionary Union. The Republic attempted to repair relations, but none of them seemed particularly serious: certainly not serious enough to be considered.\n\nBecause of this, we were surprised by a communique Bogotá sent to us earlier today. In it, the new leadership describes their desire to 'fully restore relations' with us. They describe their government as more amenable to negotiations than the previous administration, and it seems that they may finally have the political backing to put actions behind their words."

Colombia's nationalization of American branch offices many years ago was completely unacceptable, the final straw in a long series of bad Colombian decisions. If the Colombians were truly serious about repairing this relationship, said the report, it wouldn't be difficult for them to de-nationalise them, returning them to American hands.

However, the Colombian government was remarkably insistent on keeping a percentage of these companies in their hands, claiming that the enterprises would aid in the country's reconstruction.\n\nPresident [USA.GetPresidentLastName] considered the matter.

Following the successful ousting of General Rojas Pinilla, the Front went on to defeat the triple threats of fascists, nazists, and revolutionaries. Promising a stable and safe democracy, one free of the oligarchy of the past, they have signaled their intent to respect Gaitán's wishes, and build a new, liberal society.\n\nTis development has impacted both sides of the Atlantic, as this is an astounding victory for Iberian interests in the region. The Organization of Free Nations has hesitantly recognized the new democracy, with Washington sending congratulations, while Tokyo remains silent. Elections are planned to be held, but concerns have already surfaced that despite the existing power-sharing agreement, the old two-party system has returned.\n"
