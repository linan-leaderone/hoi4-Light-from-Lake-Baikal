 POLITICS_ZHANG_ZHIZHONG_DESC:0 "Zhang Zhizhong was born in Anhui Province in 1890. Like many of his contemporaries, he was swept into the warlord conflicts during his youth. But unlike his peers, Zhang Zhizhong's battles have not yet come to an end. Zhang Zhizhong attended the Baoding Military Academy and joined the National Revolutionary Army under the Kuomintang after graduation. During the Northern Expedition, Zhang Zhizhong fought bravely and achieved many military successes; during the War of Resistance against Japan, Zhang Zhizhong resolutely set aside political differences to resist the Japanese invaders together with four hundred million compatriots.\n\nWhen the war began, the Japanese offensive was efficient and brutal. The Chinese army fought desperately, but still could not match the superior Japanese forces. Zhang Zhizhong led his troops in a fierce defense of Hunan, fighting the Japanese for several months. However, a wrong decision rendered the soldiers' sacrifices in vain: Zhang Zhizhong somehow learned of the Japanese's imminent attack on Changsha and ordered his troops to burn the city before the Japanese could attack, leaving nothing usable for the enemy. In reality, this was a complete misjudgment on Zhang Zhizhong's part, and his order led to a world-renowned tragedy: the Wenxi Fire. The fire claimed countless innocent lives, and the defending troops suffered severe losses, leading to the fall of Hunan. However, Zhang Zhizhong did not give up resistance; he led his troops to Xinjiang and declared that the resistance against the invaders would continue there.\n\nXinjiang is a harsh and barren land, and Zhang Zhizhong, who found himself there, felt this deeply. His troops were not the first to arrive in Xinjiang; although they were the strongest, they were not welcomed. To maintain control over Xinjiang, Zhang Zhizhong had to maintain a delicate balance between the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the local ethnic minorities. Day by day, year by year, Zhang Zhizhong patiently managed this borderland. The old general's only hope is to free his homeland from its shackles and see it return to freedom and revival."
 Sheng_Shicai:0 "Sheng Shicai"
 XIN_Sheng_Shicai_desc:0 "Deep within everyone's heart lies a dream—an unattainable dream woven purely from fervent beliefs and desires. For Sheng Shicai, that dream was to become a king.\n\nHe almost succeeded. The place where his dream came true was the isolated Xinjiang region beyond the Great Wall.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how a man from Liaoning could become known as the 'King of Xinjiang,' but Sheng Shicai achieved this through his natural luck and opportunism. In the storm of 1933, he expelled his old superior Jin Shuren and became the de facto ruler of Xinjiang. However, surrounded by powerful enemies and in a precarious position, the throne of the King of Xinjiang was far from glorious. Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan were constantly eyeing the position of supreme power, and Sheng Shicai had no choice but to seek help from the north. After making a 'pro-Soviet and anti-imperialist' pledge, he received assistance from the Red Army, finally securing his destined land in his grasp.\n\nPromises come with costs. As the price of becoming king, Sheng Shicai had to pretend to adopt a left-wing stance and accept the Communist Party members who had come from the Central Plains into his court. He always watched these overly active Reds with suspicion while silently gazing towards the interior of China. As the Soviet Union collapsed, the Nationalist government was defeated, and Japan became the new master of Asia, Sheng Shicai took note of everything. Sheng Shicai wanted to become a king, and it had nothing to do with Xinjiang. He did not care about the fate of Xinjiang; he only wanted to protect his throne. Thus, he could decisively embrace Japan, or just as decisively slaughter the communists, despite the fact that the former did not particularly like him and the latter were once his benefactors and helpers.\n\nTen years passed in a flash. The winds blowing from beyond the Jade Gate Pass grew stronger, crossing the Gobi Desert and entering the deep court of Dihua, rustling the throne on which Sheng Shicai sat. The shell of the King of Xinjiang peeled away piece by piece under the scrutiny of the people, finally revealing Sheng Shicai's true nature—he was nothing more than an opportunistic warlord who would lie, kill, and shamelessly become a traitor for personal gain. Sheng Shicai no longer had any means to maintain his power and could only tremble and struggle as he awaited his final fate.\n\n—All kings will fall, especially when they are mere impostors. This time, Sheng Shicai has nowhere to confess and will never be saved."

 The_Crumbling_Six_Policies_desc:0 "§YAnti-imperialism, Accommodation with Japan, Peace, Integrity, Construction, National Equality§! These are Sheng Shicai's proud political inventions, the so-called 'Six Policies.' In 1946, when Sheng Shicai changed 'pro-Soviet' to 'accommodation with Japan' in the Six Policies, he repeatedly assured that this did not mean any change in the policy of accommodating communism or allowing Japan to dominate Xinjiang. However, he failed to uphold either of these guarantees.\n\nIn the 1950s, under Sheng Shicai's orders, a purge of communists began throughout Xinjiang, leading to the arrest of a large number of Xinjiang bureau officials and the secret execution of figures such as Mao Zemin, the director of the Civil Affairs Department. As a result, Xinjiang's economy fell into prolonged disorder, forcing Sheng Shicai to actively attract Japanese investment. Consequently, the ridicule of 'nominally accommodating Japan, but actually colluding with Japan' was heard all over Xinjiang. §RThe Six Policies that once guided Xinjiang are now nearing the end of their lives. One solid kick could cause them to crumble to dust. §!"

The growing Red power made Sheng Shicai increasingly uneasy, forcing him to tear off his 'accommodation with communists' mask and begin a large-scale massacre—indeed, the communists disappeared as the slaughter progressed, but that does not mean they were annihilated.\n\nWhere are they? Ten years have passed, and Xinjiang's communists are still continuing their struggle. They walk in the wilderness of northern Xinjiang, appear in villages, towns, and city streets across the region, and may even have infiltrated the heart of the administration again; §x they will never forgive, nor will they forget. §!"

However, as time passed, the provincial government's deteriorating governance capacity has left them unable to manage this area, and the newly independent Republic of India clearly harbors resentment over this 'White Stone Beach.'\n\n§YToday, unless the provincial government can rally its strength or another power takes over and restores governance, whether Xinjiang can continue to hold this strategically important mountain basin is in serious doubt. §!"

According to the plan, this railway would connect the light textile industry hub of Hami with the cotton-producing area of Aksu, thereby enabling the more efficient and rapid flow of raw materials. However, with Mao Zemin's death, the completion of the railway was indefinitely delayed.\n\nFor the Xinjiang authorities, this unfinished railway has left them at a loss: on the one hand, they lack the capability to complete it on their own, and the Japanese show no interest in the project; on the other hand, they lack the ability to maintain and operate the existing lines. §YIn the eyes of many, the Hami-Aksu railway is a symbol of Xinjiang's decade-long economic decline. §!"

 JAP.2022.d:"Our unit was patrolling the A-21 airspace as planned when we detected what appeared to be a brigade-level field command facility. The second light bombing squadron immediately launched an attack upon discovery, catching the enemy completely off guard. We used eleven 500-kilogram bombs and twenty 250-kilogram bombs. The results were outstanding; multiple angles and crews confirmed that no one in the brigade-level unit survived.\n\nAccording to radio signals intercepted from allied research stations, this command post was indeed the headquarters of the '88th Guards Infantry Brigade.' During the previous Mongolian conflict, this brigade-level unit displayed exceptional combat efficiency, excelling in ambushes, guerrilla warfare, and other combat forms, habitually harassing our supply and logistics lines and repeatedly delaying the Mongolian army's offensives. According to our intelligence, this unit was not originally part of the 'People's Revolutionary Committee' combat sequence. But why did such a formidable unit suddenly appear on the Mongolian battlefield? The reasons are still under investigation."

Although Qinghai and Ningxia have long regarded themselves as part of the Ma family, and should have been as close as brothers in the fight against Japan, now, due to the imbalance of power, the Ningxia Ma family has had to live under others' roofs, while the Qinghai Ma family, having lost Lanzhou, is in turmoil. The rift between the two Mas is growing deeper."

Hanhui_conflict_desc:"The war that swept across the country twenty years ago brought devastating harm to the people of the Central Plains. During the frenzied Japanese mop-up operations in the late stages of the war, large numbers of refugees chose to flee to the northwest—a rare part of China that had not been completely ravaged by the flames of war.\n\nThe influx of refugees replenished the labor force that was scarce in the northwest and saved Qinghai's economy, which had been on the brink of collapse due to exploitation and war. At the same time, the ethnic tensions in Qinghai, which had not been severe, were exacerbated by the influx of refugees. Contrary to traditional beliefs, this discrimination was mainly directed against the local ethnic minorities and Han people, who discriminated against the newcomers."

The economic development efforts of the Qinghai Ma family are similar to those of the Sichuan warlords.\n\nThe Ma family expanded its family business over decades, cruelly exploiting the people under their rule, and recklessly extracting profits, leading to the bankruptcy of thousands of small producers in the northwest. The endless conscription also drastically reduced the farming population.\n\nWith the establishment of the Huangzhong Industrial Company, the Ma family's monopoly industry was fully formed, and all of Qinghai fell into endless suffering under the Ma family's exploitation. Hidden behind the 'prosperity of the northwest' were the bulging pockets of the Ma family and the nearly collapsed economy of Qinghai."

To ensure the stability of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and to squeeze out some war-minded officers, the Northwest Army was formed.\n\nWhen the massive bandit suppression forces entered the heart of northwest China, they were met with little resistance, and the rebel guerrillas who had once struck heavy blows against the reorganized National Government's army did not even dare to show their heads. The Northwest Army swept into Gansu and engaged in a great battle with the Ma family warlords in Lanzhou. The Ma family's proud fortress group in Lanzhou was easily eliminated by the Northwest Army, and the surviving Ma family troops fled in panic to Xining. The invincible Northwest Army of the Empire is now advancing towards Xining, ready to finally crush the rebel forces of northwest China…\n\nBut bad news has already arrived. The Northwest Army has advanced too deep into enemy territory, and its supply lines have been attacked by the rebel guerrillas along the way. Even within the territory of the reorganized National Government, the supplies from Tokyo have been severely depleted by the warlords. Lacking supplies, struggling to maintain their weapons, and unable to replenish their forces, they are in a dire situation. Even within the territories controlled by the Northwest Army, after repeated sweeps, there is no extra food to be found. Now, they have become a stranded army trapped in northwest China.\n\nCan they retreat? No, they cannot. Not only because of the dignity of the Imperial Japanese Army, but more importantly, for the honor of the Northwest Army's highest command, they cannot retreat even a single step."

For half a century, under the rule of the Ma family, it may not have been wealthy, but it was peaceful and stable. Under the strategic foresight of the 'King of the Northwest'—Ma Bufang, even the raging War of Resistance against Japan did not greatly affect this area. Free from the turmoil of war, and with the favor of the Japanese, the northwest became one of the earliest regions to rise after the war. For a time, the Ma family was raking in money, and Lanzhou was praised as the 'Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall'... but that was before the Japanese invasion.\n\nThe war, though brief, completely changed the face of the northwest, shattering the false prosperity and igniting the latent contradictions. After the defeat in Lanzhou, Ma Jiyuan lost his father, and the Ma family lost its backbone. The remnants of their forces retreated to Xining, but discipline had crumbled, and they were short of guns and ammunition. Faced with a crisis, Ma Jiyuan had to hastily bury his father and shoulder the burden of being the 'King of the Northwest' alone. Today, the northwest is beset by enemies inside and out, the people are in constant fear, and there are even rifts between brothers. But the wealth accumulated by the Ma family over half a century cannot be underestimated, and the valiant men of the northwest will not be easily defeated. The path ahead of Ma Jiyuan is a thorny and difficult one, but this young man is determined to carve out a broad and smooth road!\n\nIf not crushed by adversity, the young colt will one day travel a thousand miles and shake the mountains and rivers!"

GAN.114514.d:"As usual, Nikolai got up early today, just as the sun had yet to rise, and the eastern sky still appeared a pale white. He then went to the washroom and followed the routine he had learned since childhood. Today seemed like any other day in Nikolai's daily life. After washing up, he neatly ironed his old military uniform, which had been with him for more than twenty years, and hung it in the wardrobe—finally breaking the routine—but not for long, as the routine was soon restored when Nikolai took out a new uniform from the wardrobe.\n\nThis new uniform had just been issued to all sailors by the Kamchatka Sailor Committee yesterday, and Nikolai could not wait to put it on today. Nikolai looked at himself in the mirror again and again. The uniform was finely made, with blue cuffs adorned with golden buttons, which shimmered under the light. The golden buttons were engraved with the Soviet emblem, giving them a delicate feel; the black leather gun holster on his waist complemented the black high leather boots he wore, and the Soviet emblem on the hat brim added the finishing touch. The man in the mirror looked mighty and majestic.\n\nSatisfied, he saluted the mirror and then opened the wardrobe to gently touch the old, wrinkled 'old comrade' who had been with him for over twenty years, as if whispering a farewell. After a while, Nikolai closed the wardrobe, put on his new military cap again, and stepped out of the room in his boots—he was going to wear the new uniform to attend the committee's award ceremony. Everything was new, from the uniform to the medals, from Nikolai to the Sailor Committee.

The leaders of the Sailor Committee were already standing inside, solemn and respectful, waiting for the arrival of the sailors.\n\nNikolai rarely had the chance to personally experience such a grand ceremony, and his mouth, which was agape with admiration, was now speechless. He had already reserved a spot on his new uniform for his medals, and with that in mind, Nikolai glanced down at the empty spot above the left chest pocket, feeling a bit lonely. But he had no worries; he knew that General Yumashev was about to personally award him the medal, and might even personally pin it on his left chest—this thought undoubtedly excited Nikolai.\n\nNikolai did not hear clearly what the General said in his speech; he only thought about standing on stage with the medals of honor pinned on him, with the Soviet emblem hanging high behind him. Nikolai had no doubts about his faith, and at this moment, the honor of that faith was embodied in the few medals on his left chest. There is no doubt that the Sailor Committee's award ceremony inspired Nikolai and his fellow sailors to march forward toward their great ideals with renewed vigor.
