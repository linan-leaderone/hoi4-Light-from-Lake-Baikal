MEX_rural_depression_lozano:0 "Revolutionary Agriculture"
MEX_rural_depression_lozano_desc:0 "From the Revolutionary demands for 'Tierra y Libertad', the ejido system of collective agriculture was born. Under it, federally-owned land is allotted to peasant communities, who work the land in common, which initially granted a much greater degree of autonomy to the Mexican peasantry than ever before. While under the guise of President Salinas Lozano some improvements have been made, the system is still plagued by political negligence and corruption, and is far less profitable and efficient than modern agronomic practices brought about by the Green Revolution."
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Lozano_Coopt_The_Movement_Victory:0 "The Strikes, Ended"
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Lozano_Coopt_The_Movement_Victory_desc:0 "The doctors' strikes didn't oppose the Revolution but were an indication that change was needed for it to survive. That was the view of President Salinas when the independent unions AMM and AMMRI went on strike. The strikes went in Salinas's favor as technocratic legislation was pushed through, in the name of "repairing the system's flaws". President Salinas was significantly praised for his success by both the middle class who applauded his pragmatism, and the party who saw the potential in the new leader."
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Lozano_Double_Standard_Victory:0 "The Strikes, Ended"
MEX_Doctors_Strike_Lozano_Double_Standard_Victory_desc:0 "The striking doctors could easily be divided into two groups. The respectable middle-class professionals of the AMM, and the inexperienced benighted workers of the AMMRI. The former were quickly absorbed into CNOP, and the latter got a much more bitter treatment. Through negative press, the two unions were starkly differentiated from each other. When the time was right, the AMMRI saw the consequences of their errors..."

MEX_the_technocrats_presidency:0 "The Technocrat's Presidency"
MEX_the_technocrats_presidency_desc:0 "Few would have anticipated Raúl Salinas Lozano to rise to the apex of Mexican politics. But his canny politicking, ties to Japan, and promises of growth-boosting reform were enough to secure the PRI candidacy and thus the Presidency. Now he and his cadre of like-minded economists and engineers prepare to remake the Mexican state to usher in a new era of prosperity."
MEX_necessary_compromises:0 "Necessary Compromises"
MEX_necessary_compromises_desc:0 "The technocrats, newly empowered, remain only a tentacle of the PRI's vast Leviathan. Most also lack the expertise to staff vital roles in defense or internal security. To ensure loyalty of the full party, we will fill these openings with experienced members of the party elite - del Rosal in National Defense, Ordaz in the Federal District, and Echeverría as the powerful Secretary of Governance. Lesser lights will also receive their unjust desserts as we look to placate the upper crust more generally."
MEX_and_odd_bedfellows:0 "And Odd Bedfellows"
MEX_and_odd_bedfellows_desc:0 "Ah... the PRI's left flank. Wedded to a romantic view of the Revolution that is now irrelevant. They stand in direct opposition to many facets of our quest to rationalize Mexico's government and industrialize the country.\n\nNevertheless, a discrete few are educated professionals of the highest order. We will lean on Sierra and Manautou for their planning and administrative abilities. Jesus Reyes Heroles, practically a technocrat himself, will bind our alliance together to combat the conservative bulk of the PRI and corruption itself."
MEX_union_dues:0 "Union Dues"
MEX_union_dues_desc:0 "Fidel Velázquez Sánchez, head of the CTM and voice of the corporatist system, is a man to whom the PRI owes a great debt. We also owe him a great, more specific, debt for his aid during the Nava Affair. A debt he is now calling in.\n\nHe wants positions for his charro cronies, both as a form of patronage and to frustrate any potential interference in his vast fiefdom. Appointing Blas Chumacero, a high school dropout and chief Velázquez toady, as Secretary of Labor goes against everything Salinas stands for. Except keeping promises."
MEX_bleeding_wounds:0 "Bleeding Wounds"
MEX_bleeding_wounds_desc:0 "The strikes by these unrecognized unions, AMM and AMMRI, are a wound left to fester by López Mateos. We must ensure that they are healed before the Informe de Gobierno or the damage to the nation, and to our administration, may be irreparable.\n\nAppropriately enough, a surgical approach is called for. But which one? We could seek to amputate AMMRI, a radical association of medical interns, from the rational, reasonable professionals that compose AMM, in order to strike a deal with the striking doctors. Or we could be bolder still - and ensure that AMM and AMMRI apply just enough pressure to squeeze the gangrenous pus of complacency from CNOP without provoking an allergic reaction from the party."
MEX_elixirs_and_amputations:0 "Elixirs and Amputations"
MEX_elixirs_and_amputations_desc:0 "Our diagnosis is pronounced. Mexico is suffering from a grave infection, the agitation of the dangerous Bolshevistic AMMRI, and a mild dislocation, with the striking doctors of AMM only demanding what is their due as professionals.\n\nThe treatment will be performed accordingly. AMMRI will be demonized by every media outlet in Mexico, portrayed as feckless youths unwilling to put in half the labor their predecessors did to sustain our nation's health. Their gatherings will be shut down, and their communications severed.\n\nAMM will be nudged gently back into place. Their demands, save those regarding the interns, will be met, and perhaps exceeded. Mexico expects the best from its doctors, and rewards them accordingly."
MEX_patients_and_patience:0 "Patients and Patience"
MEX_patients_and_patience_desc:0 "Our diagnosis is pronounced. The strikes by the medical interns of AMMRI are a symptom, not the disease.\n\nCNOP, a corporation broad to the point of incoherency, is home to Mexico and our party's future: the middle-class and professionals. Its inability to preemptively address the medical students' concerns over pay and workplace conditions represents its failure to cultivate that future, a point we will hammer again and again.\n\nAny reform to a corporate arm of the PRI will be deeply controversial, but if the strikes grow... just severe enough, we will be able to justify a sorely-needed operation to refashion CNOP. A delicate surgery, but an essential one."
MEX_cautious_steps:0 "Cautious Steps"
MEX_cautious_steps_desc:0 "The Doctors' Strike wears on, but at least we have decided on our approach to resolving the crisis.\n\nNow we must decide on our administration's broader approach. The presidency of Mexico has been compared to a rotating absolutist monarchy, but how powerful can a monarch be with a court full of enemies?\n\nFor now, we will tread carefully, via small, logical steps that boost growth and win us further room to maneuver. And with every footfall, we will repeat the familiar phrases of our presidential lineage. Perhaps that will lull our adversaries into lowering their guard."
MEX_cautious_steps_tt: "§OIcarus§! §Ywill now be visible in the decision menu.§!"
MEX_supply_for_demand:0 "Supply for Demand"
MEX_supply_for_demand_desc:0 "The Airport Crisis that appeared late in López Mateos' presidency has a simple explanation. The rising convenience, quality, and affordability of Mexican air travel caused demand to outstrip responsible supply.\n\nAccordingly, our administration will focus its considerable technical expertise into designing, funding, and constructing the next generation of Mexican airports. Larger facilities and longer runways are needed across the country.\n\nThough perhaps western states and cities could benefit more than most. We're expecting quite a few travelers from across the Pacific."
MEX_offer_substitutes:0 "Offer Substitutes"
MEX_offer_substitutes_desc:0 "A secondary method of addressing the Airport Crisis is providing efficient alternatives to air travel. Smoother roads and more rapid rail should keep Mexicans grounded for middle-distance trips. Not to mention all the benefits they'll bring for our industrial development....\n\nSecretary Uruchurtu will collaborate with CAPUFE, our federal construction agency, and Mexican National Railways to prioritize and resource projects. Let us follow in the footsteps of President Alemán and knit our nation together with threads of asphalt and steel!"
MEX_sow_widely:0 "Sow Widely"
MEX_sow_widely_desc:0 "Much of Mexican agriculture is horrifically inefficient, dominated by our nation's collective fascination with ejidos and the peasant ideal. It is in dire need of more agronomic planning, and less of Zapata's Plan de Ayala.\n\nBut our fledgling administration is not so foolish as to challenge a basic tenet of the Revolution. As much as it may pain Secretary of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Loyo González, we can simply buy off farmers and move on to more important matters. A few broad grants to support infrastructure in rural regions should do the trick."

It is in dire need of more agronomic planning, and less of Zapata's Plan de Ayala.\n\nBut our fledgling administration is not so foolish as to challenge a basic tenet of the Revolution. Instead we will leverage Secretary Loyo González's plan to further it, selectively. Ejidos that demonstrate the productivity and verve required to participate in international markets will receive grants to fund their expansion and mechanization. Technical assistance will be lavished upon them. The Green Revolution will march in lockstep with our own.\n\nAs for the rest, well, they can try to catch up."
MEX_march_through_the_sea:0 "March Through The Sea"
MEX_march_through_the_sea_desc:0 "Among President Cortines' most far-sighted initiatives was the 'March to the Sea', which supported an explosion of settlement and development along our coasts. These relatively empty regions were transformed into engines of prosperity, accelerating the Mexican Miracle as investment poured in from across the Pacific.\n\nIt is time to build upon his legacy through another vast round of investments into the infrastructure of our ports and the coastal cities that will provide their able workforce. With our efforts and his, Mexico will reclaim its centrality in global trade; the container ships of today plying the centuries-old routes of the treasure galleons."
march_through_the_sea_tbd:0 "We must decide an approach to §xforeign§! §Minvestment§! before we can determine the §Geffects§! of this focus."
MEX_moralization:0 "Moralization"
MEX_moralization_desc:0 "Mexican officialdom, whether housed in state or party, is far more concerned with stuffing crumbs in its pockets than executing our plans. They must pay a price for their lack of vision.\n\nPresident Cortines had a method for slashing away at these snarled tentacles of the Leviathan. His moralization campaigns publicized bureaucrats' and politicians' financial assets, firing the worst offenders of the Alemán years.\n\nThese campaigns will be resumed, restoring efficiency to our operations. Tweaks will be required, of course. Given the parasites' entrenchment, our assaults will need to be targeted. Selective even."
MEX_prioritization:0 "Prioritization"
MEX_prioritization_desc:0 "In addition to the ongoing menace of corruption, bloated and unwieldy bureaucracy impedes the proper functioning of Mexico's government. The application of modern management principles is a must if we are to turn it into a useful instrument.\n\nBut with limited time and limited funds, we must focus on sharpening the most vital parts of the Swiss army knife. Certain Secretariats, those most crucial to our mission of economic development, will be first to receive the whetstone: Hacienda and Public Credit, National Patrimony, Communications and Transport, and, of course, Industry and Commerce."
MEX_coordination:0 "Coordination"
MEX_coordination_desc:0 "While President Salinas Lozano has seen firsthand the bureaucratic morass that afflicts many of Mexico's Secretariats, reorganizing them is rightfully a matter to leave to the Secretaries themselves. He appointed capable professionals, and will trust them to see it through.\n\nNo, his concentration will be on something grander: creating a standardized, regular system of public reporting that is optimized for quantitative analysis. With statistical expert Loyo González serving as lead, a new era of transparency will arise in Mexico. An era where numbers provide the common tongue across our government, businesses domestic and foreign, and the great minds working in our universities."
MEX_modernization:0 "Modernization"
MEX_modernization_desc:0 "Gradually we make gains against corruption. Gradually we improve the structure of the state. But all that will be pointless if the administration remains staffed with incompetents whose only qualification is their fathers' former skill with a Mauser.\n\nA hiring surge is needed, one targeted at the sharp minds now at our universities, institutes, and businesses. These professionals will be paid commensurate with their ability, and supplied with the finest equipment in the world. For what is a technocrat without technology?"

MEX_rationalization:0 "Rationalization"
MEX_rationalization_desc:0 "Mexico's administration is not all that is in dire need of modernization. In the 1940s, the PRI established a system of quotas for representation in Congress and local government, allocating positions to each corporation to empower them and cement their loyalty. While successful, this quota system has ossified, without a change to reflect the vast demographic shifts since.\n\nWhile a true update, one which took into account our rapid urbanization, would be highly controversial among elements of our party, we can at least reallocate existing seats to align with modern patterns of development. No more will burgeoning towns and cities be governed by elderly CNC peasants. The metropolises of tomorrow deserve city planners whose knowledge of water and sewer infrastructure extends beyond the irrigation ditch."
MEX_nanahuatzin_initiative:0 "Nanahuatzin Initiative"
MEX_nanahuatzin_initiative_desc:0 "The state should be governed by cool rationality, but Salinas has spent enough time with captains of industry to know that most investments are not. A bewildering mix of hype, personal connections, and a dash of fundamentals determine where capital flows. To capture the immense sums of yen Mexico needs, we must seize the attention of every Nikkei reader in the Sphere.\n\nA massive conference in Guadalajara will summon CEOs from across Asia as guests of honor. They will be treated to striking imagery from Mexico's indigenous past; facts, figures, and feasts to show our business-friendly present; and the glorious future we could share together.\n\nThus begins the Nanahuatzin Initiative. For as that Aztec god knew, to rise as a new sun, one must first throw themself into the flame."
MEX_cost_benefit_analysis:0 "Cost-Benefit Analysis"
MEX_cost_benefit_analysis_desc:0 "Secretary Mena has earned our trust, and that of international creditors, by tempering bold developmentalism with an iron commitment to fiscal discipline. He now applies that same hard look to our economic outreach to the Sphere.\n\nIn line with our plans, he strongly supports opening trade offices to promote business ties, learn new techniques and technologies, and to help our firm break into Japanese markets. But, he argues, we should locate these trade offices solely in Japan.\n\nAs he sees it, our chief limitation is lack of capital, one which the other developing nations of the Sphere share. Only Japan is capital-rich, so let us economize our pesos and concentrate our few Japanese-speaking officials where they can do the most good."
MEX_true_co_prosperity:0 "True Co-Prosperity"
MEX_true_co_prosperity_desc:0 "In contrast to Mena, Secretary of Industry and Commerce Campos Salas proposes unfettered outreach to the Sphere. He agrees that trade offices beyond the archipelago are unlikely to pull in much capital in the near-term, but pitches broader openings as an investment in Mexico's future.\n\nIndonesia, where López Mateos laid such a strong foundation, Azad Hind, and the Republic of China are among the most populous countries on Earth, and would provide countless new buyers for Mexican goods as we develop in tandem. There is much to learn from Manchuria's heavy industry, while Guangdong designs wave after wave of innovative products. There is so much more to Asia than the Rising Sun, if only we'd look beyond its rays."

Especially at this early stage, we cannot afford to estrange our northern neighbor, our preeminent investor and trade partner.\n\nWho better to calm them than Salinas himself? The President will travel to Boston to speak at his alma mater, Harvard. Before illustrious academics and experts in international relations, he will lay out how time in New England inspired his vision of a prosperous and free Mexico. One where individuals can chase the American Dream as readily as counterparts across the border."

Secretary of External Relations Hugo B. Margáin is one of those rare technocrats as comfortable with a cocktail as with a calculator. He and his silver tongue will be dispatched to Washington at once to charm and flatter the Yanquis."

MEX_dont_fear_the_sphere_desc:0 "Even after our visit, it is clear that the US remains rattled by our deepening ties to Japan. As much as we desire a fully independent foreign policy, the economic and national security consequences of an enraged northern giant would be too much to bear.\n\nTo avoid any sudden flashpoints, we will meet with our US counterparts to learn of their red lines with regard to Japan. We will clarify that our interest remains primarily economic, and both parties can walk away feeling secure."
MEX_five_ring_circus:0 "Five Ring Circus"
MEX_five_ring_circus_desc:0 "López Mateos is inordinately proud of bringing the Olympics to Mexico in '68, a first for Latin America. Even if this is not central to our goal of developing the country, we should realize the dream of the man who has done so much for us.\n\nBesides, involving Mateos in the planning for the Games will keep him busy away from the political realm. We certainly don't need another Cárdenas sniping at us from the left.\n\nAnd who knows what commercial and diplomatic opportunities could result?"

MEX_concrete_benefits:0 "Concrete Benefits"
MEX_concrete_benefits_desc:0 "So many roads and so many airports are needed to accommodate the massive influx of tourists and athletes we expect for the Games. Modern hotel accommodations and gleaming urban centers are needed for Mexico to proudly bear the Torch.

MEX_new_heights:0 "New Heights"
MEX_new_heights_desc:0 "In our fencing match with the International Olympic Committee, their latest thrust is a concern that Mexico City is at too high an altitude to safely conduct the Games. We will deftly parry this blow, not with an épée but with a katana.\n\nOur friends and colleagues from Japan will be invited to participate in a 'Little Olympics' prior to the real thing. There, athletes will compete in a wide range of events, all the while undergoing rigorous medical testing by their own physicians.\n\nOnce the strong performances and healthy blood samples of a neutral third party are shown to the IOC, it will be us who have won the point."

MEX_an_experienced_coach_desc:0 "Every athlete, no matter how talented, can benefit from the experience of those who have competed before. In the same way, we can learn from Japan's experience in arranging the successful 1964 Olympic Games.\n\nOfficials who prepared the ceremonies, engineers who built their stadiums, athletes who built the mythos - we will engage all as consultants. Their advice and support will let us reach the heights of '64, and to go even farther."
MEX_aztechnology:0 "Aztechnology"

Find some players of that ball game they did. And call the Mexican Olympic Committee together - there's no time to waste!"
MEX_a_decent_start:0 "A Decent Start"
MEX_a_decent_start_desc:0 "We are already experiencing the benefits of competent, rational governance: an uptick in economic growth, improvements to our diplomatic position, and steady progress toward a successful Olympic Games.\n\nNevertheless, our room for action continues to be tightly circumscribed. For all its commitment to presidentialism, the PRI remains staffed with traditionalists and parasites that balk at our more radical plans. If all they can stomach is a second President Alemán or Cortines, then that is what Salinas must be.\n\nFor his sake, and Mexico's."

He will be replaced with a capable figure, one worthy of Salinas's trust.\n\nYet Echeverría was merely a reflection and defender of the PRI's mediocrity.

Japanese and US firms are scrambling to cancel their contracts, and Mena warns that our interest rates are poised to spike. Meanwhile, respectable citizens barricade themselves in their homes for fear of the Bolshevik menace. To secure our government, something must be done.\n\nWe will turn the dangerous edge on another latent enemy, demonstrating the reassuring breadth and depth of our control in the process.

MEX_Lozano.1.t:0 "Westward Overtures"
MEX_Lozano.1.desc:0 ""In this room, three generations of presidents," Salinas gestured happily at López Mateos and his predecessor, Adolfo Cortines, "and a cabinet of devoted public servants, put together our efforts to further Mexico's position on the world stage." Some looked on the president's pep talk with optimism, others with exhaustion.\n\n"Together, we are unstoppable. Let us finally begin with what Licenciado Cortines started and March to the Sea, hand-in-hand." Salinas awkwardly sat down, with the audience too small to clap though too large to respond personally. Adolfo Cortines, brought on to finish the project he started a decade prior, raised his hand to speak.\n\n"Your Excellency, a piece of advice, if I may. While I am grateful that you still see potential in me despite my age, and I am excited to work on this-" the former president carefully selected his words "-I would advise we exercise caution every step of the way."\n\nSalinas perked up. "No need to hold back, Cortines. You initiated this, it would be remiss if you did not share what you learned."\n\n"For one, an initiative like this carries a great risk of overspending - budget overruns must be avoided. In the same vein, corruption must be cracked down upon at all costs, especially in this sector. Ports, infrastructure," the nearly 75-year-old man seemed tired, yet determined. "All are ripe for embezzlement.""
MEX_Lozano.1.a:0 "Small risks to bear for the transformation of Mexico."
MEX_Lozano.1.a.tt:0 "The effects of the "March Through The Sea" focus will be more beneficial economically, but more expensive and pro-Japanese."
MEX_Lozano.1.b:0 "Wisdom is achieved through failure."
MEX_Lozano.1.b.tt:0 "The effects of the "March Through The Sea" focus will be more balanced."

MEX_Lozano.2.t:0 "A Signal to War"
MEX_Lozano.2.desc:0 "Salinas tapped his pen against his desk restlessly, waiting for the signal that the broadcast was about to start. So much was happening in so little time. He set up a man in a top position here, began policy discussions there, and started processes which, he hoped, might begin a transformation of Mexico into the modern wonder it deserved to be.\n\nThe music shifted as a speaker interrupted the broadcast. Salinas leaned forward against the desk and dropped his pen to listen. Here was one of those pieces fitting into place.\n\n"The new President of the National Executive Committee for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Licenciado Jesus Reyes Heroles, gave a speech at a party conference earlier this morning in which he outlined the new direction he hoped to take the party toward. We have been provided a small sample from the conference which we will now play for you all." A pause followed before Heroles' voice could be heard. He was about a third of the way through his speech, by Salinas' estimation. Good. That was precisely the clip that they were meant to share.\n\n"Modern times demand modern solutions, and our party has spent too long fighting against itself in search of what the right solution ought to be," Heroles began to say. "Change must come from inside the party and across our revolutionary spectrum, and this change will lead to a transformation of Mexican society into a society for the future." The broadcast cut there, and as they began a brief transition back to the music Salinas turned the broadcast off.\n\nPerfect, Salinas thought. That should put the conservatives on edge. Heroles was a reformer, albeit moderate, but he shared enough of Salinas's technocratic ideals that he was the perfect sword to cleave the old guard to pieces. As for his stances on unions, his harsher rhetoric might prove useful should the workers, or Fidel Velázquez especially, fight back against the country's necessary evolution. Salinas leaned back, content that all was going as expected."
MEX_Lozano.2.a:0 "Let the Old Guard tremble. Their time is ending."


MEX_Lozano.3.t:0 "Networking"
MEX_Lozano.3.desc:0 ""Major, might I introduce my associate, Raúl Salinas Lozano." Roberto Watanabe nodded first to Salinas, then back to the major. "Licenciado, meet my dear friend, Major Shunichi Onodera."\n\nSalinas smiled warmly as he shook hands with the Japanese man before him. He had been looking to expand his circle of contacts at the embassy, and it just so happened that Watanabe was willing to play the go between. "It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I must confess myself an ardent admirer of your great nation - I hope to be able to visit again soon."\n\n"The pleasure is all mine, Licenciado," replied Onodera in impeccable Mexican Spanish, meeting Salinas's gaze with a polite, yet subtly analytical look.

I must say it would be a most... pleasant development to see such a friendly face at the head of this country."\n\nSalinas agreed with the Major of course, but he still could not shake the feeling that the man was weighing him up, like a farmer eying a prize cow at a market sale. Regardless, the conversation between the two flowed for nearly an hour, and by the end Salinas felt that he and Onodera had established a proper connection.

Those gaps yawned even wider when comparing Mexican farmland to that of the US.\n\nBut that challenge was also an opportunity. Yields of crops and livestock could soar with the right investments. Hundreds of millions of pesos worth of tractors, harvesters, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers would all be needed. Entrepreneurial spirits could make a fortune, while providing full bellies and livelihoods for a growing nation.\n\nWhat a shame then that the cavernous hall was so empty. Many of the Sphere's captains of industry were attending a banquet with President Salinas himself, feasting on pozole and rich carne asada. Smaller fry had also dispersed, many to Guadalajara's restaurants to cement deals with each other and Mexican industrialists over sope de pollo and birria.\n\nBut a Nikkei reporter remained. Over his grumbling stomach, he managed to catch a phrase from Loyo González's translator. A phrase that would become a headline in Japan. In small print, on a back page. But a headline nonetheless."

All five of Guangdong's major corporations had made a presence on the convention floor, which flashed with neon and electronic lights, and buzzed the songs of a thousand machines. Paper lanterns, emphasising the exotic nature of the displays, were strung up in the hall, albeit in the green, white and red of the Mexican flag. Some booths promoted the latest in consumer electronics- there were radios, record players, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, answering machines, all sorts. López Matos himself put in a pre-order for one of Sony's new color televisions.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporations less specialised in consumer goods, such as Fujitsu and Hitachi, created elaborate demonstrations of their technical prowess. One demonstration by Hitachi featured a computer-created voice singing an disturbingly off-kilter version of the Mexican national anthem. One demonstration of Fujitsu's new line of so-called 'mini'-computers ran a game known as Bomber, in which the player controlled a vector graphic facsimile of an aircraft, whose speed and height were controlled by the player. The goal of the game involved dropping 'bombs', represented by vertical lines, on targets, upon targets, without crashing into the line-vector representing the ground and buildings.\n\nDespite all the engineering brilliance on display, López Mateos found the whole convention unnerving. Shortly after the Mexican Revolution commenced, a man from what would become Guangdong, Sun Yat-Sen, became the Republic of China's first president. His revolution, like theirs, was supposed to throw off an age of foreign domination and backwards corruption, making a better society for all. Fifty years on, however, his hometown had arguably become a glorified electronics factory. All the names of people running the booths and displays were Japanese, despite being from somewhere majority-Chinese. If Mexico was to cosy up to Japan, would this be their fate?"

Manchukuo was a society created to the models of technicians and economists like himself, and the region's rapid industrialisation spoke for itself. The Sphere promoted unity between peoples towards common prosperity, and Manchukuo's multicultural population and purported unity of Five Equal Peoples seemed like a prime expression of that aim.\n\nAs the playground of the reform bureaucrats, however, Manchukuo was something entirely different. The men with whom he met were blunt, exclusively Japanese, and their ways of economic thinking, while certainly effective for an autarkic military regime such as theirs, would never work for Mexico, whose economy thrived on the open market. Unlike the rest of the Sphere, Mexico held little in the way of goods their leaders desired, and trade with them always had to be conducted in cash, instead of in kind. While Japan, China, and the rest of the Sphere always seemed prepared to extend a warm hand to Latin America, Manchukuo gave little but a cold stare.\n\nAll the same, they built good machines, ones which could be put to great use to modernise Mexico. The frequency with which the salesmen talked about 'reduced fatalities' or use of materials designed to resist small arms fire didn't sit well with Salinas, but if the sacrifices had already been made, Mexico might as well take advantage. Still, the price seemed somewhat exorbitant..."

Over thousands of years, new peoples have come to Mexico, bringing new ideas, new technologies, new cultures, all creating something greater than the sum of its parts. Even the mighty Aztecs came to the Valley of Mexico from parts unknown, and what would we be without them?"\n\n"It makes me immensely proud, both as a Mexican and as someone of Japanese heritage, to see this noble tradition has continued. I cannot thank this great country enough for being somewhere my parents were able to emigrate, to raise a family, and to be successful in. Equally, I am proud to be a citizen of such an open, inviting country, which is always seeking to reinvent itself, and never resting on its laurels for a second.

It's time we get to work-" As Ortiz Mena began to make his exit from the meeting with Salinas, a voice cut him off. Next to him, a mildly displeased Campos Salas gave a last-ditch effort at thwarting his well-crafted plan.\n\n"Hold on, Licenciádo Mena." Mena let out a sigh. "You have failed to mention one key aspect."\n\n"And what might that be, Licenciádo Salas?"\n\n"The location of the offices. We can't just put them anywhere, you know. Our focus is finite, and must be accounted for."\n\nOrtiz Mena was caught off guard, but only for a moment. This was an obvious stunt, and planning hadn't even reached that stage yet. It will now, Mena thought. This act of theater cannot go unpunished.\n\nQuickly going through the options in his head, he thought back to the initial plan. What were the floated ideas, again? Ports or factories..."

MEX_Lozano.25.desc:0 "Enriqueta Basilio jogged to a stop after her fourth lap around the track and took a seat on a steel bench, gulping warm water from her canteen. She had been training for the Caribbean Games since the winter, and Enriqueta had proven herself to be a skilled sprinter since arriving in Mexico City in early February. Still, it was a stiff competition and the Cuban and West Indies track teams were as formidable as ever.\n\nA sharp blast from a whistle stirred the young athlete from her thoughts. She joined the rest of her team in flocking around a particularly harried looking coach Figueroa by the bleachers.\n\n"I have News for you all!" he began, "As of next week, some of Japan's finest athletes will be joining us here in Mexico City for the games this summer." a wave of murmurs rippled through the crowd before the coach continued. "To tell you the truth, I'm just as surprised as you, this morning was the first I'd heard of it. The Olympic Committee wants to make sure people aren't going to drop dead from competing at high altitudes, and His Excellency Raúl Salinas Lozano has invited a team from Japan to investigate the health concerns. The only thing this means to me is you'll have to train twice as hard as you have been. The playing field just got a lot wider. Now get back to it!"\n\nBefore Enriqueta could return to her warm up, her friend María emerged from the dispersing crowd.\n\n"Can you believe it? Having another team from across the world dropped on us at the last minute just like that?"\n\n"Nothing we can do about it now." Enriqueta replied. "Like coach Figueroa said, train harder than ever and beat them in the games.""

All that remained was the pumping of thin, muscular limbs and the rushing of blood behind her ears. Four seconds. The slowest runners drop behind. Seven seconds. Enriqueta pulls ahead. So does the Japanese sprinter in the next lane. Ten seconds. The Japanese Sprinter takes the lead. Twelve seconds. She crosses the finish line. Japan will take home the gold for the women's 100 meter sprint. A quarter of a second later and Enriqueta crosses the finish line. The world returns to Enriqueta again. The roar of the crowd. The blinding white glow of the floodlights. The dark sky above her.\n\nWhile Enriqueta stopped to catch her breath, the Japanese sprinter approached her, waving and smiling. Remembering coach Figueroa's etiquette lessons, Enriqueta gave a quick bow, which the other woman returned. She said something in Japanese. Enriqueta blinked. The other runner laughed a little, then pointed to herself and said,\n\n"Mitsuo."\n\n"Enriqueta." she replied with a smile, returning the gesture. Enriqueta congratulated Mitsuo on her victory. She wasn't sure if it passed the language barrier. Mitsuo spoke again and Enriqueta could only pick out a single word. Orinpikku. At that Enriqueta smiled broadly and nodded. It was a question, she could tell that much. It seemed like Mitsuo planned on being there too."

Leather plates covered their head, chest, and hands, while their faces were shielded with a rounded metal grille. Their hands clutched straight bamboo sticks with the distinctive round handguard of the katana. With their sloping shoulder pads and flowing wide legged pants, they looked like parodies of samurai. The pair were preparing for a kendo match. The sport had been added to the list of games around the time that Japan was invited to compete. Mexico's athletes were hopelessly outclassed. They had performed well against the teams of the other countries in the games, sure, but their opponents had careers that could be measured in months. Not the case with Japan.\n\n"Enriqueta!" hearing her name, she turned and spotted Mitsuo making her way across the bleachers towards her. The two had become fast friends in the days following their race, with the help of crude sketches on clipboards where gestures failed. It wasn't easy, but they enjoyed the challenge even with the occasional miscommunication. Mitsuo had barely sat down before the three referees began moving below them. Each one grabbed two flags, one red for Mexico, and one white for Japan. They formed a circle around the athletes and called for the match to begin.\n\nThe two men began circling each other slowly, bamboo swords pointed forward. The Mexican kendoka saw an opening first. Or at least he thought he did. He gave a short yell and slashed at the other man's head. Clack! The other man deftly parried his strike before the sword even got close. Before he could recover, the Japanese athlete struck him on the top of his head. All three referees raised their white flag, awarding him a point. In the stands, Enriqueta and Mitsuo giggled at Mexico's poor showing. The match was over mercifully quickly. 3 points for Japan. 0 for Mexico."

President Raúl Salinas Lozano greeted his fellow travelers with a smile as they entered, single-file through its doors. He chortled and backslapped as he led them to a laden and lustrous dining table. Though in the meal that followed, he barely partook - his eyes glowed instead as he surveyed the team he had assembled:\n\nOrtiz Mena, a financial mastermind and polymath, the man who would make the budget numbers add up and then multiply them tenfold. Campos Salas, perhaps the only man capable of filling Lozano's own shoes as Secretary of Industry and Commerce, who had been vital to the success they had achieved there together. Margain, an academic with the intellect and dexterity to ensure investment poured from across both the Pacific and Rio Bravo. Loyo González, a statistics legend who would sharpen every policy to pinpoint precision. Uruchurtu, the Iron Regent who had led Mexico City through an explosion of industrial growth and urban development.\n\nThe men themselves largely mirrored their President's silence, if not his satisfied smile. Uruchurtu sat somewhat at a distance from his fellow Secretaries, while Ortiz Mena and Campos Salas seemed to be avoiding each other's eyes. Margain gamely tried to start a conversation but it soon slowed.\n\nAn accidental clink of fork on plate awakened Salinas from his reverie, and he stood to speak. "I am pleased to welcome you here, for no men are better suited to govern Mexico. I will be brief - you all are consummate professionals and have my full trust and support. Today begins our work, and today begins a new era for Mexico.""

Lozano cited the efficiencies that Echeverría had brought to Mexico's security services as sub-Secretary, and expressed his confidence that Luis could further them in his new role. Echeverría shared his own confidence that Lozano's developmentalist vision would swell the state's coffers - making his own task far easier.\n\nLozano offered Echeverría a fine cigar, and, over a seemingly contented puff, remarked that he knew he had chosen the right man. But he knew, and Echeverría knew, that there hadn't been a choice at all.\n\nNotes from Fidel Velázquez of the CTM and former President López Mateos himself had 'recommended' that Echeverría be given the role. A firm hand to replace Ordaz's. But the Secretary was not their pawn or proxy, no.\n\nThere was too much venom in his words, too much ambition in his eyes."

After twelve hours of grueling patrols and the occasional ticket, the officer's stomach yearned for his wife's cooking - his only respite that such a day could provide. Though instead of being able to return home, he was instead called into headquarters to receive a "motivational" speech from the new head of the Department of the Federal District: Gustavo Díaz Ordaz.\n\n"Motivational, my ass," the officer whispered under his breath. And his coworker next to him let out a silent chuckle through his nose. The only thing motivating him was his paycheck.\n\nThe officer's mind trailed back to his imminent meal, but something got in the way. He looked at Ordaz pacing back and forth on the stage, his booming voice speaking of the importance of their work as officers, their work in preventing crime and how it benefits the entire republic or something.\n\nWhy was he talking so damn loud? He was in front of a few dozen officers in a medium-sized room, not on the campaign trail in front of thousands. What should have been a few minutes of motivation turned into a fifteen-minute speech, and the officer went from inconvenienced, to angry. Leaning over to his coworker again, he whispered:"

At present, this change is opposed by the bulk of our party," Salinas intoned, being met with an awkward silence.\n\nThe President's stare was returned by rigid reformists, needed to bulk the cabinet beyond his own narrow clique. Secretary of Public Works Javier Barros Sierra sat silently with evident skepticism, while Secretary of the Presidency Emilio Martínez kept his own face studiously blank. Salinas gave God a quick thanks that at least he had not been forced to bring on Carlos A. Madrazo, that raving loon.\n\n"Your Excellency, I will deliver the social programs our citizens need, in line with your plans. Our philosophical differences over governance or the meaning of the Revolution will not impede that," Sierra said, mouth forming the thinnest of smiles.\n\nSeeing Salinas' shock, Jesús Reyes Heroles, President of the PRI stepped in, "Perhaps we ought to begin by sticking to concrete commonalities, rather than ascending to those heights. I know that we're in accord regarding the regrettable state of corporatism in our country." Salinas nodded his head in approval. "CNOP in particular has grown inefficient and internally incoherent. An appropriate mix of forward-thinking individuals from our party's wings will help refine it as an instrument of our Revolution. Any names come to mind?""

How could they seize control quickly? Now the technocrats stood poised to welcome Japanese imperialists deeper onto Mexican soil, roll back López Mateos' welfare programs, and hold down the wages of the working man at the behest of the industrialist backers. Perhaps it was all his fault...\n\nEven after the whole Nava debacle, he still had many allies throughout the states, and was making new ones in his new role as senator. That said, men that he thought staunch reformists had been peeled away by Salinas. Sierra and Manautou had betrayed the cause and the Mexican people by accepting positions in the new government.\n\nYet, as Madrazo sat there, beside stunning portraits of revolutionaries before him, and long rows of bookshelves that outshone many a library, he knew that he had a long battle coming. A senator had limited formal powers, but his voice and the leftist Tabasco militancy would carry far. He would decry the technocrats' corruption, their elitism, and their ignorance of the Revolution."

Listen carefully to his advice and you'll have your hand on the pulse of the working class."\n\nLozano could feel his lips curling in distaste. Addressing this high-school dropout as Licenciado.

That was their campaign promise, at least.\n\nNow with the wheel in hand, putting such words into action would turn out to be a lot harder.\n\n"Gentlemen, I know many of us have ambitious, much-needed plans to turn this country around." Salinas paced around the room as the rest sat down, his footsteps breaking up the silence between his monologues. "But right now, we should focus on workshopping. Trial and error is what makes good policy, so I encourage you all to plan such actions in stages, beginning with local-level pilot programs."\n\nThe men in the room knew the unspoken truth, and could see behind the president's words. This "trial and error" he spoke of was not in reference to policy, but to poking the bear that was the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

The tired airport worker peered outside the window from his seat. He had been dropped over a half-mile away from the normal stop outside Guadalajara airport. "Shit, I'm going to be late," he muttered to himself, stepping out onto the boulevard.\n\nShuffling his way through the winding makeshift detours and scaffolding, Emilio's attempt to get to work on time was futile. At least everyone else has to deal with the same thing, he thought. As he passed by dozens of workers manning excavators, drills, and cement mixers, the dust permeating the air met an unlucky breeze, flying straight into his mouth and eyes, with Emilio holding his now-dirty shirt to his face as he coughed.\n\n"All this better be worth it," he muttered to himself.

That eagerness had become a barely disguised horror.\n\nUnder the guise of support, Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare Blas Chumacero had weaseled his way onto the meeting invitation. His support consisted of haltingly reading aloud a list of demands from every organized labor body, or more specifically their charro leaders, from La Paz to Tuxtla.\n\nMeeting Uruchurtu's agreeing eyes, Salinas cut in, "Thank you for your input, Secretary Chumacero. If you were to send that document to Secretary Uruchurtu and I following the meeting, we'd take its contents into consideration."\n\n"Oh I certainly will, Your Excellency. But it was the preference of the CTM that we discuss these matters personally. Let's see..." his finger found a resting point on the second page, "the regional STRFM is, uh, wants to participate in the expanded rail line to Guadalajara. Their, um, professional experience would help understand the labor experience on the, um, ground.

The miniscule formality seemed almost insulting. "I see your little quota reform has gone off - without a hitch, too, thanks to our cooperation. Congratulations." The air grew thick with tension. "By my assessments, I believe them to be enough as well. Any more might come at risk to the health of the corporations, wouldn't you think?"\n\n"Of course, General Secretary Velázquez.

I saw a nation willing to recognize the tragedies of its past, but determined to break free of their grip."\n\n"My neighbors and my friends, Mexico is still breaking the chains of its despotisms and poverty. It is breaking them through its ever-growing, ever-evolving Revolution.

A corrido, notes held a little longer and a little softer than usual, emanated from the tuxedoed band.\n\nEvery ten minutes or so, a full belly of a laugh would cut through the contented chatter. Secretary Hugo B. Margáin had coaxed a joke out of yet another official, replied in kind, and then, smiling, always smiling, drifted away to another priority target. In the rare circumstances where he was cornered into a belligerent discussion of favoritism toward Japanese firms under the Salinas administration, he would give as good as he got for a few minutes before his wife, Margarita Charles, would sally to his rescue with a new hand to shake and a new American ally to secure.\n\nIn this cocoon of an embassy, as the champagne became tequilas and meats became flan, words like 'smuggling' or 'infiltration' seemed so far away.

Taking a moment to register his successor in the room with him, the president looks up in surprise.\n\n"Oh, Raúl." A small smile draws across his face.

Neto wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, letting it fall on his calloused palms as he looked over, squinting slightly to avoid the sun's harsh glare shooting into his eyes. The foreman was bespectacled and carried a pretty timid demeanour; even the acoustics of the megaphone could not conceal the fragility and awkward tremor of his voice. Neto snuck a glance at his friend Cacho, who returned a mock roll of the eyes. "Workers..." The foreman began, reading off a crumpled note. "...your country depends on you. You are building the nation of tomorrow. We, Mexicans, are the people of endeavour..."\n\nNeto could hear a pin drop. The gathered crowd of labourers looked dismal, each face caked in grime and dust and betraying little appreciation for "the nation of tomorrow", "people of endeavour", or whatever nonsense the man was rattling about. The managers behind the foreman, meanwhile, furled their arms.\n\nThen, a jeep pulled through the gate, a pair of attendants pulling it open for it to pass through. The engine hummed, carrying three plain clothes men and another in pinstripe, complemented by shaded eyeglasses. Don Fidel Velázquez brushed some dust off his lapel and made his way to the no man's land between the workers and managers. "Friends, there'll be no slacking around. What is good for the capital is good for you and me, and you have a job to do. The sooner the Olympic Village is built, the sooner our wonderful athletes will be living in them. Let's get on with it!"\n\nDon Fidel paraded up and down for a moment. The workers hurriedly scrambled to their stations in an oddly orderly fashion, but Neto and Cacho lingered for a second.

Half the damned things that had come his way didn't even seem to have anything to do with the Olympics. He stretched his cramping hand, and reached for his pen to start writing again. Before he could begin, his desk phone rang. He picked it up.\n\n"Echeverría?" It was López Mateos.

Every day more papers came in, and no matter how fast he worked, he would end up with more than he started with. Not that López Mateos was in the mood to hear it. The roar from the phone began again.

Don't make me wait any longer."\n\n"Of course, Licenciado Mateos. I'll have the visas approved by the end of the week." The line went dead, and Echeverría slammed the handset down.

Takada was just one of a small army of officials employed by the Mexican government to prepare the city for the competition. It wasn't terribly exciting work, but it paid well and he got along with his colleagues. It was almost enough to make up from being half a world away from his wife and children. Almost. Saying goodbye to his coworkers, he took the elevator down to the lobby and stepped out into the cool evening. The man in the gray suit was waiting by the entrance again. Takada watched him as he flicked his cigarette to the ground and stamped it out. When Takada turned south towards the streetcar stop. The man followed.\n\nThat was the catch. He missed his family of course, but that was something he could tolerate. At least for a time. The stone-faced men in impeccably tailored suits that followed him back to his apartment every night were a different matter. They were never far behind him, and they didn't make much of an effort to conceal themselves. They didn't need to. He knew they were DFS men. A coworker told him over drinks on Friday evening a few weeks after he had arrived. They were being watched that night too.\n\nHe sat in silence on the ride home. When his stop came, he got off, followed closely by the man in the gray suit. By the time he reached his apartment, he was starting to hyperventilate. He jammed the key into the lock with shaking hands, stepped inside and slammed the door. After double checking that it was locked, he downed a shot of tequila, and dialed his wife's phone number.\n\n"Haru?"He asked, voice shaking.\n\n"Ichirō? What's wrong?"\n\n"I'm coming home on the next flight to Osaka. Every fucking night they follow me home and just watch me! All day at work I'm stuck thinking that this will be the day they grab me off the street for who knows what! I just can't be here anymore. I can't be here."

The day had finally come for President Salinas to unveil the scale model of the Olympic Stadium. López Mateos was, on some level, disappointed to see the project pass from his hands. It had been his ambition that had brought the Olympics to Mexico, after all. But he had picked Salinas for a reason, and trusted that, if nothing else, his vision for the games would be unique. Echeverría, on the other hand, had no such faith in the new president.\n\nAt last, the time came to reveal the project. Salinas stepped toward the table and cleared his throat. "Gentlemen? May I have your attention?" The conversations in the room stopped. "Four centuries ago Mexico was ruled by a great empire born on the shores of Lake Texcoco. Today, Mexico takes her rightful place on the world stage. I am honored to present the final design for our Olympic Stadium, one that will honor our past, and shine a light into our prosperous future."\n\nSalinas gave the cotton sheet a tug, and revealed the model. Its silhouette was thoroughly modern; a sweeping poured concrete structure with clean lines and gentle curves. It was punctuated here and there by repeating geometric motifs carved into dark granite ornament. Nearly every flat surface was covered in garish paintings imitating the pages of Aztec codices. It took the Committee some time before they realized the murals were supposed to depict episodes from Mexico's history. It was truly hideous. Seconds passed. Someone in the crowd stifled a laugh. López Mateos managed to keep a straight face. Barely. Echeverría made no such concessions to tact.\n\n"Is this some kind of joke?" All eyes in the room turned to him. "Time and time again you have stalled on land reform, and you have left the peasants to fight for scraps! Now you show us this... this butchering of Nahua art and expect us to take pride in everything we have stolen from them? This is disgusting, Salinas!" Echeverría stormed out of the conference room before Salinas could respond. He turned to the assembled committee and gave a tight-lipped smile.\n\n"You must forgive my colleague, he has been quite busy lately. I'm sure the stress is getting to him.""

Now the man's limp, light form was slung over Rodrigo's shoulder and the blood from his head leaking down Rodrigo's back.\n\nThe roar of the truck's motor grew as Rodrigo approached. How many trucks had there been at the military depot? How many depots across the country? How many peo- Communists were in the back of this truck, in all the trucks across Mexico? He tried to count six - eight - ten as he flung the wizened body to join them. They were too many for him, squirming and screaming and crying and - and bleeding. And he sealed the canvas again, blood from his hand smearing it.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw a ramshackle door creak closed. The people of Rosita were watching. It could have been a gun. He wanted to scream that it could have been a gun.\n\nBut the PJF officer with the list called out through a megaphone that they were done. And so Rodrigo, stomach knotted, rejoined his company. And all the long, bumpy drive to the Guadalajara military camp, to the dark pits where they would throw these Communists, he could see the red-stained canvas, flapping in the wind."

While your expertise in coordinating with the CTM is unmatched, I am seeking someone with greater administrative, technical, and leadership skills to align the Labor Secretariat and our security services amidst an evolving landscape of threats.\n\nTo ensure you may continue to fully utilize your abilities in service of our nation, I have arranged your appointment as CTM representative to an ejido in the territory of Quintana Roo. You will play a pivotal role in promoting the success of a presently-impoverished and isolated community of over forty people as they seek to thrive within the undeveloped jungle of the Yucatán. I look forward to regular reports on your progress in this critical assignment.\n\nAdditionally, in recognition of your unparalleled efforts on behalf of the Mexican worker and the limits they have imposed on your time for formal academic pursuits, I have recommended to UNAM that you be granted a Doctorate in Literature and Theatrical Arts immediately. The ceremony will be televised at three this afternoon, and, while I cannot be present in person, know that I am smiling as I watch you achieve this significant milestone.\n\nMy best wishes for your future success,"

For myself, and for the others. You're taking on great risk-"\n\nVillanueva waved his hand, "Oh, it's nothing, nothing. I have always said that professionals such as yourself must get out of the Federal District, experience the Revolution's peasant soul. Especially in the current climate..." He plucked a guava from a roadside tree, "I am always looking for talented personnel for the CNC, and recent events made a whole crop of them available."\n\nHe tossed the guava to Moya, who looked down at it incredulously. Moya shook his head, "Secretary General, Salinas is... a deeply vengeful man. His purges descended to mere analysts that Licenciado Echeverría had brought on. When he grasps what you've done-"\n\nThe tree's slight branch quivered as Villanueva pulled another guava free. He turned to his colleague, no, his subordinate, and said, "Licenciado Echeverría believed in the peasants of this land, in what the Revolution can and must mean for them. I hold no illusions about the strength of the forces of reaction if they could fell him. But the banner Echeverría bore - of 'Tierra y Libertad', cannot fall with him."

These quota revisions had merely been the last offense in a long line. So when Echeverría presented a viable successor and a generous 'retirement package', the way had been clear.\n\nIn his short time in Congress, Villanueva had made a name for himself and a plethora of allies. His previous stint working in the Secretariat of the Interior had been similarly successful, building the network of bureaucratic connections that would make him an effective agent. Seeking out Echeverría's tutelage had certainly helped in both areas. Heh, his skill in the backroom appeared matched by his ability at the podium, just listen...\n\n"The peasant is and will always be the heart of the Mexican nation", Villanueva thundered. "The source and spirit of the Revolution, the humble campesino must be the foremost focus of our administration and elevated as an example to the others that dwell in the land he sustains. I, and the entire CNC, will work with unmitigated vigor to alleviate the poverty of the peasants, bolster their strength in their fight against predatory foreign agribusinesses, and be their loudest voice in the Federal District."\n\nMusic to Echeverría's ears."

While nominally independent, Beltrán couldn't help but let a more opinionated piece come out in the wake of the change in president.\n\nThe anthropologist once more returns to the task. "Historically, the indigenous communities in the North and South have always been interfered with, from relocation, infrastructure work, and urbanization, there has always been something."\n\n"With this new administration, it seems this facade of caring has been dropped. Though is this really a bad thing? All the indigenous communities have ever wanted was to be left alone, to be autonomous. And this 'hands-off' approach might just be what's needed. No chance for conflict, no bureaucratic mess, or anything of the sort.\n\n"Despite what the leftist so-called 'indigenous advocates' might argue, 'benign neglect' could, if pursued sincerely, result in some of the best indigenous relations we have seen in years.""

Their opinions broadened the more people he met. One young member even considered a 'Socialistic' revolution necessary to ensure the Revolution's survival. Even with significant differences, the one thing they shared was belief in the Revolution and trust in the PRI system. Unfortunately for his associates, the Salinas presidency had slowed their progress and slowly tore away their confidence. Approaching the stage, his speech was imprinted in his head, ready to be executed.\n\n"Long live the Revolution, my dear companions! We strive for our collective freedom and equality, and the cause has served us perpetually. Yet, what is the true meaning of the Revolution, when the corrupt elite continues to seize our democratic rights that we fought for?"\n\n"Revolutionary democracy doesn't come without cost, something we have all know. The appointment of corrupt careerists to government has turned into a disaster in our struggle for liberty. In that same vein, it wasn't us militants who elected its leadership, it was the elite. It is they who continue to take our rights for granted. It is they who have eroded the promise of President Cárdenas's corporations. And it is they who will try and fail to end the Revolution!"\n\nFollowing a wave of applause, he prepared for the last section of his speech.

Every cranny was crammed with legislators, all intriguing and maneuvering to gain the favorable attention of the three men who could secure their careers. The three men packed tight into this windowless orange corner.\n\nEcheverría, who had beckoned them into these cramped quarters following the rubber-stamping of the national security strategy, began, "Your Excellency, Licenciado Reyes Heroles, my secretary's outreach seemed to be falling on deaf ears, so I decided to take the opportunity to meet with you directly. We are encountering a serious breach of party discipline - Senator Madrazo has taken to holding rallies in multiple states, condemning our party's processes for selecting candidates. So far, he is blaming unnamed 'elites', but his targeting of Your Excellency's prerogative is clear to the listener."\n\nJesús Reyes Heroles, PRI party president, grimaced, "Senator Madrazo is out of line. Your Excellency, I have a fair working relationship with him, and will arrange a meeting to put a stop to this."\n\nPresident Salinas, who had been futzing with a cigar half-extracted from his pocket, opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off by Echeverría, "Respectfully, I doubt our radical colleague will respond to any warning, even yours Licenciado. We can halt his activities more effectively by alerting the relevant governors. Madrazo's rhetoric would deprive them of their role in selecting candidates for state positions, so I'm sure they'd be quite eager to see his 'speeches' canceled."\n\nSalinas finagled the cigar into his mouth at last.

Proof. His events were cancelled left and right by the orders of various Governors, and there was proof that the administration was actively trying to silence his voice.\n\nIn the end, the attempt in making him unheard only served to bolster the movement of reform, to yell louder than the party could try to drown out.

"While our party's candidate selection process has shortcomings, airing your grievances to our membership is unacceptable. If you have concerns, bring them to me in my role as President of the CEN."\n\nThe Cyclone prepared to thunder, but Reyes Heroles' firm stare seemed to hold him back. Madrazo managed to muster, "The PRI's militancy has been sidelined for too long. If they have no role in choosing our candidates, they have no reason to be excited come election day."\n\nReyes Heroles frowned and knit his hands together, "If that was the issue, you should have come to me sooner. All the more so because your doubts could have been quickly assuaged. My staff and I will shortly be releasing a directive to increase the militancy's role in local PRI committees. Too often, we find our party's corporate arms overlooking the insights of our most committed supporters."\n\nMadrazo's eyes narrowed at this meager offering.

A group of children laughing as they raced each other home, the future of the nation inside of them. It's undeniable that loyalty should be rewarded, that those devout to the party and revolution should get their fair dues.\n\nBut, by doing so, did he betray those at the forefront of reform, did he, as they put it, undervalue their studies? Push them down and let the old party members step above them?\n\nHe looked at the mirror again and at himself. The students hated him.

The crowd became louder, the fires burning brighter.\n\n"You, who are vastly under-represented because of these quotas. It is a shame, an outrage.

Something that can be done quickly. Make sure the different teams aren't aware of each other. The group that turns up empty-handed is that one that will have your leaker.""

The Secretary of the Interior declined the offered chair, then produced a sealed envelope from a suit pocket.\n\n"Ordaz and the Federal District Police have uncovered some disturbing information." Echeverría tossed the envelope onto the desk, where Salinas unsealed it and began scanning the document. "An official in the Secretary of the Interior, one that you had recommended for promotion, has been passing confidential police information to the Gulf Smugglers."\n\n"This is quite a serious accusation. But I can assure you he will be dealt with appropriately."\n\n"I should hope so." Echeverría said before marching out of the office. Salinas glanced down at the letter again. If everything it said were true, it would be quite damning for the young bureaucrat. If it were true. There were many ways that plans for an operation could leak. It may only be necessary to find a more discreet position for the accused official. Of course, the possibility that Ordaz had falsified the evidence to confirm his own beliefs did not escape the president's calculations."

Takahata Genzō, engineer. Shigematsu Kazuko, Japanese language instructor. Hernán Moreno, hotel owner. Ernesto Ortiz, student activist. All suspected agents of Japanese intel network S Kikan. Since the Cold War had started, there had been Japanese spies in Mexico, but the Federal District now seemed more infested with foreign operatives than ever. Ordaz carefully folded the documents and tucked them into an envelope. He grabbed a copy of El Universal off his desk, slipped the letter between two pages, and left his office for lunch cradling the newspaper under his arm.\n\nOrdaz stepped out from the ornate stone archways of the city council building onto the Zócalo. He headed south along the colonial stone and stucco avenues before arriving at a small café occupying the bottom floor of a newer brick and cement office block. He ordered a coffee and took a seat, setting the newspaper down in front of him.\n\n"Gustavo!" Ordaz looked up. A middle-aged American with slicked back silver hair and eternally-pursed lips was walking over to him.\n\n"Winston Scott, it's good to see you!" Ordaz replied with a toothy grin, before standing and embracing the man. "How's the embassy been?"\n\n"Busier every day."\n\n"Doesn't sound too different from the city hall. Come, sit." Ordaz pointed to the empty chair across the table. "Have you read the news today?" Winston shook his head. "More arrests at the University of Chilpancingo last night. A bunch of ACG members in a Marxist reading group. You can have my copy, I already read it." Ordaz slid it towards Winston, who glanced at the front page approvingly.\n\n"Serves 'em right."

I've had the Federal District Police monitoring his location. Just this week he's been seen meeting with five different S Kikan members at a known front organization. Winston scowled.\n\n"He's been busy."\n\n"Extremely. And that's not the worst of it. I've seen the man on the Zócalo myself. He was heading toward the National Palace."

MEX_Lozano_Plotting.19.desc:0 "The report on Salinas' desk described what seems to be an attempt at antagonizing the President. The damned Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, Blas Chumacero, had decided to commission palatial union halls in the growing industrial areas that both Salinas and Mena had worked hard to establish.\n\nSince the start of his presidency, he knew that selecting Chumacero as the STPS was a terrible mistake. The only reason that lackey got a position was to appease the Velázquez wolf. Salinas was disgusted at the fact that an idiot held power in his government. And now that idiot was aggrandizing himself at the expense of public coffers, a leech upon Mexican prosperity.\n\nStill, he had to remember the reason that Chumacero is STPS. Velázquez had significant influence over the workers in the industrial areas, agitating him could turn out to be dangerous. He pondered the dilemma as his internal rage calmed down."

President Salinas thought to himself that he would order the Presidential General Staff to redact his schedule, to protect him from the national security risk that was Secretary Blas Chumacero.\n\nProffered in Chumacero's outstretched hands, amidst interminable subliterate babble, was an envelope. Salinas seized and ripped it open, anything to clear this human barrier. From CTM Secretary General Fidel Velázquez, of course.\n\nSalinas skimmed as Blas blabbered on, a fleck of the Secretary's spittle landing on the page. Velázquez's letter 'requested' that the original plans for the union halls be restored. Apparently, Salinas's proposed cuts were "the wrong signal to send" at a time when "Mexican workers mistakenly feel that the administration is not prioritizing their needs." These cavernous union halls were apparently "necessary to improve the morale and organization of laborers." This was especially vital "to sustain the pace of infrastructure construction to meet Your Excellency's targets for industrialization and Olympics preparation."\n\nEven speed-reading while being berated by a buffoon, Salinas could recognize a threat. A threat the CTM head could make good on.\n\nSalinas raised his head with as much dignity as he could muster, "The General Secretary's points have caused me to reconsider. Move ahead with the union halls in the scale you originally planned."\n\nThe President turned on his heels and set off the way he came, leaving Chumacero gawking at his sudden retreat."

But the buildings, those must have been what truly astounded the Spaniards as they arrived in Tenochtitlan. The Templo Mayor, stretching across the earth and reaching up into the heavens...\n\nHis 2:30 rapped lightly on the door. Mena. "Come in," said Salinas, facing out the window for a moment more.\n\nSecretary Ortiz Mena surveyed his wistful President for a moment before dispelling those spectral revelries with a simple, "It's Chumacero." Salinas' face darkened and he gestured to the chair waiting for the financier as he took his own. Mena continued, "Your Excellency, these union halls of his are egregiously over-budget. I have compared every material, labor, and land cost in the Secretary's submitted budgets with comparable infrastructure projects in the past ten years, and found ranges four to twenty-five times the previous averages. This minor project is becoming a rapid and unnecessary drain on the Treasury."\n\nSalinas closed his eyes and rubbed his temples before responding, "And are these monstrosities even being built at all?"\n\n"I've confirmed that the hall in Uruapan is genuinely proceeding, with Chumacero reporting ahead of schedule progress across all sites. If we cut off funding, as we should, our new industrial centers will unfortunately be strewn with half-built shells," replied Mena.\n\nSalinas grimaced and cast a longing glimpse to the window. No answers arrived from the past, the Aztecs never had to deal with Fidel Velázquez and his pocket-stuffing puppet. Otherwise Tenochtitlan would have remained just a dream, bitterly remembered."

MEX_Lozano_Plotting.24.desc: "Ever since Blas Chumacero heard the news from Zacatecas he just wouldn't stop talking about it. A metalworkers' union in that state had turfed a charro, a CTM-affiliated union leader, and elected their own leader. This posed an obvious problem, being reminiscent of Vallejos and the rail strikes of 1958 and 1959, but Chumacero had other things to talk about by now, having only mentioned "that Nazi-fascist communist Vallejos" once in passing.\n\nSalinas Lozano looked up from his papers. Yes, Chumacero was still ranting. On and on the man rambled, indefatigable in the face of his decreasing coherence or the lack of enthusiasm increasingly visible in the faces of the people in the room.\n\n"These communist scum are going to destroy us all—" He slammed his fist on the table twice for emphasis. "—and if they carry on like this the next thing we know we'll be handed over to the Germans to be hung upside down from a swastika." Salinas actually wanted to spit out his coffee at that last oratorical flourish. Sometimes Blas Chumacero's ... "rhetorical genius" was truly frightening. Sighing at the lost opportunity for humour, Salinas instead gestured for silence and asked a question.\n\n"Alright, Secretary Chumacero, I get that something is wrong. But what do you need us to do about it?"\n\nAt that Chumacero raised his hand in a pathetic attempt at reassurance. "No, no, there is no need for any intervention. I can handle it myself."\n\nSalinas had a flash of inspiration. He could use this to tie his annoying subordinate up, could he not? Weighing his options, he decided to-"

It is an open secret. He has colluded with management to excess. Moreover, anyone that asks him even the most basic questions about metalworking will find that he knows nothing at all about it. This incompetence is no doubt the proximate cause behind the severe extent of safety violations on his watch.\n\nI have determined the following solution. This syndicate leader will be put back in office by Secretary Chumacero, then resign immediately. A better candidate with proper knowledge will then have to be sought out.

I write to assure you that there is no need to waste the time of your diligent subordinates in a matter as petty as this.\n\nThough the support of the DFS is certainly necessary in situations of national stringency or external subversion, a matter of disorder in a single union in a single city does not require the sort of effort that our security apparatus can be relied upon to provide. The matter of an illegal removal of a syndicate leader and his replacement with some charlatan can safely be left to the CTM.

Why do I hear shouting?"\n\nChumacero was somehow no more incoherent than he had been while ranting about it in Chapultepec.

Give me the order - I'll see it done!"\n\nThe best response Salinas could muster was condescension. "Secretary, you need to take a few minutes to breathe while I come up with a solution."

Take two aspirin and call me in five minutes."\n\nPutting the phone down, Salinas steepled his fingers. Looking at Gutiérrez to his right, who had barely retained a blank expression while listening to Chumacero's screeching, he said: "There's two choices." Gutiérrez nodded for him to continue. "Either A, I let him go in with the police like he's fantasizing about. It'll discredit him, ideally. Or else B, I just dictate terms to him."\n\nThe DFS director was noncommittal.

They then set about fulfilling Chumacero's threat to arrest every last labourer that had supported the elected union leader to the letter. One by one they were arrested. Some were prudent and went quietly, others were given the stick until they submitted, and a few were knocked unconscious.\n\nA groan of despair went up as some of the workers realised that their elected leader had been taken away in a separate vehicle. Once that had taken place, mopping the rest of the workers up was done without issue. Blackleg workers, CTM loyalists, and other assorted strikebreakers then followed the legitimate charro back into the factory and got back to work.\n\nAs order was slowly but surely restored, according to the brutal plans of Secretary Blas Chumacero, the managers of the factory looked at him with a newfound respect in their eyes.

She and the rest of the interns were the ones delivering babies, nursing the sick, caring for the near-dead, and the only thanks they were getting were neglect from the public and a paltry wage from management.\n\nIt was barely enough to live on.\n\nThree doctors from the local chapter of the AMM emerged from the building, urging caution and telling them all to go home. It wasn't a good time, they said, and the interns would be able to get what they wanted if they met with management and talked things out sensibly. A few of the interns seemed inclined to agree, shifting awkwardly from foot to foot, looking to go home, be anywhere but here, doe-eyed - but what was that she saw poking beneath one of their sleeves? A gold-plated Seiko, slowly ticking and leering with all its arrogant veneer.\n\n"That talking must have worked out for you alright! You're selling out!"\n\nLupita pointed, jostled against some of her colleagues and pointed out the gaudy watch. Those among them, previously apathetic, roused in anger, with fists tightened and accusatory fingers in tow. A particularly pointed threat about skulls being knocked together sent the three doctors scurrying back to the Civil Hospital with only jeers from the picket line for fanfare."

Just a year ago, none of them could have afforded a seat there. But then they won. They brought the managers to heel. Formal contracts of employment were drawn up. There would be no more surprise late night shifts, and they would be compensated generously for their labor.\n\n"It still doesn't feel real." Lupita said to her co-worker, Raquel. "Like I'm going to wake up on that gurney again." Lupita's lips spread into a devilish grin. "I'll never forget the look on our manager's face when he signed my contract."\n\n"Did he do that thing with his mouth for you, too?" Raquel asked, stretching her face into an exaggerated grimace. Lupita laughed and nodded. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a waiter carrying several bottles of wine. He uncorked them with a series of soft thoomps and filled their glasses. When he left, Lupita grabbed the stemmed cup and raised it above her head.\n\n"To President Salinas! The man who made us rich!""

But as Lupita saw her nametag slowly burn to a crisp it was only the physical representation of the much more horrid immolation done to her.\n\nPresident Salinas and the AMM had struck the match.\n\nThe President she did not care for. But the doctors were her mentors, her idols, and in the days when hope still crossed her heart Lupita had hoped to become one of them.\n\nShe could've saved lives. Made a difference.\n\nNow Lupita and her friends have no fight left in them.\n\nNow she has nothing.\n\nNow she is nothing."

"I invite the delegates who met with the President to make their findings known to the rest of the AMM congress."\n\nShort, bespectacled, one doctor stood before the rest of his peers, clutching a white paper docket. He cleared his throat to the sound of absolute silence, each and every eye trained on him for a smidgen of good news, something their campaign of fair pay and fair treatment had been spurned at every turn.\n\n"President Lozano expressed his sympathies with the AMM, saying that middle-class professionals like ourselves deserve better treatment," he paused, scanning over some bullet-pointed figures, "and he has issued a set of concrete promises."\n\nMurmured satisfaction surged through the room. "The reinstatement of our Christmas bonus, a two-percent pay rise, and a special inquiry as to the management of hospitals nationwide."\n\nFervorous applause. A standing ovation. Colleagues embraced.\n\nThen the double doors violently swung open, striking the wall with a resounding clap. A young intern, holding a copy of the day's news for dear life, shouted above all the celebration, drawing all bemused eyes on him. He turned the paper so the headline - PRESIDENT DENOUNCES STRIKING DOCTORS - was clearly visible. "He says we're a bunch of violent saboteurs!"\n\nIn absolute pandemonium, the doctors who had previously been basking in their fresh victory began to yell, heckle, and riot."

The café door unlocked with a soft click. A young, handsome man in a doctor's coat and fake glasses stepped in from the cool, rainy night.\n\n"Take those glasses off. They almost make you look literate," Omar said with a smirk. "Sit down, Edwin. What do you have for me?"\n\nEdwin sat, though the glasses remained perched defiantly on his nose. "You won't believe it," Edwin said, grinning, "The doctors put me in the press wing." Omar's bushy eyebrows shot up. "Yeah. I have the whole itinerary. Upcoming strikes, official meetings, I even got leads on chapters that are still getting organized. The way I see it, we have two ways we could use this information. We could focus on disrupting the formation of new chapters outside the Federal District, or we could target the core of the movement here in the capital."\n\nOmar scratched at his graying mustache. "Are you sure this will work? I don't want to be responsible for approving this if it blows up in my face."\n\n"So you'd throw away a career-making operation instead?" Edwin asked. "They're doctors, not insurgents. They don't have experience doing this kind of organization. They won't know what's happening even after it's done.""

"It took a while to get everyone on board at the meeting. We had a big vote. They want me to call the AMM tonight to officially register the Toluca chapter." She watched her family eat, then pushed her bowl away and excused herself. She wasn't hungry.\n\nTeófila grabbed the AMM newsletter from her coat by the door and walked to the phone in the kitchen. She dialed the number on the back for the union's office in the Federal District. The phone rang. Static. It rang again. Static. Ring. Somewhere, impossibly distant- Ring. Voices in a sea of white noise.\n\n"Hello?" Said the soft-voiced AMM receptionist. Silence again. Static and whispers through the landline. Teófila slammed the handset back into the receiver, and the bell inside gave a sharp ring in response. She flinched when she saw Manuel standing in the doorway. "Honey, is everything all right?"

The intern tore the missive free from its envelope. The dispatch, typed on stolen AMMRI stationery, declared that the AMM had grown too complacent to meet the goals of the strike. The AMMRI would, according to the letter, disavow the organization, and pursue more radical paths to progress.\n\nDoctor Herrada pushed his way through the crowd. Even when she wasn't looking behind her, she could feel the gaze of the man in the bug-eyed aviators boring into the back of her skull. The agent had been following her ever since she left the AMM meeting. And she wasn't even one of the radical members! If all it took to get stalked by federal agents was asking for better pay, Doctor Herrada began to wonder if she wouldn't be safer if she left the organization.\n\nValentina trudged up three flights of stairs to her apartment. It had been a grueling shift, and every muscle in her body ached. Nothing excited her more than the prospect of collapsing into bed. She unlocked the door, stepped inside, and turned on the lights. Dead ahead, on the kitchen table, metal glinted in the dim light. Someone had driven a scalpel a full inch into the dark wood. Sleep did not come to Valentina that night.\n\n"I motion to prohibit the use of the word 'intern' to describe our profession! It's a term that refuses to grant dignity to us and our livelihoods!" Agent Derbez proclaimed. Immediately he was met with quizzical looks and glares. The motion was denied. "Even here, our superiors deny us a voice when our demands become inconvenient! I motion to-""

The appointed intern leader edged forward, questioning his counterpart from the AMM.\n\n"We have opened a permanent line of communication with President Lozano's government-"\n\nA few interns gasped, scoffed. Their leader blinked.\n\n"I thought the whole point of this strike was to promote the idea of labour being an independent force, not one that has to rely on the government. You do realise this will change nothing, no?" He rapped his knuckles on the table.\n\n"This may be our only chance to gain any concessions!" pleaded the AMM man.\n\nThe leading intern stood, proverbially shaking the dust from his feet, beckoning his colleagues to rise with him.

Any man worth his salt checked, and rechecked, what he would be deployed with before the mission starts, and this was no different to any other. Well, that was a lie.\n\nThey were greeted by their equipment; pallets of bottled water, non-perishable foodstuffs, masks, placards, markers. "Tell me-" The first man, Julio, said to the other, "-why the hell are we helping the protestors?"\n\n"I thought we would be crushing the agitators, too." The second, senior, agent, Ramón said as he rummaged through all of it to do a quick inventory. "But this is a very sensitive operation, and we're their man on the inside."\n\n"Was there any specifics with how much help we needed to give them?" The junior looked towards the signs and markers, picking up a black marker and flicking through the stacks of poster boards.\n\n"No." The senior didn't bother to look again at the other material in the chamber. "So, we can just pick up the bare essentials, food, water, and the masks, that the agitators will be grateful for; who can turn down water with the sun beating down on them all day?"\n\nJulio looked towards his senior, then back the posters, then back to Ramón before letting his opinion decide the course of the mission."

El Sol was not kind to the people in the Ciudad de Mexico, and he was not kind to those chanting slogans and protesting the days earlier. But they kept refusing the grip of giving in and stopping. They had to.\n\nAn hour past noon, maybe. His spirit held the best it can, but the body was revolting each second of torture, being put down by the memories of why they were here in the first place, before flaring back up again. He refused to be broken under the most rigid of-\n\n"Sir, you look a bit pale. Need some water?" A man, holding a now half-empty packet of water bottles, held one up to him. Who was he to refuse? The protestor quickly thanked him before drowning his doubts without any room for error. "We also brought some food for you all, solidarity with the strikers, you know?"\n\nThe man continued on his way offering food and drink, and the agitators of the AMM quickly relished in the opportunity to continue fully rejuvenated, though for the AMMRI strikers...\n\n"Sorry, I don't recognize you."\n\n"No thanks, don't need it."\n\n"You're being awfully kind, don't you think?"\n\nThe man frowned as he walked past all of them.

Ramón, Julio's superior, had begrudgingly agreed to his idea to hand off their placards in person instead of doing it through an intermediary. Instead, they looked like fools.\n\n"We're getting out of here, Julio-"\n\nOne of the doctors, an older man, balding, sauntered by and perused their selection. "May I have one?" He was obliged, handed the crinkled cardboard which he inspected for a moment. He practically guffawed.\n\n"20 de NO-viembre? More Pay on Doctor's Day? This is a load of shit and you know it! What department are you from, officers?"\n\nJulio bolted it, hitting his foot off the box and spilling the rest of the placards out onto the tarmac.

MEX_Lozano_DS.17.desc:0 "Edwin watched from behind his fake spectacles as yet another round of vicious debate swept through the AMM convention. The doctors and interns were at each other's throats again. Edwin wondered how quickly this could have been settled if they could just agree on a single goal. But they wouldn't. Or couldn't. And so the affair ground on into its fifth month with no end in sight.\n\nAn intern stood. "We need to take action that the government can't ignore! All we've done is show Salinas he can wait us out! I motion to begin the organization of another march on the National Palace!" Murmurs quickly blossomed into lively argument.\n\n"Quiet!" The chairman shouted. Edwin almost felt sorry for the poor bastard having to wrangle these people. Almost. "The floor is open for debate." A graying doctor rose to his feet and put forward a suggestion about limiting the demonstrations to hospital campuses in the Federal District. Inoffensive, but uninspiring. Think fast, Edwin. He adjusted his glasses, and rose to his feet.\n\n"Uh, I'm with Dr. Barrena. We're underpaid and overworked, but that doesn't mean we should act, ah, impulsively. I don't think we need any reminders about what happened to the railroad workers in '59." The doctors nodded and whispered agreements. "Broken corpses in the street don't get paid, and they don't take any consolation in the fact that they didn't compromise either." Edwin sat. The dispute spread like fire through a dry field, and the chairman called for a vote. It failed handily. There would be no march on the Zócalo."

MEX_Lozano_DS.18.desc:0 ""That's right, perfect. Now, keep sitting up straight, like I said. Nobody wants to read about a slouching doctor. Could you wrap that stethoscope around your neck?" The quick-talking photographer's camera flashed with every comment directed to his subject. The subject in question was Dr. Pedro Ximenez, head of the Otolaryngology department of a prestigious hospital in Morelos. Doctor Ximenez was an older man, close to retirement. He was respected in the AMM more as an academic than a political advocate. He had published many prestigious works pertaining to the care of ENT patients. Now, however, he strained to sit up straight on the cold metal stool the self-appointed photojournalist had provided for him. He had only agreed to get his photo taken since he felt that his perspective might help his fellow AMM members if their movement's message got published in the newspaper, state-run or not.\n\n"Are you sure the stethoscope is necessary? It seems disingenuous since I almost never use one in my work." It was difficult for Ximenez to understand the cavalcade of instructions with the noisy audience. An array of PRI sycophants and box tickers had stuffed themselves into the small office to watch the photo session. All eyes were on the doctors of Mexico, and for all the wrong reasons. "Gentlemen, I was wondering when we will begin the interview. I have some very compelling data that you might like to see..."\n\nThe PRI bureaucrats surrounded the photographer to discuss how to best frame the doctor for their bosses. They were more interested in how the scene looked than actually listening to the veteran medical professional. If a picture is worth a thousand words then this headline portrait would be a manifesto of support to the PRI.\n\n"We'll get right to you, Sir. For now, just give us a big smile.""

MEX_Lozano_DS.19.desc:0 "Salinas refilled his snifter with brandy and leaned against his desk. A frown etched itself into his face as he returned his attention to the heads of the IMSS and the ISSSTE. The meeting had begun hours ago, when the sun still shone on the Zócalo. Now, the windows opened only to the murky night. The broad strokes of their strategy had been settled: One final concession to bring the doctors back into the fold. All that was left was to hammer out the details.\n\n"A one-time cash bonus for the doctors," the IMSS head suggested as he snubbed another cigarette into Salinas's overflowing ashtray. "And guaranteed yearly raises going forward. They're as exhausted as we are, all they need is a nudge in the right direction."\n\n"The core of the issue," interjected the ISSSTE head, "has always been poor working conditions for the R/Is. If you want to end the strike, major structural changes will have to be made to the IMSS and the ISSSTE to ensure that the interns cannot be radicalized again. Otherwise all we will have done is kick our problems ten years down the road."\n\nSalinas returned to his chair "I think," he said, "that we should consider absorbing the AMM into the CNOP." Wide eyes and stunned silence from the healthcare men. "The time for half-measures has come and gone. If we want a permanent solution, we must acknowledge that the AMM is an organization of educated professionals, capable of representing themselves. The medical unions in the CNOP are staffed by ancient careerists with no interest in representing the people they are supposed to serve." The healthcare directors were quick to regroup and voice their objections. Salinas knew the CNOP would put up stiffer resistance. Perhaps a less divisive plan would suffice."
MEX_Lozano_DS.19.a:0 "The IMSS plan will do perfectly well."
