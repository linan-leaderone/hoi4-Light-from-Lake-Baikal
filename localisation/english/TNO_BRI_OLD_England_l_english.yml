ENG_Alec_Douglas_Home_hog_desc:0 "§YPrime Minister\nControlled Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LThe Royal Party before Alec Douglas-Home's ascension to the leadership was a disparate band of squabbling malcontents held together by fear of the Reich's Garrison cracking down on them. It was home who picked up the pieces in the aftermath of Mountbatten's death, it was Home that persuaded Macmillan and Chesterton to put aside their differences in the name of good government. Now Alec Douglas-Home leads England because he is the only man who can, and because he knows deep in his heart that his homeland will not survive another war with Germany.§!"

Supportive of collaboration over resistance from the earliest days of the occupation, Butler maneuvered himself into a position of authority at last in the Douglas-Home government, and in the government of his successor Thatcher, Butler has continued to be a voice of moderation and conservatism. This natural inclination away from conflict with the Reich has caused him to be labelled a puppet for German and business interests by some, yet in reality Rab Butler wants an England which will survive the troubles which face it without ceasing to be the land in which he grew up. Something he will ensure by any means necessary.§!"

Born on January 17th of 1918, to Lord-Mayor of London, his family had been given the role of Baronet. Like many of the other MPs, he had served in the Second World War in North Africa before being recalled back to the British Isles in a doomed defence of the island. After the war, he had been employed at the now state-owned Lloyds of London working as an underwriter. Soon after, however, he left to pursue a life in politics. He had won the election in Leeds Northeast, placing a new face in the government. Soon after he had joined the government, he had met Margaret Thatcher. The two MPs who had begun to make waves. After the ashes of the English Civil War had settled, Keith has found himself in a new spot, the Deputy Prime Minister under Margaret Thatcher. Now, he prepares to make waves of his own.§!"

ENG_Own_Peoples_Hate:0 "Our Own People's Hate"
ENG_Own_Peoples_Hate_desc:0 "The Douglas-Home Government has the distinction of being the only government to last more than four years since the end of the war with Germany. Unfortunately, it is not popular with a good many of the people it rules despite this. The exact reasons vary, from perceived illegitimacy to discontent with the state of England and even the simple desire to avenge those killed by the Germans or the Collaborationist Government. This lack of public support limits the government's ability to meaningfully pass legislation as the Royal Party and its factions rest on the knife's edge of becoming outright despised by an otherwise apathetic population. Fixing this will be a challenge to say the least."

ENG_HMMLR_desc:0 "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance has been a persistent annoyance for over a decade, absorbing the communist and rogue military units which formed the majority of the Resistance to government authority pre-London Uprising. Evidence suggests however that the organisation formed mere moments after our surrender to Germany, and their worrisome ability to stay largely undetected in their machinations limits our own capability to respond. In addition HMMLR is believed to have a significant number of former high military personnel in its ranks in addition to regular terrorists, which raises the question of whether they intend more direct action against us some day."

ENG_Across_The_Channel:0 "Across the Channel"
ENG_Across_The_Channel_desc:0 "England is less than 40 kilometres from the German Reich across the English Channel, and despite our best efforts they have maintained the continued necessity of their garrison in Cornwall, keeping a hand ever ready to strike. The treaty signed at the end of the war mandates that we limit not only the size of our military but its composition too, with strictly limited numbers of tanks and aircraft and a similarly restricted navy in a grotesque parody of the Treaty of Versailles. But whilst the Germans have insisted upon keeping the treaty strictly enforced there remains the possibility that if the situation in Germania or England were to change that this could be superseded."

ENG_Lying_In_Ruins_desc:0 "The German bombing raids were devastating to our economy during the war, and our severance from America and our former colonies has not helped matters, to say nothing of the fact that we no longer hold the British Isles either. There had been signs of recovery before the Germans own economic collapse in the 50's, but at the present time the English economy is even in the most generous of terms, dead in the water. This causes a not insignificant amount of unrest amongst the general public, where unemployment is high and contributes to the volatility of our populace. Should this be fixed however it would be a major relief to our government."

ENG_consolidating_forces_desc:0 "Everything has led up to this. The years of preparations, failed attempts, and rising tensions have all been nothing but a prelude to today. With the Germans busy with their own collapse, it is imperative that we seize the initiative, and make one last effort to put an end to the collaborator regime and send the criminals which have crushed us beneath their German jackboots right to where they belong.\n\nOf course, we have not been as prepared as we would have hoped. Our divisions continue to work with limited organization at best, and our army as a whole still needs time to consolidate, and bring themselves up to acceptable fighting conditions, at least before they can put these dogs six feet under."

ENG_disorganized_ranks:0 "Disorganized Ranks"
ENG_disorganized_ranks_desc:0 "The Army of England has always been greatly weakened by the treaty of London, never failing in its ambitions of keeping the English weak. Now, however, in its time of need, this useless executive action from Germany has led to our armed forces being caught completely off guard by the attacks of the HMMLR organization, and unprepared to put a stop to its mass uprising. Even now, the exact number of those who fight on our side is yet to be determined, and what remains of our professional armed forces are disorganized and further weakened by the partisan attacks of the Resistance. While consolidating our forces will certainly not take long, we still need time to ensure organization within the army. Only time will tell if it is sufficient to put these rebellious dogs down."

As our brave London officers descended on the quiet suburb of Bexley, the remants of the attack painted a vile picture. Four people were killed by the massive explosion, including Trobbard's recently hired groundskeeper. Just across the street laid a dark beret with a winged dagger, leaving no questions as to the involvement of the SAS in this evil attack.\n\nMonths of heavy crackdowns on the rebels have not halted these disgusting acts of violence, with them becoming so frequent Londoners are beginning to refer to them as "dinner bell bombings." There is no question that we are in a struggle for all that is good and moral on these Isles, and if we do not decisively move to cut off the head of the terrorist snake then the murder of innocent men and women will simply become a fact of life."

On the outskirts of Brentwood, an armory left lightly defended due to increasing violence in the capital was subject to brutal assault by communist forces. In the dark hours of night, multiple men in red berets shot the few members posted for security with their revolvers, then proceeded to ransack the armory's interior.\n\nAs dawn broke and the reds receded to their dank holes, our army was left to survey the damage. As we feared, dozens of assault rifles, rocket launchers, and bulletproof vests were taken, while what couldn't be taken was left heavily damaged by what appeared to be a cluster of pipe bombs. A crude hammer and sickle was spray painted on the armory's rear, leaving us knowing only the vile creed of these bastards. One member of the security detail is now in questioning, stating that he saw the attack occuring from a distance as he'd gone to the hills for...bodily needs. There are no answers here, only a clear need to put out these fires and get our house in order."

The Northern General, while unfortunately not killed in the explosion, was severely injured and would have almost certainly died had there not been an ambulance called by his neighbors. We can be certain that Templer will pose no threat to us for the immediate future, and resistance no longer needs to fear his brutality."

This forced our people to defend themselves, and a gunfight broke out. The short-lived battle killed some of Templer's detail, but failed to wound the Northern General.

After extensive planning, we launched the operation.\n\nThe results could not have been better. Our forces were able to successfully neutralize the few guards that were stationed, and rapidly secure the exits, allowing us to bring in our own trucks, which were loaded up with guns, grenades, and other small arms for the Resistance.

Worse was that as we began the raid, a team of Germans made an unexpected stop at the depot, and immediately called for reinforcements when they saw what was happening.

Both men were completely unprepared for the attack as our team of resistance soldiers stormed the headquarters, killing the exterior guards.

Let's go over the plans.\n\nOur greatest chance at victory comes with a breakthrough in the border regions. If we get through, the Scots will fall, and we'll be in Edinburgh within the fortnight. That's how it's worked in every battle ever. One side gets through, and they wipe out the other. And we expect this war to be no different.\n\nFirst, our task is preparing our forces for the job. We can put together a unit of mountain troops for the job. Mostly loyalists from Scotland. Their job is to break through. Once they're set up, we'll launch a border war to see if the Scots are up to task. If they aren't, we're going to do what Hitler couldn't and finally break their lines."
ENG_Scotland_unification.8.a:0 "Let's get ready, then."

ENG_Scotland_unification.9.t:0 "The 52nd Lowlanders"
ENG_Scotland_unification.9.desc:0 "In the North Pennines, a special unit gathers. Men from Scotland, disaffected by the recent political trends in the country. Men familiar with the terrain of the country. Men skilled in mountain warfare.\n\nThe 52nd Lowlanders is the title of this new unit. Its name is a joke, referencing the 51st Highlanders, the premier division of the Scottish military. Only this time they are working for the English. And they are prepared to test their skill with their more famous rival."
ENG_Scotland_unification.9.a:0 "They will get that opportunity."

ENG_Scotland_unification.10.t:0 "Look Before You Leap"
ENG_Scotland_unification.10.desc:0 "Prime Minister, everything is set up. The 52nd is ready, and our forces are deployed at the border. We're now facing off against Scotland, and they're not blinking. And war will break off any day now. It's time for a little test.\n\nIn a certain area of the border, there's an area where the fencing is not clearly marked. We will attack a Scottish patrol there when it comes around. It will be backed up with artillery and massive divisional support. It's vague enough that nobody can quite blame us, and it will allow us to actually test the Scottish defences before we have to move in. Of course, the downside is that it actually starts a war, but we expected it at this point."
ENG_Scotland_unification.10.a:0 "Let's hope they're lacking."

ENG_Scotland_unification.11.t:0 "Scapa Flow"
ENG_Scotland_unification.11.desc:0 "Since Haakon IV of Norway anchored there in 1263, Scapa Flow, in the Orkneys, has been favored as a safe and convenient place to park one's fleet. Its strategic location to block the North Sea was noticed by the Royal Navy in 1905, and it thus became the location of the Home Fleet. Perhaps the most famous event at the location was the mass scuttling of German warships after the First World War. Its distance from German airfields again made it a prime location to base the Royal Navy when the second one broke out.\n\nToday, it's the prime naval base for Scotland. Their Gibraltar, so to speak. The central lynchpin of their defence. From there, they can block the North Sea and clear their coasts with ease. It is the point from which their entire armed forces is based around."
ENG_Scotland_unification.11.a:0 "And we're going to knock it out."

ENG_Scotland_unification.12.t:0 "Friends From Within"
ENG_Scotland_unification.12.desc:0 "We are not without our friends in Scotland. There are plenty of people of English ancestry up there, who wish to reunite with their homeland once again. And some Scots are still Unionists. These forces help us gather intelligence about various Scottish deployments and other information. Some of it involving Scapa Flow has proven especially interesting.\n\nThe Scottish Navy typically runs exercises in the day. However, at night, they are based in the harbor. An attack on them will yield devastating consequences at that time. We could be able to destroy or damage a great amount of their fleet before they could do anything. And the garrison on the islands is so weak, we could take it without too much trouble."
ENG_Scotland_unification.12.a:0 "Let's go, then."

ENG_Scotland_unification.13.t:0 "Zero Hour"
ENG_Scotland_unification.13.desc:0 "At 1:15 AM, the islands were awakened.\n\nThe English navy, coming in from the east, opened up with a massive barrage of anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The Scottish Fleet was caught completely unaware at the port. Many ships were hit in the initial barrage. Those that tried to escape found English submarines outside, waiting for them. When the English closed the gap, they were able to add their cannons to the fight.\n\nAt the same time, on the north of the island, English marines and special forces landed at Inganess Bay, with the objective of seizing the airport there. More forces landed at the Bay of Berstane and the Bay of Meil, pushing into the town of Kirkwall. The garrison there was completely overwhelmed, forced to retreat to the town center to put up a stand around the police station.\n\nAs day rose, and more forces were airlifted in from Newcastle, it was obvious how the night had gone. The Scottish had been defeated. The English flag once again flew over Scapa Flow and the Orkneys.\n\nAnd a new war on the isle had begun."
ENG_Scotland_unification.13.a:0 "We're in it now."

ENG_Scotland_unification.14.t:0 "The Anglo-Scottish War"
ENG_Scotland_unification.14.desc:0 "The entire island is consumed by sirens. From Wick to Dover, civilians crowd into air-raid shelters, fearful of enemy air attacks. Children are being taught to use gas masks, and sent away to the countryside. Homeowners are told to set up shelters in the bottom of their homes to escape the enemy air attacks. Those especially close to the front lines are begged to stay in place, least they clog the roads for fighting men.\n\nThe border regions, so long a scene of tense, yet quiet, tranquility is now rattled by the sounds of machine guns and artillery fire. Scottish and English cannons attempt to hit the other side, while thousands of guns cover the ground, mowing down anyone who dares cross the lines or poke his head up. In an instant, the piece of British countryside has turned into Verdun.\n\nWas this avoidable? Could this have been prevented with some sensible decisions? Likely. But common sense has not prevailed. And now the isle has been embroiled in yet another bloody war.\n\nWe may only pray that we emerge victorious."
ENG_Scotland_unification.14.a:0 "God save England!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.15.t:0 "The Talks Begin"
ENG_Scotland_unification.15.desc:0 "In Edinburgh, a room is full of people. On one side sits a group of English diplomats. On the other, officials of the Scottish government. They look at eachother, sizing each other up. They have to. Things are just too important to not pay attention.\n\nThe negotiations for the future of Scotland have begun. Will Scotland enter England as an equal partner? Will the original arrangement with Scotland in the Act of Union be maintained? Or will something in-between be agreed to? It remains to be seen. But one thing is for certain: if negotiations fail here, a war will surely break out between the two nations."
ENG_Scotland_unification.15.a:0 "Let's do this."

ENG_Scotland_unification.16.t:0 "Our Opening Offer"
ENG_Scotland_unification.16.desc:0 "Let's start with an opening proposal. Now, the ideal situation is we end up where Scotland was under the Act of Union. Obviously, that would be more than acceptable to us, and is something reasonable we can ask for. We couldn't give the Scots a worse deal than they once had, they would reject it outright anyway.\n\nOf course, they probably won't like this one either. They will, in all likelihood, ask for something a bit better on their end. We should be prepared to receive this notice, and think about our next steps. But you aren't just going to annex an independent nation without giving them some autonomy in return. This isn't the 1930s."
ENG_Scotland_unification.16.a:0 "You have to start with something."

ENG_Scotland_unification.17.t:0 "The Original Union"
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.desc:0 ""So here's our proposal," says the English negotiator. "You can come in under the Acts of Union from 1707. Your laws can remain the same, your parliament still exists. And you get representation in London. That's a good deal, right? Especially considering the bloody Germans are off the island.\n\nLook, we're doing you a favor. We could press for worse, but we won't. We respect your independence, and we're not trying to just march over you and do to you what the Germans did to the Czechs. So we're offering a chance to make the deal your ancestors did and get together with no issues whatsoever. It worked well for them, didn't it?""
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.a:0 "I guess that's good."
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.b:0 "How about we be a real Union of Equals instead?"

ENG_Scotland_unification.18.t:0 "They Went For It!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.18.desc:0 "Jubilation went through the streets of London as word got out of the deal that had been reached with Scotland. They had agreed to the same Acts of Union they had signed in 1707, no more, no less.\n\nThe people cheered when the PM came out to make the announcement. Without a doubt, it was a major victory for the government, and all of England. Scotland was back. And England could now call itself Britain once again, and with all honesty."
ENG_Scotland_unification.18.a:0 "Same as it ever was!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.19.t:0 "Counter-offer"
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.desc:0 ""Do you mean to insult me?" asks the Scottish negotiator. "Nobody is going to agree to become a puppet of London up here. Not after we've had freedom for so long. We want more than just the status quo. Far more.\n\nWe'll keep our own parliament, and our own elections. English laws stop at the border as well, we'll take care of our own business. Taxation will be left up to us. And massive protections for our language must be left in as well. You want a Union, then it's going to have to be a Union of Equals.""
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.a:0 "Okay, that's fine..."
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.b:0 "How about a Scottish Council instead?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.c:0 "You can have some limited autonomy."

ENG_Scotland_unification.20.t:0 "Proposal Accepted!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.20.desc:0 "The English had no choice but to accept our demands. Every single one. And that is the best possible outcome we could have gotten out of the situation.\n\nScotland will join England, yes. But it will join England with an enormous degree of autonomy. We have complete control over our domestic affairs and laws. We can do what we want, and London's authority stops at the border. Scotland will be ruled by its people forevermore, and nothing in England can prevent this.\n\nSome may mourn the nominal loss of independence. But there's nothing that really makes it a terrible issue for us. We have control over our affairs. We can have our democratic system maintained. Scotland's people are truly free and will be forevermore.\n\nWith this deal, we guarantee a free Scotland with London's respect."
ENG_Scotland_unification.20.a:0 "We won."

ENG_Scotland_unification.21.t:0 "Why Do I Cry On My Wedding Day?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.21.desc:0 "Scotland is ours again. That's the important part. So why does it feel that nobody's celebrating?\n\nThey have full control over all domestic matters. They exacted a heavy toll from England to join up. And they still have their own government. All things that make the deal seem more like a giveaway rather than a deal between two equal partners.\n\nScotland is a part of England now. Britain has been reformed.\n\nBut England had to bend the knee to them for it to happen."
ENG_Scotland_unification.21.a:0 "We still have control, don't we?"

ENG_Scotland_unification.22.t:0 "The Scottish Council"
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.desc:0 ""No, we're not going to give you complete autonomy," says the English negotiator. "Are you serious? Nothing would get done! And how could we be a union if neither of us can have a final say? Have you seen Iberia?\n\nWe'll give you something close to that, though. You can have a Scottish Council. You elect the people you want to the council, and they can make decisions. If there's something minor that we have that doesn't work up here, you can change it. But certain major things get decided in London. And, yes, you still have representation in London.\n\nIt's really the best of both worlds. You get to make your own decisions, and we get to have somebody with the final say if things get heated. You really aren't going to do any better than that, can you?""
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.a:0 "Sounds good, let's do it."
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.b:0 "We need more."

ENG_Scotland_unification.23.t:0 "Equal Exchange"
ENG_Scotland_unification.23.desc:0 "Two things are happening today. Both in Edinburgh. And both at the same time.\n\nAt the Redford Cavalry and Infantry Barracks, a group of 51st Highlanders stand outside, looking at a flagpole. A group of press and onlookers are standing outside the Scottish Government Building as well, looking at two flagpoles instead. One has nothing flying, while the one to the left has Saint Andrew's Cross.\n\nWhile an army band plays the Scottish National Anthem, the Scottish flag at Redford is taken down. The soldiers look on in silence. Some cry. Others keep a stern face throughout. Then, the band strikes a new tune. And another flag is raised up the pole.\n\nAt the same time, the same song is played in front of the Scottish Government Building. And the same flag is being hoisted. The emotions are a lot less subdued here. Some cry, while others cheer. It is a sad event, but there is a silver lining to it.\n\nThe song is the English National Anthem. The Flag is the one of a united isle. And at the end of the song, the flag is flying all the way up. England has gained control over the Scottish military. And Scotland has its own council."
ENG_Scotland_unification.23.a:0 "Jolly good!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.24.t:0 "In my defence..."
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.desc:0 ""A council would work," says the Scottish negotiator. "That's acceptable. But there's a problem. How would we defend ourselves?\n\nScotland is in a unique situation. One which requires a degree of military force. We have been in occasional tense situations with the Kriegsmarine in the North Sea. It's not out of the possibility that they may seek to invade us. And where would we be if all the forces are in the South? We need our own militia to defend ourselves with.""
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.a:0 "Alright, you can have that, I guess."
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.b:0 "No, you have to accept the offer we gave you, or else!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.25.t:0 "As good as we got"
ENG_Scotland_unification.25.desc:0 "We fought for everything we could. We demanded everything. But they refused to budge on certain things. And at the end of the day, nobody wanted a war.\n\nThe deal with England isn't the best we could have gotten. There are certain things we had to give up. But it isn't the worst deal we could have gotten, either. We still have things that help guarantee a better future for the people of Scotland.\n\nAt the end of the day, we forced the English to negotiate with us as equals. Even if we are now in a Union once again, we held strong and forced them to compromise. And perhaps that will be our finest legacy, after years of hatred between us."
ENG_Scotland_unification.25.a:0 "We drove the hardest we could."

ENG_Scotland_unification.26.t:0 "We Won, Didn't We?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.26.desc:0 "Yes, we did. But was it worth the cost?\n\nScotland is part of England. We can form something like the UK again. And that should be an accomplishment. But for many people, the way we went about it makes it feel like a bit of a capitulation.\n\nScotland is ours. But it has a high degree of autonomy. So much so that one wonders if it was really worth it. Worth it to surrender English pride and honor for this deal.\n\nBut it's not the worst deal. Or the worst outcome. We avoided a war, and have united peacefully. And hopefully they judge us on that in the future instead."
ENG_Scotland_unification.26.a:0 "We still have something."

ENG_Scotland_unification.27.t:0 "Final Warning"
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.desc:0 ""No, that's just not acceptable!" declares an angry English negotiator. "We will not compromise on these terms, and that's final. You have to agree to them. London will not accept anything more.\n\nIf you don't agree, these negotiations will fall apart, and we have to have a war. What you're proposing is completely unacceptable as a solution to this crisis. We've come this far, and you need to agree with us. Or another war erupts on this blood-soaked isle.\n\nYou have to back down. To do otherwise is going to mean a war that nobody wants. And you know that we've got the larger military and the industrial base. You will lose this conflict. And there's going to be a deal not as generous as one we're giving you.\n\nIn the name of God, think of your people! Do you want to lead them into a massive, unwinnable war? Or do you want to just accept a deal you have some reservations about? Plase, take the sensible option and sign the treaty!""
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.a:0 "Guess they're serious about this."
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.b:0 "We'll see how well you can attack us."

ENG_Scotland_unification.28.t:0 "Talk is cheap"
ENG_Scotland_unification.28.desc:0 "Scotland refused to discuss any more terms. There were attempts to get them to agree. There were attempts to get them at least discussing the terms again. There were attempts to get everyone to at least stay in the same room. They all failed. And everyone knew what must come next.\n\nPanic spread across the island. Civilians prepared to flee the border regions. The soldiers mobilized and prepared to fight. And in Edinburgh and London, politicians and generals both looked at the same map with foreboding and dread.\n\nAnother war in Britain had begun. And for the first time in the modern era, it would be between Scotland and England."
ENG_Scotland_unification.28.a:0 "And we all suffer for it."

ENG_Scotland_unification.29.t:0 "A Better Deal?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.desc:0 ""No, no, no," says the English negotiator. "We can't do that. That's too much to ask. Complete autonomy? Are you out of your minds? How would we get anything done?\n\nObviously, we know that the old Acts of Union were going to be a hard sell for you. So we have another offer. We can give your parliament some more control and autonomy. You can set more tax rates, and have some laws that England doesn't, except in major fields like narcotics enforcement. And you can also have a few protections for your language.\n\nIf that's good, we can shake hands and leave right now. But if it's not, I'll have to ask London again. And they may not be so eager to give you much more.""
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.a:0 "Alright."
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.b:0 "We would like a Scottish Council instead."

ENG_Scotland_unification.30.t:0 "That Worked?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.30.desc:0 "The English negotiator stared at the paper that had been dropped in front of him. He was amazed, it seems that the Scots had accepted the proposal. Limited Autonomy had been accepted by the Scottish delegation. The English negotiator was pleasantly surprised. However, to some of the other delegates, this was quite a large item to be given up to the Scots. Them having some autonomy means they could impede their own laws and possibly challenge the laws that the English had laid down for them.\n\nAcross Scotland, these changes had begun to be felt immediately. Members of Scottish Parliament had been told to prepare to be moved to the English Parliament immediately, as the change was effective. However, now across the isles, another flag was raised next to the Cross of St. George, the Cross of St. Andrews. It was only due process. As the negotiator nodded his head, he wondered if the transition would be kind to the many people of Britain."
ENG_Scotland_unification.30.a:0 "Aparently"

ENG_Scotland_unification.31.t:0 "One Last Try"
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.desc:0 ""We want our Scottish Council, full stop. Either we receive the council, or Scotland does not join the Union. Simple as that. If we join the Union, we only want a council for us to self govern." Said the Scottish negotiator to a English negotiator who had sat across from him at the table.\n\nThe English negotiator seemed even more annoyed and replied, more annoyed than anything at the fact he now had to deal with the idea of a Scottish Council running around. If they had let the Scottish join and stand down, it could be a massive blow for the country. Letting a country in with such high autonomy? This could be a disaster for the public! However, the idea of a Scottish Council could lessen tensions between the two countries. He then replied to the Scot, hoping he could persuade the man."
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.a:0 ""We accept your proposal.""
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.b:0 ""We decline, final warning.""

ENG_Scotland_unification.32.t:0 "Fine, We Accept"
ENG_Scotland_unification.32.desc:0 "The English negotiator crossed the floor to meet with the Scottish negotiator, once there they shook hands, like they did at the start of the meetings. Each one had a bit of respect for the other. It took lots of dedication to come and meet a foreign representative face to face and demand things. Each of them did that. They shared a few words before both departed. The Scots flew home, uncertain of what would occur in the coming weeks, but confident that they had proposed the right idea. They were also certain that they had done the right thing for Scotland, a council would definitely help. The English did the same, they flew back to London, hoping that they had made the right agreement. War could have been an option, but who would want that. Only death and destruction followed. However, for both parties, they looked into the future with hope."
ENG_Scotland_unification.32.a:0 "An isle reunited."

ENG_Scotland_unification.33.t:0 "The Decision"
ENG_Scotland_unification.33.desc:0 "The Scottish President looked down at their fingers. In front of them was the cabinet and some members of the armed forces who had met with the president to discuss the issue of war with the English. The English had come down to their last line, patience had basically gone with them. It seems that the demands that the Scots had brought to the table had been too radical for the English.\n\nThe Scottish at this point only had two options. Either they would bow to the English or prepare for a conflict that would devastate Britain for years to come. The Scottish President then announced their decision to the group assembled before him, it would then be sent to Holyrood."
ENG_Scotland_unification.33.a:0 "We must accept..."
ENG_Scotland_unification.33.b:0 "We must stand alone!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.34.t:0 "A Change in the Air"
ENG_Scotland_unification.34.desc:0 "Things are slowly becoming better in Scotland. The air is less foggy. The skies are a little brighter. And the people aren't as angry as they used to be.\n\nIt seems the hatred and anger towards the English in Scotland has gotten better. Resentment will always be there, it seems. But right now it isn't manifesting itself as it used to. Our government is slowly getting a grip on the situation, and hopefully soon, it will be only a dark memory."
ENG_Scotland_unification.34.a:0 "May there be peace in the North."

ENG_Scotland_unification.340.desc:0 "Two senior bureaucrats were discussing the Scottish security situation in an office somewhere in the newly reunified United Kingdom.\n\nOne of them asked, "They've given up terrorism, have they?" Several weeks ago, he had just narrowly avoided getting blown up by a Scottish militant's improvised bomb.\n\nThe other nodded eagerly. "Yes, they have; they resort to far more low-level methods, and their resistance groups are disorganized now. Few pickets here and there, some flag desecrations in private, nothing more intensive than you'd expect from a lot of witless university students."\n\nThe first bureaucrat leaned back and sipped some wine. "So it's almost done, isn't it? Not much longer now until the Scots accept their new situation."\n\nHis friend nodded. "Precisely so.""

ENG_Scotland_unification.344.desc:0 "Dusk began to set over the horizon across Dumfries. As it painted its pastel purple colour upon the sky, a band of men contemplated their next move. They were members of one of the many Scottish resistance organisations that had formed to fight the occupation of Scotland. Yet, as time had gone on, the fight that they fought had become increasingly futile.\n\nThe English had gotten wise to their maneuvers, no matter what they tried, the men would always find a force readily prepared to meet them with devastating effectiveness which had sliced through their allies. These losses had taken their toll on each of the men. They knew how many had been lost, and that many more would suffer a similar fate if they were to fight on. Their doubts were not due to a lack of motivation, the passion was still very much amongst their hearts, but the reason in their heads to continue the senseless slaughter had long since died.\n\nOne by one they came to the realisation that their defiance could not be maintained. They would have to lay down their arms and retire to whatever lives they had left. But this decision was not supported by all.\n\n"This can't be it, you cant let the dream die now! The fight must not end!" cried out one, who looked across to the man who had just stood up, with a pleading look.\n\n"I'll make sure." was all that was said in a weary response, as the first of the men departed."
ENG_Scotland_unification.3444.desc:0 "It seemed as if no matter if the occupation had been the result of a peaceful agreement or an outright war the result would have been the same. After existing, and to some extent thriving, for so long, free from the control of the English, the Scottish people had grown accustomed to their newfound freedom. And unfortunately for those who now governed them, they were not going to welcome this change with open arms.\n\nInstead the English were met with widespread lawlessness as riots swept the streets of every major city. From Glasgow to Edinburgh, Dundee to Aberdeen; all manner of people had come out to make their distress known. Even the politicians, far south of the border had to take notice of Scotland's outrage. Though even as they started to pay more attention, the violence had begun to dissipate. By the end of the month, civil unrest in all urban areas had ceased.\n\nFor now, the riots have ended, but the discomfort still remains. Scotland itself has become a little more stable, even if the anger of the people still remains. However it is an undeniable truth that the notion of independence has become slightly more out of reach and England has once again tightened its grip over the land."
ENG_Scotland_unification.34444.desc:0 "Much time had passed since the English had occupied Scotland and proclaimed a United Great Britain. At the time, the majority of Scottish people had resisted at every turn; fighting, rioting and protesting against what they saw as a foreign invader. But as time went on, and the resistance groups were dispersed and the riots began to participate.\n\nEventually even the protests realized they were being ignored, as their throats became increasingly hoarse.\n\nNow only a few die hard nationalists continue to put up a fight, which is in reality all but lost. It is known that even the best laid schemes often go wrong and as time goes on the design of an independent Scotland slowly dies. More and more people are getting used to life under the new regime and it will not be much longer until all the British Isles are united in peace."
ENG_Scotland_unification.344444.desc:0 "Devastation has gripped the British Isles for decades, from the disaster that was the German invasion to the all too recent English Civil War, bitterness and bloodshed had marked the land and its people deeply. And yet, through it all Scotland had survived as a beacon of hope, its democracy and freedoms preserving the liberty Britain had previously represented. Though its democracy may have been vulnerable, and its freedoms were constantly at risk, Scotland was free.\n\nNow however, the times are different. England has, for better or for worse, rallied itself and gone on to unite all of Britain under one authority. Life from the Highlands to Lands' End has become less rough and more stable than it was before. Subsequently, less people see the need for Scotland to exist as a separate nation and more have come round to the idea of a great united Britain.\n\nNo longer will the people hear the cry that tells Scot men to do or die, as the people of Britain have come instead to unify."

POLITICS_ALEC_DOUGLAS_HOME_DESC:0 "Alexander Douglas-Home was not a man born into any true power. He served in the Territorial Army to no great success, married his wife Elizabeth in a ceremony of little note, and served as a Member of Parliament with little influence before leaving in 1937 to be the aide of Neville Chamberlain. Though initially serving as Chamberlain's eye in the House, after he left the Government Home was caught up in bigger problems. He spent most of 1940-1943 in a full cast for the spinal tuberculosis he had removed. Thus Home missed much of the bungling of the Unity Government in the war effort - along with much of the blame, something which proved useful when the Germans invaded.\n\nHome was present at the signing of the peace treaty that dissolved the United Kingdom by virtue of inheriting his father's lordship in 1942, but held little influence in English affairs for the remainder of the decade. The 1950's however proved more favourable, with Home emerging as perhaps the archetypical representative of the Royal Establishment, desiring above all else to prevent a second invasion. The Royal Party is de facto an alliance of several groups, and as one PM after another fell to infighting, riots or German disagreement, Home simply kept rising: first to leader of the House of Lords, and then to Foreign Minister under Mountbatten. Finally, following the brief leaderless year of 1958, Home was convinced to take the post of Prime Minister.\n\nHome's government has been a relatively stable one compared to his predecessors. He has managed to solidify the Royal Party, and is tolerated if not exactly liked by the Garrison in Cornwall. Now however, with the rising influence of HMMLR, Home faces far more perilous straits, and whether he shall lead his nation into survival or damnation remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HENRY_HEAVENLY_DESC:0 "Heinrich HMMLR is the dutiful leader of the Bur- ...the Burnley Resistance Brigade, a brave and completely English partisan organization which is absolutely real and exists on the historical record. Born in Munich (an Anglicization of Mhunecagh, a small town in West... Shire... town. Yes, West Shiretown.), his upbringing in such an isolated village led to him to develop an unusual backcountry accent. Why does it sound German, do you ask? That's because he's more Anglo-Saxon (emphasis on the "Saxon" part) than the rest.\n\nIn order to keep anyone, even other members of the Resistance curious about his heritage, from finding out his identity and threatening all the friends and family he claims to have, he has foregone his true name and adopted the acronym of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance as a nom de guerre. Any similarity to the name of a famous, intelligent, and ravishingly handsome Reichsführer-SS is purely coincidental. Upon being asked, Heinrich HMMLR will insist that he has in fact been seen in the same room as Heinrich Himmler many times and that he has a photograph of them together, but he happened to leave it in his other wallet that day.\n\nHMMLR's plans upon victory include transferring the entire monetary reserve to a secure undisclosed location, bringing in large groups of foreign experts to train the officer corps, providing grants to study the atomic sciences at Oxford and Cambridge, and constructing a second metro system in London far deeper than the first. As to where the money will go, where the experts will come from, who will provide the grants, and what he plans to put in the tunnels, HMMLR has been eerily silent, his gaze boring into the very souls of anyone who asks."
POLITICS_HAROLD_MACMILLAN_DESC:0 "Some men would fight for their country until time itself bowed to their whim. For each ditch, for each farm and field they would fight under their lands were nought but cinder and bone. Harold Macmillan, born in 1894 in the age of Queen Victoria, serving in the Great War and seeing Britain triumphant, might seem like the kind of man to whom this would apply, but the Second World War broke many things. The British spirit foremost amongst them. Seeing his nation bombed into ruin, its youth dead on foreign shores and even London itself falling under the yoke of the Reich, Macmillan was struck with the realisation that he could well be witnessing the utter destruction of all that he had loved and held dear. So unlike many brave men, Harold Macmillan signed the treaty of surrender to preserve not his nation's glory, but its people.\n\nDespite this, as he knew too well, an unwillingness to see your nation ruined further does not mean you stop hating those who ruined it. The reformist faction of the Royal Party was formed by Macmillan to be the face of reluctant acquiescence in the Collaborationist government, but also to provided a legal haven for those opposed to fascist dictatorship. He later backed the creation of the United England Party to ensure the fascists and the corrupt oligarchs of the Royal Party never get a chance to bring England to ruin again.\n\nMost of the English people don't know who Macmillan is, most will never know who he is. He is not a man for speeches or publicity, he has people for that. Some see him as a tyrant in the making, but these people fail to see his true cause. Whilst Harold Macmillan lives, he will keep England from ever seeing its men die on foreign shores again."
POLITICS_MARGARET_THATCHER_DESC:0 "What is the making of a great leader? Is it the ability to compromise? To crush all opposition or ensure it never forms in the first place? The answer Margaret Thatcher would give is a simple one. What makes a leader is an iron will to do what is needed, and the courage to see it through until the end.\n\nPeople said a grocer's daughter and chemist couldn't possibly stand against a respected independent candidate in the 1951 by-election and win, yet Thatcher did so. Her own colleagues were certain she was nothing but a minor blip on the radar, no need to worry about her becoming a well known face. Then in poll after poll Mrs. Thatcher emerged as one of the most popular Royal Party politicians in England for her efforts to champion the cause of the ordinary citizen. In the aftermath of the English Civil War, and the resignation of PM Alec Douglas-Home, nobody whatsoever thought a woman with no solid power base could be anything more than a puppet of the party leadership, Prime Minister or not.\n\nIt will be interesting to see about that one.\n\nMargaret has a dream, of a strong and independent England answering to neither Germania nor Washington, of a people no longer cowed by intimidation but loyal to the government out of gratitude. Margaret Thatcher will move mountains to see England prevail, whether the world is set against her or not. For she knows that one misstep could well mean her doom."
POLITICS_REG_BIRCH_DESC:0 "One would not think an engineer could inspire so much fear in an organisation filled with terrorists, soldiers and desperate men. But there was a reason everybody in HMMLR feared Reg Birch. Originally merely a mid ranking CPGB official who escaped the London Uprising by the skin of his teeth, Reg Birch kept the movement going whilst men like Bill Alexander went into exile, even if only for a short while. Joining up with the Left Resistance upon the Red General's return in 1958, Birch proved his utility when he provided the names of every mole in the movement seemingly out of nowhere. For that was his strength, information.\n\nIn England the reach of Reg Birch was second to none, thanks to his infiltration of the Collaborationist intelligence apparatus and a network of trade union contacts spread around the nation. These helped contribute to the victory of HMMLR in the Civil War, but the Socialist Labour Party formed in its aftermath was too moderate for Birch, too revisionary and prone to indulging the excesses of the Labour Aristocracy.\n\nSo like any good gardener finding a weed, he pruned it. Under Chairman Birch the Socialist Labour Party has turned down a more radical path, one of ideological purity and vengeance wreaked upon monarchists, collaborationists and revisionists alike. Let the world gaze on as England fortifies itself into a nation of concrete and will, whilst the revolutionary flag flies ever higher. Chairman Birch will guide England into the future, he will stop the fascist dogs in Germania from ever setting foot upon his isle, and most of all he will save England from its worst enemy, itself."
POLITICS_CLAUDE_AUCHINLECK_DESC:0 "Patience is a virtue. Nobody remembers the man who strikes and fails, nobody remembers because he dies ignominiously and without note. Claude Auchinleck was forced to internalize this lesson during his last stand at Carlisle, holding with a few thousand militia and what scattered infantry he could scrape together whilst the rest of the British generalship either fled or surrendered. He realised in that shelled out surrounded city that if he died there nothing would be gained, and all hope for Britain might be lost.\n\nSo he surrendered, pretended to find an aptitude for politics and joined the Royal Party as an MP, loyally supporting the new government. All the while, he began creating the most organised rebel group that England had ever seen. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, an alliance that despite its name was dedicated solely to the expulsion of the German occupier and their Collaborationist puppets from England, free elections and the restoration of democracy at all costs.\n\nUnlike many early groups, HMMLR made no distinction in ideology other than an opposition to fascism and recruited any and all willing to join the cause. The half communist Left Resistance and Bill Alexander, the ultra-militant Commando's of David Stirling and a dozen other notorious bands of outlaws and freedom fighters swore loyalty to Auchinleck, "The Boss". And whilst the shadow head of HMMLR was hunted far and wide, nobody suspected the mild MP from Newcastle who was well past 70 years old.\n\nBut now HMMLR's time has come, they rise in a rebellion to overthrow the government and Auchinleck stands revealed to the world as their leader. Come death of glory, his shall be a tale remembered forever."
POLITICS_GEORGE_JELLICOE_DESC:0 "George Jellicoe might have a military background, but the once daring commando who terrorised the Italian forces in the Mediterranean looks quite different nowadays. Forced to capitulate following his capture in the earliest days of Operation Sealion, Jellicoe pretended to be willing to let go of his loyalty to King George and was released into a well respected civil service position at the Foreign Office. In secret, however, the son of the Admiral in Command at Jutland never fully surrendered.\n\nIn his position at the Foreign Office Jellicoe was approached by the agents of Claude Auchinleck, and swiftly rose to become one of the main contacts between the OFN and Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. Following the victory of HMMLR forces in the English Civil War, Auchinleck was faced with the problem of his own advanced age and not wanting to set a military precedent for leadership in the new civilian government. As a result he nominated someone he could trust to head the National Democratic League at the first democratic elections in twenty years.\n\nA man dedicated to his Queen, his country and his party, Jellicoe plans to turn England into something resembling its former glory, but whether he can do this whilst keeping his American friends happy remains to be seen. For in the end, despite their different origins, Jellicoe is respected by Enoch Powell and Norman St John-Stevas enough to maintain his position as Prime Minister, but whether he turns the National Democratic League into a party in its own right, and earns the trust Auchinleck placed in him, remains to be seen."
POLITICS_ENOCH_POWELL_DESC:0 "John Enoch Powell a man defined by the decline of Britain, and one determined to reverse it.\n\nTo his horror, Powell - at the time of Sealion, the youngest general in the Empire - failed to die in the war as he had intended, being knocked unconscious by a bombing strike on Bletchley Park, where he was held as a prisoner until 1946. Once released, Powell resolved that his first task was to free England from the continental occupiers and restore its traditional institutions. To this effect, he joined HMMLR, being so fanatical in his determination to drive out the Germans that he had to be physically restrained from joining the London Uprising.\n\nInspite of being consistently returned to office since 1950, Powell did not take up his parliamentary seat until after the Civil War, as he publicly refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the collaborationist puppet King, a move which made him an immensely popular politician. However, his uncompromising stances, along with his difficult personality and sometimes tiresome obsession with logic has made him many enemies. Due to this, Powell was deliberately passed over for leadership of the NDL in favor of the more amenable George Jellicoe.\n\nWhile Powell was denied the premiership, he remains a powerful figure within the party, and intends to use his position to restore not only the United Kingdom, but the very essence of Britishness itself: In the service of this goal, Powell is willing to do - and say - anything."
POLITICS_HAROLD_WILSON_DESC_OLD:0 "The argument exists that socialism and democracy are somehow incompatible. That the working man cannot earn the just reward for all that he toils and have a vote for the government at the same time. Harold Wilson will prove those allegations wrong, his leadership of the Socialist Labour Party depends on it after all.\n\nNothing more than a minor civil servicemen during the War, Wilson watched as his nation collapsed around him and could do nothing. He watched as the Labour party he had joined was forced underground and once his own ties were revealed himself along with it, and he could do nothing. But inch by inch, he started taking things into his own hands, advocating for a broader coalition to the exiled leadership in Ottawa and even trying to persuade the Labour Underground to join the CPGB in their ill fated London Uprising. Eventually he was able to claim the leadership of the movement for himself following a brutal crackdown by the Collaborationist authorities, just in time for Bill Alexander to return from his exile in Russia.\n\nIn a cold cellar the two men talked, one leading the largest leftist militant network still intact following the crackdown, inspired with a newly found willingness to compromise, the other an Oxford graduate and administrator determined to see England freed. It says something about Wilson that he handed the leadership of the Left Resistance to Bill Alexander from the start. Perhaps that was why, when searching for a candidate to spearhead the Socialist Labour Party's first electoral campaign, he looked no further than Wilson. Now contending with a fractious party of Social Democrats, Communists and more, Harold Wilson will finally be able to do something all the world will see."
POLITICS_RAB_BUTLER_DESC_OLD:0 "He had been right all along. When the Germans invaded the Isles, Richard Austen Butler was proven to have been right when he said that the Germans ought to have been appeased and that Britain should have stayed well out of Continental affairs. And all being right cost him was watching the British Empire collapse around his former colleagues' feet.\n\nButler's position on Germany left him well placed to become one of the foremost members of the burgeoning Royal Party. Once the initial lot of outright fascists were sidelined or dealt with, in one way or another, it was left to Butler and others like him to transform the Royal Party into something which would keep England stable, safe and, most importantly, alive. He used his connections to help get the aristocracy broadly on board with the Royal Party programme, and it got to the point where his words were listened to more closely than those of the Prime Minister.\n\nYet now Rab Butler finds himself in power, and he has found that the limelight does not suit him much. His appeal to the ordinary citizen was always somewhat less than his appeal to the upper classes, after all. But he will carry on. For if he does not, England may face the fate it endured in 1943 once again."
POLITICS_YDL_PROVISIONAL_GOVERNMENT_DESC:0 "The Young Democracy Law was never intended to be activated. Crafted by Bill Alexander and Claude Auchinleck, it was designed so that, in case of great crisis or crass incompetence, a selection of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance leaders could take temporary power. The only situation where one expected it to be necessary, of course, was a decapitation strike on the government or an elected government considering surrender to Germany.\n\nYet, for one reason or another, the government elected by the people, of the people, and for the people has failed to deliver, collapsing into anarchy. As such the Young Democracy Law has been activated, so that a caretaker government can see the country through to new elections. The administration is not divided amongst petty partisan lines of right or left, but will act as a government of unity for all Englishmen.\n\nThe people don't seem to mind this provisional government much, but whether this remains the case in the long term remains to be seen. The elections have not manifested thus far, after all."
POLITICS_REGINALD_MAUDLING_DESC:0 "Reginald Maudling is not a man of great cunning. Luck he certainly possesses in spades, for how many times can you insult the Germans and the Government of which you form part - in public no less - without suffering any consequences? The truth of the matter was somewhat less fortuitous than many would believe. Maudling and his eclectic collection of Liberals, outcasts and downright malcontents were protected by Macmillan not because they were useful to him at the time, but because they were amongst the only MPs Macmillan could trust to return to democracy if the opportunity were offered.\n\nMaudling would not get his chance until the dissolution of the Royal Party and the resignation of PM Alec Douglas-Home, opening up an opportunity for Macmillan's reformists to seek their own path. Yet conversely, the man most dedicated to the protection of English democracy could not be seen to lead it, associated so intrinsically with the Royal Party as Macmillan was. How could people believe change would come from his leadership? Enter Maudling, stage right.\n\nActing as Macmillan's public face for the newly formed United England movement, Reginald Maudling proved not just a match for the trails he faced, but their better as well. Convincing even his most ardent detractors wrong, under his leadership England will have the chance to know true democracy once more. Maudling sacrificed much for this opportunity, to have idealism triumph over pragmatism, and for this he will most certainly make his mark on history."
POLITICS_DAVID_STIRLING_DESC:0 "What is it that makes a man? His cause, his beliefs, what others believe him to be? A question for the scholars perhaps. But not when talking about Archibald David Stirling. Born in 1915 as the son of a Lieutenant General, David Stirling was around for the aftermath of the First World War, and served with distinction in the Second. From Africa to Egypt and eventually in Britain itself he fought and bled the enemies of his country. He was good enough at it that around him the very first special forces of the United Kingdom were formed, the SAS. But Britain lost the war, and so a new approach was needed.\n\nA lowly Lieutenant Colonel at the time, when the armistice was sounded David Stirling did not give up like the rest of Britain's forces, for while he lived the war was not over. Starting as a few hundred deserters, Stirling's war against the German occupier and their new collaborators was ceaseless and merciless. They had to be, everyone who took the soft approach died. Eventually the self-titled General was approached by one Claude Auchinleck, ironically not a few months after he'd tried assassinating the man for perceived loyalty to the regime in London. From there, the beginnings of an alliance which would eventually liberate England from its tyrants was built.\n\nYet the aftermath of Stirling's greatest and most secret hope, the expulsion of the Reich from the British Isles, he found not joy but more worries. Neither Auchinleck nor Bill Alexander's visions for the future of Britain were ones he saw as acceptable. The SLP wanted to change too much, the NDL wouldn't make the sacrifices necessary to preserve their newly won independence. So a soldier turned rebel asked himself, "Why not me?"\n\nNow David Stirling stands uncontested as the first freely elected Prime Minister in almost two decades. He promises peace, order and security under his new government. He will protect the people of Britain, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_BERNARD_MONTGOMERY_DESC:0 "When Britain splintered under the iron boots of the Wehrmacht, Bernard Montgomery did his duty by serving the collaborationists and keeping the nation together, protecting it from the extremes of Germany's wrath. Once more he has answered the call of duty in the name of England. With a stiff upper lip and a firm hand, Field Marshal Montgomery has established himself as ruler of the Southern Temporary Military District. When his work is done, only then will England return to normality."
#POLITICS_GERALD_TEMPLER_DESC:0 "Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer fought in the trenches of France during the First World War. Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer defended his nation with vigor and tenacity during the Second World War. Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer sacrificed his pride for England's security by siding with the collaborationists following its tragic defeat. For the Field Marshal, this is no time for cowardice. Montgomery's Coup has split England into two Temporary Military Districts, with Templer ruling over the North for as long as necessary."
POLITICS_GERALD_TEMPLER_DESC:0 "Born: 11 September 1898, Essex, United Kingdom\nCareer: Sir Gerald Walter Robert Templer was born the only child of Lt. Col. Walter Templer. He served with distinction in both World Wars. During World War II, he was in charge of the defence of East Angila, and when the Germans came, his men fought valiantly, despite being regarded as second rate troops, even impressing General Eisenhower himself. Gerald Templer was mentored by Field Marshal Montogmery during the interwar period, and due to Montogmery's high opinion of the general he recommended Templer for the rank of Field Marshal after the war. Though Templer begrudgingly accepted the position, he has made clear his dissatisfaction with the current regime, but remains tied to them nevertheless."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_KENNETH_CHESTERTON_OLD_DESC:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is a man of many layers. A scarred veteran of the trenches of the Great War, a theatre critic, an alcoholic. A fabian in past times, a fascist now. Though he left the sinking ship that was Mosley's BUF at the first opportunity, Chesterton was reinforced in his beliefs as the Axis stormed into Egypt, while the British army in East Africa he was part of was stuck sieging the mountains of Amba Alagi.\n\nBy the time the siege was lifted by Axis reinforcements from the North, Chesterton had already been sent back home to fight off the Germans, despite his poor health. With Britain's situation graver than ever, Chesterton decided not to evacuate from the German advance and gathered anyone willing he could find to prepare for a new Britain. One strengthened by Fascism, not opposed to it.\n\nIt was for that purpose that he would rally the Hardliner faction of the Royalist party around him, and now the National Front. And he's finally done it, hasn't he? He rules over England after all...\n\nBut Chesterton is a man long past his prime, his party full of division and sub-factions. Only time will tell if he can truly implement his vision of a fascist Isle, or be swept away by the Nazi bootlickers he calls allies."
POLITICS_ORDE_WINDGATE_COLLAB_DESC:0 "§w Born:§! February 26 1903, in Nainital, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, British India\n\n§w Military Career:§! Orde Charles Wingate, born to a military family, graduated from the Royal Military Academy in 1923 with a commission as an officer in the Royal Artillery. Transferred to the Sudan Defence Force in 1927, where he learned Arabic and spent time organizing expeditions into the desert. Returned to the UK in 1933, and was placed in charge of retraining the Royal Artillery for mechanization. Posted to Palestine in 1936 as an intelligence officer, where he quickly identified with the Zionist cause. His Special Night Squads, patrol units tasked with counterinsurgency operations against Arabic saboteurs proved effective enough to merit him the Distinguished Service Order, though not without garnering considerable controversy for their policies of collective punishment. Was recalled in 1939 with High Command believing him too involved with Zionist causes to be effective, though he retained a large degree of popularity amongst the Jewish population. After the Second World War began, was again deployed to the Middle East to organize a native raiding force to attack behind Italian lines in Abyssinia, which proved extremely effective. A massie clash with his commanding officers over the treatment of him and his men afterwards led to depression and a suicide attempt. Assigned to the Far East in 1942, he began work on long-range penetration units to operate in the Jungles of Burma, and attack the Japanese where they least expected it. This led to the creation of the famous Chindits, soldiers relying on air resupply and radio communications to operate from bases deep inside enemy territory. These units garnered high praise in London, though their tactical and strategic usefulness was questioned by many. Ultimately, Wingate was captured along with many of his men, and spent years in a Japanese prison camp. Eventually, the Kingdom of England was able to secure his release, and cleared him to return to active duty in 1955.\n\n§w Important Notes:§! Constantly clashing with other officers and his commanders, Wingate is a staunch proponent of small unit commando tactics and a tough mental attitude to win battles."

ENG_tick_tack_tick_tack_desc:0 "The surrender of the United Kingdom at the end of the war unfortunately was not enough to keep dissidents quiet in England. Though many attempted conspiracies have been crushed over the years and it looked like we might finally be past the dark times following the Third Battle of Cable Street, in recent years a new organisation has waged war from the shadows. Pretentiously titled "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance," they along with the Left Resistance have been a thorn in our side like none other.\n\nAssassinations, falsified anti-government propaganda and even bombings by HMMLR have become increasingly common, and things are starting to get out of hand. But the King is set to make a speech on the matter soon, which hopefully will help us turn public opinion to our point of view."
ENG_the_prime_minister_speaks_desc:0 "England is a nation of compromise, our very existence dependent on the fact that the Germans considered it not worth the effort to puppet us like the Dutch or Norwegians. Regardless of some of our fellows' opinions on the matter of furthering or lessening ties to our benefactors across the Channel, our first priority must be the continued survival of England above all else.\n\nThe King may think he can calm the recent tensions with a speech and a proud word, but we know better. These tensions represent an existential threat to our nation's survival. Let us instead use this opportunity to secure the government's position, and point out that we do not have the capacity to fight Germany, no matter what the would-be rebels say."
ENG_anyone_anything_desc:0 "One might suppose that people ought to be grateful for the government signing a peace deal that ended the war, but those who remember when it was Britain, and not England, think differently. Of course it isn't the job of the policeman to criticise the government's choices but perhaps a more secure method of informing the people that everything is fine could have been used? As in, not a speech by the King to thousands of people?\n\nNever mind the risk to His Majesty, but the arrest quotas are simply getting ridiculous. How on earth are the police supposed to hold half the former protesters in London for a couple of weeks before the event, not to mention the proposals about blocking off Cable Street? With no extra manpower to cover it? Still, it's the policeman's job to obey orders, not make them. Hopefully the speech will actually calm down the rabble somewhat."
ENG_what_to_say_desc:0 "What is a King to do in these circumstances? Edward VIII may have been born to be King but at times like the present he wishes that weren't the case. Bertie isn't even around anymore to talk to, and the rebels that support his niece... well, the less said about what they might do the better. What is a King suppsed to say when half the populace looks ready to murder the other half? How does he calm those with legitimate grievances against the government's actions?\n\nAlec is of no help in the matter. Wallis knows how to convince the upper class, but the speech will be heard by a nation, not merely the aristocracy. Of course if the Germans misinterpret what he says, well... it will have been a short government indeed. He might hate the job, but it has fallen to him nonetheless."
ENG_whole_state_under_there_desc:0 "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, a catch all term for a problem that has eluded solutions for nigh on twenty years. The current organisation is probably better described as a combination of three. David Stirling and his Commandos are the largest rogue military unit in England which didn't surrender following the war, and the only one still active in England proper. Bill Alexander and the Left Resistance are an amalgamation of assorted leftist partisans and Labour supporters, though they might not be as influential as the CPGB that perished at Third Cable Street. Infuriatingly however, the original HMMLR's leader is unknown, some spymaster in the shadows no doubt if he even still lives, but he somehow managed to get almost every major partisan organisation in England to answer to him despite ideological differences. This organisation is a thorn in our side, we must excise it."
ENG_the_gears_are_moving_desc:0 "The funny thing about any moving machine is that it keeps moving, even when the operator is no longer there to guide it. Everyone can agree that the statement applies to HMMLR, but with different definitions. The collaborationist government thinks that the organization is like a speeding car with no driver, going aimlessly until it runs out of fuel or veers off the road and comes to a halt. They see the rebellion as a shadow of its former self, huddled in the hills or cowering in the sewers, and a victory for law and order against the forces of anarchy is a matter of when instead of if.\n\nThe men and women of HMMLR, however, prefer a different analogy. They see themselves as a different machine, one that does not need an operator once activated. One that can safely be left alone until the moment to fulfil its duty is at hand. They are a ticking time bomb, and they are counting down to the beginning of His Majesty's speech."
ENG_big_big_love_desc:0 "Most of HMMLR are moderates by any sense of the word, men and women who want freedom more than anything more specific. But David Stirling and Bill Alexander have other goals. Stirling wants revenge. He's about the only surviving man still in the country who never surrendered and he's lost a lot of friends for that. Bill Alexander wants his revolution, though he's willing to forego that to get the Germans out of Britain for good. He lost a lot of friends on Third Cable Street during the first uprising, but he survived, and he'll have his turn to do the killing.\n\nAuchinleck meanwhile, he wants the traitor King's speech to be a proper show. Complete with HMMLR as the entertainment. Stirling and Alexander might hate the other's guts, but they've more experience in guerrilla warfare than the rest of HMMLR combined. Time for them to use it."
ENG_almost_there_desc:0 "The King's speech is shaping up to be quite the event. Some might want to break out the champagne and call it a day, but London is practically being isolated in preparation for it. The question on everyone's lips, though, is why? Third Cable Street was years ago and there hasn't been any real violence in London since. It's almost like the government is worried about something.\n\nThe press for their part are busy speculating and issuing declarations of solidarity, but some speculate as to whether its quite necessary to block off all of London and put in the curfews for what is, at best, a theoretical threat? The government, for its part, has decided that they will go ahead with these measures anyway."
ENG_keeping_ahead_desc:0 "Batten down the hatches, for the London police are ready for any and all interventions. Crowds will be carefully monitored and methods of evacuation and detention planned out beforehand. Any suspicious individuals will be kept well away from the main viewing sections and there will be exceptionally thorough checks for stashed weapons in the days before the speech commences.\n\nHis Majesty will enjoy a nice speech, a polite lunch afterwards and will then go home, end of story, without interference from any rebel scum. Those HMMLR buggers think they can get the best of the London police? Well, they have another thing coming."
ENG_writing_on_the_walls_desc:0 "One need only look at the streets of London to see how ripe the city is for revolution. It's like a bale of hay only in need of a spark to set the entire house afire. The police are no problem; those who aren't on our side will be dealt with by the ones who are, if they can't be bribed into staying back of course.\n\nThe crowds: that was something Bill's lads solved. Turns out when you know half the unions in the country you can get a few of them to turn out and act as a... disruptive influence for a public event, like this speech. With Stirling's lot acting as civvies to lead them we ought to give the King a right surprise when he turns up for tea and biscuits, something this entire country will remember forever."
ENG_the_kings_speech_desc:0 "The day has come, King Edward VIII of the House of Windsor may not be a well liked man, but he is nonetheless the King of England. The speech it would appear will start at midday and go on for an hour or so before his majesty attends a late lunch with some notable public figures.\n\nOf course that assumes everything goes to plan. Both HMMLR and the Government know something will occur, but what exactly happens is up to the will of God at this point. The coin of history tosses and turns in the air, the face upon which it will land unknown by even those who threw it. Perhaps HMMLR will be correct in their assumption that all the dry tinder needs is a spark, or perhaps the government prepared well, who can say? Only one way to find out..."

ENG_edwards_round_table_desc:0 "Part of the job of kingship is maintaining the relationships between politicians to ensure that, in theory at least, a government can cooperate even in the midst of a crisis. Alec Douglas-Home is by far the most capable Prime Minister to grace England since the war, and Margaret Thatcher is amongst the most influential of the new generation of politicians and is the voice of the party membership. These two obviously merit invitations to any discussion on national policy.\n\nWhere it becomes more difficult is in the extremes of the Royal Party. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is the main voice of the Germanophile and overtly fascist wing of the party, whilst Harold Macmillan is the foremost reformist to hold any great degree of influence. Unfortunately, both are likely to refuse to cooperate with the other. We must choose one to deal with."
ENG_chestertons_dedication_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton, our Home Secretary, is our first head on the round table. Although some in our government question Chesterton's fervor, and his support of the Germans, the King has assured the council that Chesterton will be happy to work with everyone. Already, Chesterton has called for curfews and increased presence of armed policemen on the streets, in the interest of national security, of course."
ENG_a_fist_and_will_desc:0 "Chesterton has informed His Majesty that a drastic increase in the size of the military is necessary to provide security and destroy the rebellion - a strong fist to smash any resistance to our government. The military shall call up more to serve, and will deploy to the North, which Chesterton believes is a hotbed of resistance activity. Although some generals are skeptical that this expansion is possible, and strongly oppose deploying troops to the cities and countryside, Chesterton has assured them he has the blessing of His Majesty in the endeavour."
ENG_terror_tactics_desc:0 "Apparently the military increase was not enough for Chesterton. In a meeting with the King, government officials, and military leadership, Chesterton has demanded the military use all available means to strike fear into the rebels. He believes that this will destroy the will of the Resistance, and they will be sent scurrying back to their holes. Some of our generals have threatened to disobey any order that would use "terror tactics" against their own people, and have been drawing comparisons to the Luftwaffe blitz of London during the invasion. However, Chesterton has reminded His Majesty, and everyone present, that these rebels are not Englishmen, but traitors who will get exactly what they deserve."
ENG_towards_the_north_desc:0 "Chesterton has decided the army shall head north to root out HMMLR once and for all. The north has always been a hotbed of resistance activity, and their closeness to Scotland allows for dissidents to slip through our fingers. This shall go on no longer. The army shall crush the Resistance in one swift stroke."
ENG_use_the_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Blackshirts were started by Mosley, but have grown to serve us long after the traitor had fled. This paramilitary group is known for their ferocity and devotion to the fascist cause. Although many in government dismiss them as racist, violent hooligans, Chesterton believes that they would bolster our forces, and their absolute devotion would intimidate the Resistance into submission."
ENG_dominate_yorkshire_desc:0 "Sheffield, although devastated during the Blitz, has managed to recover and become a vital transportation and industrial hub in Yorkshire. The Sheffield Railway station, in the event of an uprising, would be key in transporting troops from our southern bases to the rebellious north. Therefore, Chesterton has pushed for the Blackshirts to step up their operations in Yorkshire, and for the military to set up checkpoints in Sheffield, especially around the station. We must not allow the gateway to the North to fall, at any cost."
ENG_edwards_trip_to_germania_desc:0 "The King goes to Germany, and with him goes the fascist ideologue Arthur Chesterton. Rumors surrounding the visit indicate that they supposedly intend to request that some of the restrictions on the English military be lifted, while purchasing some German equipment to assist in equipping the suddenly much larger English armed forces.\n\nThis is the first time in years that England has shown any sign of being more than a reluctant appendage of the Greater German Reich, and is sure to intrigue the Germanian bureaucrats, possibly with favourable results for us."
ENG_homes_experience_desc:0 "His Majesty has brought in the current Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, to his round table to solve this rebel problem. Already, the Prime Minister has addressed Parliament, calling for "unity and order" in these uncertain times. His Majesty hopes that the longest serving post-war Prime Minister can help him weather England through this crisis."
ENG_unite_the_voters_desc:0 "The Prime Minister hopes to unite the voters of England behind the government. Although the Royal Party is still the most popular in England, it is no secret that we have, to put it lightly, influenced the system to keep it this way. Thus, the people are not completely supportive of the government, which explains the growing popularity of HMMLR. To turn the public away from supporting the Resistance, we must campaign on bringing the people together in these uncertain times, and reassure voters that everything will be fine."
ENG_speak_with_the_army_desc:0 "Prime Minister Home has called a meeting of our top generals, in order to discuss the worst case scenario - open rebellion. Although the Prime Minister hopes that it will never come to this, we wouldn't want to be caught unaware. General Montgomery says that we can raise two impromptu divisions in the event of an uprising to supplement our army. As well, he recommends not to deploy the military to police civilians, as this will only turn them against us."
ENG_convincing_the_midlands_desc:0 "Home has chosen the Midlands as our focus in unifying the country. The North is lost, and the South is firmly in our grasp. The Midlands however remain a battleground, torn between us and HMMLR. If we can convince them to support us, any possible uprising would be severely weakened without their support."
ENG_locate_the_cells_desc:0 "For far too long, HMMLR has operated under our noses. The full extent of their reach was revealed in the fateful assault on our King. Home has given full authority to MI5 and Field Marshal Montgomery to step up infiltration and intelligence operations. Once we're through, there will be nowhere for them to hide."
ENG_a_radical_a_day_desc:0 "'A radical a day keeps the revolution away' will be our new motto. The public will be convinced that although we seek to unite the nation, we will not tolerate traitorous activities. Whenever we capture one of those traitors, we shall broadcast it for the whole nation to see. Their faces shall be known, their crimes shall be heard, and their punishments shall be seen far and wide."
ENG_a_shaky_compromise_desc:0 "Macmillan is a fool, unaware of the wrath his reforms would bring upon us. Chesterton is worse, almost treacherous in his desire to bow to German might. The moderate wing has led England through thick and thin these past decades, and it shall be they who once more step up to the task of preserving England whatever the more misguided of her people may think.\n\nAlexander Douglas-Home and Margaret Thatcher will work together to ensure this, a partnership that will provide salvation to England from that which would menace her, whilst also keeping her independence from untrustworthy allies."
ENG_macmillans_reasoning_desc:0 "His Majesty has brought in Harold Macmillan, leader of the Reformist wing of the Royal Party. Already, more hardline and even some moderate members of the party question whether going soft after this terrible attack will just weaken our position, but His Majesty believes that Macmillan's cool head and intelligence will bring a cool-headedness to his round table."
ENG_uniting_parliament_desc:0 "Macmillan believes that to unite the nation, we first must unite the squabbling politicians in Parliament. Everyone here has a common love of England, so for now, everyone, from the most reform minded to the most hardline among us, must put aside our differences to calm the people down and unite the country."
ENG_talk_to_the_lower_classes_desc:0 "We must start a dialogue with the lower class if we want to keep this country together. They are the most vulnerable to be swayed towards HMMLR's lies. If we can promise some token reforms and begin talks about future liberalization, hopefully the masses will be content and not fall into the Resistance's ranks."
ENG_focus_on_the_south_desc:0 "Macmillan has decided that the government shall focus its efforts on securing the South of England. Although the South is mostly under our control, its numerous cities hold many potential and actual HMMLR operatives. If we were to lose control of this region, London and the heart of the nation would be at risk. Therefore, we shall campaign on our promises of reform here, to convince the people that we are working to make things better."
ENG_a_plea_to_germany_desc:0 "Albert Speer is an influential man in German politics, one of the Führer's most trusted advisors. He is similarly to Macmillan noted for leading the reformist wing of his nation's premier political party, and some view him as a natural successor to the world's most powerful man.\n\nMacmillan heads now to Germania, the city Speer designed brick by brick, to negotiate a trade deal more favourable to England. Rumour has it he also goes to see if England might have a future in the Pakt that is an arrangement of equals more than of subordinates. Time shall tell if he succeeds."
ENG_investigate_the_military_desc:0 "Even with our talk of unity and reform for the voters, there is one place where we cannot have a light hand. The military has escaped suspicion for far too long. It should have been obvious from the start, those old minds, stuck in the past. We shall search high and low, throughout the officers and enlisted alike. We may lose some great talent, we must root out every single traitor from our ranks."
ENG_request_additional_forces_desc:0 "Cornwall has a surplus of armed men concentrated in a small area, this is both a waste of time and supremely inefficient when it comes to dealing with HMMLR. We cannot directly raise too many more English regiments, but if Halder were to lend us his men we would not need to.\n\nAs an added bonus if we were to send these soldiers into the more dangerous of situations and they were, tragically, killed in action, we would not be spending valuable English blood on the matter, so the government really couldn't give a whit. It's a win-win situation: either Halder refuses and we can complain to Germania, or he accepts and we are one step closer to freeing our island."
ENG_expel_the_radicals_desc:0 "Sometimes to kill a cancer upon the body there can be no living with it, there is merely a choice between letting it poison you or cutting it out at the roots. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is a cancer upon the Royal Party; he represents the kind of base submission to the Germans that we had hoped Englishmen would never stoop to.\n\nSince the cancer will not leave of its own volition, we shall do the deed ourselves. Chesterton is too high profile to simply vanish, but the same cannot be said of his fellows. A few mysterious disappearances and high profile arrests for corruption will do our party a world of good. And keep us safe from German dominance."
ENG_court_the_moderates_desc:0 "The Moderates are the largest faction of the Royal Party, heirs to the conservative old guard that have long been guardians of English tradition. As a rule they tend to support the status quo, lest the consequences of breaking it spill over onto the English people, but now with that status quo changing of its own accord following the rise of HMMLR we need to convince them that change is needed.\n\nIt will be difficult, but the Moderates seek the survival of our nation above all else and will fall in line on this matter. Money directed at the projects they suggest will not find its way into the pockets of the corrupt, it will be spent as directed and as needed."
ENG_call_upon_the_garrison_desc:0 "The treaty in which the United Kingdom became England did not entirely remove the German Reich from our Isles, despite our hopes. While the Wehrmacht withdrew from the majority of England and Wales, the peninsula of Cornwall remained occupied under the authority of General Franz Halder, officially as a guarantee of protection, unofficially as a knife pointed at our back.\n\nA harsh man, Halder pursued his task as the Reich's foremost military attaché to England with ruthless efficiency and an iron fist, but we now find a situation in which he may once again prove useful. Halder assisted us in crushing the communists at Cable Street; perhaps he might be willing to help us with the matter of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance? But we ought to be careful, lest he seek to involve Germany more directly."
ENG_an_alternative_solution_desc:0 "Cornwall might be under temporary Wehrmacht authority, but it is English soil and internationally recognised as such. Perhaps we can use this. After all, we do indirectly control what can be imported into the military zone and we can somewhat hamper their ability to move outside it. This pressure would however serve a purpose, namely to throw them at Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and be ready to shoot whoever emerges with the most wounds.\n\nActing in such a manner might be somewhat negatively viewed in the Reich, but in London and the other cities of England it might give our government, forced together out of necessity as it is, some genuine public support."
ENG_secure_our_heads_desc:0 "General Halder is being rather reluctant in providing us with equipment necessary to prosecute the fight against HMMLR and the other malcontents who infest this island. Normally we might not bring this up out of politeness, but the government is well and truly running out of patience. If a kind word will not solve this matter perhaps a reminder of what we can do should we so desire will suffice.\n\nAs the English people discovered in the Blitz, a lack of food choices can truly be cancerous upon morale, and those fine German soldiers will find out that only eating canned food from Germany might well please the fatherland, but it can be somewhat harsh upon the stomach. Halder will see the true message: we control what his men eat, and we could very easily decide to add an ingredient or two."
ENG_choke_cornwall_desc:0 "General Halder is looking somewhat more approachable today, but it is best when you want something from a dog to ask its master to command it. Germania no doubt sees the weakness of its representative in England; it is quite possible that if we simply ask, Halder will hand over the required military equipment.\n\nHe can technically refuse us, but the same does not apply in any way to his superiors. That said, this will make the higher ranking officers of the Garrison less likely to converse civilly with us in the future, but do we truly need them once we have the equipment anyway?"
ENG_britannia_on_her_knees_desc:0 "Franz Halder's orders are the law in England no matter the official status of the Kingdom within the Einheitspakt, and the only way to change that might put us squarely in Germany's crosshairs. Something we cannot afford, even now. Thus, if we wish the assistance of the Garrison, we will need to beg for it.\n\nHalder will have a price no doubt, perhaps material or perhaps nationally motivated, and we will pay it. In return he will crush HMMLR, the communists, the deserters and those loyal to the false Queen all. This is a sacrifice that will be difficult to make, but we must not think of ourselves in these times, but of our children who will pay the price if we fail."
ENG_prevent_an_icarus_desc:0 "The Greeks tell of a boy who flew so close to the sun that it burned him; England surrendered to the Germans, because defeating them on our own was not practical or indeed possible, lest we ended up like Icarus. But the rebels don't seem to be willing to recognise this, a stark example of why they must be kept from power at all costs.\n\nTo counteract the possibility, a simple solution might just be to increase overall funding of the police. Besides greatly aiding our capabilities in regards to locating the HMMLR associates, it might just help us defeat them should the worst happen."
ENG_the_garrison_grows_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison is the arm of the Reich's protection in England, dedicated to preventing us from being subjugated to American whims ever again. Of course, such a force is appreciated but it is also small, more suited to crushing a small revolt than anything larger in scale. Arthur Chesterton intends to change this, requesting that the King ask for an increase in the Garrison's size so as to more effectively deal with the HMMLR organisation and its insidious plots against the integrity of England. This may not be popular with our own military or people, but when it comes to survival or pride survival always takes precedence. Always, else we would not be here at all."
ENG_locate_the_snakes_head_desc:0 "There's someone behind all this. HMMLR's leader is organizing everything behind the scenes. He's behind these activities, and will inevitably strike again. We need to hunt him down and kill him. Without his leadership, the Resistance will fall apart and we will have averted a terrible catastrophe. Eliminate the bastard, and we will have won.\n\nIf we can find where he is."
ENG_Collab_not_enough_time_desc:0 "Germany has descended into chaos. Would-be Hitlers have sprouted up all over, and are fighting each other. It is clear that no aid will now come from the Reich, save for a few aimless soldiers in the Plymouth garrison.\n\nThe rebels know this as well. There is no greater opportunity for them. All their planning, all their plots and preparing, they will use it now. For there will be no other time when we are so weak. The hour of our greatest test must come.\n\nGod save England!"

ENG_days_of_the_resistance_desc:0 "Auchinleck, Alexander, and Stirling. The first is a name not known by too many, aside from as a curiosity being the last General standing when the call to surrender was sounded. The second is probably the best known by the general public, one of the few rebels to escape Cable Street and a constant reminder of those darker times. Stirling is known only by those who hunt him - those who still live.\n\nTogether they represent HMMLR, an organisation dedicated to as many causes as its members have political leanings, but undeniably united in the desire for a Free England. One free of tyranny, free of traitors... and free of the Germans. The partnership is one of convenience but all involved intend to see it out 'till the end, until the Collaborationists are defeated or they've died trying."
ENG_stirlings_methods_desc:0 "Most of HMMLR don't want to get involved in the shady stuff. Can't blame them, as it's all horrible work. Bombs in traitor cars, men with guns waiting in unfortunate buggers' rooms at night. Makes a gent feel a bit dishonourable, really. Still - they sold us out to the Germans, so it's not as if they didn't earn it.\n\nThe Reds do the same if we're honest, but they've had to learn it. Cable Street killed all their best and even the bloody Red General can't make new soldiers from thin air like he can everything else. Stirling taught us the fight was dirty from the start: give no quarter and receive none, fight 'till you're dead and then some more. What makes killing a dozen at dinner any less honourable than a thousand on a battlefield?"
ENG_a_couple_of_tongues_desc:0 "Careless lips sink ships? That was what the Government told us before they turned out to be traitors anyway. Still, that particular nugget of wisdom applies now more than ever: half the reason the Reds failed at Cable Street is that their comms lacked sophistication, compromised months before the showdown and the traitors were waiting with guns at the ready when their revolution began.\n\nStirling isn't the nicest boss but he knows what's what. You don't just catch the spies and throw them in the sea anymore, you've got to find out what they told the traitors first. If they don't want to talk? Well, we might not be elegant in our means, but we do know how to make a lovely example."
ENG_who_dares_wins_desc:0 "Stirling led the SAS during the war, fought the German bastards from Africa till they landed over in England. Of course he picked up a trick or two when he was doing all that: how to make lads talk, how to hide the equipment from aerial searches and all that nice stuff. Most importantly, though, he figured out that the best way to fight someone with more shit than you was to always hit first.\n\nA traitor can't fight when you've gone and stolen his weapon. A tank won't run if dynamite's been shoved in the treads, and those wonderful aeroplanes don't appreciate having a grenade or two tossed in the engines. Fighting fair is for those who want to die fairly; the traitors have no honour, and we sure as hell won't give them any."
ENG_taking_the_midlands_desc:0 "England's Midlands are flat country, not many hills and only scattered woodland to break up the endless landscape of fields and villages. Not a land one would think lends itself well to guerrilla warfare. Yet that is exactly what David Stirling has done for the last two decades.\n\nStirling would have HMMLR take up the struggle in the centre of the country, able to split the Collaborationist forces in two from the start and gain control of the vital industry in the region's cities. Birmingham is an excellent staging point for supplying ammunition and guns throughout England. Bill Alexander is less keen on moving, as the Midlands are far from the Left Resistance's power base, but he is willing to cede to Auchinleck's judgement on the matter."
ENG_an_order_to_hand_over_desc:0 "The traitors purged the army of most lads who can think for themselves, or that's what Stirling says when he mocks their corpses. The thing about a rebellion is that, without some guns to shoot the traitors with, the whole thing will be over rather quickly. Even the Reds can't ship in enough firearms to equip us all. Which is where our lot come in.\n\nProtocol doesn't change that much from year to year in the army, which means that when a very cross looking colonel turns up at a depot with a convoy of trucks asking why the fuck they aren't ready to be packed already, the poor buggers on duty jump to it quick. Helped along by a few of our own on the inside, of course. I'm told the haul was over 20,000 semi-automatic rifles alone."
ENG_they_will_speak_of_sussex_desc:0 "Sussex. Aside from Coventry, you'll be hard pressed to find a more accursed part of England. Must be why Stirling loves the place. Loves the food, the atmosphere, the silly little traitors running about like headless chickens after we blow up a convoy. Sussex also is the linchpin to control the southern English coast by default, and if we can secure it for HMMLR we might just be able to give the more military minded lads an edge on the day of reckoning.\n\nOf course, we need to be careful to not attract the Garrison's attention. The traitors might be something of a joke when faced with our people, but the Germans only leave their best on our isle. Stirling says he likes the challenge, but even he knows his bravado only goes so far."
ENG_operation_bad_morning_desc:0 "It would be easy if we told ourselves that the traitors were all rotten from the start, but that isn't so, no matter what some of the Reds think. Sad fact is that most of the lads we fight don't know better, which is why it's all the more important that we get the ones who knew what an occupation of England would mean and went ahead anyway.\n\nGerald Templer fought with distinction for Britain in the first war with Germany; shame he couldn't have kept his spine for the second. Bastard was amongst those who signed the treaty, and no matter how many hints have been dropped his way he's never shown an interest in the cause. It's a big risk, but we know his driver and if we can smuggle a present into his car we might just strike a blow for all the world to see."
ENG_claudes_strategy_desc:0 "HMMLR is, despite the name, not united by a dedication to the restoration of the Queen, even if a significant portion of the membership supports it. In a movement with communists, republicans, and even a handful of fascists who've seen the light, what unites HMMLR is the figure of Claude Auchinleck.\n\nKnown to most simply as 'the Boss', almost nobody outside HMMLR's upper ranks is aware the former general turned MP leads the greatest rebel group in the Isles, and they would like to keep it that way. Claude Auchinleck united those who believe in a free England through sheer unwavering will, and he has kept his position by keeping the movement alive despite many attempts by the Collaborationist Government to ensure the opposite. HMMLR answers to Auchinleck, and no one else."
ENG_the_leader_speaks_desc:0 "Propaganda has value, something Claude Auchinleck has come to know quite keenly in the fight for English liberation. But when all the general public knows of HMMLR's rumoured leader is a shadowy figure playing chessmaster, it might be understandable that they feel uneasy about him. So Auchinleck took the risk of making his first public speech to the HMMLR membership.\n\nWith a scarf concealing his identity and some deliberate altering of the recorded audio, no one will ever guess the mild mannered MP from Hampshire is the one addressing a hall of HMMLR's most notorious militants. It is a speech that delves into many topics: the ruination of English soil, the unjust imprisonment of martyrs, the corruption of institutions once respected. But at the end, the hall and many people in their homes have but one thing to say. God Save the Queen."
ENG_flood_of_volunteers_desc:0 "As a Member of Parliament and a War Hero, Claude Auchinleck is afforded a certain respect by much of England. He was the last man standing in Carlisle after all, and as such he has become that patron of several charitable organisations in addition to hosting many public events.\n\nIt's merely a coincidence that HMMLR recruiters also frequent these events, and that Auchinleck often speaks to those who have reason to be disaffected from the current social order. Auchinleck knows that HMMLR cannot rely entirely on its extant forces: when the day of liberation comes every man who can hold a rifle will be needed. Thanks to his efforts, there may be a few more than expected."
ENG_staying_in_the_north_desc:0 "Claude Auchinleck fought the last battle of a united Britain around Carlisle, a desperate defence that culminated in him being forced to capitulate only as the official surrender was signed, buying time for Wimberley to retreat into Scotland. The North is his home as easily as London, and it's where HMMLR had built up a substantial network of support before even contacting Alexander and Stirling.\n\nSo it is fitting then that the freedom of England shall be reborn where it died, in the foothills of Northumberland and the dreary coasts of the Irish sea. Scotland is an unknown at this point in time, but even if they dare not oppose the Germans openly, they will almost certainly aid us with supplies and volunteers, even foreign ones. Of course the North will be more agreeable to the ever squabbling Alexander and Stirling as well, as it favours neither."
ENG_we_await_mr_president_desc:0 "The Americans are perhaps the only overseas ally we possess who can offer us more than cast offs and hand me downs in terms of material support. More importantly though, they are vital to our long term plans after England is liberated. Without American backing and membership within the Organization of Free Nations, England will be invaded whenever the Germans feel like it.\n\nTo that end, strengthening our relationship with Washington is a vital part of our operations, including, if need be, affirming certain basing rights following the war. For now though, all we need is the assurance that aid will come - not openly of course, lest the Germans involve themselves in turn - when we launch our uprising."
ENG_dominate_lancashire_desc:0 "Lancashire is perhaps the third most populous area in England, containing Manchester and several populous towns besides. As an industrial region, control of Lancashire will grant HMMLR a solid base from which to liberate the southern regions of England, for if we have control of the North then the South shall follow.\n\nThe process of doing so may be difficult, but it is worth the cost. We have contacts in the councils and trade unions, and the police are already mostly on our side, so we need not fear collaborationist interference there. But we will have to ensure that any troublesome elements are dealt with as soon as the call of liberation sounds. Not killed, but detained for the duration of our struggle."
ENG_operation_stock_desc:0 "A deficit of munitions is a consistent problem for our organisation. Smuggling can only mitigate the problem and heavy calibre weapons are scarce even amongst our better equipped units. Operation STOCK aims to solve this problem for us: several old depots near Carlisle are full of weapons, including numerous grenades and even some outdated tanks the Germans never got around to looting.\n\nHowever, as the facilities are guarded, we shall need at least six hours to evacuate the more valuable equipment, and that means silencing the area without regional collaborationist forces getting wind. Not impossible, especially with the German Garrison being far away. We will, however, need just a bit of luck, and quite possibly some silencers."
ENG_bills_connections_desc:0 "The revolution is not yet dead, not whilst Bill Alexander lives. He survived the war, Cable Street, and Russia, and there's no way in hell the fascists can succeed where their masters in Germania failed. He built the Left Resistance from the ground up, and now the revolution begins again.\n\nOur connection to the exile communities exceed even that of HMMLR proper, and with most of the dockworker's unions on our side, smuggling in supplies, weapons and even people is no problem at all. When HMMLR need explosives they come to us, when they need a message sent they ask us to do the sending, and whilst that bunch of monarchists might be reactionary they're in agreement with us on the main point: England will be free or dead by the time we're done."
ENG_under_their_noses_desc:0 "Smuggling might not be a dignified profession, but the revolution isn't built on soldiers alone. We need engineers, truck mechanics and factory workers just as badly as we do lads with a gun, and coming up with supplies in England can be a bit hard these days. Hence why the southern dockyards and their constant flow of ships are so important to us. With forewarning, we can get a shipment of old Yank rifles from dockside Liverpool to London or Carlisle in two days, less if we don't have to bribe the fascist guards.\n\nOf course our ability to get to and fro comes with some other uses too: more than one fascist official has gone missing on an evening stroll. More than a few others will join them."
ENG_win_with_wingate_desc:0 "The revolution has friends in high places: it has had to in order to survive these troubled times. One of them is a general working for the government by the name of Orde Wingate. No doubt the fascists thought him theirs when they negotiated his release from the Japanese after the war, but Wingate never forgot who abandoned him and his men to die, and he was most receptive to our plans for England.\n\nWingate will approach the fascist government to inquire as to whether he might train a force to hunt down Stirling and his Commandos who went rogue at the war's end, using the same tactics to track and eventually defeat them. Of course, what Wingate will actually be doing is training the beginning of a Red Army. One that will bring the fascists to their knees."
ENG_moving_south_desc:0 "Southern England is not a friendly place for would-be rebels. HMMLR avoids it as much as possible and even Stirling is reluctant to antagonise the Cornwall Garrison more than absolutely necessary. Perhaps then, it should be considered impressive that the South is the nucleus of Left Resistance support, centred around the dockyards, the factories and those closest to the unyielding boot of fascism.\n\nStarting a rebellion in the South is a risky proposition, but it also offers significant rewards if we can capitalise on early success. Surrounding London will make us appear to be the more legitimate government, and the Cornwall Garrison can be isolated and eliminated before it can call for German support. Alexander also promises that he can mobilise the hopeful revolutionaries into an army given time, but Stirling is hesitant. The decision falls to Auchinleck."
ENG_o_canada_desc:0 "Canada is famously the home of reactionary monarchy which opposes the fascist monarchy, which one might suppose is an improvement of sorts, but more importantly for the Left Resistance and by extension HMMLR, the Labour Underground has significant contacts in the former Dominion. Most of this support is political, legitimising our struggle with the exile community and Canadian government, but a significant amount of our material support originates from Canada as well.\n\nBill Alexander is of the opinion that the revolution needs allies to survive and thus far, few can call him incorrect. Given the events of Cable Street, Canada is a valuable lifeline. It might be time to start making extensive use of it."
ENG_sharpen_the_sickle_desc:0 "The revolutionary movement does not possess the elite force of Stirling's Commandos, nor do we have a truly large following in the armed forces like HMMLR, loyal to the memory of the monarchy. What we do possess however, is perhaps the greatest militia network in England, formed around the trade unions and factory workers. When the time comes the English proletariat will rise as one, and the fascists will pay their price in blood.\n\nFor now though we must organise these militias, give them goals and equipment so as to effect change on a more strategic level. Docks must be secured, arms factories for the enemy sabotaged, and their lines of communication cut if at all possible. For now as we sit back and sharpen the sickle of the revolution, we wait only for the hammer to fall upon its anvil."
ENG_operation_broken_telephone_desc:0 "Generals Evelyn Hugh Barker and Geoffrey Baker are two of the main fascist commanders in the South of England. Barker personally helped slaughter our comrades on Cable Street and Baker should have known better than to side with the fascists even if they did negotiate his release from Italy. Alexander has given the order: both are to be eliminated, and Birch's friend in intelligence, Philby, has some information that might be of use.\n\nThe two tend to work together in a regional headquarters which is protected, but relatively isolated and unprotected for its value. We know their routines, their schedules, and we also have a few good men ready to strike if need be - and perhaps liberate a nearby weapons cache at the same time."
ENG_operation_inspection_desc:0 "James Cassels - the name even sounds right for a bloody traitor. Well the problem with killing the bugger is that he's a bit paranoid; what kind of man swaps hotels at the last minute just because there was a storm? We wasted three perfectly good grenades on that bed! To top off the problem, he's well aware of the Commandos' weaknesses - he's just about the only traitor who's given us a bloody nose.\n\nBut the boss wants him gone and Stirling has been the one set to do it. He intends to send a team to break into the general's home and kill the man when he returns to it. A display like this will show the traitors that they are not even safe within their own homes from our justice."
ENG_operation_look_up_desc:0 "The fascists have something of an advantage over HMMLR in terms of their air capacity; we rely entirely on what few pilots are sympathetic to the revolutionary cause within the RAF whilst they have the bulk of the air force under lock and key. On top of that, we have been tasked by Auchinleck with removing one of the more competent fascist generals, a Michael Carver, from the table.\n\nBut an opportunity has arisen to kill two birds with one stone, for the fascist general is set to give a speech following the inspection of several planes donated by the Reich, new planes with a fearsome capacity for destruction. The revolution would be well served to be rid of them, and a few sabotaged engines and a kill team hiding amongst the aircrews should take care of the fascist and aircraft alike."
ENG_operation_loud_and_clear_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery was once our greatest champion; now he is a symbol of the collaborationist regime second to none. He signed the treaty with Germany following the fall of London and was the man who ordered Auchinleck to lay down his arms personally. His death is not something that can be argued against, it must happen and it must be done swiftly. The man might be old but he has a fearsome mind for tactics.\n\nMontgomery intends to take a brief trip to Cornwall to reconnoitre with the Garrison command there. It is up to HMMLR to ensure he never reaches that destination. As a final note, Auchinleck has requested that he not suffer unduly."
ENG_down_the_rabbit_hole_desc:0 "Bill Alexander has operated in the South of England for longer than just about anyone. He knows the lay of the land and has explained to the HMMLR High Command that it is impractical to just throw men at Cornwall and expect to get anywhere. A careful approach must be taken to neutralize them, subvert their men, kill the competent, bribe the weak minded and sabotage what we cannot steal.\n\nThis approach has its limits, of course, but we might be capable of getting more in the long term this way. If we get the right sort of people on our side in Truro, we might even find an opportunity to deal some permanent damage. The kind even a souless German cannot recover from."
ENG_pay_them_enough_desc:0 "The German Garrison in Cornwall is for the most part well trained, well disciplined and ruthlessly efficient, but every army has its weak links. In the case of the Garrison, it would appear that many of the lower ranking officers are of dubious loyalty to their vaunted fatherland, and more than open to taking bribes in return for looking the other way in regards to certain actions. The stealing of equipment, or not patrolling a section of the beaches for an hour or two.\n\nTruly the revolution has no greater ally than the incompetence of the fascists. We will render the Garrison in Cornwall a lackluster ally to the Traitor King. Here's hoping he quakes in his boots when he realises it."
ENG_and_remove_the_rest_desc:0 "Sometimes it pays to be direct. For every officer willing to take a bribe, there exists one who represents the peak of Germanic efficiency. As such, Alexander has formulated a solution to the problem: we shoot them.\n\nWell, not just shoot them. Bombs, car accidents, accidental doses of cyanide in the sauerkraut, maybe a faked suicide or three. In the end, as long as they die, we won't question how. Perhaps it might be prudent to just make a few vanish outright and scare the more cowardly into deserting? It's a problem solved at any rate. Something Auchinleck should be very happy about indeed."
ENG_be_more_practical_desc:0 "Why exactly the Boss told us to head down to Cornwall was fairly obvious: we don't get along with Germans all that well. Stirling had a plan to enact before we even reached the joint, and there's a slightly greater than even chance it involves copious amounts of explosives.\n\nThe fun thing about Cornwall is that it has all these things we normally don't get to blow up, steal, or kill. Infrastructure, brand new German weapons by the crateload, and even unwary German officers just standing on the street corners like they're waiting around for us. Of course, security is tight, and there's no chance the Commandos will be able to stick around for long, but it ought to be fun while it lasts."
ENG_take_whats_ours_desc:0 "The thing about a German military depot that makes it so much more exciting than a regular depot is the fact that we really don't have to worry about things like not shooting the bystanders. That, and their toys are a lot bigger than the ones we usually play around with.\n\nStirling wants a route to ship all the stuff we nick back to Auchinleck and HQ, and it seems that might just be doable, assuming we can get in contact with Alexander's lot at the ports. The land border is just too heavily guarded for Stirling's liking."
ENG_and_then_some_more_desc:0 "It turns out there are more places to store contraband in a ship than the average person might think. Who would have guessed you could shove a tank into the hull of a yacht? Mind, we still haven't figured out a method of getting it out, but we're working on it. Ammunition is in good supply too; it seems for all their postering, the Germans in Cornwall leave their depots lightly guarded with remarkable regularity, though that could be an indirect result of us shooting them.\n\nStill, Stirling says we'll be making our getaway soon. It seems the High Command are getting nervous about retaliation, but they just have one more job they'd like us to do first."
ENG_operation_franz_desc:0 "Franz Halder is the man who holds England in an iron grip. His Cornwall Garrison enforces the will of the Reich, and it is well past time that he paid for his crimes. We won't likely get an opportunity to try him, so it has been decided that assassinating him works just as well. In this case any blowback we receive will be well worth it, the man and his inner circle are irreplaceable officers and doubly so for their familiarity with England.\n\nThe plan itself has a few points of failure as possible. We intend to be in and out before the Garrison, much less the Collaborationist Government, is aware anything has even happened. We won't likely get a chance to repeat this attempt, since it will put the Garrison on high alert for months. We can only wish the assigned men the best of luck."
ENG_HMMLR_not_enough_time_desc:0 "Time is something that is not on our side. The Collaborationist Government is aware of this too: while we have stymied their best attempts to root us out thus far, each day that passes is more guns produced, more men recruited, more of our cells discovered.\n\nAuchinleck, Alexander, and Stirling have conferred with each other: the time is now. The war of liberation, of revolution, of revenge, a war for a Free England. For a better England. For all England. The men and women willing to take up arms for our cause are ready, we only await the word to strike our foes. Perhaps one day this will be remembered in song. We can only hope that song isn't a sad one."

When the smoke dies down, we can consider who is truly to blame for this catastrophe, but for now, we must turn to the matter at hand.\n\nThese communists and madmen fighting under the banner of the American puppet queen, Elizabeth, must be silenced and swiftly if England is to persevere.

What use are the kraut bastards if they cannot even effectively fight a rag-tag band of communists and university students? None, we say. It is time for the Cornwall Garrison to learn its place in the hierarchy of the emergency situation. Under us.\n\nHalder will bow, because he knows he cannot fight the rebels and ourselves at the same time. We can then proceed to use his forces as a meatshield whilst we rebuild a proper English army to solve an English problem.

He is what we need to deal with this swiftly, and effectively.\n\nTempler has suggested implementing a strategy of hearts and minds, and beating over the head anyone who isn't with the program to secure our rear from insurgent activity. The details are to be worked out later, but once the first phase of this plan is complete we will seek to meet the Rebel armies in open battle where our more professional troops hold the advantage.

The solution is simple, draconian response to confirmed actors, and some leniency towards the rest. We cannot afford to be seen as monsters outright, it would not do. Yet equally we cannot be seen to appear weakened by these actions if our government doesn't want more of these communists and madmen springing from the ground.\n\nWe need to send a message.

Let him inspire our men to feats of glory, and our civilians to work ever harder for victory.

Oliver Cromwell faced a similar issue when creating the New Model Army in the previous civil war, and there might just be something to learn from his example.\n\nOur military leadership is decent enough, but we lack proper veteran units. Fortunately, the rebels aren't so well equipped as us, and we can buy the time needed to train our men up to standard.

Our tanks are old, our guns are rusted, our artillery is lacking shells after the expenditures in past weeks.\n\nThis can be remedied, but it will take a concerted effort to bring our military up to standard. Consolidating frontline formations to take the best advantage of our superior equipment can mitigate our current losses. So too can we set up production lines for the long run.

It has come to our attention though, that this is not the case.\n\nSome we suspect are just spies, others may be opportunists. But a cabal of almost a dozen MPs is believed to be extant and plotting against our government from within. This war has tested our nation greatly, and unfortunately we can no longer afford to be merciful, they must be arrested and sequestered at a facility where we can determine exactly what they told that bastard Auchinleck. Now."

ENG_nothing_without_the_germans_desc:0 "Remember why this government, this preservation of the old order was formed. It was not because of any great love between our constituent parts. It was not because we hated someone else or loved each other. The Royal Party, and the current government, were formed because we fear what will happen should the Reich turn its gaze to us once more.\n\nFranz Halder and the Cornwall Garrison are the Reich for all intents and purposes now, at least on this island. We shall turn to our benefactors now, so that they remember our loyalty when the dust settles in mainland Europe. This is not honorable or just, this is a betrayal of English values, and this is entirely necessary to preserve as many lives as we can. It is our duty, and our burden."
ENG_panzers_in_liverpool:0 "Panzers in Liverpool"
ENG_panzers_in_liverpool_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison is amongst the finest fighting forces on the European continent. Forged in blood and iron. It seems almost unfair to pit them against the rabble of militia, geriatrics, and maniacs HMMLR calls an army. But then fairness was never the object of warfare.\n\nThe Panzers of the Reich will grind the traitors under their treads, and there will be nothing the traitors can do about it. They will try no doubt, perhaps even inflict some casualties. But these Panzers are even more deadly than the ones which broke the lines at Dover and Carlisle. The traitors don't stand a chance, and we must live with the consequences of our failure. May God forgive us, for our people may not."

ENG_watch_them_flee_desc:0 "One of the understated values of a professional military force is that it can reliably outlast even the most fanatical of militias. Certainly the diehard communists and Stirling's men thought they were hard and unbreakable when they set themselves in the Garrison's path. Perhaps against our armies, they might have been.\n\nFranz Halder broke his teeth in the first war, he crushed us in the second. Some militia armed with three decade old rifles and antiquated hand grenades? Hardly a challenge for the best men the Reich has produced. Now our opponents flee before us, and it is time we pressed the advantage hard."
ENG_stukas_in_the_air:0 "Stukas in the Air"
ENG_stukas_in_the_air_desc:0 "The rebels caught us off guard with the air raid on Plymouth. Unfortunate yes, but we can prevent that from recurring. The Luftwaffe detachment in England is small, mostly some dated ground attack aircraft and a handful of more modern fighters. They can still outfly the entire rebel arsenal of aircraft by a factor of six. Combined with our own small but effective air force, and it might be possible for our forces to completely control the air war within weeks. Once we rule the air, it becomes a mere matter of time before we can utilize this control to push the traitors back on the ground. A man being attacked from two directions is significantly easier to catch off guard than one being attacked from just the one after all."
ENG_hide_the_damage:0 "Hide the Damage"
ENG_hide_the_damage_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the Cornwall Garrison is rather short on reinforcements, and this is beginning to show in ways we do not like. The panzers are running low on spare parts, their vaunted anti-tank explosive arsenal is running out entirely, and the less said about our situation in the air the better. Yet we have put our eggs in this basket, and if the basket breaks so too will our military apparatus. We cannot afford the Germans to seem in any way weakened. Not just so that our enemies don't get emboldened, but so that our troops don't ask shortsighted questions on why we bow. It must be remembered that whatever happens in these coming months, the Germans will end their civil war some day. We do not want them to be displeased when they next decide to look across the Channel."

ENG_the_paper_tiger_stripped_naked_desc:0 "Perhaps it is our fault. Perhaps we overestimated the strength of the Garrison's forces. Yet how were we to know they would crumble after a scant few months of high intensity warfare? The Garrison's forces crushed the uprising in London a decade ago, they ran roughshod over the best of the best the rebels of the day had. Yet here they are, faltering. Weakening. Visibly so, enough that our own forces have noticed it.\n\nThe Cornwall Garrison is, unfortunately, no longer suitable for front line combat initiatives. They simply lack the men required to put up a fight, and now we shall be forced to pick up the slack. Had we focussed our efforts on rebuilding the English portions of the army instead of supporting the Garrison this mightn't be bad news. But we didn't, and it isn't. Now we must lie in the bed of misery we made."

ENG_the_horrific_lie_desc:0 "This government said it could protect the people of England from war and horror. This government assured all that it was the only path to an England free of the terrors in the night. This government has failed in that duty. The Prime Minister has been made aware that soon if the fighting cannot be ended, we shall be forced to resort to desperate measures. If we are put in a position where the Germans end their war before ours, and they decide to intervene, our nation will not survive what comes after.\n\nTherefore, this government must consider unconventional measures to ensure our survival. Unconventional tactics, unconventional technologies, and unconventional men. One man in particular. One who is hated by all, and yet has the last real reserves of uncommitted troops in England.\n\nArthur Kenneth Chesterton."
ENG_call_up_chesterton:0 "Call Up Chesterton"
ENG_call_up_chesterton_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton made his name as the man who was the first to parrot the German line on English policy, and few have ever held any form of affection for the man. Yet, it is hard to deny that he has his uses. Personal connections with high ranking German figures, a paramilitary organisation whose size and reach is without peer in the isles, and being the de facto voice of national socialism within England gives him authority beyond his official position as a mere MP.\n\nChesterton's influence, unlike ours, hasn't declined with the ongoing war. Indeed it has strengthened and grown like a weed. Now it is time to tap in to that strength, to unleash it on our enemies and hope we can end this without all of England burning down around us. This is not a kind act, but if we don't use Chesterton now, we may not have the chance to reconsider again."
ENG_blackshirts_behind_their_lines:0 "Blackshirts Behind Their Lines"
ENG_blackshirts_behind_their_lines_desc:0 "Chesterton has proven most cooperative, in particular he has directed his blackshirts to aid our forces in anti partisan actions behind the lines. They might be brutes and thugs, but whilst these men are performing a vital service they are freeing up soldiers to head for the front lines. Relieving our manpower issues and ensuring that whatever comes in the next offensive, we aren't the ones outnumbered.\n\nThere have been complaints of course, about the exact nature of the actions some of the Blackshirt Battalions have been taking. Rumours of massacres in villages friendly to HMMLR, rumours of darker things still occurring to captured agents and soldiers of certain ethnic and ideological backgrounds. There must always be sacrifices though, and who are we not to allow our enemies to pay the price of defeat rather than us? When victory arrives, we can account for the costs then."
ENG_fuel_for_the_sacred_flame:0 "Fuel for the Sacred Flame"
ENG_fuel_for_the_sacred_flame_desc:0 "The Royal Party has never been particularly fond of embracing some of the ideological facets of fascism. Even though the hardliners within our ranks proclaimed their allegiances, not since the early days has our government taken a fascist stance on policy. Instead we look to the past, to the conservative era of dominance, and we draw our legitimacy from that vision.\n\nOur alliance with Chesterton is changing this somewhat. Espousing fascist doctrines that our allies in Germania hold dear is now becoming more commonplace amongst the political and military rank and file. Some of this is opportunism in reaction to Chesterton's growing influence no doubt, but some of them seem to be adhering from genuine ideological convictions. Were this any other time or place, it might be prudent for this government to act. As it stands however, we cannot afford to. We must take notes to keep watch on the true believers when this is all over. Lest we burn in the fires of fascism ourselves."
ENG_the_legion_marches_forward:0 "The Legion Marches Forward"
ENG_the_legion_marches_forward_desc:0 "Chesterton has come to the General Staff with a proposal. A proposal that has the potential to change the war. His Blackshirts have grown strong recently, toughened up by guerrilla fighting in our rear lines. Chesterton wants this strength to be directed at our enemies hearts, and for a division to be formed from his paramilitary organisation. To be used and unleashed upon our enemies floundering armies.\n\nWe would not have considered this for a second earlier in the war, but we are out of men. We are out of time. We have no one else to turn to, and he is offering us a way out. The division will be formed, and our enemies will break before it. They must break, they must. If this does not grant us victory nothing will, and if all this death and torment has been pointless. Perhaps it is for the best that we lose this struggle. So far have we descended in our struggle to survive, that now we can barely recognise ourselves in a mirror. He will have his division, may our enemies choke on it. May the almighty God forgive us for our sins."

Not for all her faults in defence of some foreign conquest, or for her own interests but because Britain had sought to stop the endless march of fascist butchery across Europe. Traitors from within sat upon her corpse, and those who would fight for what is right and just were forced to hide in the shadows.\n\nNo longer.\n\nThe banner is raised, the weapons are ready and the Reich lies riven by chaos and petty conflict. There is no better time for this, there will be no second chance. Today, the people of England raise their heads, and march to make war on those who betrayed them all those years ago. Our men and women are not aligned by some petty ideology or creed, but because to struggle against tyranny is the only right and just course of action left to us.

HMMLR is a cause not united by some ideological vision, it is a cause for all those who want vengeance on the beasts which despoiled our nation, and on the traitors who helped them do it.\n\nBill Alexander, the bloody Red General stands with us, he stitched together the Left Resistance after London and he'll guide us through this fight come hell or high water. Now, we shall strike down the old order. They will know our rage. They will know our suffering, and they will know that we forgot not a single one of their horrid acts.

An army without a supply base will soon be reduced to sticks and stones.\n\nOur factory workers know what will happen if they don't contribute. They know the horrors the traitors and their German masters will unleash given half a chance.

Gun manufacturing can be outsourced from dedicated production facilities to the individual fronts so long as it is uncomplicated firearms that are being produced, so too can ammunition production be spread out to be less vulnerable to traitor interference.\n\nThis fight will decide our fates, this last gasp of the revolution thought destroyed at Third Cable Street, and we had best not be found lacking in our efforts.

In her exile she has constantly strove for the liberation of her birthplace, and not once has she entertained offers of peace or conciliation.\n\nA true monarch is one who never ceases to inspire their people, rather than betray them to the Reich like the current occupant of Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth has become more than a representative, she has become an icon for the cause of liberty. The restoration of the golden age is at hand, we only need take it from the traitors cold dead hands.

Though we reject their authority for refusing to stay and fight, we cannot ignore their proffered support. Canada is an important member of the Organisation of Free Nations after all, and so long as Germany is distracted by their Civil War we might as well take advantage of the free oceans. Guns, men, bombs. A myriad of technologies and materials we cannot produce in great numbers or quality.\n\nFor the restoration of Her Majesty, we require every possible advantage over the traitors, and thanks to the generosity of our kin in Canada, we will receive enough to make bastards choke on their German cast offs."

Boys barely old enough to vote shoulder rifles, alongside farmers and factory workers. Women too.\n\nWe shall remember them all, and we will honour their sacrifice by striking down the traitors where they cower. Had they not given into the promises of Germania none of this need have happened. Had they not given in when victory was possible, we might have survived without the tyranny of the Reich.

They have after all, fought for longer than just about everyone else.\n\nAll the other rebel groups who started fighting shortly after Britain fell are dead. Down to a one. Soldiers and civilians, men and women who stood up for what was right. Stirling remembers them, he and his men are but a remnant of the once mighty British Army, where all the others went underground or gave up. His lot are crotchety and vicious to a one, but by God are they some of the fiercest fighters on these isles.

Modern American weapons, former soldiers willing to fight fascism wherever it stands. He's even managed to sequester small amounts of military grade explosive compounds rather than the improvised weapons we traditionally rely on. With this, we shall make the traitors fear us.

You use anger to aid in doing what is necessary. Why after all, is it any more honorable to kill ten thousand men in a battle than it is to kill a dozen at dinner? The traitors will learn this the hard way. They will die at dinner and whilst walking in the park. Their businesses will be burned, their homes will be shelled, their German allies will be shown no mercy.\n\nThey've done all that and more to us after all. A taste of their own medicine is long overdue."

Their revolution would not die, and the Communist Party of Great Britain suffered great and terrible losses in their struggle against the Reich.\n\nWe might not see eye to eye on everything with the heirs of Harry Pollitt, hell we don't even like them that much. Yet, they are here fighting and dying alongside us. When the chips were down, they stayed and fought for a free England. Closer cooperation than a mere united front might be worth considering.\n\nAs it happens, Bill Alexander has been having similar thoughts on the subject.

Yes, they will doubtless cause more casualties, some of them civilian, yet would not a traitor victory kill even more? A question of semantics perhaps, but it is one we are having to face the possibility of no longer being a mere theoretical question. Stirling promises many things, but he promises victory most of all. Victory will allow us to rebuild, to recover. To repent. HMMLR will not be the same untarnished organisation it started as by the end of this war, but if we survive we can make amends later.

He's the one who's been feeding all that juicy information to us, and now we can use that knowledge to plan something very special indeed.\n\nPeople never notice someone who's meant to be there after all. It's remarkably easy to get anywhere so long as you look like you're on important business. With Philby's aid, we'll target the traitor intelligence apparatus root and stem.

Tanks chiefly, will give us enough punch to surpass the traitor armed forces, but the process of getting them will doubtless be unwieldy.\n\nStill, we are out of options in terms of getting other material advantages, and the traitors can't expect the same from their murderous friends currently killing each other in the Reich. This coming offensive will make our cause, or it will break it."

FEN_allow_unrestricted_bombings_desc:0 "The traitors must not simply be beaten, they must be punished. They ruined the British Empire, tore it down root and stem. We don't even control our island anymore. This merits punishment, and what better punishment than the one their masters inflicted upon us? Arthur Harris should have been listened to back in the war but we cannot change what was. We can merely give his advice the appropriate consideration now. Their factories will be bombed, their armies will be bombed, their homes will be turned into ash and cinder. We will make them regret their treachery if it is the last thing we do. Even if we do not beat them, we will make them regret their victory."

The traitors are more than the lapdogs of Germania, they represent something dark at the heart of old England. Something reactionary, unwilling to accept even the most minor challenge to its hoarded gold.\n\nIntegration with the Left Resistance at a command level will pose issues of course, but Bill Alexander's ideas for the introduction of political officers to regiments unwilling to go all the way in the cause of liberation is worth considering. We need to win this war together, or we will most assuredly die alone and forgotten. If living with the communists is the price of that? It is one we can more than afford to pay."

Our cause will be snuffed out and we ourselves will long for death after the Reich is finished with us. The war must be finished or else. Claude Auchinleck in his time as a general was informed about some covert facilities being prepared before Sealion. They were never finished, but the weapons that were made might still be functional. Weapons that choke the air, and burn the skin. Mines that explode twice, to catch the rescuers. Fouler things too, that should never have to see the light of day. We need these, we need them all. This will be our last opportunity for victory, and we cannot afford to miss it. God will have to judge us should we fail. Or for that matter, should we succeed."

Bill Alexander's men are massing behind the lines, whilst Stirling is marshalling what he can of his depleted elites.\n\nThis will be our end, or it will be our salvation.

The traitors and communists of HMMLR are captured, dead or on the run and their American backers seem to have given up on attempting to assert their influence for the moment. All it cost was the blood of tens of thousands of people.\n\nYet in the midst of this tragedy we can yet look to the future. England has remained independent and free of obligation to those parasites across the Atlantic, now we can rebuild what was lost. The government which led England for two decades continues its guidance, with luck this shall continue for a long time to come."

Prime Minister Douglas-Home shall be handing in his resignation to the King, a successor is already in place in the form of that young Thatcher woman. She's a smart one by any measurement and the party will keep her in line should she let power get to her head. There is little better time to announce such a change."
ENG_the_oxford_trials_desc:0 "HMMLR fought in the name of a failed branch of the House of Windsor who were part of the group that led our nation to ruin in the Second World War, perhaps it is unsurprising that they were utterly defeated. Regardless, we now hold many thousands of their members prisoner and we need to do something with them. Not in London obviously, too many people around and too easy for things to go wrong.\n\nOxford is close enough that we can transport the leaders of HMMLR in with no issue, there in the university grounds ravaged by conflict we will decide the fate of those people who would tear our country down for such petty reasons. Heedless of if their actions might open up the possibility of the Germans reinvading the moment they looked out way. Let them suffer justice, let it be swift and public."
ENG_meeting_with_montomery_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery has been our foremost military commander for some decades now. If one ignores his failure in the face of the Reich, the man has defeated every foe to come against him, including a good number of his former colleagues during the Civil War. Speaking of which, his presence in that most dreadful conflict is what enabled us to win, and we ought to reward him handsomely.\n\nParades, some commemorative medals for the soldiery, and a few memorials to start off. But he must also be informed of the change in leadership that is soon to occur. He might be one of the old guard, but Montgomery values stability as much as the next man. As such, we know he'll do the right thing."
ENG_an_announcement_for_everyone_desc:0 "Douglas-Home has settled the matter of succession with the Moderate faction of the Royal Party higher ups long ago. Margaret Thatcher is bright enough to not be befuddled by the political machinations of the reformists or the brute demagogue nature of the hardliners, whilst also not having a power base of her own with which she might deviate from the Royal Party's own goals. The Moderates will have the power they have earned through blood, sweat and tears.\n\nNow it is a mere matter of informing the rest of the nation that a change of management is due. It should be fine, England has had what, a dozen Prime Ministers resign by this point? It is doubtful the person on the street will even notice."

Horribly in the sense of, the Royal Party no longer has a majority in government and we cannot get enough independents to work with us to form a new one.\n\nThe "Royal Divorce" as the event is becoming known, means that England might be forced to hold new elections soon. Unlike previous elections under the Royal Party we now have a potentially serious opposition and no way to effectively keep them from running. The future of this nation is up in the air like a coin, and nobody is certain upon which head it shall land. That of reform or stability?"
ENG_no_chance_to_win_mac_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a party of stability, of safety and an unflinching iron will. Margaret Thatcher might be young, but she grew up amidst the violence of the Second World War, survived the Civil War where many others deserted for greed or ideals, and has held together the Moderate faction of the Royal Party where others might have buckled. Let Macmillan and that oaf Chesterton try to assert otherwise but it was not they who led our nation through the greatest series of crises in living memory.\n\nWe are the Royal Party, as immovable as the island upon which we live and we will never let England suffer like the foolish leaders of old did when they fought the Reich with no hope of victory. We will move on from this setback and emerge victorious once more, whatever the cost."
ENG_not_so_easy_desc:0 "Having a third of one's party abandon ship all at the same time might seem like a downside to the unprepared, but being the party of establishment in England comes with a few advantages. For example, knowing when a politician has accepted bribes and from whom. A discreet bit of buggery might not be so discreet if the wrong person were to speak to the right papers, and that's saying nothing of the affairs we could reveal to a spouse looking for a divorce.\n\nIf they want to leave our party so badly they should have remembered that we tolerated these things only as long as they served our interests. Leaving the party means leaving our protective influence as well, and wouldn't it just be a shame for things to go wrong for a few of those men?"
ENG_we_wont_stop_winning_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a party of dignity, of tradition and of England. Whom was it who guided our fair nation through many a year of strife and difficulty? Whom was it that protected our nation from disaster and violence? It wasn't the fascists or the liberals, of that much you can be sure.\n\nWe do not need to stoop to such petty methods as blackmail when we can point to our many successes over the years. That we will also be spending a proverbial tonne of money on reconstruction efforts, orphanages and the like might not hurt our popularity with the masses. Whilst we think of it, it might be worth pointing out that our opponents are most decidedly not following our example, or minimize it when they do. Either works, but money is spent getting people onside rather than convincing our opponents to drop out."
ENG_anyone_but_chesterton_desc:0 "Say what you will about United England, they have a goal that might be stupid but is not in and of itself a terrible idea, just one they wish to enact too soon and too hastily. They are our opponents not our enemies. The same can most assuredly not be said of the National Front, the absolute last thing that our nation needs is fascists being anywhere near government. Or anywhere near society for that matter.\n\nThe National Front don't have their German masters to protect them anymore, time to deal with the rabid dog they represent. A concerted campaign against them will need to be enacted, perhaps we could even collaborate with United England on the matter. They like the National Front even less than we do after all."
ENG_what_a_useful_old_man_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is the pathetic, shrivelled shell of a once great statesman. So bewitched by visions of a fascist England that he cannot even recognise the hole he digs for his own future. Yet that can wait for the moment, Chesterton is doing a good job gathering all of the disaffected far right behind him in one neat, recogniseable and recordable block, more importantly he is splitting the vote of those against our own party but not especially convinced by any one candidate.\n\nSo long as Chesterton is around, it will be incredibly difficult for United England to achieve an effective majority in Parliament. We can deal with the fool himself afterwards."
ENG_convince_who_we_can_desc:0 "United England is not a party of fools like the National Front, there are legitimately well intentioned men and women in that party, who were colleagues of Thatcher for years. Who is to say we cannot peel off a few dissidents led astray by Macmillan, playing nice might even enable us to integrate some of our lost base in some areas back into the fold.\n\nIf we fail, what's the worst that could happen? We are shown to be the more reasonable and stability minded of the two parties who could possibly win the election? Well, even in that scenario we don't lose anything so why not. Let us open our arms for the uncertain, let the truly foolish separate themselves from our grace here and now."
ENG_just_get_rid_of_trouble_desc:0 "When the proffered hand is rejected you do not offer another, you cut off the problem at its root. We cannot allow United England to win, the consequences might be disastrous for our nation if that fool Maudling or the scheming Macmillan get anywhere near real power. A disaffected Germany or worse, an angry one comes to mind. The Garrison might be weakened after all but it is also right here.\n\nArrest the more prominent on charges of corruption, it might not always stick but at the least we can cast doubt upon their touted honesty. Some blackmail might not be a bad idea as well, not for United England proper but those who might be tempted to support them. We will stop this nonsense if it's the last thing the Royal Party does."
ENG_midlands_is_the_key_desc:0 "The Midlands of England are one of the areas most contested by United England and ourselves. The North is their domain, the South and London mostly hold to the Royal Party. Yet the Midlands remain stubbornly uncertain in who they'll vote for. Birmingham and other cities being the worst offenders.\n\nIf the Royal Party were to devote the overwhelming majority of our funds towards campaigning in the Midlands we might very well come out of this election stronger even than before the coalition collapsed. Macmillan and his puppet Maudling likely think the same, and should they take advantage before we do it might become a difficult proposition to beat them. Margaret has suggested to our campaign managers that we move on this, quickly."
ENG_better_focus_on_the_base_desc:0 "The South was once our stronghold, it still is to be honest. Yet there have been some worrying signs about how some of our more important constituencies might vote, and Thatcher has ordered our campaign to focus their attention on securing the region electorally. If we hold on in the South after all it doesn't matter how many seats United England wins elsewhere, nobody in a hundred years has won without London and nobody in the next hundred will either. It might not be as fancy as winning a supermajority, but for what Margaret has planned a regular majority will be more than enough. To the winner goes the spoils after all."
ENG_their_inevitable_loss_desc:0 "The polls look good, Thatcher is in the lead for preferred Prime Minister over Maudling and Chesterton by an extremely satisfying series of numbers. Oh how the fascists and the fools must be gnashing their teeth at what they see coming to fruit before them. The Royal Party has led this nation for decades, what could they possibly hope to achieve that might outdo our own accomplishments?\n\nVictory is just a matter of time, and on that fateful day we will proceed without the hindrance of reformists or the bull headed refusal to adapt of the hardliners. England will tread a moderate path under Thatcher, so long as dear Margaret remembers who she answers to in the end."
ENG_its_all_against_you_thatcher_desc:0 "England was saved by the Royal Party from destruction all those years ago, it is true. However, in their position of power, what was once a noble party has given into petty greed and corruption. Harold Macmillan and Reginald Maudling saw this, and though they tried to convince the Royal Party to change its ways, it would not. So United England was formed to reform England into what it used to be. A land of freedom, of justice, and of true democracy.\n\nThatcher will be defeated, the Royal Party thrust from power by the will of the people, and England will finally be rid of those who oppose the democratic process. Maudling will lead this change, and Macmillan will be in the background making sure people get the message right."
ENG_united_england_the_best_choice_desc:0 "United England is more than a mere attempt to replace the Royal Party, it is a movement to supersede its very existence in every way. Let us show the people of England this not through words but through deeds. Having our members rebuild houses and roads, find families for the orphans, and homes for the homeless, we will prove ourselves to be better connected with the English people than the aristocratic Royal Party.\n\nWe will have votes from the farmer and the factory worker, from the postman and the constable and every working man and woman who has been done wrong by our former friends. Let us right the injustice, and let us correct the errors made by those who care not for the normal Englishman."
ENG_rotten_royal_party_desc:0 "We have successfully brought more than a third of the former Royal Party over to our way of seeing things. Why not go for more? Oh, to be sure, they might not be the most democratically inclined of folks, but Macmillan has a certain way with people which might disabuse them of trying anything untoward. They can get in line with the future of England or they can risk the consequences.\n\nWe need the appearance of broad support in order to stand a chance against the entrenched apparatus of the Royal Party, and who better to help with this than former members of the Royal Party? For those unwilling to see the truth of democracy of course, we can always promise looking the other way about some of their past discretions."
ENG_the_mans_insane_desc:0 "The mere idea that English politics tolerate a literal fascist standing for any parliamentary seat is an outrage of the highest order. It was the fascists who destroyed the United Kingdom, it was the fascists who bombed our homes and salted our fields. We should be hanging Chesterton and all his friends from the nearest belfry, not tolerating their existence in politics.\n\nBut we are a civilised people, we will take our case to the general populace on the matter of Arthur Kenneth Chesterton. Let us examine his every decision, his every act of treachery to the fair people of England. Let us let United England be the ones to show the entire nation his depraved and evil true self. This might not be the most strategic of decisions, but all agree it is what needs to be done if England ever hopes to be a true democracy once again."
ENG_lets_battle_it_out_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is an utter imbecile. An embarrassment to the very fabric of reasonable English politics. Yet, he has a singular use that will have us tolerate his existence for now. He shares a pool of votes with Margaret Thatcher, that being the far right who would never vote for United England in the first place but might well not vote for Thatcher either.\n\nIf Chesterton is taken out of the political framework too early then he might not get a chance to siphon these votes. We have nothing to worry about, after all he'll never win on his own. We will get to the matter of his fate in the long run, but for now we will just let him be and prepare our options. We are, after all, a civilised people, unlike him."
ENG_a_risky_risky_bet_desc:0 "United England has a greater purpose than merely overthrowing the Royal Party, we seek to restore democracy as well. That cannot always be done by honest tactics, hence why Macmillan and Maudling have amassed some funds for a somewhat nefarious act that will serve a pure goal.\n\nTo put it bluntly, we don't have the political framework the Royal Party enjoys and without friends in all levels of society, United England faces an insurmountable challenge. Many people will side with us, because they do not share our cause, so we will pay them to hear us out. Even if we just get a few hundred friendly faces it will all be worth it, for what is more important in an election than having the voters trust on your side?"
ENG_get_the_money_ready_desc:0 "The Royal Party is fragmenting, falling apart under its own grotesque corruption and weight. Why not seize this opportunity to try and get an outright majority of the former Royal Party MPs inside United England? It would immensely aid our efforts to secure influence, and speed along some of our programmes very nicely.\n\nThere is a risk to this plan. United England attracts voters who want reform and change, so having most of our party be people once affiliated with the moderate RP who mismanaged the country so badly will not do our public perception any favours, to say nothing of what ammunition it might give the opposition. As with all things it is a question of balance - should we risk it, or try something more subtle?"
ENG_midlands_and_only_the_midlands_desc:0 "Amidst the factories and rolling fields of the Midlands lies a great opportunity for United England to secure the election firmly. The Midlands are populous, and unlike the South they might be persuaded to vote for us, not the Royal Party. A concentrated and thorough campaign in the region will give us an outright majority of seats, provided nothing goes wrong, and the Royal Party knows it. Wasting their resources trying to defeat us here rather than aiming for the North will be their downfall.\n\nThe Midlands also represented some of the core HMMLR support back in the Civil War, and the people still remember the names of Bill Alexander and David Stirling with glee in the dark alleys. We might, covertly, promise to keep the idealistic part of that legacy alive."
ENG_northern_english_voting_treasure_desc:0 "The English North is the core of United England, filled with anti-London sentiments which have provided the backbone for our party's growth. If the Royal Party were to oust us here, we would not stand a chance of winning the election. That is why we must guard our seats here carefully. The Midlands are likely not going to vote for us anyway, but should the North falter then we will face a problem not even a miracle might reverse.\n\nLess publicly, the North was the core of HMMLR support, and though misguided we can use these attitudes to serve our own vision of English democracy, so long as we aren't too obvious about appealing to that demographic that is."
ENG_whats_left_to_sort_out_desc:0 "The polls don't lie, Reginald Maudling is the most popular candidate for Prime Minister by a margin greater than Alec Douglas-Home's first ministry, a proper achievement in and of itself. With the election just weeks away we now face the problem of what might do following our victory.\n\nReform is a dangerous word, but Macmillan wants to restore the English democracy no matter what, and to hell with those who suggest we ought to keep some of the Royal Party's corruption around for our own ends. Let the National Front and the Royal Party squabble for the scraps of influence they have left, we will outlast them and leave them in the dustbin of history. Democracy is England's birthright, and we shall deliver."

FEN_a_forgotten_word_england_desc:0 "Freedom, a word the former traitor government would have rather preferred to be unmentioned for the rest of time. Freedom is not simply a word however, it is a state of mind, one that pushes the greatest of men into actions considered impossible. Monarchists and communists, soldiers and labourers and churchmen all worked together not because of force or fear. They fought as one because they would rather die free than live oppressed under the traitor's boots.\n\nHMMLR is victorious, and England is now free of the rule of those who betrayed it to the fascists decades ago. We have won, and from Dover to Carlisle it is the banner of a Free England which flies. We did this not for personal glory, but so that the children born in this land will never again have to witness the jackboot of the Reich."
FEN_assembly_of_heroes_desc:0 "Now that the struggle is won, HMMLR will have to deal with the aftermath. With so many figures in the Collaborationist government refusing to defect it leaves England with something of a deficit of civilian leadership not tied to HMMLR directly. Thus HMMLR must take up the responsibility of planning the nations future, especially the free elections promised so often in our pleas to the people. A meeting will be necessary for this.\n\nClaude Auchinleck, the leader of HMMLR who united men from every facet of society under him. Bill Alexander, the Red General who put aside his own misgivings with HMMLR to free England from fascism. David Stirling, the Mad General who never stopped fighting, no matter the cost. These men and others will determine the future of our nation."
FEN_urgent_matters_first_desc:0 "Whilst having a debate about the merits of bringing back the institution of the monarchy in a forum filled with ardent monarchists, republicans and outright communists would be fascinating, it might also take several hundred years. There are a thousand minor political differences between the assorted factions of HMMLR, but none of them matter now. We can decide on purely political problems once elections are done and the English people have chosen.\n\nFor the moment our chief goal should be repairing the damage inflicted upon our country by the Civil War, either through reckless action on our part or sadistic spite from traitor formations. There are a thousand and one matters which take place over politics, and the provisional government must be focused on those issues alone."
FEN_a_responsible_political_system_desc:0 "HMMLR is a diverse organisation, one made of promises and compromise rather than any definite political ideology. But with new elections being held members of HMMLR are in many cases the natural choices to represent or even become leaders in the new political landscape. But Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander are unwilling to lead their former followers personally, and have instead agreed to support the creation of new civilian led parties.\n\nBill Alexander seeks to draw his own old CPGB, the Labour Underground and the myriad of smaller leftist parties that made up the Left Resistance into the Socialist Labour Party. Whilst Claude Auchinleck looks to convince the establishment, liberal and former conservative party members who opposed the Collaborationist government into a National Democratic League."
FEN_the_young_democracy_law_desc:0 "Nothing is more threatening to a fledgling state than its first steps. Be it ambitious military officers or politicians seeking to make new opportunities for personal gain it is always at the beginning that a state is most vulnerable to falling from its path. Auchinleck and Alexander are well aware of this, and more importantly both are well aware of the possible consequences of any part of HMMLR trying to subvert the democratic process.\n\nThus the Young Democracy Law has been proposed, which will give authority to a select council of HMMLR veterans to, during the formative years of this resurrected democracy, suspend that democracy for the good of the English people if need be. Only with the mutual agreement of both Auchinleck and Alexander can this law be enacted, and only against a threat using the guise of democracy to end or pervert it, or the collapse of democratic institutions leaving England without good governance."
FEN_root_out_the_rot_desc:0 "We have won the battle, but our work is far from over.\n\nThough we have secured control over England, there remain many who are sympathetic to the Collaborator government, and the fascist ideology it encouraged. There is no better manifestation of this threat than the National Front, an extremist movement which has only grown more dangerous now that they are unrestrained by the collaborators.\n\nThis threat must be ended before it can spread, and there will be no delays. We will expunge this fascist rot from England before it can take root in the hearts and minds of the people again. There can be no hesitation or mercy - fascism has ruined our nation once.\n\nWe will ensure it never will again."
FEN_what_to_do_with_the_jackboots_desc:0 "Our administration faces a question - the fate of the Collaborator military who are now in our custody.\n\nWhile the ranking officers and generals will be tried and punished, what to do with the non-commissioned officers and the footsoldiers has caused some disagreement. While each of them chose the wrong side in the conflict, not every soldier who fought against us is evil or deserves to be treated as harshly as those who were responsible for maintaining the government.\n\nAt the same time, these men knowingly joined a government of fascist collaborators, and spent years ensuring their power was maintained - and for some that is unforgivable. No matter what happens, this question must be answered - and answered soon."
FEN_undoing_their_evils_desc:0 "England is wounded, none can deny that our land is a shattered remnant of what it once was. The Civil War caused much destruction it is true, tens of thousands of needless deaths and entire towns left broken by shells and gunfire. Yet the Collaborationist government did a great deal of damage in their rule as well, damage far harder to heal. Our academics were hunted or forced to toe the government line, the unions of workers beaten into submission or forced underground altogether. To say nothing of the political persecution of opposition parties.\n\nIt now falls to HMMLR to repair this damage, to undo what went wrong and give the people a glimmer of hope that the future we promised will be worth the wait. Be we soldiers of Stirling, Alexander or Auchinleck, we owe our countrymen that at least."
FEN_begin_demobilization_desc:0 "The struggle of liberation was one undertaken by a good many tens of thousands of loyal Englishmen. From villages and factories, dockyards and farms they came. Men and boys and even women who all knew that the evils of fascism and totalitarianism had to be expunged from our nation whatever the cost.\n\nThe top ranks have spoken and it's been agreed that now that the struggle is over, it's time for most of our men to return home. Let them trade guns for hammers and rakes and ploughshares, let them return to normalcy. A professional core of HMMLR fighters will stay on of course but they will exist to form the backbone of the future English army, not to oppress the people they are supposed to protect like the Traitor forces had done."
FEN_mending_our_wounds_desc:0 "With the immediate issues we have faced after the civil war dealt with, a modicum of stability has once more returned to England - at least for now.\n\nNow our efforts must turn to recovery.\n\nThe civil war caused significant damage across the country, and it is our responsibility to begin repairing the nation. We will begin mobilizing all of the resources of the government - civilian and military alike - to undertake a national reconstruction.\n\nA reconstruction that will need all of England to come together, to succeed."
FEN_clearing_unexploded_ordinance_desc:0 "Wars are not accurate affairs. As often as not a shell or bomb will miss its target entirely, and with significant fighting in urban and rural areas of England alike we now face the unfortunate problem of numerous explosive devices including actual landmines which, for one reason or another failed to detonate as they were intended to.\n\nUsing an all volunteer force, Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have catalogued the areas with the highest number of unexploded munitions and sent demining crews in to, slowly, solve the problem. This might well take years to effect fully, and it is entirely possible that England will never be 100 percent free of explosive refuse, but it will be an improvement for our people."
FEN_life_begins_anew_desc:0 "HMMLR is a volunteer force, we had no need to conscript when the vast majority of our fighters were militiamen or defecting soldiers. Alas but being a volunteer does not insulate our soldiers from the effects of combat. Shellshock is rampant amongst those units which spent a great deal of time on the front lines, especially the militia formations which bore the brunt of much of the fighting. Many who fought for our cause lost limbs, senses and even family members when brother fought brother amidst the chaos. We owe them more than mere words can convey.\n\nWe shall do our best to ensure nobody who sacrificed something dear to their person for a Free England will be forgotten, and that those who sacrificed everything shall be remembered forever."
FEN_start_reconstruction_desc:0 "With much of the civilian leadership rendered unable to assist us due to their siding with the Collaborationist Government and what civilian apparatus we do possess mostly being limited to the more local positions, it had been decided that the reconstruction of England will take place under military authority.\n\nA series of Reconstruction Commands each covering a distinct region of England shall govern the rebuilding process, deciding on the priorities to be given for specific issues and acting as a temporary judicial and governing branch for the Provisional Government. Needless to say these will be influential positions, and whoever holds them may affect the popularity of the nascent political parties in the upcoming elections."
FEN_expand_the_reconstruction_command_desc:0 "Reconstruction is an arduous process and it falls to the Provisional Government to ensure that it gets off to a good start before whichever party wins the upcoming elections finishes it. To aid in the process, the higher ups have delegated certain military and irregular formations to each of the reconstruction zones to assist in the repair and rebuilding of infrastructure, housing and the problems associated therein.\n\nConsequently, with the Reconstruction Authorities becoming ever more influential in English society so too will the influence they hold on the future elections increase. We must take care to ensure these temporary authorities don't outstay their welcome and make provisions to dismantle them once a civilian government is available."
FEN_HMMLR_is_law_desc:0 "The police, prison and judicial systems were some of the Collaborationist Government's foremost tools to use against groups seeking the return of democracy to England, and even now we face the problem of compensating for the fact that many of their ranking members are awaiting trial for treason in one form or another.\n\nClaude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have thus authorised for the Reconstruction Authorities to take over the duties of acting as police, internment and legal authorities until such time as all relevant systems can be reestablished. Former fighters might not make the best police, but at least we can trust that we share common cause with them."
FEN_register_the_voters_desc:0 "The coming elections will be the most important in the history of England, a return to a true and interfering democracy for the first time in over two decades. But democracy requires voters, and voter suppression was one of the main ways the Royal Party kept their traitorous grip upon power intact.\n\nAuchinleck and Alexander don't always agree on everything, but both agree that the first step to a real and functioning democracy is having as many voters as possible. To give the election a sense of legitimacy the Collaborationist government never could, and to give the ordinary Englishman a chance to show his support for our liberation. Let the light shine upon democracy unshackled, and let the traitors see exactly what it was that they feared put into action once again. The choice of the ordinary man."
FEN_feed_our_hungry_desc:0 "The Collaborationist forces had the regrettable habit of confiscating food supplies from villages and towns where they believed the populace to be against them. Combined with the food shortages from all the burnt fields and destroyed stocks of grain and if we aren't careful there might be a famine on our hands.\n\nLuckily the yanks have been generous enough to send over what aid they can, combined with generous rationing on goods in short supply and it should be enough to tide England over until the next harvest. We can use HMMLR members to hand out the rations, that ought to keep the people in good order at least. Still, some efforts to keep an eye on those in charge of rationing might not hurt."
FEN_what_of_the_young_desc:0 "Orphans are always a problem in war, no matter the conflict men and women will die and their children will be forced to face the world without them. The reprisal policies some of the fascist militias engaged in have produced many orphans, to say nothing of what happened when they shelled urban areas in efforts to root out our fighters.\n\nSadly our own victories were not free of loss either, we must take responsibility for the children of all those slain in this civil war and act to give them a better future. Orphanages and work programs for orphans leaving them will be a vital part of the post war reality in England, it is up to us to ensure they work as intended. We will also encourage adoptions where possible, to give some of them the chance of a normal life."
FEN_assume_the_civilian_administration_desc:0 "The average post office in post-civil war England is located in a wonderful neighborhood and is surrounded by a variety of pleasing aesthetics, it is also on average bombed to smithereens. It turns out that the local post office makes a frighteningly good command post for the local militia. For that matter most of the postmen are also bombed to smithereens, poor bastards were amongst the first to be conscripted.\n\nNow in regards to solving this the Reconstruction Commands have had to create and staff their own post offices, and whilst those manning them are somewhat less friendly and more inclined to prolific facial hair than the traditional postmen they are nonetheless doing their all to return England to a state of normality."
FEN_from_rifles_to_shovels_desc:0 "Whilst HMMLR has made significant use of soldiers to man previously civil affairs until normal governance has been restored, the Reconstruction Commands have only made limited use of soldiers as a rebuilding force. Still there is a first time for everything, and now it falls to the Reconstruction Command's to designate towns, cities and roads which are in need of clearing and repair.\n\nIt might be a crude solution and for certain a proper rebuilding will require years of dedicated reconstruction but as a stop gap measure this will do. Let the men and women who saved English democracy put down the weapons of war for the symbols of peace, let them enjoy their victory by having them build what is to come."
FEN_the_english_phoenix_desc:0 "The scars are still present on the English landscape and the English soul, but thanks to the Reconstruction Commands they are scars rather than open wounds. The process of healing won't be able to fully get onto its feet until the people have elect a new government, but nobody would be lying if they said the Command's did a damn good job with what they had.\n\nFrom the ashes of oppression and war a new England rises. An England without the shackles of totalitarianism, without the vultures of fascism picking at its bones. From here and forever it is a Free England which shall govern this land. Governed by the people, of the people and for the people. Not for the tyrant in Germania, and a curse upon his house. Let him know that the fire of freedom rises."
FEN_For_The_Nation_desc:0 "To say the government of the Collaborators was disliked would be an understatement. The Collaborators, led by the Royal Party, were corrupt, incompetent, and inefficient stewards of the nation. Thieves, thugs, and grifters who were only interested in enriching themselves, abusing the common Englishman, and clinging to their power through any means necessary - right until the very end.\n\nThere is nothing of worth in such a system. It will be burned to the ground.\n\nIf we wish to restore the faith of the people in governance, we must build something new. We will work to create a new system of government, one that is truly representative of the people of England. A government which will be not for the corrupt, the rich, or the special interests - but one which is by, for, and of the people."
FEN_the_oxford_trials_desc:0 "The matter of what to do with the officials and military members of the Collaborationist regime has been a hotly debated subject. The Left Resistance, HMMLR proper, and Stirling's faction all having disagreements on the fates of the accused and indeed on many groups of people as a whole.\n\nA solution as agreed to by Auchinleck, Stirling, and Alexander is to hold a series of public trials for the most notorious Collaborators. So that our people and the world will know that this government is not the same as that which it replaced. That it values justice, and not mere revenge out of hand. They may be guilty to a one, but the traitors will receive a fair trial for their sins."
FEN_their_castle_burns_desc:0 "Ah the traitors, well see before they actually get to trial they're going to have to survive until the trial starts. Many people, Stirling himself included are quite annoyed that we're even having to go through with all this trial nonsense to begin with to be quite frank. Alas but the Boss and that killjoy Bill Alexander are adamant that we can't just haul them off somewhere and make the whole affair five minutes long.\n\nOf course there is some leeway over where they get held. We could go the old fashioned route and use one of the nearby castles to detain the traitors of course but if some of us were feeling ungenerous we could also hold them in an ordinary neighbourhood, close to their victims. Camouflage see, and of course if some were to go missing whilst there well, that would just be a shame."
FEN_increment_security_desc:0 "The reactionary fascists are being held in custody until such time as their crimes can be listed and evidence gathered. Also there needs to be some preparation of the trial grounds themselves in Oxford University, temporarily converted to the local headquarters for HMMLR.\n\nWe can't be seen to use soldiers at what is nominally a civilian trial so it falls to the decision of rehiring some police to act as trial guards, trustworthy ones only of course, or whether we could summon up some of our revolutionary comrades to handle security matters. We'd need to keep them in check of course but who better to ensure that the reactionaries get the justice they deserve?"
FEN_chose_the_prosecutor_desc:0 "Part of this whole civil "justice" stuff according to Stirling is the actual part of separating the business of who's guilty and who only looks like a filthy traitor by association. But Stirling's got word from the Boss that prosecutor is needed, and fast. We could probably find one of those types by looking around HMMLR proper, God knows they're a stuffy bunch.\n\nAlternatively, we might throw a bone to the reds. We couldn't be accused of conspiring anything if we gave the job to one of theirs but it would be an awful shame if that fellow went overboard in the charges. For the traitors that is. Or we could just ensure justice is meted out, one our lads would do the job fine i'm sure."
FEN_and_the_judge_desc:0 "As part of the general liberation of England from fascist oppression there needs to be a set precedence of fair and impartial justice to wipe away the stain of inequality riven into the heart of the reactionary system of courts. Claude Auchinleck trust comrade Alexander to deal with, and find an impartial judge to deal with the matter.\n\nA member of the Left Resistance would be ideal of course, to ensure those who hunted our fellow's like dogs back in the Uprising of 1953 get the justice in sore need of meting out, but that might open up our swiftly forming Socialist Labour Party to criticism. We could also choose a justice affiliated with HMMLR proper but they have always been somewhat squeamish. Or we could abandon even the pretense of subtly and nominate one of Stirling's men. It would get the job done at least."
FEN_enemies_of_the_nation_desc:0 "We didn't capture all the Colaborationist officials unfortunately, some are still in hiding or on the run all across England. If they flee into neighbouring countries or worse, across the Channel we may well never see them again. We cannot rely upon manhunts of ordinary soldiers no, this will require some expert help.\n\nKim Philby, one of our main agents in the Collaborationist government once upon a time and now head of the reconstituted intelligence services aims to capture the traitors by deception. Faking escape routes, using personal connections from agents he helped to defect to entrap the unwary, even outright blackmailing their families into revealing their hiding places. Or we could just send Stirling after them. That might work."
FEN_access_of_the_press_desc:0 "We really ought to consider the level of access given to the press in this whole affair. Too much of a good thing as the saying goes, if we give unrestricted access and ability to record events as they occur it could lead to some bad publicity, yet on the same grounds not allowing this could be interpreted as censorship.\n\nBill Alexander and Stirling advise that the press be limited in what they can record in some fashion, mainly to protect witnesses yet Auchinleck himself favours a more open approach. In the end a decision needs to be made and it falls to the three most powerful men in England to make it."
FEN_the_reformist_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan. The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of His Majesty's Exchequer. And the head of the reformist wing of the Royal Party. Well known for his stance towards softening the collaborationist government and allowing a larger degree of freedom, his convictions apparently were not enough to overcome the fear of German intervention. And now, he awaits punishment for being a wartime minister in Douglas-Home's cabinet.\n\nMacmillan is not like the other prominent defendants of the cabinet, however. Unlike Home, he has never been in a position where he was responsible for the horrible crimes of the government. And unlike Chesterton, he is not a terrible and shameless individual who truly believed in the objective right of what he was doing. Perhaps that will allow him to avoid their fates. Perhaps not. We shall see..."
FEN_the_liberal_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling. By the accounts of those who knew him, he should not have joined the collaborationists at all. One of the most prominent voices against the government while in Parliament, many of similar beliefs joined HMMLR when the war broke out. Yet, he betrayed them all and stayed with the collabs. Now, he is brought before us to defend his decision.\n\nThis is easily the most controversial of the defendants we tried, however. Aside from the aforementioned break with his colleagues and friends, he hasn't done anything particularly interesting after that. Some still want to punish him. Others argue what he did does not warrant him being brought before a court for murderers and traitors at all. Let us hear the evidence before we make a final decision."
FEN_the_traitor_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery. If he had died in the invasion, he would be forever remembered as a hero. If he had refused service with the collaborators, he might still be. If he had joined with HMMLR, he would have had a chance at redemption. And yet...here he is.\n\nThe case is clear cut. He was in charge of the collaborationist army, and everything the army did could be blamed on him. However, he still has conducted actions in his past that were admirable, and there remains a not-insignificant amount of respect for him amongst Claude and his supporters. Might it be worth it to temper justice with mercy?"
FEN_the_rabid_dogs_desc:0 "Templer. Carver. Gibbs. Baker. Their names are numerous, but there is one thing that unites them all. They were commissioned generals in the collaborationist army. And now, we have to judge them for the atrocities committed under their commands.\n\nThey have no future in our army, that much is clear. But how far do we want to punish them? Some are arguing that only blood can answer for blood, but others are arguing that a violent retaliation against these men is not who we are, and that more proportionate punishments should be considered."
FEN_the_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "Alec Douglas-Home. The longest serving Prime Minister in the history of collaborationist England. But while his electoral strength still remains undefeated, his tenure was ended by the free peoples he had tried to submit. Now, we shall bring him before the court to defend himself.\n\nHe is accused of every injustice, every violation, every misery suffered by the English people during this war. Every order, every action, every inaction can be traced to him and him alone. We intend to make him answer for every one of those crimes. And prosecute the leader of the collaborationists to the fullest extent for the crimes committed under his command."
FEN_the_bootlicker_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton. If there was a man more reviled in all of England, hated by both rebels and collaborators alike, we have yet to find him. A fascist demagogue so low he could walk under a dachshund's belly, the head of the collaborationist secret police, and the head of a Blackshirt paramilitary group during the war. Certainly, he has an enormous amount to answer for, though we will try to be fair to him. As fair as one can be when looking at an individual as heinous as Chesterton is."
FEN_the_gavel_strikes_desc:0 "It is done, the Oxford Trials have concluded and now we merely await the sentence. Throughout these trials we have seen the very worst the Collaborationist Government and its military dogs had to offer. We have heard tell of countless crimes and even more horrific goings on in the dark underbelly of the Collaborationist Regime, but the sentence shall apportion guilt only to those deserving.\n\nOur actions beforehand could well have affected the outcome significantly, we can only hope that the international community sees the trials as just or at least fair. If not, we may have made a miscalculation."
FEN_a_new_english_army_desc:0 "When the civil war ended, many of the militias instrumental to our victory disbanded, as its members returned to society to assist in the civilian reconstruction, while a few veteran militias remained in force to keep order.\n\nHowever, as we return to a formal system of governance, we cannot rely on militias forever. Guerrilla warfare and the methods we employed during the war may have served us then, but we are now the leaders of the nation, and for conflicts of the future, such methods are insufficient.\n\nWe must begin creating a new English army, one that incorporates the lessons we learned from the Resistance, as well as modern tactics. It is likely we will require British men and women to take up arms in the future - and we must ensure our military will be prepared for years to come."
FEN_never_another_sealion_desc:0 "While the Germans are in the midst of their own national upheaval, we cannot assume that they will ignore the fall of the Collaborators - and the establishment of a hostile state so close to their own empire. We do not know if they will invade once again, but we must be prepared for if they do.\n\nWe will construct new forts. We will ready our air force. We will leverage our navy. We will reinforce the ports. We will take every conceivable measure through subtle and overt means to signal to the Reich that if they dare invade England again, they will fail. The Germans may try nonetheless - but we will be prepared if they do.\n\nFor if they try, they will only find death on the British Isles."
FEN_a_new_administration_desc:0 "Theories, debates, proposals - there are no shortage of ideas within our government. While the details vary, there are a number of core values and ideas that most of our government agrees on. However, thus far it has been academic, with only debate on what policies would look like, and what effect they might have, in theory.\n\nThe time for words and speculation is over. It is time for action.\n\nThe English people will not be satisfied with mere words and promises. The Royal Party did this, paying only lip service to popular ideas and reforms. We will actually put our promises into tangible legislation, and when that is accomplished, into action. A new era of English politics is upon us - one where our policies will not only be implemented - but enforced."
FEN_the_wounds_are_healing_desc:0 "Slowly, surely, our efforts are bearing fruit.\n\nThe system that we are establishing is beginning to resemble a functioning administration, one capable of successfully governing a nation. While the scars of the civil war have yet to be healed, and will not be fully healed for many more years, our nation is stable, and our countrymen are working together to make it happen.\n\nHowever, there remains much work to be done, even with all of the progress we have made. We are on the path of full recovery, but there remains a short distance to go. The dawn of a new England approaches - and we must see it through to the end."
FEN_prepared_for_the_future_desc:0 "Many of our projects and efforts have succeeded, and the time has come to transition away from the provisional government that has been in place, and move to a true democracy. It is time to fulfil our mission - the restoration of a free England.\n\nOur government is prepared for elections. Candidates have declared and registered, polling stations are being established throughout England, and campaigns are already taking place. Citizens are ready and eager to vote and elect a truly representative government for the first time in years.\n\nIt is time for the people of England to decide the future of our nation."
FEN_a_nation_reborn_desc:0 "When we inherited England after our victory, we inherited a broken, divided, and devastated nation. Many were privately afraid that we would be unable to meet the challenges it brought, and that we would fail to meet our ambitious promises. Today, such doubters were proven wrong.\n\nEngland stands, unrecognizable from what she was before, or just after the civil war. The rot of fascist collaborators has been purged, a government devoid of graft and corruption has been established, and the damage inflicted on the nation has been repaired.\n\nWe have done more than succeed in our ambitious promises - we have laid the groundwork to make England greater than she has ever been. We have given the free men and women of England, reason to hope once more for the future."
FEN_citizenship_reborn_desc:0 "One man one vote, though now that women can vote as well the saying might need to be updated somewhat. One person one vote doesn't quite run off the tongue so well. Either way, the National Democratic League and the Socialist Labour Party now prepare to face off in the first demcoratic election held on English soil in two decades.\n\nAt stake is the future of the monarchy, the economy and the reconstruction process. As well the assorted reforms each party says they will or won't enact. But it shan't be some shady council of military men who decide how this happens, it shall be the people. And the people alone. This is what we fought for, a free and independent England. Let us enjoy it whilst we can."
FEN_corner_stone_democracy_desc:0 "For years, England was the main force behind freedom and democracy throughout the globe. The entire might of our nation ensured the world would always stand against despots and would-be world conquerors. But today, our system is broken, and England is controlled by an emergency military dictatorship. We must restore democracy as soon as possible to make good on our promises to the population, and to show we really are going to create a free and democratic England."
FEN_Guiding_hand_desc:0 "Every revolution has its heroes. Ones who risked their lives and freedom to create a better world. But now the revolution is over. And what role should those heroes take now?\n\nBill Alexander, Claude Auchinleck, and David Stirling have all certainly done their parts in this battle. But the next phase is approaching, and they certainly don't wish to stick around too long and overstay their welcome. They will meet to decide how best to use their status in order to aid the revolution."
FEN_Restoring_Trust_desc:0 "Years of being governed by a supposed democracy that disenfranchised the majority of the population and ruthlessly targeted any dissident has left the population extremely jaded about democracy. The general triumph of dictators over the democratic nations has also left people a bit pessimistic about our government. We'll tell them exactly why that's wrong.\n\nWhat we experienced was merely a Reichskommissariat with a facade thrown over to try and give it an air of legitimacy. Our government will be a true democracy, and will not make the mistakes as the ones in the past."
FEN_from_ash_desc:0 "Rivers clogged with the remains of bridges. Shells of factories being lived in by hundreds of homeless people. Vast fields of burnt wheat, trampled on by men and machines. Block after block of collapsed brick piles where homes once stood. Bombs and unexploded shells being discovered every day. England is a land destroyed, a land broken beyond use. But we shall rebuild it. To make the England one remembers, and to make an England that will lead one into the future."
FEN_To_Roads_desc:0 "England has long known the importance of solid infrastructure. The Romans laid solid, paved roads that we still use today. Our canals made us an industrial power, and our railroads brought much of the world into a more enlightened age. Now, we are mired in poverty, and our roads are destroyed. One may draw a conclusion from this.\n\nEngland's roads will be rebuilt. Broad highways will link our nation together. Trucks and cars will have smooth, well built paths to any area they wish to go. And with the proper framework in place, we can begin our industrial reconstruction."
FEN_Rebuilding_the_System_desc:0 "England's economy does not work. In fact, it hasn't worked for many years. Many of it is merely the result of massive destruction and carnage from the two massive wars on the island. But there are a few things that just don't work, and we'll be prepared to replace all of it. Taxes, regulations, jobs, industries, everything will be rebuilt. And if we know that it won't work, we'll reform it and put in something that will. England will be prosperous again, and we're going to do anything to make that happen."
FEN_To_The_People_desc:0 "One must not forget why we're doing all this. Not for some narcissistic desire to have our nation achieve some arbitrary definition of "greatness". Not for the sole wish to have the collabs and traitors suffer. We are doing this for the people of England. They do not deserve what was inflicted upon them by the Germans and their Quisling lackeys. They deserve to have the say in how things are done, and they deserve to have a decent and happy life. We will remember this, and make it clear where our priorities lie."
FEN_Bread_and_What_desc:0 "At long last, the hunger plaguing the nation is beginning to subside. Our efforts have been successful, and we soon won't have a problem like that anymore. So what do we put our efforts into with the leftover cash?\n\nWelfare is a good option, since many still have other issues aside from hunger. A strong democratic system would require some extra cash as well. Or we could just spend it on the army and ensure another humiliation like this will not happen again."
FEN_To_The_Army_desc:0 "Our military accomplished what it set out to do. It defeated the collaborators and set in place a new system of government that will help the people of England. But in its new role? It is not as adept as it should be. It must be reformed, and we will begin to make the necessary decisions to shape the military in the way we want."
FEN_where_to_send_the_rest_desc:0 "The army has thousands of extra soldiers. Regulars, local militias, and reservist groups. Some say this is too much. They say they could be doing much more useful work in other places. Things like rebuilding our nation, repairing factories, repaving roads, that sort of thing. This is an interesting proposal, and we have to consider the possibility that our forces could be more effectively utilized in other ways."

ENG_an_unfortunate_reality_desc:0 "Since we are now a part of the OFN, we can no longer entice German investment and support. We must embrace them, we have simply become too dependent on the US. The Germans are not willing to come anywhere near us.\n\nEven Thatcher has allowed her hopes to subside. Britain can no longer be a Superpower, we will have to accept that we now exist in the shadow of the USA. At least we are free of the Germans."
ENG_the_road_to_washington_desc:0 "America's dominance over the United Kingdom has now been accepted, Thatcher has decided to send Pym on a diplomatic mission to Washington to talk to the Americans about our new relationship. Our embassy there will need to be expanded as relations with the Americans become more intimate. It has become obvious that Britain is no longer entirely in control of its relations with the United States."
ENG_share_our_technology_desc:0 "Technology is to become an important base for our new relationship with the United States. Regrettably we will have to send some of our technical developments to them in return, since we are no longer in the position we once were. However, the additional improvements to our Industry and Jets will be welcome. Perhaps American dominance will not be all that bad."
ENG_an_ofn-sided_trade_deal_desc:0 "With the Germans out of the picture the US knows we no longer have any leverage over them. Losing the protections that we had in the past will be very damaging to our government's reputation, but we will have to swallow our pride as the country desperately needs a trade deal with the Americans. We no longer have a say in such matters. Sadly, we are going to give up several concessions to preserve our economy."
ENG_bases_on_britain_desc:0 "We will allow the Americans to set up military bases on British soil, their army will now help protect our shores from German forces.\n\nThis is exactly what the Germans have always feared would happen, they will be put right on edge once this news reaches their leadership. They will likely see the Americans as a grave threat and will want to retaliate in a way they can.\n\nAt least the Americans are here to protect us now."
ENG_americas_airstrip_desc:0 "The United States is keen to position its air force on our island, the proximity of our bases to Germany will be very advantageous to the American military. They will have the access they require, we will serve them; becoming their unsinkable aircraft carrier.\n\nThere is nothing for us to gain from this besides US protection. We can only wish that they will see us as an intimate ally; rather than nothing more than an airstrip."
ENG_a_diplomatic_1943_desc:0 "Worryingly little seems to have changed since the civil war. England is back under the German sphere of influence and our government is likely to be diminished to little more than the puppet that it was before the war. Bormann is also unlikely to be too forgiving of our recent actions, it is as if we have been invaded by the Germans once again.\n\nThatcher has failed the United Kingdom and life under Bormann is only going to make this failure sting more as time goes by."
ENG_a_line_on_the_north_sea_desc:0 "A new maritime border with Germany will have to be drawn. Concessions will have to be made to the Germans and they will not be concerned with how their might affect us. There is no doubt that we will lose most of our access to the North Sea; along with most of its resources and wealth. We have to hope that everything we surrender to the Germans will satisfy them in the future."
ENG_surrender_the_oil_desc:0 "Sadly the oil under the North Sea will have to be part of our concession to the Germans. We have little choice but to give the Germans almost exclusive drilling access within the region. We will lose almost all of our oil fields and our economy will suffer as a result.\n\nThis choice is taken because it is a necessity, if we did not give the oil to them they would just take it, this way it is on our terms."
ENG_north_sea_naval_exercises_desc:0 "The Germans have become increasingly enthusiastic for the Royal Navy and the Kriegsmarine to take part in a joint exercise in the North Sea. The war games will take place shortly, it will likely be odd for our sailors to train alongside the Germans they have prepared to fight against not too long ago. But this will just have to be a part of their encroaching influence into our military."
ENG_give_them_access_to_scapa_flow_desc:0 "Scapa Flow is believed to be one of the greatest naval bases on earth, it has been a source of great pride for the Royal Navy ever since it became a base for the British Grand Fleet. But our navy has long since been sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe port will now have to be relinquished to the Germans, they will get more use of it than we would have; they still have a powerful navy after all.\n\nYet another concession has to be made to the Germans, each one is sad, but necessary."
ENG_a_dream_forever_crushed_desc:0 "There was a time, not too long ago, when we thought it would be possible for England to rid the British Isles of German influence. Alas this was not meant to be, the Hun have returned to reassert their control over us. England is back where it started, under the German thumb. Britain will never become a superpower, let alone great, under Thatcher. Our government will not even be sovereign, we have lost everything and are set to gain pitifully little.\n\nIt seems as if England is doomed to live under the Germans for many more painful years."
ENG_bedfellows_with_the_devil_desc:0 "England is back under the control of the Germans, we have allowed them to have far too much influence. The United States no longer wishes to deal with us, our only option that we have left is to join them. This situation has become far from ideal, but at least with Germany under Speer, Britain may yet retain a degree of its own sovereignty.\n\nHowever England will now only become a shadow of what it could have been."
ENG_relax_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Numerous barriers to trade between Great Britain and Germany still exist; the German have requested that they be cut down as quickly as possible. Many tariffs and embargoes are to be lifted, without them conducting business between our two nations will become much easier. The immediate effects of this may benefit them more than it helps us, but it could very well assist our economy in the long run."
ENG_reject_the_ultimate_humiliation_desc:0 "Lately the Germans have set up a Pan European economic project known as the 'Zollverein'. This is nothing short of economic imperialism, created by the Germans as a tool to exploit the resources of the other members of the project.\n\nGreat Britain has absolutely no intentions of joining such a thing. Thatcher has already been distrustful of the continentals and despite her weakened position will never allow the Germans to ravage her country. There is no doubt that we will reject joining this, showing that we clearly still hold on to a shred of our former dignity."
ENG_the_germans_in_london_desc:0 "A new ambassador is to be sent to London from Germania, he will likely be stationed in a place where he can keep an eye on our government. Thatcher is to meet with the ambassador, even if she is reluctant to do so. The Prime Minister is also expected to congratulate him on the beginning of a new era of Anglo-German relations.\n\nIt is not going to be an era that will see the rise of Britain, the time and for that has been and gone; we will have to work if what we have from here on out."
ENG_german_technicians_desc:0 "Germany is to send over a group of technicians to help modernise our ineffectual industry, which still suffers from the damage of the Civil War. They will be welcomed, because even though they may be Germans, we can still use their expertise. Our factories need the support and we will appreciate their help in getting our economy back on its feet."
ENG_partners_with_the_hun_desc:0 "We are not subservient to the Germans. At least not as much as the rest of Europe, we are considered to be closer to partners than puppets. They may be many times more powerful than we are, but some still like to think that we continue to hold our own against the Europeans.\n\nHowever our economy is still dependent on their support. It is highly unlikely that we will ever be completely free of German influence."
ENG_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "The simple fact that Wales is separate from the rest of England undermines our government in the eyes of the rest of the world. The government established there is illegitimate and thus has no reason to exist; therefore it must be brought back under the control of Westminster. We will deal with them swiftly and resolutely. They will not block us from reclaiming our right to greatness"
ENG_mobilize_the_reserves_desc:0 "Even though Wales is a small minor power, with a small minor military protecting it, we will still need more manpower in order to overwhelm them. Mobilizing our reserves will let us have enough troops to defeat the Welsh scourge. It may be an overly extreme move, but we can not let them have a chance at defeating us, or we will be humiliated for the rest of history."
ENG_a_show_of_force_desc:0 "Before we cross the border into Wales to reassume control over their territory, we will demonstrate our military might to their faces. Every Welsh Border Guard will hear the echoes of our artillery that will shortly be turned on them. Having flexed our armies muscles there will be no doubt in their minds of what will come next. We will attack rapidly and they will be too scared to even lift a finger to defend themselves."
ENG_increase_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "As we are starting to become more connected internationally we will need to expand the size of our Foreign Ministry. More diplomats are required to negotiate overseas on the government's behalf, this will lay sufficient groundwork for future diplomatic actions. After Wales has been dealt with, we will be able to make sure our international presence is felt."
ENG_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "Though we stand prepared to crush the Welsh militarily, military action is costly, and will likely result in damage to valuable infrastructure that will soon be part of British land once again. Therefore, we shall prepare our foreign ministry for negotiating with Wales, to give them an opportunity to return to the fold peacefully rather than by force."
ENG_solve_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "We have already made all the necessary preparations for an invasion of Wales, our army stands ready at the border and ready for battle. Now it is the time to negotiate with the Welsh where we will mercifully offer them a peaceful solution to their treachery.\n\nIf they dare to refuse us then they will get what they deserve."
ENG_the_south_united_desc:0 "The first confrontation in the reunification of our isle has been won, as Wales has been conquered. The English people have become reinvigorated by the government's success and are ardently waiting for our next triumph. There is much work left to be done but Thatcher will doubtlessly make sure that it is done.\n\nLong live England, soon to be the United Kingdom."
ENG_the_fortress_up_north_desc:0 "There is one last obstacle in the way of restoring the United Kingdom, it is our ancient rival, Scotland. If our dealings with Wales is anything to go by, they should fall under our authority soon.\n\nHowever they will prove to be quite an indomitable foe. They have spent years apprehensively preparing to defend their republic. The border is heavily fortified, if no peaceful settlement is found, the resulting war will be the bloodiest in the history of the British Isles."
ENG_contact_pro-unionist_officers_desc:0 "In spite of the Scottish government's vigorous efforts to defend their nation, they have overlooked the swathes of pro-unionist soldiers that existed amidst their army's ranks. Once they have been contacted by MI6, they will be very useful in bringing down the Republic from within. And if the Scottish government refuses to reunify diplomatically, they will explode every fort, every road and every government office that they can. We will make it clear that Scottish security is nothing more than an illusion, their territory will be reintegrated, by any means necessary."
ENG_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "If we are forced into a war we will have to stamp out every Scottish nationalist throughout the land. That will include the rugged, and easily defensible, mountains of the North.\n\nAt the moment, our army is not prepared to fight in such terrain. They will have to be trained to fight amongst the mountains if we are to have a hope of removing the Scottish army entirely."
ENG_we_are_willing_to_negotiate_desc:0 "We do not wish to fight with the people of Scotland. They are almost as ready as we are for war. The battle along the border would be bloody, the havoc inside the cities would be terrifying and the scars that would be left behind would take several lifetimes to fade.\n\nBut, rest assured, they know that we are more than willing to make such sacrifices to restore our once United Kingdom."
ENG_the_welsh_example_desc:0 "Wales has already been retaken and brought back to its proper place within our kingdom and we have gained a great deal of experience from dealing with them. We are ready to use these experiences to better tackle the Scots. Our army is more than willing to occupy them. There will be no time wasted in reuniting with Scotland under the crown."
ENG_bridge_the_gap_desc:0 "Reunification with Scotland is imperative if we are to regain our national prestige, the sooner we start work on their unification, the better. They may be hostile toward us to begin with, but they will quickly learn that we are not going to submit to their demands. The Scots will not remain independent much longer. Scotland has to be reintegrated, no matter the cost."
ENG_the_second_act_of_union_desc:0 "Having dealt with the old government of the Scottish Republic and the Welsh brakeaway, we can begin drafting our proclamation of the reunification of the United Kingdom. Our isle is no longer divided. We are once more united under one King and Margaret Thatcher's dream of England once again being relevant on the world stage is closer than ever to being fulfiled, now that she rules Britannia."
ENG_a_necessity_desc:0 "Ever since Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of England, she has had one fundamental goal, the restoration of what she believes is England's rightful place on the world stage. In order to take up this mantle, she believes that Great Britain must first be reunited; this will only be possible with Pakt or OFN assistance. However, before Thatcher can begin to take a more active role in foreign policy she will have to meet with Francis Pym.\n\nDespite being fiercely loyal to her prime ministership, Pym is unlikely to appreciate what he believes is Thatcher's increasingly excessive control of his area of policy."
ENG_faction_mechanic_GER_is_not_goering_or_heydrich:0 "§YWe are dealing with a Germany that is willing to negotiate.§!"
ENG_faction_mechanic_goering_or_heydrich:0 "§YUnder threat from an aggressive Germany we should prepare against them instead of negotiating.§!"
ENG_our_biggest_threat_desc:0 "Following on from her previous talks with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thatcher has planned to persuade Pym that the presence of the Cornwall Garrison on English soil is unacceptable.\n\nThe mere existence of the garrison is indeed a grave and constant threat to the future sovereignty of England. If Thatcher is to restore England's independence, she will have to rid herself of the Germans who occupy the isle."
ENG_approaching_the_hun_desc:0 "With Pym sufficiently convinced of the merits of Thatcher's plan, the time has come for him and the Prime Minister to visit Germania together. After their arrival in the German capital, they will have to come to many agreements with the Germans, from trade to future military relations.\n\nA peaceful resolution has already been made with Germany over Cornwall, although tensions still hang over the two countries. These negotiations will not be easy, but they will be essential in placating the Germans."
ENG_visiting_an_old_friend_desc:0 "After the Second World War broke out the United States abandoned England, and doomed us to our German dominated fate. Since then we have constantly avoided reaching out to the Americans, we did not feel like we could truly trust them.\n\nYet the Anglo-American relationship has not always been this cold, after all, we did fight side by side during World War One. By ushering in a new age of Anglo-American friendship and mutual assistance, we will be able to stand taller than ever on the world stage."
ENG_a_place_in_germania_desc:0 "Soon England will be able to send an envoy into Germania to establish a stronger relationship with Germany. This will bring the United Kingdom closer to Germany and solidify its place as their equal, and not as their puppet.\n\nHowever, the choice of ambassador remains to be made. Thatcher will want to push for a more hardline candidate who will not bend to German pressure, but Pym will likely prefer to appoint the ambassador himself. The strain between the two is bound to become much more noticeable."
ENG_what_our_future_shall_hold_desc:0 "Relations with the Germans are still somewhat hostile. We will have to tread carefully if we are to avoid wrecking the progress our two countries have already made. A treaty will have to be signed to help normalize our new relationship. Assuring non-aggression will also be a significant step towards greater cooperation.\n\nHowever much we may distrust them we must remember that they need us as much as we need them."
ENG_we_are_not_afraid_desc:0 "Many years have passed since we were humbled by Germany and forced to suffer underneath them for decades. Thankfully this humiliating part of our past has been left behind, we no longer live in fear of the Cornwall Garrison and stand eye to eye with the Germans.\n\nAt long last England stands independent, and no matter what, it will not be easy for Germany to take that away from us again."
ENG_a_black_or_blue_telephone_desc:0 "Direct communication is a key part of securing long term close relations between states in our increasingly modern age. However, the question remains over which country we should establish this meaningful connection with.\n\nSetting up a telephone line with the US administration would allow our country to cooperate much more closely with the OFN. Helping to cement our trust with those who are part of the Free World.\n\nOn the other hand, reestablishing a direct means of talking with the German leadership would help us to reconcile with them.\n\nWhichever side we choose will have much more influence§! over us"
ENG_german_technical_support_desc:0 "If we were to receive German technical support our industry would be strengthened a great deal. Taking advantage of their support would offer significant improvements to the effectiveness of English industrial production. This move may bring us closer to the Germans, but our country would benefit hugely, regardless of the dangers."
ENG_german_technology_desc:0 "There are many within our government who may still distrust the Germans, but that does not detract from the fact that their technology is some of the best in the world. Their superior tanks and advanced planes are thought to be the main reasons why they triumphed in the Second World War. Although this may just be trumped up German propaganda, our military sorely needs the technological support that Germany is willing to offer."
ENG_american_technical_support_desc:0 "One of the main advantages of using American support is the fact that it is not German. As we still have issues with the Germans it would be better for us to request the support of the US instead. We will nevertheless become more reliant on the Americans, which will set a dangerous president if we wish to continue to remain entirely independent. However we will have to make a choice and many would rather avoid the devil we already know, all too well."
ENG_american_technology_desc:0 "There is no air force on the planet that can be compared to the Americans'; the United States has the most futuristic fighter jets and helicopters at its disposal. Their modern style of warfare is also very intriguing, even though it is not known if it is totally reliable. If we were to have some of these aircraft in our own air force, the German military would be as fearsome as it currently seems"
ENG_overlooking_washington_desc:0 "Having sown the seeds of our new relationship with the Americans, the time has come for an English ambassador to be sent to Washington. This will mark the first time the US and England have worked together in decades; it may only be an ambassador but it signifies that times are indeed changing. Once the bond with America has been rekindled, England will not be as alone in the world as it has been."
ENG_a_new_special_relationship_desc:0 "Over the course of history, the US and the UK have always been close; sharing a common language and a similar cultural identity. The Prime Minister now seeks to use these similarities to create a new partnership with America, one that suitably reflects the intimacy of our pasts. However Thatcher is unlikely to permit any deal to be too in favor of the US, she would much prefer England to remain in control of its own destiny."
ENG_the_germanian_problem_desc:0 "England may have released herself from Germany's clutches, but we are not completely free. Germany's military power is still immense and if the German leadership were to order another invasion, there would be little we could do to stop them.\n\nHowever, if we had an ally that was willing and able to protect us, the people of England would sleep much more soundly. We will need to turn to the United States and guarantee their military support, for the sake of the safety of England."
ENG_german_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of the Germans if this is to change. Because of the Germans success during the war, their military advisors have been proven to be highly skilled. Employing them within our army will bring us up to date and make reuniting our isle by force a lot more plausible."
ENG_no_military_advisors_desc:0 "Even though our military is known to be undertrained, over reliance on either the Americans or the Germans is something that is critical for us to avoid. It would only diminish England to nothing more than pawn to be used by either superpower. Refusing advisors from both sides will weaken our own military but it will help us to run a self sufficient army, free from foreign interference.\n\nWe can not allow any other country to know how we intend to wage war; our army, like the rest of our country, will remain independent."
ENG_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of American military advisors if this is to change. They will equip our forces with the skills necessary to defend our shores against any German threat. This would bring us much closer to the United States, though be that as it may we need help and we will be damned if we turn to the Germans."
ENG_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that Wales is back under our control our military and our government appear a lot stronger than they did before. We can now turn our attention on to more relevant parts of the world. Thatcher is one step closer to reuniting the Isle.\n\nEngland is now ready to begin retaking its proper position on the international scene."
ENG_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "The current position of the United Kingdom is still a precarious one, however it could also be highly profitable. Thatcher believes that it is possible for the UK to leverage its power between Germany and the United States, to get them to sign deals favorable to England. Pym will need to be won over before we can start the delicate tasks that will enable us to use our current position to its greatest extent."
ENG_preparing_for_the_enemy_desc:0 "Thatcher is keen for the army to show its strength in a wargame, warding off any prospective invaders. The question remains, who should be the focus of our display, both sides could be threats in the future. Either way the choice that is made will need to be calculated, neither the Americans nor the Germans have our interests at heart.\n\nWe will have to remind both of them of our independence; along with our willingness to defend it."
ENG_discuss_the_enemy_desc:0 "Now that we have chosen who the main threat to the United Kingdom is, we can start to draw up plans over what strategies they are likely to use if they were to invade us. From there we will figure out how we should counteract their attacks. There can be no chance of the enemy ever taking control of our country. We will never be subjugated again."
ENG_grab_some_blueprints_desc:0 "Though we may be working with them now, there is no guarantee to how long this relationship may continue, yet there is still plenty that we would like to get out of our temporary ally. They have several blueprints that we would like to borrow and since they will not be willing to hand them over for free, we will have to steal them. Fortunately for us, MI6 is quite adept at capturing such material, they will work with Thatcher to secure the designs that will considerably improve our technology."
ENG_study_the_results_desc:0 "The Royal Army has exerted itself tremendously and provided us with some valuable data on how our opponent is likely to handle itself in battle. We will need to assess this data and use it to our advantage, should we ever have to face them in an actual war. Though there is still hope that the UK will never have to wage war again, we have become more ready than ever to defend our United Kingdom."
ENG_the_dover_conference_desc:0 "Foreign investment is what is going to enrich the people of England, and with two superpowers striving to trump the other, we will become very rich indeed. And to maximise our profits, Thatcher has already come up with a plan to auction off a contract that would grant extra access to the workers of the UK. She will have to continue to guide Pym to make it certain that the country continues to play the two sides off against each other.\n\nOur international course has been chartered, now is the time for us on our journey toward economic rejuvenation."
ENG_the_promise_of_free_enterprise_desc:0 "If we are to attract more investment into the UK, we will have to assure foreign companies that whichever super power they will be able to invest freely in our markets, without the government interfering. Even though this would help we still want to maintain control of our economy; however Thatcher believes there is a way we can get the best of both worlds. She will allude to free enterprise, but never fully commit to it, using the power of plausible deniability we will raise more and more investment."
ENG_hint_at_the_scottish_oil_desc:0 "As a result of our reunification with Scotland, many sizable oil fields in the North Sea have come under our control. This has certainly caught the attention of foreign firms who are eager to exploit our resources.\n\nThatcher has planned to make a "slipup" in her next speech where she will mention the possibility of investors gaining access to UK oil; raising the stakes and our economy higher and higher."
ENG_cash_out_desc:0 "In the wake of the civil war, England was in ruin. Thatcher has since helped the country rebuild, expand and reunify the United Kingdom. But despite all this, the English people have remained poor.\n\nThe auction of 'the contract' has left a lot of money in the hands of the government. We will end this conference prematurely, and watch as the superpowers realize the severity of their mistake, when they tried to influence our British Isles."
ENG_cash_out_end_conference:0 "§YWe will end the Dover Conference§!"
ENG_upsell_a_trade_deal_desc:0 "It is such a great shame that we will only be able to trade with either America or Germany. Which is a sad reality as we could have profited greatly from trading with two superpowers.\n\nRather than making the decision of who we shall open our markets to ourselves, we will make them bid for it. We trust that this trade deal will be highly sought after and that as a result, we will make a great deal of money from selling it."
ENG_the_value_of_the_english_market_desc:0 "England has large reserves of steel and coal, as well as very good potential to have a large amount of industrial output. As bidding has begun for the trade deal, we should remind both sides of these immense benefits; as well as how it would be an awful shame if the other side were to get access to it and they were to lose out. They will raise their bids and we will only profit more."
ENG_raise_the_stakes_desc:0 "Thus far the bids at the conference have been decent; but they could be higher.\n\nWe already know that both sides are desperate to prevent fiercely trying to curb the power of the other. By "hinting" at the possibility of access to British ports being a part of the trade deal, both sides will take the auction a lot more seriously. They will not want to allow the other such a strategic base in such a crucial region.\n\nThey will need to win this now."
ENG_our_proficiency_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but the United Kingdom is back on the world stage, and what an entrance we have made. After all, we have just managed to tactfully outmanoeuvre the global superpowers with ease.\n\nPrestige has returned to England and everyone in the country is better for it, from the elites to the workers. Thatcher has succeeded in solidifying our independence and warding of all foreign influences. Our position is once again safe and secure."
ENG_reveal_our_motive_desc:0 "The reunification of the United Kingdom and our outwitting of Germany and the United States has left us in good stead internationally. Thatcher believes that we should go one step further and declare Britain to be the 5th Superpower.\n\nBoth the Germans and Americans will not be best pleased with this announcement, but it is necessary if Britain is to return to its righteous place and stand shoulder to shoulder, eye to eye with the rest of the world."
ENG_a_great_britain_desc:0 "In spite of all obstacles, Thatcher has done it; Great Britain is resurgent.\n\nThough many doubted we would ever recover from our greatest defeat and subsequent German subjugation, we have. Wales and Scotland have been reunified with England and the German presence in Cornwall has been dislodged. We can now stand free of their influence.\n\nA new era has begun for our country, we are now ready to compete with the rest of the world again. Let us hope that our power continues to rise; so that the world can once again realise the power of Great Britain."

ENG_united_england_wins_desc:0 "It would seem the Royal Party have fallen far from their glory days indeed, for despite every foul attempt at deceit thrown our way it is not Margaret Thatcher who won the elections. For two decades a Royal Party member was PM, but those days are over, for it was United England who won the elections!\n\nUnder the leadership of the new Prime Minister Reginald Maudling, a noted liberal and Party Chairman Harold Macmillan United England shall bring the nation the reforms it requires to survive in an ever changing world. The gross corruption and nepotism of the Royal Party will not be tolerated, we will reform England root and stem into a nation our children will be proud to call home."
ENG_but_inside_its_as_divided_as_ever_desc:0 "United England is unfortunately not a single party, but rather it is an amalgamation of two distinct groups who were both dissatisfied with the status quo under the Royal Party. First are the Liberals who nominally lead United England, the furthest left allowed under Royal Party rule the Liberals desire a return to the glory days of English democracy when every man had his vote and he didn't have only one option to vote for.\n\nBy contrast, the current majority of the party aren't loyal to the Liberal ideal so much as they are to the person of Party Chairman Harold Macmillan. Above all else, Macmillan desires the utter obliteration of fascism in England, but whether he can continue to work with the Liberals to do so is still the question."
ENG_meet_the_chairman_desc:0 "Some of the more stupid call Harold Macmillan a coward for being one of the architects of the English surrender. Those men are fools, the Party Chairman acted as he did not because he wished for the current situation to arise but because the alternative was seeing England bombed into oblivion and its youth slaughtered in pointless battles for petty politics.\n\nHarold Macmillan will do anything to see that never comes to pass again, but whilst he has influence over United England he also wouldn't mind some revenge against those who used the capitulation of England to their own advantage to acquire wealth and power. The former Royal Party may have been his allies, but they were never his friends. Perhaps things can be different with Maudling."
ENG_meet_the_PM_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has long been a firebrand Liberal in English politics. Protected as he was by the influence of the reformist faction of the Royal Party, Maudling was one of the more vocal government critics and his image stuck in the minds of the people for this. Perhaps then it was no surprise that nobody else could lead a party seeking to restore England's glory days. Macmillan might have the majority of the party on his side but he does need Maudling for the moment.\n\nStill, should Maudling secure his position as Prime Minister he would institute the reforms promised and more. For when you look across England, there is nobody else who has the ability whilst also being acceptable to the current establishment."
ENG_parliament_opens_desc:0 "Elections are always times of great reflection for the political classes. Knowing that your constituents saw fit to elect you despite whatever dirt your opponent threw your way is certainly a great morale booster for the newly elected and old guard alike.\n\nThis opening of Parliament however looks to be more interesting than most, as the two most important men in United England talk of their visions for the nation's future. Harold Macmillan the Party Chairman looks set to aggrandise his vision of an England secure from the threat of fascism and corruption, whilst PM Reginald Maudling seems likely to address the matters of the flaws in the current democratic system and his solutions. Whom the party shall pay more attention to, however, is not certain."
ENG_inside_westminister_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan and Reginald Maudling are critical members of the leadership of the United England Party, but their increasingly divergent political views are causing... issues. Macmillan's position that government guidance remains paramount for defending democracy and Maudling's Shakespearean insistence that liberty not be sacrificed in the name of stability are increasingly pulling the party into two different camps. Westminster is not large enough for the egos of these two men to coexist; the party will have to choose one or the other."
ENG_to_protect_england_desc:0 "In times of crisis it is not the idealists we look to for comfort. Men are not comforted by pretty words, nor are they comforted by ideals. It is action and experience which keeps the people calm and focused upon their own lives, the knowledge that they will not have to do anything, for the experts will take care of the problem. That is what Harold Macmillan offers England.\n\nWhen the liberal elements of our party buckle, Harold Macmillan will stand fast. Should the skies darken with approaching aircraft the people will be able to retreat to prebuilt shelters rather than their basements. Should the wolves at our door come knocking they will not find weakness in England, for Macmillan will sacrifice anything and everything for the protection of our people. Nothing else is acceptable."
ENG_here_we_go_again_desc:0 "More than thirty years of political experience have made Harold Macmillan into a master of the parliamentary battlegrounds. Working from behind the scenes, the man in the background ensured that the Royal Party didn't grow too abusive in their pursuit of power whilst keeping the Germans minds as far from England as possible.\n\nNow Macmillan is in much the same situation, the vital pillar on which PM Maudling's support rests, ensuring that United England works in a smooth and efficient manner in regards to government whilst keeping the National Front and relict Royal Party disorganised. Helped by the fact that much of United England is loyal to him personally, Macmillan will keep our nation on a steady course."
ENG_look_over_the_floor_desc:0 "The English "opposition" is the single biggest collection of liars, frauds, and criminals that have ever had the dishonour to sit in parliament. In the Royal Party are the corrupt, the arrogant sellouts who if they had their way would have us still answering to Germany in full. Far from their once lofty heights, the Royal Party is a disgraceful institution that ought be put to rest.\n\nThen we have the National Front. Mere words cannot describe the hatred United England has for those disgusting, wretched, feculent pieces of refuse. Worse than wanting out subordination to the Reich, worse even than the thousands they betrayed to Germany is their true allegiance. Fascism. If we have to fight for a thousand years to ensure the National Front never gain power, it will be a thousand well spent."
ENG_the_corrupt_and_the_fash_have_to_go_desc:0 "United England is now England's only hope for salvation from the forces of fascism and corruption. If either of our opposition parties were ever to gain power it would be a disaster without comparison, so venal and debased are their flaws. Luckily, the Party Chairman has a plan he will outline to Prime Minister Maudling.\n\nThe corruption and disloyalty of our opposition comes with certain advantages, namely that were United England to answer public calls for the investigation of corruption within parliament we would catch a far greater number of MPs with loyalties to the National Front and Royal Party than we would our own supporters. We can even investigate and search for evidence ourselves, for who knows the secrets of our former friends better than Macmillan?"
ENG_the_anti_corruption_act_desc:0 "Corruption is a disease that affects politicians like lice. A little isn't really an issue worth dealing with, a moderate amount might require some care to stamp out. When faced with an infestation, only fumigation will solve our problem.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Act is a bill drafted by Mr. Macmillan and other concerned MPs of United England to outline some clear expectations on what the newly reformed England expects of its political classes, with some severe penalties for gross levels of corruption and a dedicated watchdog organisation to to catch the more unwise MPs in the act. Oh, the Royal Party and the National Front will howl and complain no doubt, but it is us, not them who are in power now. The public will love us even more for this."
ENG_the_back_bench_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England have always been the second in charge for a reason, namely that the those loyal to Macmillan outnumber them by a not insignificant amount. Yet, their ideals of a truly restored democracy and extensive social reform aren't inherently terrible, and their support is useful. It's why we don't treat them like we do the fascists, after all.\n\nLed by the current Prime Minister Mr. Maudling, they might not be equal partners in our current alliance of United England, but they are partners nonetheless, and we ought to be careful that we don't alienate them unnecessarily. They are members of Parliament after all, and even one or two sunken bills could be a detriment to the vision of the Party Chairman. So we shall let them be."
ENG_talk_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling's heart is in the right place - the restoration of democracy, of English liberties, and of responsible, responsive government - but he misses the forest for the trees. With the dogs baying across the Channel and... disorderly elements still a threat at home, we have to make sure that England is safe for democracy before all else. We need to convince Maudling to see things our way."
ENG_promise_them_acts_and_them_over_desc:0 "You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. How that old saying relates to our current situation is that we really do need to make some surface level appeals to the more Liberal members of United England to keep them on the same train of thought. We will throw them a few bones to keep them happy, as it were.\n\nThe easiest way to keep them happy would be to introduce some more "liberal" acts into our legislative agenda, all the usually hot air about the inherent rights of the people and free expression and whatnot. Perhaps even some pardons for a few political prisoners thrown in with it. We should probably take care to ensure we don't release any fascists, though."
ENG_the_better_education_act_desc:0 "One thing both the Macmillanist and Liberal factions of United England most assuredly agree on is that the state of our education system is simply abysmal. The Royal Party truly was the party of the elite, having neglected the common people so thoroughly that they even defunded countless public schools. Truly, the fact that this is even an issue highlights the pitiful nature of our current situation.\n\nThe Better Education Act is a bill which will attempt to reform the education system into something responsible to the wants and needs of students, rather than fruitlessly clinging to outdated, ineffective methods. With this, we can guarantee the best for our future scholars and learners. We will also be able to shore up our rural support by directing funding to them in particular."
ENG_a_dinner_with_monty_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery is one of the few men still alive who knows exactly why it was that the United Kingdom agreed to its own dismantlement. He was with Macmillan when the treaty was negotiated, and amongst the most fervent voices for maintaining the peace at all costs. His subsequent victory over the insurgent HMMLR has only made him more useful to the future of England, and perhaps it's time he be brought more directly on board with that future.\n\nA meeting is required, and a reasonably private one at that. We can reach out to one of his stepsons to arrange it and broach the possible subjects. Namely the prevention of any future Operation Sealion. Montgomery will likely be interested, he's quite the reasonable man after all. We just need to give him the right incentive."
ENG_hunting_with_templar_desc:0 "Gerad Templer has long served England loyally, and his crucial role in preventing the foul organisation HMMLR from winning the Civil War has only increased the regard for him in the political classes. However, Templer never really got along all that well with us civilian officials, in no small part due to our position on the matter of throwing away German restrictions on the military apparatus.\n\nWith United England's new defensive foreign policy focus however, it might be possible to bring Mr Templer on board with our agenda. We can speak of it whilst on a fox hunt, which the man is known to love, especially on the subject of our current military strength and how that might be improved. Even in the worst case scenarios though, what harm could a little chat do?"
ENG_a_calm_day_in_parliament_desc:0 "The situation is actually rather decent at the moment. Yes, the foreign policy matter is a bit tense, and the Royal Party is simmering, yet within the party things are about as harmonious as they've ever been. The Party Chairman and the Prime Minister have even managed to get out the legislative agenda ahead of time, to the surprise of all who know the two men. Mayhaps they've sorted out their differences?\n\nWell, regardless of what is happening, it is quite refreshing to know that political differences aside, United England is beginning to coalesce into a party worth the label. Perhaps this new unity can be showcased in the speech PM Maudling is said to be preparing. It will certainly be an interesting listen."
ENG_the_aftermath_of_the_debate_desc:0 "Apparently you can never hammer the message home hard enough when it comes to the Liberal faction of United England. We protected them from Royal Party persecution, we aided them when they needed it, we even gave them the post of Prime Minister. Well, they evidently believe they deserve more. Oh, they'll get exactly what they deserve.\n\nMacmillan is distinctly unamused to hear some of these tales. More accurately, he has been put in a state of apoplectic rage over some of these tales, but that is hardly unexpected given the magnitude of this betrayal. Evidently, it is not the job of the Liberals to save England from Germany. Evidently, it is not their business to be in politics at all. When you want to do something right, you damn well do it yourself."
ENG_maudling_will_attack_us_for_the_last_time_desc:0 "The Liberals are still a part of United England nominally, but the recent events have left some easily distinguishable marks between those loyal to our Party Chairman and those loyal to the Prime Minister. Macmillan is still quite incensed at the betrayal of Maudling, but it must be admitted this was hardly unforeseen. A shame, he might have been quite useful if he hadn't acted so rashly.\n\nLet's go on the offensive, then. We've identified a number of troublemakers we can easily expel from the party, or at the very least impress upon them the seriousness of remaining loyal to the PM over the nation. Membership rolls will be purged, key supporters of the Prime Minister censured, and funding for the more Liberal members of United England stopped altogether. That's only the tip of the iceberg. We're just getting started."
ENG_pull_over_the_easily_persuaded_desc:0 "Not all of the Liberal members of United England were involved in the stupidity of Maudling, as much as we might not like to admit it. After all, they're just as opposed to fascism as we are, and the Party Chairman can respect that quite a bit in the current era. We can impress upon the wiser members that we really don't have any problems with their economic or social views, just their mistaken political allegiance.\n\nWe can probably pull over a dozen or so by doing this, and if we offer the right incentives to a few more, United England might start resembling the name it took. Even if we don't succeed in grabbing that many, one or two would be enough to make the point to PM Maudling. He isn't as secure as he might think."
ENG_the_liberals_will_know_their_place_desc:0 "Let it not be said that Macmillan is lacking in mercy. We will not destroy the Liberals in United England, but much rather we will merely cow them. They are too useful, after all. What will end, however, is their nominal independence. The Liberals had their chance to work mostly on their own, and they blew it. When they act, speak and campaign now it will be with men and women loyal to Macmillan looking over their shoulders.\n\nOf course, we cannot guarantee everyone will get the message. The Prime Minister will likely engage in some symbolic resistance, but it won't matter. Macmillan runs this country now, and what he decides will be is what will be."
ENG_dirty_dirty_chesterton_desc:0 "Oh, Chesterton, you bastard! The National Front is the single most despicable collection of traitors assembled this side of HMMLR, and at least HMMLR only intended on making us vassals to the Americans! The National Front and their collection of fascist braindead imbeciles would have happily sold us out to the Germans if they won the election. Unfortunately, they still have a base of public support to draw off of. For England's sake, this bastion of evil will need to be stomped out, and fast!\n\nWe can have some private investigators and the intelligence services dig for the more shocking crimes of the National Front, for the time being. As long as we get the dirt we need, it won't matter how long it takes for us to get it. When we have it, we can finally give that scum Chesterton the sendoff to Hell he deserves."
ENG_ban_the_black_shirts_desc:0 "Someone somewhere once said that revenge was a dish best served cold, and now that we are finally experiencing the feeling we can say without a doubt that that person was most assuredly right. The National Front, a successor to elements of the far right conservatives and the British Union of Fascists, was always far too keen about collaborating with the Germans. There was always mountains of evidence, but the Royal Party never seemed to feel it was the right time to act.\n\nThat's changed now. United England is not the Royal Party. We are men of action, not caricatures of corruption and nepotism. Hence, fascism is now the ideological equivalent of persona non grata in England. We'll ban their organisations, their parties, imprison the fools dumb enough to claim the label openly, and all the while they'll not be capable of lifting a finger against us."
ENG_ban_the_scourge_of_fascism_desc:0 "Well, for all that lofty proclamations of the illegality of fascism get the public's attention, sometimes it's better to avoid the potential conflicts down the road and address matters in the correct way, even if it's after the fact. The "Banning of Fascism From Politics Act" does, more or less, exactly what the title of the act states.\n\nOh, it's all hidden behind fancy words in the text of the act, but it doesn't take a genius to divine our feelings about fascism. The fascists are a band of traitors, criminals, and downright scum. United England hates them, England itself hates them, and hell, even the corrupt bastards in the Royal Party hate them! We are going to excise this cancer from England by any means necessary, and to do that we'll need to ban them outright. Who cares about what the Germans - a batch of good-for-nothing fascists - think?"
ENG_the_clean_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, they were a more noble band of corrupt kleptocratic oligarchs, but now those days are long behind us. It's a shame, really. They served the purpose of keeping England out of the German grasp admirably for the years prior to the German Civil War, but they just weren't willing to go that extra step. Still, you make do with what you have, and we really don't have a use for them at the present time.\n\nNepotism beyond belief, corruption, multiple unconfirmed-but-probably politically motivated killings, the list simply goes on and on. How long should England have to live with these disgraceful politicians? Why should they have to live with them existing in a state of luxury whilst the common man works hard for his bread? The answer is, they shouldn't."
ENG_taking_out_our_trash_desc:0 "Obvious corruption comes with a single rather large advantage over traditional secretive corruption, which is that it's completely obvious to even the most cursory financial examination. How unfortunate for the Royal Party MPs, then, that they've grown used to open corruption over the course of some twenty years of unfettered power.\n\nWe shall launch a series of corruption investigations against the more prominent members of the Royal Party to start off with, but as things roll on we can go over every single Royal MPs records to seek the more hidden grifting as well. Party Chairman Macmillan will be very happy to see this go ahead smoothly."
ENG_dig_out_the_rotten_core_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we can't just imprison all of the corrupt Royal Party MPs. Aside from the negative press, most of them are legitimately guilty of little more than corruption, with only a handful actively collaborating with the Reich and fewer still to any provable extent at that. What we can do, however, is remove those corrupt MPs from parliament in a more conventional manner.\n\nOnce removed from office, new elections for their seats can be held. We might win some of them, but it's no great loss if we don't; we still have a majority. Macmillan's visionary leadership is starting to pan out, which makes one wonder what to do with Maudling."
ENG_the_deal_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling was useful for a time. Had he maintained faith with Party Chairman Macmillan, he might have been permitted to retain the seat of Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he was too greedy and, well, we don't need him anymore. We can't kick him out of the party, nor his Liberals, but we can reduce them to the subordinate role they always should have occupied.\n\nSay goodbye to PM Maudling, and hello to the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan! Oh, and Reggie is now the Deputy Prime Minister, for the sake of his ego. Macmillan isn't cruel - he's just doing what he needs to do. That should always be remembered, so that we don't turn into the monsters that the Royal Party became."
ENG_the_PM_power_act_desc:0 "With Harold Macmillan now officially in charge, it is time to remove some of the restrictions we used to keep Maudling in line. For a start, the cabinet will be taking something of a backseat from now on, with the Prime Minister's office acquiring a great deal of executive power, so as to allow Macmillan to fully exercise his vision of a free and fair England.\n\nThere are those who condemn this as some sort of power grab, but they merely lack the understanding of just how important Macmillan is to the continued functioning of England. It was he who guided us up until this point. For his deeds, he has more than earned the right to exercise a significant say in political matters. Out of respect for his vision, we will not stop him. Macmillan will save English democracy, and the people will cheer him on."
ENG_the_protection_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "We sit at the crossroads of history, for from this precipice we gaze upon there will be no return or second chance for the mighty nation of England. It took us years to even get to this point, years of struggle and bargaining and sacrifice, all for the ideal of a nation where choice was not dictated by some master in Washington or Germania but from London.\n\nIt is Harold Macmillan who got us here, he recognised when it was necessary to stand down and preserve what could be saved, he kept the Germans out of England through guile and dealmaking, he preserved our institutions from within the Royal Party. Now, as Prime Minister he shall ensure that both Democracy and England are protected with the zeal of a man in his prime. Until the last, we do this for England."
ENG_edward_abdicates_desc:0 "The recent elections were surprising in many ways, not least that they occurred at all. But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"
ENG_king_henry_takes_the_throne_desc:0 "Edward's abdication does leave us in a bit of a pickle in regards to whom the next monarch shall actually be, the former King having no heir of his own blood. Obviously the American puppet Elizabeth cannot be allowed to accede to the throne, but there is yet one Windsor from the children of George V left untainted by incompetence.\n\nHenry the Duke of Gloucester has remained out of the political spotlight for the past decades, neither supporting our government or that of his niece and instead focusing on charitable affairs. He is our only realistic legitimate option for a successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. Aside from the former King, that family are a dependable lot after all."
ENG_a_crown_falls_silent_desc:0 "It seems that England really cannot catch a break on the matter of its Kings. Whilst travelling back from a charitable event his majesty King Henry IX suffered a massive and debilitating stroke that has rendered him bedridden. Despite our hopes doctors have informed us that it is unlikely the King shall ever walk again, much less rule the nation.\n\nThis is a disastrous situation, but as a nation we are capable of recovering from it. Our first action now should be to establish whom shall act as His Majesty's official regent, and from there we will need to go over succession plans. It is quite likely we will be in need of them sooner rather than later if our current run of luck holds."
ENG_the_prince_regent_desc:0 "William the Prince of Wales is a rather sensible lad. Young but not overly so, and more importantly for us he's well on board with our government on the subject of how the nation should be run, to a greater degree than his incapacitated father even. This is good, as given the health of King Henry it is quite likely that William will be taking up the full responsibilities of his fathers position quite soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent to the King. Taking over the official duties which require his majesty to be capable of travelling across the nation. This might prove a good time to get William introduced to the responsibilities of leadership, so to some extent we ought to be thankful."
ENG_the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "King Henry IX, a noble man who took up his duty when nobody else would, a man of strength and determination, a good man, has breathed his last. With his death dies the last child of his majesty George V, and furthermore means the accession of the seventh monarchy of England in the twentieth century.\n\nAll hail King William V, who has taken up the duty and burden of the crown. In these troubling times it is a strong hand that is required to marshal the nations strength, and King William will assist our government in keeping this will at the forefront of our policies. If fortune favours us the King will reign for many decades yet, the first monarch of a reborn Britain perhaps? But as the times change and the world turns one thing remains constant in England. For we shall always say, "God save the King!""
ENG_to_protect_democracy_desc:0 "We are United England, our name is not some barely concealed snub at the lower classes or call to action. Our name is a symbol of our ideal, of an England where every man and woman can have their say in how this nation is run, regardless of birth or position. Fishermen and factory owners alike, bosses and workers, landowners and tenants, all have taken a chance and supported us in this last chance at a true democracy unburdened by intimidation and fraud. Now it is up to us to fulfil our promise.\n\nWe in United England do swear this, to protect the principles of democracy which made our nation great in times past. To uphold and live these principles no matter the cost, and to fight to the death to ensure they are never cast down again."
ENG_remember_what_was_before_desc:0 "For the longest time those supporters of the British golden ages democratic principles were forced to linger in the shadows whilst the Royal Party reigned supreme over our nation. Democracy under that party was a decayed and fragile thing, the only party ever able to run without opposition was the RP, with anyone not an independent suffering intimidation or suspiciously great wins for the Royal Party come election time.\n\nBut it was not always so, there was a time where every man had his say and parties of all sorts could attempt to appeal to the individual voter. Creating an atmosphere where politicians needed to serve their people lest they be turned out come election time. Perhaps we can return to this state of affairs given time."
ENG_the_light_of_democracy_never_died_desc:0 "United England is full not of kleptocrats like the Royal Party, or maniacs like the National Front, but is instead filled with those willing to risk everything for their ideals. This is a party for those who believe they can make a difference to the conundrum England finds herself in, and no matter how small a chance it is that we will succeed we must try.\n\nBut even if we don't succeed we can know one thing for sure, democracy is one of the great inventions of mankind, an idea which has the power to raze kingdoms and uproot nations. No matter how much the Royal Party might want to, they couldn't and cannot now kill the idea of democracy. For ideas are as the mountains, unmoving to the whims of mere mortal men."
ENG_meet_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "The agreement between the Party Chairman and the Prime Minister is a simple one. As the Party Chairman does not completely trust the people loyal to him to be loyal to the dream of restoring English democracy, he will allow the Liberal faction of United England under Maudling to have a great deal of influence in how the government dictates policy.\n\nYet, it behooves us to note that we shouldn't merely accept what is handed out to us. Why should we live with crumbs, when a whole cake is there for the taking? Building up some of our own proper support networks now that we no longer need fear the intervention of the Royal Party might be a good start, and then we can proceed to meet and plan out our true goals."
ENG_our_partners_next_door_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England is not the dominant one it pains the Prime Minister to admit. Party Chairman Macmillan is the driving force behind United England and that is unlikely to change at the present time, thus we must seek to not oust the Macmillanists but convert them to the cause of democracy. Or at least the cause of Maudling.\n\nTruthfully there is some potential in this proposal, after all even the most conservative of Macmillan's followers despises fascism with a passion and tolerate unhindered democracy in theory. All we need do is convince them that Macmillan won't be around forever, and that it might be profitable to get their names in with the new leadership sooner rather than later."
ENG_meet_with_the_military_desc:0 "The military apparatus of England has always been tied strongly with the Royal Party, dating back from when Montgomery signed the treaty of surrender and convinced the other generals to lay down their arms rather than doom the English people to the bloodshed of fighting in the streets and hills.\n\nNow it is time for Prime Minister Maudling to meet with Montgomery to see what our worries are in the modern age. The Germans still lurk just beyond the English Channel after all and no matter our courage we will need a plan to keep them satisfied or mayhaps deterred. The Prime Minister will also need to inquire as to the actual state of our forces, bloodied as they are by the recent civil war. If we can find some covert supporters more loyal to us than Montgomery, that would just be a bonus."
ENG_introduce_the_concept_of_democratization_desc:0 "English democracy is a joke, and the entire country knows it. The only fair election in the last two decades was held between three splinters of the previously dominant party. Anyone further to the left than liberalism is subject to open intimidation, our election fraud is an international as well as national scandal, and to top it all off we have open fascists who disdain democracy in Parliament.\n\nTo save the soul of England we will need to convince the people that United England as a party is different from the Royal Party. That we truly believe in the system that made our nation the most powerful on earth once upon a time. We will then turn this belief into action by repairing our political infrastructure, but this process of democratization is long and hard. We will need to put in every effort."
ENG_the_great_shift_desc:0 "A change is floating in the winds of politics, a change the like of which England has nary seen since the fall of Britain itself. United England has within itself two factions vying for control and until this moment the victories and power have mostly gone to the Macmillanists. Yet now something is different, and as ordinary Englishmen walk the streets unawares the Liberal faction of United England has begun to assert its dominance.\n\nReginald Maudling is starting to be a Prime Minister in truth and not in name only, and with this "Great Shift" seemingly unlikely to cease in the immediate future it would seem that United England looks set to be united in truth, one way or another."
ENG_the_old_man_clears_the_way_desc:0 "Despite our disagreements with Party Chairman Macmillan on the methods by which England shall be returned to democracy, we cannot deny that he has helped us a great deal in ensuring that United England will follow liberal ideals and not personal loyalty to any one man, despite some of his own supporters misgivings no less. As he said in a speech to the party higher ups recently, "History is apt to judge hardly those who sacrifice tomorrow for today."\n\nMacmillan has confided in the Prime Minister privately that what he truly wants is for an Englishman to be capable of walking from Suffolk to Nottinghamshire without fear of violence or thievery. Perhaps we can help him achieve that much whilst he's still around."
ENG_liberating_the_nation_desc:0 "England has long struggled under the oppression of the German occupiers and her own politicians who enabled the worst of their excesses, yet harkening back to their origins in the Reformist faction of the Royal Party, United England seems set to end those days for good. We didn't make the mistakes of HMMLR and achieve this liberation through violence, instead it was through democracy, liberal ideals and deal making that our land has been freed of the Germanic yoke.\n\nIt is perhaps time that we draw the public's attention to this fact, to show that we mean what we say in our election campaigns and that not all of England's problems will be solved by bloodshed and corruption. We do not just liberate our nation from foreign rule, but from its own darkest fears."
ENG_sons_of_britannia_debate_desc:0 "Free speech was one of the items taken away by the German invasion that the people have most sorely missed, in theory the government under the Royal Party allowed it but in practice free speech has been barely tolerated until now. The secret police often intervening to chastise anyone with too scathing criticism of the government.\n\nThis is hopefully something we can change easily enough, but we will need to gain the trust of the people that this isn't an attempt by us to lure out critics. Perhaps we could hold several public debates with our more prominent critics, even encourage impromptu debate halls and questionnaires for those with grievances against the government. Yes it might occasionally get awkward, but what is the point of democracy if you give up because of the parts you don't like?"
ENG_push_macmillan_to_the_side_desc:0 "The "Great Shift" is starting to become apparent even to the general public, and with more and more of the party aligned to the Liberal ideal rather than the person of Macmillan. The old man has been a useful and valuable accessory to our movement throughout our period in office, but it falls to the Prime Minister to start preparing for an England without him.\n\nWe can start by easing some of Macmillan's responsibilities as Party Chairman, insert a few more Liberal aligned members of United England to take the weight off of his job. Some cabinet responsibilities we can delegate as well, but we should take care to ensure that even if nothing else that he is not disrespected. Macmillan protected us for years, it would be unjust to push him away without recompense."
ENG_daughters_of_anglia_learn_desc:0 "Education, education, education. The Royal Party were a bunch of laggards on that particular subject, feeling free to let our academic system rot from the inside as teachers were under trained or forced to steer away from politically sensitive topics. Well we're here now and unfortunately it's our duty to fix things.\n\nWe should be careful in our reforms to instill a love of democracy in our youth without encouraging them to associate democracy solely with our own party, which would lead to many problems in the future. So too should we take steps to ensure girls and boys both benefit from these educational opportunities, and that the poor have access as much as the middle class who are the most consistent in sending their children to school."
ENG_britons_vote_desc:0 "Democracy is a fragile system, it requires willing and activate participation from a majority of the population to be truly effective, and the last few decades have strained the public confidence in our electoral system to the breaking point. The people remember the rigged elections of the Royal Party, and the suppression of those who stood against them, which means that if we want our reforged democracy to survive long term we need to make the public believe its real once again.\n\nA series of campaigns over radio and television, and even regular old newspaper adverts to encourage voting in not just national but local council elections would be a good start, and from there we can move on to the business of actually registering the millions of potential voters left neglected in prior governments."
ENG_weaken_the_macmillanists_desc:0 "Despite the recent decision on part of the Party Chairman to operate in the background now that the Liberal faction of United England are starting to wield more active influence in party matters, there are still some Macmillanists who refuse to accept our authority. The reasons vary, for some it is personal dislike of the Prime Minister or Liberalism in general, a fair few are just unwilling to see Macmillan make preparations to leave, but in the end its all the same problem to our Prime Minister. Maudling cannot let this go unanswered.\n\nWe can replace the most vocal with our own supporters, preferably former Macmillanists who now see things our way, this action serving the twofold purpose of sending a message to the recaltrients and rewarding those who turned their coats. Hopefully it will be enough."
ENG_liberal_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is a rather strong word, but when you have opponents like ours is it really that bad? Let us be honest, the National Front is a collection of far rightists who would gladly send us back to the dark days of the German occupation for control of the country. On top of being filthy scum sucking fascists. The Royal Party on the other hand makes a mockery of the term, being so corrupt as to make even the worst elements of United England seem tame in comparison. Truthfully it isn't even a lie to say both would be utter disasters for English democracy.\n\nHence, why we will be paying for advertisements against our opposition, hopefully quashing any attempt to defeat us at the polls before it can arise."
ENG_the_equal_vote_act_desc:0 "It might surprise some, but until this moment there was no specific protection by Parliament or legal precedent that stated unequivocally that every man and woman had a single vote, and indeed there were some conditions which prevented persons from exercising their vote depending upon their race.\n\nThis ends today, as with the Equal Vote Act this government puts to rest the archaic practices of discrimination that have so defined prior ministries in England. Be they man or woman, of Caucasian or African heritage, and over the age of 18, any English citizen now has the same vote as any other that they can exercises at will and as they see fit during national and council elections."

What failures have caused civil unrest and tens of thousands of dead Britons? These are the questions the Prime Minister has long debated, Maudling is, after all, quite the philosophical fellow and tries to model his leadership on the successes of the past rather than the failures. Unfortunately there is something of a paucity of the former but a man can make do.\n\nThe answer to these particular questions however is one that came to him almost by chance. Control is the problem, not the existence of a man controlling everything that occurs in a nation, or even temporary absolute control, but the power that comes with control is a tempting one that corrupts those who wield it. We must take care that we do not outstay our welcome."

But should we tread the path with care we could well see all our efforts rewarded, and English democracy bloom in the light.\n\nThis is Reginald Maudling's view of our potential futures. We are far enough along to be so close to success, but just far enough away to need to worry about the chasm still. It will not be an easy journey to reach a fully functioning democracy, it will not be a walk in the park. This last stretch will require great efforts from us, for even greater rewards."
ENG_the_clear_parliament_act_desc:0 "Frankly the people don't trust Parliament at the present time, seeing it as an almost otherworldly force that does as it pleases when it pleases and they only get to read about it in the newspapers.\n\nThe Clear Parliament Act is one of the Prime Minister's more original ideas to be quite honest, showing the path to democracy by showing how the demcoratic process works to the general populace. Recordings of parliamentary sessions will be made available to the general public via the EBC and any observer may deign to look upon the government in action during these sessions. It is not a perfect system of course, but as systems go it is certainly better than most."
ENG_the_kids_born_into_a_corrupt_system_desc:0 "It is a rare thing that a Prime Minister can have something truly in common with even the lowliest of paupers, but Reginald Maudling raised a child through the dark years of England. His daughter Caroline is just one of an entire generation who grew up knowing their country at its lowest state, and there are many thousands like her who are disillusioned, despondent and out of work.\n\nThe Prime Minister has personally advocated for a programme to assist the youth of these troubled times, giving them access to more opportunities to better themselves, get jobs and escape the systems which entrap them in lives of drudgery and misery. If even a few make it out, it will have been money well spent."

Well, we can certainly use that.\n\nThe "New Way" is the term coined for Prime Minister Maudling's comprehensive series of reforms and changes to the education and political systems. Encouraging public backing of democratic ideals, tolerance for different ways of life and experimentation and a general lessening of the law and order focussed public appeals of prior Ministries. The children of this age will grow up in a land of tolerance and freedom of expression, it is our hope they can pass these ideals on to their own children some day."
ENG_the_liberal_education_act_desc:0 "The Liberal Education Act is somewhat ostentatiously named it must be admitted, but accuracy is important when making major changes that will affect the general public and this bill of reform will most certainly do just that.\n\nThe overarching goal of the Act is a fairly concise one, that inaccuracies, biases and faults in the education system which have been extant up until this point, the actions of the coalition government in the Second World War and their portrayal for example, will be corrected. Additionally more funding will be given to universities and facilities of higher education, so as to increase the number of trained specialists in various professions available to England."
ENG_no_more_government_news_paper_desc:0 "It would be fair to say that despite our efforts to reduce government influence over the mass media, there have been some things which have escaped our notice and amongst these items is the fact that the government owns in part or in totality several of the larger and more well read news corporations and broadcasters.\n\nWhilst not in theory a bad thing, the potential for this to be misused by ourselves let alone the other less scrupulous political parties is quite frankly a bit unsettling. The companies will be privatised with the exception of the EBC, which shall return to its prior mandate of being an apolitical broadcaster. This can be used as an example to the public of our commitment to the liberal ideal of a government which is hands off, hopefully without giving the Royal Party a way back in."
ENG_the_modern_media_desc:0 "Strangely, the Royal Party never really got around to encouraging the widespread adoption of personal televisions and radios in all their years of governance. Perhaps we should be less surprised, after all they often forgot to pretend they weren't a party of the elite.\n\nBut it behooves us to not acknowledge the utility of these devices, a television can grant knowledge of the wider world's events to anyone willing to listen, a radio much the same and for cheaper prices. We should invest in ensuring that the people of England have opportunities to view all the political points available, and not just that which the government deems to be acceptable. The media apparatus will probably be happy with this as well, after all a higher viewership is never a bad move."
ENG_the_free_press_act_desc:0 "It has been the policy of Prime Minister Reginald Maudling in particular and the United England Party as an institution that the prior restrictions on the nature and content which politics is reported in ought to be changed. Indeed, we have greatly lessened the restrictions upon most Broadcasting networks and our influence upon them up until this point, but it does rather fall to us to make this sort of thing official.\n\nThe Free Press Act officially and permanently bans the influence of politicians upon the media, with grave repercussions for those caught doing so. Additionally it prevents the government or those employed by the government from owning political media networks. With luck some of the opposition might even listen to us."
ENG_the_start_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "It is a slow process, much like gardening. You don't notice its growth by the minute or even by the hour, but slowly and surely democracy is beginning to take root once more in England. Be it the debates you can hear in pubs that would have been out of the question a scant few years before, or the numerous independent or minor parties seeking council and even parliamentary seats. You can see it in the eyes of students and the voices of up and coming aids, people are once more beginning to believe in democracy.\n\nThis is what United England always wanted, and thanks to Reginald Maudling it is what we have to boast about. The beauty of a working democracy is something we will need to nurture, until it can survive without us."

ENG_the_people_have_our_back_desc:0 "United England has never been the most stable of parties. Granted, we all have the common goal of opposing the corruption and ineptitude of the Royal Party, but the relations between our factions are nonetheless somewhat strained. Despite this, we have evidently been successful at our goals, for in spite of what our good "friends" in the opposition have alleged us of doing, and despite our own problems as a party, we have just been reelected to government.\n\nThe people have chosen what is right over promises our opponents cannot keep, and so now it falls to us to come through on our own promises. The necessary work of turning England into a nation we can be proud of, and ensuring nobody interrupts that work before it is done."
ENG_fascism_failed_again_desc:0 "Fascism is a blight upon all that is good and just in this world, a cancer upon nations and states across the globe that ought to be burned in the hellfire it spawned from. Yet in England we have prevented its rise, we have prevented the insidious infection from seizing power and influence for its masters in Germania. All thanks to the work of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan who recognised the mistake of the Royal Party in allowing the fascist hardliners into their ranks, who has always and will continue to oppose it wherever it rears its ugly head in England. England stands united by its traditions, its spirit and its Prime Minister. Fascism and all who act as its agents are not welcome here."
ENG_lets_make_sure_that_it_will_never_rise_again_desc:0 "When a feral dog attacks a human being, you do not coddle the animal. You do not let it live whilst the potential for danger remains from it. Any sensible person merely compels it to stay still before blasting the diseased creature in the head, and the metaphor being used here ought to be applied to those who would corrupt England's soul with fascism as well.\n\nNot literally, unfortunately, there are certain standards which must be maintained after all. No, we need to choose a target. Our work will require that the so called "loyal opposition" be neutralized on a political level. It's quite unfortunate, but then again, we wouldn't need to do this if they hadn't collectively decided to become filthy rat-bastard scum-of-the-earth German-loving whoreson traitors. If they didn't, we wouldn't be here. The question is, who's a bigger traitor?"
ENG_combat_the_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, we were a part of that dismal mess of a coalition. The Prime Minister himself felt they were the only option to keep England's spirit alive and kicking, everything else seemed likely to only get England's best hope quashed, like so many other groups. Now, they act as the voice of Germania in England, second only to the disgusting National Front.\n\n20 years they had to change, 20 long and tiring years where we tried to convince them that not all was lost, that we could strive for better things, better ideals than simple survival. We were ignored, and so we come to the crossroads we were always going to reach. The Royal Party and its tendrils throughout English society die today, we shall be the ones to kill it."
ENG_lure_the_germanophiles_desc:0 "The most odious portion of the Royal Party by far is that section known in common parlance as the "Germanophiles". An odd group, not really organised around a singular leader so much as they are united in their shared disdain for loyalty to their country and a desire for the perks they so enjoyed when England was under their leadership. Well, these opportunists are to be our first targets, and how fortuitous is it that we have a sting operation just ready and waiting in the wings.\n\nWe won't make up any evidence, some letters will be sent to them and they will be invited to a meeting with what they thinking is a German intelligence officer. The rest will be all up to them. The PM thinks he won't be disappointed."
ENG_are_these_the_people_you_voted_for_desc:0 "A tip for whenever members of our party seek to set up political stings in the future, always make sure that there was a minimum of prodding from yourselves, and that the targets were the ones who implicated themselves in whatever they thought was going on. It's a matter of publicity, the man on the street might not care if an MP is arrested for what he might have done, but will pay far more attention to the man arrested for joining a plot he thought was legitimate.\n\nThe meeting will occur, we will record the whole thing and have the constabulary arrest them in full view of the press as they leave the building. The public won't even know we were involved."
ENG_investigate_the_royal_party_desc:0 "We never did get around to launching a truly thorough investigation into the Royal Party. Maybe it was foolish optimism on our part, but the Prime Minister believed the corrupt imbeciles might get the hint when the worst eggs of the bunch were removed. Predictably, the Royal Party has shown itself to be a rats nest of corruption and ineptitude. There isn't even any sign that the party leadership are shocked by some of the accusations the press level against them.\n\nSo, given the situation at hand, we will resolve it with an iron fist. Every single MP and high ranking member of the Royal Party will be investigated, thoroughly. We will find everything, every secret and every crime they've ever been party to. Then, we will solve the matter of the disloyal opposition once and for all."
ENG_reveal_the_findings_desc:0 "Oh, how satisfying victory can be. Our investigations went ahead, and the things they uncovered have shocked even some of the most optimistic of our intelligence services. 187 pages worth of shocking acts, lies, and secrets the Royal Party would, and sometimes did, kill to keep out of the limelight. It's all ours, every single piece of their dirty deeds.\n\n187 pages of shame, 187 pages of criminality, 187 pages of corruption. We can show it to the press ourselves, give them copies, hell, give the people copies to hand out by the dozen. Let the entire nation see what the Royal Party really is, not the facade they have been careful to keep. Let them be judged as they would have judged us. A fitting punishment for traitors!"
ENG_the_corruption_act_desc:0 "Public opinion is an important thing, you know, and why should it not be? Is not our legitimacy gained by the people's commitment to never again letting fascism have a grip over England? Oh, the Royal Party might not strictly be fascist, but being so completely and utterly corrupt that you get caught trying to sell the nation to the Germans is somewhat embarrassing at the very least.\n\nHence the introduction of the Corruption Act by Prime Minister Macmillan and Deputy PM Maudling. An act which crystalises the policy of United England in a series of easy to read paragraphs, perfect for public consumption. Unofficially, this is just the simplest way to indict most of the Royal Party in one fell swoop. We can deal with leftovers later."
ENG_lock_the_traitors_up_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a stain on our heroic history. These cowards decided they would rather kneel on a plastic throne than challenge the German occupiers, then proceeded to use their position as nothing but a fast track to self-enrichment. Each and everyone of them are just as responsible for the Civil War as the terrorists themselves, and they should be treated as such.\n\nOur preparations must be quick. A few hasty trials in a makeshift courtroom, and we will send these empty suits to receive proper justice, mostly involving a brick wall and a group of riflemen. United England will live up to its ideals by removing the parasites who sought to drive our once-righteous nation into weak servility, and create a united front against those who wish to see us bow before Germany. For the dream of a union to live, the Royal Party must die."
ENG_crackdown_on_the_NF_desc:0 "There do not, in the fair English language, exist a series of words properly profane enough to describe our Prime Minister's thoughts on the political organisation known as the National Front. We could call them traitors, except that many actual traitors had a great deal more scruples. We could call them spies and German sympathisers, which would be entirely accurate, yet still not quite give the full scope of their debauchery.\n\nNo, perhaps an accurate description is not needed at the time being, it doesn't affect our plan after all. Under the direct orders of the Prime Minister, the National Front is to be considered a subversive foreign organisation, and dealt with as such. We will end the madness of English fascism permanently."
ENG_the_last_rats_in_england_desc:0 "The National Front isn't quite as great a force as it once was. We wouldn't like to take all the credit, some of which must obviously go to the insanity of the organisation in question, but we must admit that it was a pleasure to dismantle it piece by piece.\n\nNow it's just Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, his little gang of sycophants, and a handful of others that are left, a paltry band from the force that briefly sought to rival both United England and the Royal Party, but enough to be worth destroying all the same. It's a bit of a shame we don't have that old bastard Moseley around anymore, since he'd make an excellent target for our most righteous vengeance, but we make do with what we can get. Chesterton will suffice."
ENG_plant_the_poison_desc:0 "We didn't hold much faith in the general intelligence of the National Front's remaining MPs, but we, the Intelligence services, and almost all persons with functioning brains thought that they'd be smarter than to reply to message which, to paraphrase an officer involved in its writing, stated "We are planning to invade, would you be willing to head a government? Sincerely, Germany."\n\nThe sheer imbecility is simply jaw dropping, and quite satisfying, to be quite honest. Saying the truth that the National Front are filthy traitors is all well and good, having actual treachery to catch them being involved in is quite another thing entirely. The Prime Minister is ecstatic, the opportunity of a lifetime has arrived on his desk and Macmillan fully intends to use it. Let's not keep the police waiting."
ENG_jail_the_rats_desc:0 "Victory is worth all that it took to arrive there, and our victory is worth thrice as much and then some if you listen to the United England MPs. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, caught in a sting with his party about to commit to supporting a German invasion of our fair isle, the headlines just couldn't be better! We have the trial just about set up now, the rats languish in their cells for the time being, though.\n\nPM Macmillan has stated he's open to hearing opinions on what their long term fates ought to be. Nobody thinks execution is quite the right answer at the moment, but the possibility is definitely being floated."
ENG_a_letter_to_ches_desc:0 "Why go to so much effort when you can get the point across politely? Seems all a bit too much work for one traitor and his band of malcontents, no, Prime Minister Macmillan will handle this one personally.\n\nThe letter will be short and to the point, Arthur Kenneth Chesterton's days in politics are over. If he insists on disputing this, he will suffer the consequences of his past actions that have thus far been postponed for one reason or another. Either he's stupid enough to confront us, or smart enough to know we'll never let him get within twenty miles of a reporter."
ENG_send_him_to_germania_desc:0 "The National Front is a German sponsored subversive organisation, and you unfortunately need a better justification than 'German lapdog' to start executing. Deputy Prime Minister Maudling came up with quite the inventive solution to our issue, "Why not let the Germans have them?" It's simple and stunningly effective, who will openly support the National Front when they see our enemies giving them succour?\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan is in full agreement with the Liberal faction's suggestions for once, and we have already begun making the preparations for the extradition of Chesterton and his friends. Well, "extradition" in the sense of dumping them in the German embassy. It will do."
ENG_the_antifascist_act_desc:0 "Fascism is a plague, a disease upon all that is well and good in English society. It moulds and corrupts what it touches into parodies of their original selves, burning a scar right into the fabric of entire institutions. This will be allowed no longer, and with the Anti-Fascist Act, United England will be seen to do what every government prior to now should have. We will scourge this monstrosity from our island.\n\nThe key to this, of course, is to not merely make fascism illegal, but also those ideologies adjacent to it, the sort which the fascists would attempt to camouflage their insidious beliefs with. By banning them too, we can still easily reach the deplorables. We can call our little scuffle with the National Front finished once the last of them are rotting in prison as a reward for their cleverness."
ENG_the_liberal_flower_desc:0 "The Liberals, such a quaint little group. Once, they were our only effective allies, but in recent times the Prime Minister has been doubting their worth for a variety of reasons, not least that they seem oddly squeamish about preventing the disloyal opposition from using elections as a cover to bring back the Germans.\n\nOptimism is all well and good, but not when you apply it to honourless thugs like Thatcher and Chesterton. Granted, one of them isn't truly a problem for us anymore, yet we still need to address the root cause here. The Liberals weaken us. They represent a vulnerability in United England's armour. We must patch it, however we can."
ENG_silence_them_desc:0 "Their ability to appeal to the ordinary Englishman has always been the strength of the Liberals, and now that they're beginning to act in opposition to United England's goals, it might be worth addressing what could be called an emerging threat.\n\nNothing harmful of course, no, we'll just have some frank conversations with the media outlets, especially those on radio and television. It wouldn't do for some of the more disaffected to lose sight of their purpose and start blaming us for the failures of the Liberals. This is no kindness, but it is necessary if we are to expunge the weakness that might allow the beast of fascism back into England."
ENG_fire_those_who_resist_desc:0 "One advantage of Maudling tipping his hand all those months ago is that it has shown us that leaving the reigns of party power in the hands of the untrustworthy is a mistake not worth repeating. To save the soul of England, we will need to quash those who might object before they can use their influence against us.\n\nWe can fire the radical liberals from their positions, and those unwilling to work with us can simply be expelled from the party. There exists the possibility that we might be underestimating them, however, so just in case we'll deal with any Liberal associates in the officer core as well. It never hurts to cover all your bases on matters like these."
ENG_maudlings_friends_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has been a stalwart ally despite his own flaws and ambition. Perhaps that is why the next step will be so difficult, for he has many who respect him. They probably don't know about his two-faced nature.\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan ought to be the one to do it. Maudling and Macmillan know one another decently well, so Macmillan will be able to break the news to him the best. With luck, we can give him a position of little authority outside the party for him to fritter the rest of his days away on."
ENG_must_go_desc:0 "By far, the greatest shame about this whole affair is having to explain what is happening to Maudling himself. The man deserved better, but his weakness will not serve England well if he were to remain in a position of influence and power. No, it is better this way, after all at least he'll still have responsibilities, just not political ones anymore.\n\nHe'll probably enjoy the relaxation after the last few stressful years he's had."
ENG_the_protection_of_democracy_act_desc:0 "The time has come. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan can look over England now and see a land dedicated to the expulsion and fighting of fascism wherever it lies. However, we must take steps to ensure things remain this way, now that we've dealt with the Liberals and half of the opposition.\n\nThe "Protection of Democracy Act" will play a fairly outsized role in this, the act itself is one of the more complex pieces put to Parliament by the Prime Minister, but it holds true in the essentials to the vision of United England. It gives the office of Prime Minister certain discretionary powers when it comes to matters of national security, in addition to the ability to determine what is and isn't a fascist group. All for the good of the people."
ENG_the_royal_party_rots_desc:0 "Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some. The Royal Party has definitely been on the latter end of that phrase, the once mighty titan of English politics reduced to a tottering behemoth that could fall at any moment.\n\nPerhaps it would be a mercy to put the Royal Party down before they descend further. In any case, the best way to fell a giant is to strike at their legs. We will finish this bastion of corrupt traitors and move on. May England remember them for the monsters they became, and not the party they once were."
ENG_those_who_got_away_desc:0 "As surprising as it might be, the monstrous corruption of the Royal Party is not a universal fact. Oh, for sure, the majority is irredeemably corrupt, but there exist a handful of moderates who align with the RP out of genuine belief rather than any allegiance to the corrupt system which perpetuated the Royal Party.\n\nConsidering the number of pressing events we have on our schedule at the moment, it might be worth doing to leave them be. First, of course, we will need some insurance."
ENG_make_them_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "An opposition is a useful thing, "better us than them" as Harold Macmillan says. Thus, despite our contempt for the handful of idiots still following the Royal Party, we shall let them be, so long as we have some assurances of their conduct.\n\nA simple signed agreement will do. It will be a simple promise for the Royal Party, where they promise not to pursue any actions that would destabilize the government, to do their utmost to discourage fascism where they can, and to not get in our way. Most of them will keep to it, but there might be one or two to use as an example."
ENG_make_them_repent_desc:0 "Why have principled men if you can't use them? Prime Minister Macmillan will call a press conference soon where the Royal Party Moderates will denounce the rest of the party they serve to the public. We'll need to ensure the media get the story right, but once it's done we will have struck a blow against the corrupt heart of the party.\n\nConservatism is a paternalistic ideal after all, and we're simply ensuring the wayward children of the Royal Party demonstrate their fealty to the true protectors of England."
ENG_the_opposition_disappears_desc:0 "The Moderates are now puppets, moving along the strings we have set. While it is true that they could have potentially been the foundation of a capable anti-fascist organization, the possibility that they could have become a threat to our government was far too high. Now, they answer to the same man as the rest of England. Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan is a man of his word, and for the Moderate leadership's cooperation, they will not fall victim to acts and measures they would otherwise find inconvenient. It's only fair. Additionally, they will be permitted to keep the seats they currently hold."
ENG_the_iron_lady_with_greed_desc:0 "Mrs. Thatcher is a curious woman, it really must be said. Unlike the rest of her corrupt abomination of a party, she has some principles with which she conducts herself, an affair which seems to baffle her coworkers.\n\nWe face something of a conundrum in dealing with the woman known as the Iron Lady. Perhaps we should just sweep her aside with the rest of her party, but Her potential to lead as a puppet opposition leader is great enough to counterbalance the risks. Even more than that, showing the olive branch towards other non-fascist parties will go a long way towards helping our cause."
ENG_ally_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Sometimes you need to look at the broken things to rediscover their use properly, and the Thatcherite faction of the Royal Party might yet have some purpose for us. We won't give them promises we can't keep, rather we'll offer the old tradition of the bread or the club.\n\nThere won't be any grand speeches from Mrs. Thatcher. No, all she will be doing is signing a simple and polite agreement dictating the actions of her party. Especially in regards to a certain neighbor across the channel. While the Royal Party may have an unfortunate record of leaking to the Germans, they will now only leak what we want them to."
ENG_a_puppet_on_strings_desc:0 "The Iron Lady has bent rather than be broken, and it's a right good thing she did. As far as the public is concerned, Mrs. Thatcher is still the head of the opposition, but in actual fact the remnant Royal Party answer to the same man as the rest of England, Harold Macmillan.\n\nWe'll let her keep her reputation and dignity, for as long as Thatcher serves the interests of England no harm shall come to her."
ENG_much_like_the_rest_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher is too dangerous to leave at our back. The woman turned the corrupt shell of a party which had been split three ways into the second most fearsome political force in England. Who knows what she could do, give some actual time and the absence of our interference.\n\nUnited England will do the proper thing. We will end our opposition once and for all without giving them an opportunity to crawl underground. England's corruption will burn away today, and it shall be United England that lights the match."
ENG_swamp_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Luckily for us, we still have plenty of dirt on Thatcher and her gang from our time inside the Royal Party and subsequent infiltration of the modern one. We'll need some extra evidence, though, so let's set a bit of bait.\n\nNothing obvious, just enough to ensure that we get the right people on the right set of charges. We still need the public to buy the trial's legitimacy after all, and too much evidence might go against the grain."
ENG_thatcherists_pacified_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher, once the only serious rival to Harold Macmillan for dominion of English politics, is now no longer an issue to be concerned with. Let us move on to better and bigger things, now that corruption and fascism both have been excised from English politics and replaced with more virtuous and sensible political ideals.\n\nThe Royal Party was a good opposition for a time, it must be said, but all things come to an end. It's best we close the door on this act of history."
ENG_no_longer_a_threat_desc:0 "Thatcher's talk of unity and strength in the Royal Party was not meant to apply to England as a whole, but rather the sickly chimera she led. Now that we have pushed her out of government and into a cold cell, we can finally begin building a free, united England in peace. Our economy will not be sold out to wealthy elites, our government will not be dictated by the iron will of one woman; our party will preserve all the ideals that make England great."
ENG_safe_streets_act_desc:0 "It is an age of information, and thanks to a rather obscure case going through the courts recently, we will now be able to have all the information on our citizens that we need to protect them.\n\nThe Safe Streets Act is the cornerstone of England's new domestic policy on matters of national security, namely that the government has the prerogative to take any action needed to protect the nation from fascist subversion and treachery."
ENG_my_allegiance_is_to_macmillan_and_democracy_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan has led us to greatness. Under his guidance England has once more ascended to a position of respect, if not influence, on the international stage. Internal enemies have been swept aside, and the twin evils of corruption and fascism excised from the national consciousness.\n\nYes, the path has been a hard one, and some have fallen along the way, but compared to the alternative, our actions have been a mercy upon the people of England. Let it be heard by all who would listen, God save the King and long live Prime Minister Macmillan!"
ENG_a_chance_for_freedom_desc:0 "Victory is a sweet nectar, and one on which you can be distracted should you sup upon it too greatly, but let us no downplay the scale of our victory here and today. We won, for the 2nd time in recent history in a democratic election it was United England who emerged victorious. Not the Royal Party and their sycophants or the madmen of the National Front.\n\nWe have the people to thank for this, the people who recognised the necessity of our continued governance. As a show of thanks, we shall give them what they asked for. A return to the glories of the past under the aegis of democracy."
ENG_but_freedom_has_its_costs_desc:0 "Democracy is the ideal which has long motivated United England, but unfortunately it seems that even the purest of ideals is vulnerable to threats from the inside. Opposition to our actions has been mounting from the remnant National Front, who seem poised to make a resurgence should nothing be done about them.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporations who appreciated our economic policies are starting to get a bit big for their boots, trying to exert their influence in the political sphere. It is time that we end this charade that we will allow those once ruled us with us to destroy or corrupt what we built. We have work to do."
ENG_targeting_corporatism_desc:0 "Though socialism is undeniably incorrect on many things, we must reluctantly admit that they might have had a point on the whole "corrupt corporations" issue. The industrial giants and their aristocratic backers are seeking to make this newly flowered democracy one puppeted by their hands, and they are showing interest in buying politicians, votes, even electoral commissioners.\n\nIf our ideal is to survive we must stop this here and now, and one way or another that is exactly what we will do."
ENG_the_giant_that_poisons_our_democracy_desc:0 "The influence of money in politics is like a poison, slowly but surely turning even the noblest of men and women into nothing more than the string puppets of laughing businessmen. If the current crop of CEO's and well to do families get it into their heads that they can influence the process with impunity there will be no going back.\n\nOur first step should be addressing where the influence flows from, before we try to address the matter of who is influenced. Should we succeed then we may make the lives of future generations far easier."
ENG_separating_business_and_democracy_desc:0 "Obviously we cannot remove the influence of business from politics completely, and unfortunate though it may be we do need them around to keep money flowing into our coffers. But that doesn't mean we can't have some regulations on the subject of money and politics.\n\nThese guidelines will be minimalistic, but hopefully they can prevent any overt conflicts of interest, namely by forcing recusal in the case where profit could be garnered by an MP on a vote and strict limits on campaign donations otherwise. It won't prevent everything, but it will stop the worst abuses."
ENG_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military-industrial complex of England might not be quite the giant it was back in the days of the Empire, but nonetheless it is still a force to be reckoned with. Hawkish politicians still infest parliament, and it isn't uncommon for businesses with military leanings to lobby for certain actions or interests in Parliament.\n\nIf we were to remove this influence, it is quite possible our military might actually start becoming responsive to what England needs rather than what her suppliers need us to buy."
ENG_both_at_the_opposition_and_back_at_home_desc:0 "United England has been at the forefront of political reform for many of these past years, but just because we want reform doesn't mean some vipers don't exist within our ranks as well as the opposition. We will contact the relevant authorities to begin investigations into the rank and file of United England, mostly to sweep up the obvious abuses and corruptions but also to remind our membership that being apart of the governing party does not grant immunity from consequences.\n\nBesides, it'll look good in the public's eye and that never hurts a bit."
ENG_the_fair_politics_act_desc:0 "The Fair Politics Act aims to reduce the amount of influence that money has on the political landscape, not by removing it entirely but instead by evening the playing field. To begin with, no donations of over 2000 pounds can be accepted to a political campaign unless for charitable purposes, all campaigns will receive some amount of treasury subsidising for basic expenses, and no politician can be in direct control or contact with a business during their term of office.\n\nWith luck we can gradually expand this act into an overarching series of rules for political conduct, preventing abuses by all involved and establishing ironclad penalties for breaches of the act."
ENG_targeting_fascism_desc:0 "We might not agree with Harold Macmillan on everything, but it behooves us to listen to him when he actually has a point. What brought down the England we are trying to restore? Fascism. What corrupt and evil system had free reign over our nation for almost two decades, causing many of our current problems? Fascism. And who, right now sits with us, unwelcome, in the House of Parliament? Fascists.\n\nMacmillan was right, fascism is a disease to be combatted, but we must be surgical as we remove it, so as not to destroy democracy whilst we eradicate the disease. From here we must act carefully."
ENG_the_dirty_fellows_in_the_nf_desc:0 "The National Front is a political party descended from the Hardliner faction of the Royal Party before the split that saw United England emerge along with it. But something is wrong with those words, namely the implication that we need tolerate a party of open fascists existing in this new English democracy at all.\n\nIt is the pleasure of Prime Minister Maudling to announce that the fascists will no longer have free reign to act as a German catspaw. They will answer for what they have done and intended to do, and the people will love us for it."
ENG_outlaw_the_blackshirts_2_desc:0 "Banning fascism is a surprisingly simple process - a bill, a vote and a law which ends with a once dominant party of the English political landscape being rent asunder. The benefits of this action are many, but a surprising one is the change in the manner which the army views us.\n\nTraditionally the military establishment has always hated the ideology which ended the original United Kingdom decades ago. Now that we've banned fascism, some of the higher ranking officers are beginning to look at us, and not the Royal Party, as the political group with England's best interests in mind."
ENG_offer_the_fash_redemption_desc:0 "The National Front has many supporters, and given the efficacy of their propaganda during the years of Royal Party rule perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by this. Yet it is the young who worry us most, those who might potentially carry on the traditions of fascism in secret. We cannot answer this with force, lest we be proven to act like the tyrants the National Front claims us to be. No, we will offer the young and misguided opportunities to deradicalise. We won't be successful with everyone, but we will be successful enough to not worry about future problems."
ENG_the_people_know_better_desc:0 "Fittingly, the final say on fascism comes down to the people who voted them in. Some perhaps thought they were the only option, others maybe were intimidated into voting for the National Front, but there are always genuine supporters indoctrinated by ideology, and those are the real problem.\n\nWe need to address this at the base, convince them to abandon their hateful ideology in favour of a democracy that will do right by them, not the landlords and businessmen."
ENG_the_democratic_education_act_desc:0 "Despite our failures in fully dealing with the fascist problem, there yet remains a long term solution. People learn things best at a young age, and that is where we shall spread our message of democracy the most.\n\nThe Democratic Education Act will ensure that schools across the country address the realities of England's past and interactions with fascist nations and fascism itself. The crimes and corruption will be laid bare, their treachery revealed, their atrocities examined in exquisite detail. Let our children know the virtues of democracy, by seeing for themselves the alternative."
ENG_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "A rose will not bloom in a garden overgrown with weeds. The lingering tendrils of the old Collaborators' fascism and corporatism, hostile to the very idea of a diverse democratic polity, have been uprooted from England, leaving fertile soil for the democracy that we strive to become."
ENG_shake_it_up_a_little_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the Liberal faction of United England leads the party, the conservative Macmillanists still remain in overall power, and indeed recently they have begun to brook some of our reforms internally. This is intolerable, but there may yet be a solution that doesn't involve party infighting with a handful of old windbags.\n\nNamely, get rid of the windbags and put our people in their places. It won't please everyone but we don't need the figleaf of conservatism to protect us anymore, United England stands because of those who want change, not those who wish to prevent it."
ENG_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "First things first, we should address the matter of many United England MPs being, well, crotchety old men who were ageing when the 2nd World War was going on let alone the Civil War. Old men having too much power for too long is half of what caused things to get this bad in the first place.\n\nNaturally, we cannot just remove MPs altogether but we can lessen their authority and the scope of their duties in cabinet, replacing the party whips would be a good start. The Macmillanists will rant and rave but in the end it is our party now, not theirs."
ENG_back_stab_the_conservatives_desc:0 "When you're about to do something terrible to a friend for their own good it's best to do it quickly and with minimum fuss. But for that we need lists, names and replacements all in order so the entire operation can be over in just 24 hours at the maximum.\n\nTo get those lists will be the job of our junior MPs, the ones below suspicion who will also be the ones filling in most of the positions about to suddenly become vacant. We want this to go off without a hitch, and that means planning."
ENG_hit_and_run_desc:0 "What we are about to do is not a kind act, it is not the act of friends who worked beside each other for years. History will not look upon this kindly, it will look upon it as necessary. In one meeting we will remove all the prominent Macmillanists from their posts, and appoint new, loyal Liberal members of the party in their stead.\n\nPerhaps one day they may forgive us, perhaps one day we may forgive ourselves."
ENG_approach_the_left_desc:0 "The Left Resistance represented the worst of the English leftist political spectrum, madmen and radicals who wanted a revolution of blood for a foolish cause. It is fitting they were mostly defeated along with that madman Stirling and the traitor Auchinleck.\n\nYet, political restrictions on the left don't merely extend to communists but to the old Labour remnants as well, who are unlikely to have done anything too treasonous. Perhaps if we offered them clemency, we might find allies more approachable to our reforms."
ENG_an_act_for_support_desc:0 "A simple piece of legislation it is, but the document sitting before Prime Minister Maudling is the single greatest leap forward for English politics in twenty years. It unbans the Labour party of old, should they be willing to renounce communism and revolutionary socialism that is.\n\nOnce returned, these leftist parties will cease causing civil difficulty for the government and offer their support to the stabilisation and maintenance of England's future. One good deed does not outway years of sins, but it is a start."
ENG_the_party_splits_desc:0 "Nobody can endure everything, and the last straw on the proverbial camel's back has broken for the Macmillanist conservative wing of United England. Our party once united is now unto two separate and distinct groups, but this time it is the Liberals who are the greater power of the two.\n\nWe have enough support that this will not overly affect our governance, perhaps we can even point to it as a demonstration of our commitment to the democracy we are busily restoring. It is a necessity, though a regrettable one."
ENG_the_new_magna_carta_desc:0 "If there's one thing Reginald Maudling can do well that none deny it's market something to the people. "The New Magna Carta" is no exception to this. Created in the bowels of our party headquarters, the document is actually a rather simple one for that it is talked up. What is nigh revolutionary about the document in the modern political era is that rather than increase the amount of governmental power certain offices possess, the New Magna Carta gives more power to the democratically elected offices. Both to Parliament, to the Judiciary and importantly to local councils."
ENG_helping_the_weak_desc:0 "The Royal Party is truly an insidious organisation, they don't merely rely on the old methods of currying favour with the voters but instead actively seek out downtrodden demographics and try to pin the blame for their situations on us. Ignoring the fact that they were in power for 20 years and caused most of the current problems.\n\nBut we must not lash out against the misguided, no, we must educate them instead. Heal them. Save them from what ailments they possess. Then they will know the truth of whom shall help whom."
ENG_the_RPs_abandonment_desc:0 "20 years of government. 20 years of promises. 20 years of failure. What can be said of the Royal Party really, besides the fact that they sold the nation to the wolves of Germany and grew fat off of the scraps of England's carcass.\n\nWhere was the Royal Party when the Germans searched through your homes? Where was the Royal Party when your children starved? Where were the Royal Party when they were shot! Standing at the beck and call of Germany, that's where."
ENG_where_was_the_RP_desc:0 "The Royal Party now is a mockery of the very name. A party which hasn't been able to win either fair election it participated in, and has been reduced to a mockery in the newspapers. They lurk in the shadows, denying responsibility for their own mistakes and accusing us of crimes that were theirs. Never do they think of the people they could help, they think merely of power and of what they might do with it when it is seized. They disgust all decent minded people."
ENG_whats_in_the_RP_desc:0 "What of the membership of the Royal Party you ask? Why only the most ruthless band of criminals, crackpots and corrupt MPs this side of the English Channel. The moderates have been long weeded out by ruthless men, the few with any commitment to democracy absorbed into United England when it formed and fewer still into our own ranks.\n\nThere is no salvaging the poor souls who remain under the Royal name in the Houses of Parliament, no chance whatsoever."
ENG_have_you_heard_of_their_crimes_desc:0 "If you want something to stick, find what they actually did and merely let logical conclusions do the rest. People won't believe a little lie, but if we don't directly say what it is we think the Royal Party did over the years it will have all the more poignant an effect.\n\nFor example, we know the Royal Party had the leaders of the 1953 uprising executed, who is to say that they didn't have other leaders perish in unfortunate circumstances? Or the corruption that we all know they partook in, perhaps all those ill paved roads could have used the funding? It is merely a thought."
ENG_the_final_step_in_democratization_desc:0 "Those parties which threatened democracy by their existence are no more, either reduced into nothing by virtue of what they did or banned outright. It is time then for us to create legitimate alternatives that the people might want to elect for the most trying possibility of all in democracy. That we might not get reelected.\n\nFor now, let us allow the resurrection of the old Labour Party. We can trust they appreciate the seriousness of the situation at any rate, and they hate fascism as much as the next man. They will do."
ENG_bring_back_old_labour_desc:0 "There was a time when it was bad to be labeled a liberal, let alone a leftist in England. Yet we promised those in hiding that the days of persecution were over. Now we have delivered on that and we can begin to see the flower of democracy fully unfold.\n\nLabour was many things, a rival and an opponent yes but never our enemy. We can trust them, we can work with them, and perhaps most importantly we know that should we lose to them next election they will not bring down this edifice we have created."
ENG_a_broken_but_perfect_system_desc:0 "We are not a perfect nation. Hard though it is to admit, we have poverty and corruption yes, even callousness of government on occasion. But we are a democracy. The people can sleep knowing they can judge us on merit rather than fear at the ballot box. For we are committed to their rights when all others are not.\n\nIt has taken many years to reach this point, but perhaps now is a better time than never. Long live Britain, and god save the King!"

ENG_IT_Macmillan_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "England once again emerges onto the world stage. As a shadow of its former self. A nation no longer at the center of the world, no longer a dominant mover in world politics, but as a small nation making its first steps out from the shadows. One may expect England to be swamped by a turbulent sea of change and pulled back down into the depths. But England has been in this spot long ago, when the world was split between spheres of influence and a totalitarian dynasty ruled mainland Europe, and the tiny kingdom in the isles was an afterthought. And with some skillful maneuvering, one may find England as adept as it once was at claiming the spotlight..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_new_england_desc:0 "Forget everything you know about England! A nation merely a puppet of the German Reich? No longer! The spineless traitors who bend over backwards to Hitler to protect their property and pompous titles? They lost the election! The fascists who serve only as Germany's boot on Britannia's neck? They now are further from power than anytime after the war!\n\nUnited England's England is a country that strongly abhors any sort of Nazism. It will go out and reclaim England's greatness, and forge bonds both new and old. No longer do we cower in the shadow of Adolf Hitler, for we now look the nations of the world right in the eyes!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_dealing_with_cornwall_desc:0 "Outside Bristol is a barbed wire scar that cuts through the country and separates England from the South West Peninsula. Beyond it is Cornwall, a humiliation forced upon us by the Germans, partially to keep us in line, but also to keep a segment of England in eternal torment. One can see a painful reminder of what once was, and what might be.\n\nBut we are not the England of 1943. And we are no longer a nation that needs to have a sword of Damocles dangled permanently over its head. We will eliminate the garrison, and then secure our eternal freedom."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_hurt_them_deep_desc:0 "Halder's forces have been a nuisance for a long time. Any dream the reformists had was shot down because of fears of the garrison. Any sensible reform the reformists proposed was blocked by fear of the garrison. And if the garrison had not been there, we would be a democracy right now, with the UE working side by side with Auchinleck. The garrison will be removed. Out of personal vendetta, yes. But also, to force the reeling Reich to look at us with respect or face the prospect of another landing under the white cliffs of Dover."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_ruin_their_supplies_desc:0 "Intelligence reports from the war showed the rebels oftentimes infiltrated the garrison territory to conduct sabotage and assassination missions against the troops there. These reports detailed tactics, operations and infiltration methods to do these missions. And a lot of these reports were never shown to our gallant allies in the garrison.\n\nLet's pick up where the rebels left off. Destroying warehouses, sabotaging fuel tanks, even robbing railroad cars will deprive the Germans of the necessary materials to wage war against us. We may not be able to do anything as spectacular as burn Plymouth off the face of the earth, but a long campaign of attrition will hurt the garrison just the same."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_strike_their_heart_desc:0 "For the longest time, the garrison has contributed immensely to the suffering of the English people. Their forces have kept the island under threat for years. They have run a piece of English territory like an eastern Reichskommissariat, punishing the good people who live there. And they have stifled any hope that the England of old could be made again.\n\nNow, they collect their reward for their services."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_regaining_our_freedom_desc:0 "The entire formation at Cornwall was eliminated, destroyed by the people and military it was supposed to threaten and coerce. One of the most feared forces of the Heer, led by its most famed generals, now completely destroyed. And England no longer is threatened by any immediate threat on the isles.\n\nThe world has been shown now that England must be taken seriously. Its forces can defeat the Germans in open battle once again. And it has severed all of its old chains and bonds with the Pakt. We stand as a country reborn, a nation that is going to assert its freedom against all comers. And that opens some doors that were once believed tightly shut..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reaching_out_to_old_friends_desc:0 "The OFN has really been content to ignore us since the war ended. Or when they haven't ignored us, they've been providing guns to the communists and SAS. Now, the armed resistance has failed, and we have got the Germans off our back. Perhaps now is time for a reset in our relationship.\n\nWe will make clear we are the best chance England has now for a free future, one where people are no longer hounded by fascism, and have a high degree of liberty. We can be an extremely valuable member of the OFN, and slide into the role we once held when we were aligned together. It's time to make the calls."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_O'_Canada_desc:0 "Relations haven't been good with Canada lately. They refused to view us as anything other than a Nazi puppet state, which, let's be honest, we were. And our bondage prevented us from making any overtures to the Commonwealth. But now, we don't have the Huns on our back, so we can take advantage of this new state of affairs to rebuild our relationship with our oldest dominion. We can agree to an exchange of ambassadors and normalization of relations. Granted, our difference in monarchs may be an issue, but we do not seek to make them a colony again, only to have them see us as an equal on the world stage."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_cultural_exchange_desc:0 "Canada and the United Kingdom have long shared similar cultures to each other, as well as a fascination for the other's way of life. The war and occupation has temporarily stopped this cultural two-way, and we have gone off in a different direction than Canada has. Why not find out what the other is doing at the moment?\n\nWe must reintroduce the English culture to Canada. Their cities will host exhibitions by modern English artists. Their universities and libraries will be visited by English writers. And English musicians will tour their provinces. And we will gladly allow them to do the same. We will show them England is not in the cultural blight of fetishistic Aryan depictions like the rest of Northern Europe. And they will show us that Canada's culture was not purchased by American movie and record studios."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_help_me_help_you_desc:0 "Have an excess of wheat? Ship it over here! Loggers out of work? We'll buy it from you! Want some workers to help with your factory? Why not build it here? Need help with your chemical plant? We have a few things I.G. Farben left behind in the war that might help you...\n\nBy helping Canada with a variety of problems, we can help them overcome the various challenges that they may face. And once they realize they need England, they will be sure to extend their thanks through improved diplomatic relations."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_greatest_ally_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have seen many alliances of convenience take shape and dissolve through countless wars. One day, we align with the Spanish against the French, the next, we align with the French against the Spanish. Diplomacy is complicated, and oftentimes confusing. But in our recent history, when we were at our darkest moments, one country could be expected to come in and give their all against the enemies of freedom. And we must contact the United States to restore our grand alliance once more."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_propaganda_giant_desc:0 "America is a country with massive problems. Under the surface one will find a massive gap between rich and poor, rampant discrimination and racial violence, and a nation in permanent fear of being unable to defend itself from the Nazis or Japanese. Yet, you ask anyone outside the US what America is, and they will tell you it is a nation of tremendous opportunity, a melting pot of the cultures of the world, and a great protector of freedom. This is because for all the problems it has, America is tremendously good at selling itself on its good aspects.\n\nWe must set up some consultations with Madison Avenue, Hollywood, and the State Department. If they can convince the world and their own people that America is so perfect and strong, perhaps they can apply their skills to England as well. With some makeup and good lighting, we can make England's problems disappear as well."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_closest_cooperation_desc:0 "We are friends of liberty. WE stand against fascism in all forms, and will do our utmost to protect the world from it. We will not forget our international commitments either. And with that, we shall cooperate with the Organization of Free Nations. Our forces are ready to help the OFN where it needs it. Our diplomats will stand by the OFN when they must put pressure on other countries. And the OFN can be assured that one country in Europe stands by it in all things."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_land_down_under_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand have been about as far from our minds since the war as they are from London. They have in the meantime cut many of their ties with the former British Empire and are mostly concerned with fending off any Japanese encroachments. Their situation does not involve us in any way, but we will be sure to improve relations with them regardless.\n\nIt's clear they want a reset relationship, and we will give them what they want. They want us to see them as an equal, and we expect them to treat us as the legitimate government of England. Once this is out of the way, we can get along just fine."
ENG_IT_a_simple_game_of_cricket_desc:0 "England and Australia need to begin to rebuild their relationship. One that's more equal and respectful. And isn't sports where respect is earned?\n\nFor a long time, The Ashes were a series of test cricket matches held between Australia and England. Restarting the series will give both England and Australia something to watch, and may improve our respective attitudes towards each other. Television will make these matches more popular than ever before. And we can pitch our country in-between the breaks."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_restoring_old_trade_ties_desc:0 "England has vast industrial potential and a highly skilled workforce. Oceania has wool, mutton, and an amazing amount of raw minerals. It makes sense that we start trading once again. They send us the raw materials that we need, and the ships bring back the finished products they love. Everyone makes money off of this, and both our economies will boom with this trade going on."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_part_of_something_bigger_desc:0 "No more can England be considered a glorified Reichskommissariat. No more do people talk to Germania when they want to talk to London. And no more are we considered a non-factor in world politics. Things have changed, and changed tremendously.\n\nWe have made our return to the world stage. The spotlight is on us. And the audience awaits our next lines. Now we strike the music and begin to perform."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_undermining_the_reich_desc:0 "For far too long, England has been a slave to Germany. A puppet, forced to endure poverty, humiliation, and hardship. And all for the benefit of a few stuck-up barbarians who think a shaky linguistic interpretation of Sanskrit makes them a world conquering master race. Well, their dominion over the English isles is at an end! Now, we begin to take moves that will free us from our bonds with the Hun."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_placating_the_reich_desc:0 "Calm yourself, Germany. We only want a better relationship with you. One that's more equal. We've taken care of ourselves, haven't we? While you and the rest of Greater Germany were losing your heads, we were able to hold onto our position. We do not need any more assistance to stand on our feet. And this certainly doesn't mean we want to rush off and join the OFN, we're still thankful for your guiding hand during those awful years after the war. Now, if you could turn your attention elsewhere for a bit, that would be much appreciated..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_an_arms_deal_desc:0 "How do you show a nation you are committed to their foreign policy goals and are not a threat to them? By purchasing their arms, of course!\n\nWe will contact the Germans and ask if we can buy a bunch of their surplus weapons they no longer need after shooting the rest of the would-be Führers and their supporters. We don't really need the weaponry. But it can show we are acting in good faith, and improve Germania's opinion of us. It can also make Germany think we are potentially still their friend."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_visiting_the_overlord_desc:0 "A full Blitz of Germania is in order. One with aircraft taking off from England to disgorge their payloads on the city. And that payload is diplomats, ministers, officials, and various notables. Our delegation will contact everyone who is anyone in the city and convince them England is their friend. And this will calm tensions a lot. We certainly wish to continue our friendship of nations with Mitteleuropa! Surely nobody can deny our sincerity?"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_becoming_our_own_desc:0 "It's time to slip off the chains that have held us to Germany for so long. No longer will we rely on German parts and equipment. Goods in Germany can be produced at home as well. And we don't need their experts anymore. Our economic needs will no longer tie us to the Pakt. Instead, we will now produce what we need by ourselves, further reducing Germany's hold over us."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_distancing_ourselves_from_germany_desc:0 "Our close association with Germany has caused... problems that we would rather not have. Domestically, the people see us as their overlords chosen by the Reich from a pile of Quislings. And the outside world still sees us as the administration of another Reichskommissariat that has gotten too pompous and self-centered. We should change this.\n\nGerman organizations will be quietly removed. Consulates from the Pakt will be closed down to the absolute minimum. And any other reminders of our past relationship will be destroyed or pushed out of sight. Germany is no longer our overlord, and we will make ourselves look like the independent nation we are."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_false_friendship_desc:0 "Hitler said England was not his natural enemy. That the Netherlands and the Belgians could continue to exist peacefully. And that he desired nothing more than peace with his European neighbors. Some believed him. But one does not need any more evidence of the falseness of those statements.\n\nWe say Germany is our friend as well. They believe it. But our words are complete dross. We merely pretend to be their friends to prevent them from taking aggressive action against us. And one day, we might plunge the knife into their back, just like they did for so many others..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_but_a_profitable_one_desc:0 "Our past history with the Reich has been... troubled, but that does not change the fact that they are not only the largest economy on the Continent, but also wield control over practically all the other economies of the same landmass, with partial exception of the former Triumvirate members. As much as our citizens on the streets may object to and be suspicion of any interaction with the Germans beyond that strictly necessary to maintain the integrity and security of our nation, almost all our economists and business leaders are of one mind. We must open for and encourage trade with the Reich and its puppets if English productive forces are to thrive. The Reichsmark may be covered in blood, but that does not make its value less when exchanged for shiny new pound sterling."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_more_than_just_a_pawn_desc:0 "The support of the powers at be in the wider world has been very useful for Britain, especially since our nation can now truly live up to that name with Scotland back in the fold. Yes, the great powers have been valuable in their assistance, until now.\n\nBritain is not some backwater in the far reaches of the world, she is not a mewling pup of a nation to be cowed by the whips and whims of greater powers. Our path is our own, our course to be charted in the twilight of our age by British hand and British heart. Let the swastika and the stars battle for the heavens, Britain cares for them not. Thanks to Harold Macmillan, Britain will remain aloof from this Cold War now and forever."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_independence_secured_desc:0 "The days of empire are long past, and yet English ambassadors find that their calls to Washington and Germania are answered increasingly frequently. Our country's strategic position off of Europe's shore, while putting at risk from the Reich on the Continent and the Americans in Iceland, also presents us with a diplomatic opportunity. The Americans and the Germans want the honor of dancing with England alone; by dancing with both of them, we will remind them that England is a nation that deserves respect."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_bringing_wales_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The first nation on the Isles to be conquered by the ascendant Kingdom of England in the medieval age, Wales has long detested our supremacy, mounting a strong resistance against us - first through petty kings and rebellions, and then peaceful agitation. Unionist elements in Welsh society still exist, however, and they may be the key to peaceful unification. England and Wales will once again be one - this time hopefully without bloodshed."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_beginning_the_process_desc:0 "The Welsh have accepted our overtures! The path to peace and friendship between our nations lies open, and the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. We are one step closer towards the reunification of Great Britain and a resurgent United Kingdom!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_forcing_them_back_in_desc:0 "The Welsh, in their misguided pride and stubbornness, have rejected our offer. Unfortunately for them, we do not accept refusal. Great Britain will be whole again - and sacrifices must be made for it to happen."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_with_us_once_again_desc:0 "We have done it - Wales is back in the fold, and our goal of uniting the errant former kingdoms of Britain is nearly within our grasp. Welcome back, Welshmen! We are together once again."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_making_it_official_desc:0 "Even though Wales is, de facto, under our control, technically our nations are still separate. The reunification has made quite a legal mess, and we must sort it out before proceeding further - which is why we shall proclaim the Kingdom of England-Wales, standing proud and mighty for all the world to see!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reunite_with_survivors_desc:0 "When the Huns crossed the channel and set foot upon our fair land, the British Army resisted them on every step of the way. They fought on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets, they fought in the hills, and even though they were pushed out of England, they held the line in the North, in Scotland, and they never, ever surrendered.\n\nNow, as the German yoke no longer rests on the English neck, we shall welcome them back, one and all."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_quiet_unification_desc:0 "The situation has developed just as we had hoped - the Scottish government has accepted our offer. There will be no more bloodshed, no more pain - our heroes are coming back home, and all of Scotland with them."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_loud_refusal_desc:0 "We didn't think it would come to this, but reality has surprised us once again - Scotland will not return under the King's reign peacefully. We can speculate on what, or who, made them do this - socialists, foreign agents, nationalist agitators... In the end, it matters not.\n\nScotland will not last."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_together_at_last_desc:0 "As Edinburgh passes from the control of separatists and nationalists into our own hands, the United Kingdom, considered by many to be dead and forever lost to the annals of history, rises anew. Peace returns to the long-suffering island, one built to last. We have proven to all that Britain, however beaten and battered, still has enough strength to stand on its own!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_breaking_them_down_desc:0 "Nationalists, socialists, and other traitorous elements of Scottish society still seem to resist our benevolent rule. They attack our soldiers, loot the cities, and terrify our citizens. Their terrorist actions endanger the King's peace and cannot be tolerated!"

ENG_the_new_british_royal_armed_forces_desc:0 "Nobody is really prepared for a massive insurrection, especially one where a sizable number of our units and officers defect. Our men were forced to fight a difficult campaign against their own countrymen, who were armed and supported by major foreign powers. That we won in the end is a significant credit to the armed forces of England, but none of this excuses poor performance.\n\nWe may not want to hear it, but we underperformed in the Civil War. We will find out what went wrong, and fix it immediately. Our next enemy will not be a group of insurgents. And we cannot make mistakes when we face him."
ENG_consult_the_generals_desc:0 "The English Army has now been divided into two distinct doctrinal camps, both of which insist their strategy is the best to defend England is the best way to prevent a German incursion. As always, we really can only support one.\n\nOne faction of the Armed Forces insists a strategy of intense fortification is the way to fend off an invasion. By wearing the Germans down, they say, we would make the cost of an attack on England too much for the Reich. This is folly, say the others. England alone cannot withstand an invasion, we must seek aid from the OFN instead and get their help in our defence.\n\nMany have reservations about working with the ones who supported the rebels just a short while ago, but others say we do not have a choice in the matter."
ENG_never_another_sealion_desc:0 "The most shameful moment in the history of Britain came in 1943, when the first Fallschirmjäger boots touched English soil near Brighton. What came next were years of destruction, humiliation, shame, slavery, and death. We now know the consequences of defeat, and not a man in England will stand for such a disaster again.\n\nEngland held off invaders for 866 years before Sealion. We resolve to do much better than that this time around."
ENG_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "The largest navy in the world. An air force backed by advanced radar and Spitfires. A massive army using everything at its disposal and multiple lines of permanent fortifications. And the Germans still won. For years, a victimized island has asked "why?"\n\nWell, we'll figure out "why." We're going to get a team together to look through all the documentation of what happened in those fateful months, from British and German sources. We'll figure out just what went wrong, and where those weak links were. They won't be there next time, that's for damn sure."
ENG_a_smaller_but_better_force_desc:0 "The Army won't like it, but it's really the truth. We shouldn't put our efforts into making a massive and bloated defence force made up of every man in England. Rather, we should put our efforts towards making sure our military is as trained and equipped as possible. Our goal isn't to match the Huns on a manpower basis, it's to surpass them on a man-to-man basis. If our soldiers know what they're doing, and they have the tools to do it, it will make them as effective as a force ten times their number. And having a massive amount of fortifications to rely on will help them tremendously as well."
ENG_train_more_reservists_desc:0 "It's simple math, really. The Germans are going to be coming in with large numbers of men. If we don't put up a respectable number of men against them, we lose, and we don't have a respectable number of men to put against them.\n\nReservists must be called up and trained, and the manpower pool will be increased. Everybody that can do the grim task of defending our island from the enemy is going to do so. England expects that every man will do his duty, and they will."
ENG_defend_every_piece_of_land_desc:0 "Let us make it clear to the German that this is not the 1940s, and we are not some Eastern European agrarian backwater. This is England, where we stand ready to defend our land, and have the capabilities to back it up. Every schoolchild can recall our centuries of military triumphs, and we intend to wipe away the shame of 1943 with the blood of Nazi Fallschirmjägers and infantrymen.\n\nEvery beach will have a pillbox. Every field will be guarded by a machine gun nest. Every street will have an AT emplacement at the end of it. Every home will have a squad in it, and every barn will have a sniper in the hayloft. Any advance will take a heavy toll, and we'll see how many lives the Germans will now spend to take our island again."
ENG_strategic_redoubts_desc:0 "The concept of fixed defensive lines is something from the First World War, and quite honestly should stay there. Our defensive fortifications are not going to be thin rings of bunkers and barbed wire across the countryside. As Friedrich the Great once said, "he who defends everything defends nothing."\n\nRather, we will allow the Germans to make advances in select areas of England. The army hates the very idea, but it allows our forces to make stands in more defendable and extremely fortified locations. From there, they can hold off the Germans and make counter attacks as part of a mobile defence strategy."
ENG_simulate_an_invasion_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we are unable to enlist the help of the Wehrmacht in doing a version of their invasion to test our defences. Fortunately, we can do the next best thing. With our knowledge of German tactics and good estimates of their numbers, we can simulate their invasion in an exercise. Computers will help control for variability and other effects.\n\nThe aim of this war game is to test our strategies against an actual invasion. We will see any major flaws in our strategy, so we can correct them. Any successes will be noted as well, especially ones that we did not expect. With our pretend invasion, we will be much more ready for the real thing."
ENG_blow_up_the_panzers_desc:0 "Germany's strength is in their mechanized beasts. They stormed across Europe, sowing death and destruction wherever they went. Our Home Guard had scarcely any defence except jamming logs in their tracks and trying to pour sugar in their gas tanks. This was ineffective, and in many cases suicidal. To make it even worse, the new versions of the Panzers are more armored, better armed, and larger than any model we faced in the invasion.\n\nBut instead of immobilizing, what if we destroy them instead? It certainly is a concept worth putting effort into."
ENG_fortify_the_coasts_desc:0 "Knowing where your enemy is coming from is an incalculable advantage in a fight, and we know where the Germans are coming from; they're coming from the sea. This is a broad front, sure, but it means we can concentrate our efforts in defending a few critical areas and ports to prevent the enemy from sustaining a foothold.\n\nA series of barbed wire, land mines, and just plain fortifications are to be built across the coastline. These will offer our soldiers defendable positions to dig into and protection against enemy fire support. Sure, it sort of ruins the scenery, but we won't be able to enjoy England at all if it's under the jackboot."
ENG_radars_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "In this fight, we need every advantage that can be seized by us. We can create as many tactical and strategic advantages on England as we could, but there is still more that needs to be done. We must know the enemy, and not just be able to match him on paper.\n\nA series of radar stations in the southeast served our nation well in the last war, and they will be expanded in this one. We will see the enemy ships before they ever sight English soil. We will know when a flight of aircraft is coming to attack us well before they arrive over England, and we can listen to the enemy units from far away. When they attack, we will know, and we will be ready to meet them."
ENG_keeping_the_skies_clean_desc:0 "We will never be able to match the Luftwaffe in the air. That's a sad fact, but it's the truth. We lack the aircraft and pilots necessary to stop the enemy from coming over the countryside and attacking where they want. They still have to come over, and so we can make it hard for them.\n\nA series of anti-aircraft batteries unlike anywhere else in the world will make any journey over England fraught with danger. Cannons and missiles await at every potential target and over every route to it. If they want to attack, they have to face these defences. If they want to neutralize these batteries, they still need to attack. If they don't attack, they cannot win."
ENG_one_step_ahead_of_them_desc:0 "Something we English have always prided ourselves on is our intelligence system. We have placed a premium on finding out all we can about our enemies. Today is no different. MI6 must have people everywhere, throughout the Pakt, in order to find out what we can about an invasion.\n\nOur agents will give us everything we need. They will give us the codes and radio frequencies. They will give us the order of battle. They will give us the plans of the invasion force, and they will give us what's most valuable of all: a date."
ENG_work_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "Some won't admit it, but there is only one force in the world that can provide the necessary force to counter the German Reich. The Americans and their allies have the factories, they have the knowledge, and they have the technology to fight a war against the Hun. We do not.\n\nWe don't expect the Americans to trust us at first. They really have no reason to right now, since we defeated their proxy army a short while ago, but we can earn their trust by showing some of our own. We will offer to work together to show that we are serious about opposing the Reich's designs on our island. In time, they will come to see why our England fights for their cause as well."
ENG_meet_up_with_them_desc:0 "Getting into contact with the United States won't be easy. They have tended to ignore our government, and so have the rest of the OFN. This makes any direct contact with the American president impossible. However, there are some countries that are on speaking terms with us and the OFN, and also have an interest in making sure Germany's plans are frustrated.\n\nWe can send a diplomat to make contact with an American counterpart in a neutral ground, and have him inform the OFN of what we would like them to do. It'll be a tense, awkward conversation. If we can manage to have it, then we can convince them our needs align."
ENG_american_equipment_desc:0 "Everyone can agree that American military equipment is quite splendid. Everyone likes their tanks and infantry equipment, and agree their aircraft are some of the best in the world. Even better, we can get our hands on a bunch of it.\n\nAmerica will send us shipments of material for us to use against the Germans, with the hope we use it well. Some of it is surplus from the last war, but a lot of it is high-tech cutting-edge weaponry that our men will be pleased to use. The Army loves this idea, and will gladly outfit our forces with these weapons."
ENG_american_blueprints_desc:0 "American equipment is all well and good, but is it for the English soldier? We can't rely on foreign suppliers to keep our forces outfitted and supplied. With some technical help, we can guarantee that American weaponry with British characteristics will be used instead.\n\nThe US will send us the necessary blueprints to use for our defence industry, and to improve our domestically-produced weapons. Our generals may be disappointed in this, but British soldiers must have British equipment. The potential benefit to our national arms industry is enormous."
ENG_a_new_way_of_warfare_desc:0 "War has changed since the 1940's. Today's troops move faster, and have far more firepower at their disposal than they did back then. Now that our armed forces are unshackled, we need to catch up to the outside world, and our new friends can give us the skills to do it.\n\nMany books and reports on the recent, mobile actions in South Africa have been written in the United States, and are available in American military schools, and the State Department has agreed to give us their library card. These papers will go to Sandhurst, and every officer will be required to read about these developments, and to have familiarity with how things work in the wars of the present day."
ENG_lessons_from_the_empire_desc:0 "The deserts of Arabia. The jungles of Tanzania. The mountains of the Spīn Ghar. All terrains much harsher than one would find in Britain, and all places where the British Empire fought and won in living memory.\n\nOur empire gave us skills in handling the most extreme types of terrain. There still are men who remember the challenges and hardships these terrains pose, and the solutions they found to keep muddling through. Their knowledge of the worst the world threw at them will help our young men deal with the worst the island can throw at them."
ENG_a_pact_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "We need to recognise that Britain and the OFN have similar needs. We need American technology and equipment. They need bases from which they can get really up close and personal with Germany. Why not help each other?\n\nThey guarantee technology sharing and the occasional delivery of spare equipment for our forces. We can guarantee them bases for their men, and naval facilities to operate from. Everybody gets what they want, and it makes us all very happy. Let's see if they'll agree to this treaty."
ENG_ofn_naval_exercise_desc:0 "It's a sad state of affairs when Britain is not at the cutting edge of naval warfare. Feelings aside, we must recognise where we are. We need to do what is necessary to turn things around and get us back on top.\n\nThe OFN has offered to bring along some of our officers on a naval exercise in the Atlantic. Our men will watch the OFN practice the latest techniques in all aspects of naval warfare. They will bring back their observations and what they learned. This will help us catch up with the aspects of modern naval combat."
ENG_spy_on_the_germans_desc:0 "Of course, we aren't going to forget about the real threat to our country. They are nearby, and we can watch them prepare for the day they attempt to destroy us. However, their proximity and our intelligence apparatus give us a great opportunity to build rapport with the OFN.\n\nMI6 will begin sharing what we learn about Germany with the CIA. They will also feel free to request intelligence that we hold on the Third Reich. Our services will make us invaluable to the United States, and their capabilities will help MI6 in turn."
ENG_airbases_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "When we started planning our air defences in Southern England, we noticed a problem. Many of the airfields were good for the aircraft flying there the last time they were operational, but some experts from the United States believe they are woefully inadequate. For example, F110s and B-52s require longer runways than the P-51s and B-17s did. If we are to operate American aircraft on these fields, massive modernization must take place.\n\nWe will correct this oversight immediately. Construction will begin on longer runways and bigger hangers so we can have airfields that meet the standards for American aircraft. Our goal is to make the area as much a home for American aircraft as it was back during the war."
ENG_a_british_U2_desc:0 "In the last war, our pilots loved the de Havilland Mosquito as a reconnaissance platform. Fast, agile, and good at just about anything you could make it do, it was perfect for sneaking over enemy territory undetected and running off with valuable photos. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to work on something better. Thus, we aren't surprised when the Americans tell us their U-2 can travel higher, faster, and longer.\n\nThe Americans will lend us experts to help develop a U-2 that we can produce domestically and use to gather intelligence. If we end up with anything close to the performance of the U-2 and the value of the Mosquito, we will consider our model a smashing success."
ENG_american_advisors_desc:0 "Among other things the Germans were bad at, they failed to properly help out our military with advisors. It seems they just wanted us to soak up enough Scottish machine gun fire until the Übermensch could stroll through and win the day. Thus, we have had to rely on our own knowledge to keep our military in shape. The Americans are a lot more generous, however.\n\nUS Army officers will be embedded with our units to provide advice and best practices. Specifically, they will make sure our men are well drilled, our forces are disciplined, and our military efficiency is up to snuff. With their outsider perspective, we can make the British armed forces meet world class standards."
ENG_a_new_royal_navy_desc:0 "Drake's defenders of the Gravelines. Nelson's heroes of Trafalgar. Jellicoe's victors of the Jutland. A group of rusted hulks in the estuary. This is what the war and occupation has done to our navy.\n\nWe will rebuild our vessels. We cannot afford a fleet like the one we had when we had an empire and a roaring economy. Whatever we can afford, however, we will build. Britain's pride and honor demands it. More importantly, our survival relies upon it."
ENG_submarine_warfare_desc:0 "The last time Germany attempted to bridge a massive body of water, it took years and broke their economy in two. It was also less than half the width of the English Channel and nobody was shooting at them on the opposite side. It's safe to say they will be ferrying their men across by sea this time, which gives us an advantage.\n\nA few British submarines in the invasion force will allow us to cause unprecedented amounts of mischief and destruction. We can choke their supply lines, or sever them entirely, guaranteeing us a total victory in the land war. Thus, submarines will play an integral part in our Royal Navy."
ENG_protect_the_supply_lines_desc:0 "It's the same story, over and over again. Britain and Germany are at war. Britain relies on supply convoys from North America to survive. Germany decides they can win the war quickly and easily by just sinking the convoys. They haven't done it before, and we will make sure they won't do it this time, either. We're not going to just hope they sink another Lusitania or Reuben James.\n\nASW ships and destroyers will guard our convoys in the North Atlantic. Our route to the new world will be maintained and never break. We will go toe to toe with Germany's Kriegsmarine once again, and show them they still can't measure up."
ENG_rebuild_the_british_navy_desc:0 "Everything is ready. The technologies are researched. The blueprints are made. Now, we can begin the momentous task. A task that must be done, but a task every Englishman will be glad to take on.\n\nTo the yards, shipbuilders of Britain! We will lay a hull in every slipway, in every town, in every port! The isle will ring with the sound of smashing bottles and new ships sliding into the water! Recruiting stations from Dover to the border will be jammed with men who will sail the Atlantic on new, modern vessels! Let the Hun know that Britannia's charter grants it the seas, and we will defend the approaches to our land as much as the land itself!"
ENG_a_rebuilt_armed_forces_desc:0 "Then? A group of ceremonial units and militia with surplus weaponry. Now? A modern and efficient fighting force. Then? A group of half-sunk ships mothballed in harbors and estuaries. Now? A shining and magnificent fleet of patrol vessels and submarines.\n\nOne may be astonished at how we have quickly turned things around, but they don't know the tenacity of the Briton. We love our land, and are prepared to bore any hardship, make any sacrifice, to keep it. Now, we may rest comfortably that when trouble comes, our lads are capable of handling it."

ENG_ET_macmillan_A_lion_licking_his_wounds_desc:0 "It would be fair to say that the English economy has seen better days. The forceful dissolution of the United Kingdom has left England without colonies, without access to many trading partners, and bereft of much of our economic prestige which so bolstered our income previously.\n\nEngland did seem to recover somewhat in the aftermath of the war, as the early 1950's were a time of relative prosperity. Yet the collapse of the German economy dealt a blow to the fragile status quo from which it almost could not recover, we were left with massive debts and little way to effectively fund many of our vaunted institutions. Finally, the English Civil War caused immense amounts of destruction which we are still rebuilding from, but now England has stern leadership at her head once more. With luck we can put our past behind us."

The Americans may not trust us but they trust our money enough that they have risen to become our largest trading partner. Inter-Atlantic commerce with the Americans is booming and funding the rejuvenation of our nation, to the surprise of many.\n\nFor all that Germania is wounded by the Civil War which was waged across its heartlands, it is not a power which we can ignore by any means. The Germans are the largest holder of English bonds bar none, and no matter our desires we cannot afford at the present time to cease trade with a nation which could potentially collapse our economy at any time it chooses. We shall have tread carefully on this matter."

ENG_ET_macmillan_the_english_economy_desc:0 "Economically, England isn't doing as bad as it could be, given the poor circumstances we find ourselves in. In fact, given that we were recently in a civil war of epic proportions, it's amazing that our economy is functioning at all. Regardless, Reginald Maudling and Harold Macmillan intend to use the relatively clean slate that the aftermath of the conflict presents to make some reforms.\n\nThis will be a tricky prospect, as the issues we face are deeply ingrained into the way of life the average Englishman leads at the moment. Issues like low employment and low foreign investment compared to similar nations around the world being amongst the least of our worries. However, United England is a government of competence, and with their steady hand at the wheel England shall march forwards."

There was an era where the first and most powerful industrialised nation was England, when we ordered and half the globe obeyed our whims. The Second World War crushed that dominance so thoroughly that it is unlikely to come back in our lifetimes, perhaps not ever.\n\nEnglish industry in the present day is in something of a haphazard state of half-life, with factories shutting down seemingly weekly and unemployment rising like a growing tide. The English Civil War did not help matters whatsoever, with almost half as much destruction as the Second World War again being wreaked upon our industrial base. We must calm the workers, repair the factories and get the English industrial complex back in business."

With the Americans backing the talks, we'll likely find a more equitable agreement than anything we will get on our own.

It is only right therefore that our government enshrine some protections for the employees of all businesses, government and civilian alike in law rather than mere words alone.\n\nFrom this day forwards, the workers of England shall have a respectable minimum wage, cannot be forced to work beyond a certain number of hours without overtime and will have the right to take complaints against their employer on the subject of ill treatment or unjust firing to a commission. We shall also implement a more stringent series of workplace health and safety laws, combined these endeavours should greatly improve the lives of the average Englishman."
ENG_ET_macmillan_the_workers_health_act:0 "The Workers' Health Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_the_workers_health_act_desc:0 "A national healthcare service, as first suggested in the Beveridge Report so long ago during the Second World War, has been a promised benefit of the Royal Party for some decades now. Yet they never delivered, and so an opportunity arises for United England to make our own mark upon the histories.\n\nThe Workers' Health Act will provide covered hospital fees for all private hospitals and selected clinics across the nation for all persons without private health insurance. We cannot cover everything or every eventuality, but this basic service will quite literally save tens of thousands of lives over time. Should we implement it well, this Act will seal our immortality in the people's minds forever."
ENG_ET_macmillan_an_economy_to_serve_the_people:0 "An Economy to Serve the People"
ENG_ET_macmillan_an_economy_to_serve_the_people_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling is a man of the future, let none say otherwise. He has through will and dealing led a Liberal resurgence through the United England Party that most thought impossible after two decades of Royal Party domination. Now that he has proper influence over the matter of the economy however, he has some changes to make.\n\nThe economy is an ever changing, ever shifting morass of opportunity and the possibility of failure. Traditionally the goal was to ride the currents as best as the individual could, but now that a moral man leads England, it shall be the goal of the government to ride the tides for the good of all. A dawn rises, and it is a Liberal one that will provide salvation to all the people of England."
ENG_ET_macmillan_fair_education:0 "Fair Education"
ENG_ET_macmillan_fair_education_desc:0 ""Fair Education" A saying which is often headlined by the Maudling Government but rarely explained in detail. Well the time has come to actually get to the process of implementing the ideal, the basics of the proposal focus around lowering the cost of educating for the average Englishman and providing bonuses to higher education institutions for the training of more teachers of all varieties. In addition the Maudling government will sponsor the building of several dozen new public schools across England, to better offer the chance for our nation to improve academically.\n\nThe average person might not see much personal benefit immediately, but their children will grow up in an England where basic education is free, and perhaps that alone is worth all the effort."
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_education_costs:0 "The Lower Education Costs Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_education_costs_desc:0 "The Government has sent out the draft for an act set to pass Parliament sometime in the next few weeks, titled the "Lower Education Costs Act", LECA is a plan by the government to divert a substantial amount of funding to all aspects of education, effectively subsidising them in return for making their prices to the general populace substantially lower. For families who never sent their children to any school, let alone secondary or tertiary education this could make all the difference in the world.\n\nSome observers have noted however that nowhere within the text of the act is it stated "where" these funds shall come from. This has caused some degree of discontent, but most are confident in the Prime Minister's ability that they have made little fuss in public."
ENG_ET_macmillan_it_will_pay_in_the_future:0 "It Will Pay Out in the Future"
ENG_ET_macmillan_it_will_pay_in_the_future_desc:0 "The Royal Party, in their typical ignorance, question the wisdom of spending so great an amount on public education. What they really mean to ask is why we should give the "filthy commoners" the education that they will require to better themselves.\n\nThe answer is simple, plant no seeds in a field and you will have no control over what or how much you receive from it. Plant the seeds you want in the field, nurture and water them and you will reap the benefits from it for a lifetime and then some. The children of this generation are England's future, it's time we started treating them with the care they deserve rather than dismissing them for their birth or natural abilities. Maybe one day the next Einstein shall be English."
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_taxation:0 "Fair Taxation"
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_taxation_desc:0 "Do we really need to tax the poor so much? They don't actually own too great a percentage of the national wealth, most of which sits holed up in land value and the vaults of the aristocracy. We could cut some taxes on the more innovative businesses as well whilst we're at it, really help the English entrepreneurial spirit get going.\n\nThis shan't be so popular with some portions of our own party let alone the opposition, but what is the position of Prime Minister for if not to push through what needs to be done rather than sitting around and waiting for gold to fall from the sky? The people will thank us for sure, and is that not what matters when it comes time for elections?"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_income_tax:0 "Lower Income Tax Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_income_tax_desc:0 "The income tax has always been one of the more divisive aspects of English national policy, yes it works for generating revenue but the argument has been put forth that it stifles investment to some degree as well. United England cannot simply abolish the income tax nor do we wish to, but there are more ways than one to skin the proverbial cat.\n\nIf we reduce the income tax rate but only for the poorer elements of society and the richer persons who make a certain amount of investment in the economy over the course of the financial year we could well gain some popularity from the policy without betraying the principles it embodies. The business community will likely complain at first but they will see the light in time."
ENG_ET_macmillan_trade_will_pay:0 "We Will Pay It Through Trade"
ENG_ET_macmillan_trade_will_pay_desc:0 "Trade, trade is the lifeblood of England and, if the new taxation policies are implemented as stated it will quite likely be our main source of governmental funds as well. Foreign companies are chewing their hair at the possibility of missing out upon the English markets, and all we have to do to get them to contribute to our society is threaten to tax their ventures into the ground.\n\nMost of the time we wouldn't be making this threat openly of course, no it is a far more practical matter to simply leave the threat hanging. By doing this we stand to make more than a high income tax ever would in a hundred years, and we'll give the English people more jobs out of the deal to boot. It is a good day to be an Englishmen, yes indeed."
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_labour:0 "Modern Labour"
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_labour_desc:0 "Manual labour is a backbreaking task, somewhat literally in all too many unfortunate cases. Our economy once relied upon that sort of work, but now in the modern age we are beginning the transition to something greater, something better. The manufacturing of advanced materials and goods, services like banking and trading materials all across the globe. We even hold a surprising headstart in the production of materials used in computers.\n\nEngland moves forward with the times and shall never be stuck in the past where lords and the upper class ruled over all. Let them have their land and titles, they'll have nought else soon enough."
ENG_ET_macmillan_maudling_labour_act:0 "The Liberal Labour Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_maudling_labour_act_desc:0 "The "Liberal Labour Act" is a piece of legislation designed to aid England in better exploiting the circumstances we find ourselves in. When the mines are making less money than ever and most of our income once more comes from trading across the globe as we did in the height of the Empire.\n\nThe Act will when put into effect subsidise foreign companies seeking to invest in our markets and subsidise further the English companies looking to build foreign connections. With this Act we shall create enough jobs for the majority of our remaining unemployment to if not go away entirely then at least be mitigated significantly. It'll even be competitive, a truly modern masterpiece of business and care. The people however, will be the ones who get the profits."
ENG_ET_macmillan_looking_to_the_left:0 "Looking to the Left"
ENG_ET_macmillan_looking_to_the_left_desc:0 "The Left was once in the political doghouse under the Royal Party, but with United England growing steadily more liberal the once outsiders seem remarkably decent allies in the current circumstances.\n\nIf we throw in a few passages about granting more workers' rights and cracking down on abuses of power by bosses we can probably get the newly reformed leftist parties onside outright. Having allies on all sides makes it far easier to pass legislation than being limited to those we cannot fully trust after all. We should be careful to not grow too reliant though, hobbled from the once mighty powerhouse of Labour the current leftist parties might be, but by no means does that make them any less dangerous should we double cross them on something important."
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_liberal_economy:0 "A Liberal Economy"
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_liberal_economy_desc:0 ""Liberal", once a term derided by the Royal Party but nurtured in secret and kept alive despite efforts to crack down upon us. Well now we stand at the precipice of a new era, a Liberal era of peace and most especially prosperity.\n\nThe people and the businesses have never had it better, nor for that matter have the upper classes though they'd never say it out loud. A Liberal Economy for a Liberal nation that if we are fortunate will continue long after our own bones are nought but dust in some dingy crypts. For this we must thank Macmillan as well, for without him we'd have never gotten this far, perhaps one day the world will know the full story. For now though, let us relax in the glorious future which awaits our children, a Liberal future."

ENG_PT_thatcher_a_young_face_for_an_old_system_desc:0 "The English people have rejected stagnation and lunacy in favor of victory! Victory for themselves, victory for their nation... and victory for us.\n\nThe history books will doubtless describe Margaret Thatcher as the first female Prime Minister, but that alone cannot be her legacy. Many refuse to place their trust in a young woman, even one as tenacious as Thatcher, but it is time for drastic change. The stuffy old men who reject leadership shall be left behind in the dirt as the Royal Party hauls England to greater heights. Soon, Thatcher will be a figure of authority for all the world to see."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_ladys_speech_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher must face the English people not as a candidate, but as a Member of Parliament, as the leader of the Royal Party, and most importantly as their Prime Minister. She is to deliver a steely yet brief speech before the black door of 10 Downing Street as the press scramble to take pictures and hurl questions. It is not just the English but the whole world who will witness this speech - and as she well knows, first impressions are the most important."
ENG_PT_thatcher_edward_abdicates_desc:0 "The recent elections were surprising in many ways, not least that they occurred at all. But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"
ENG_PT_thatcher_king_henry_takes_the_throne_desc:0 "Edward's abdication does leave us in a bit of a pickle in regards to whom the next monarch shall actually be, the former King having no heir of his own blood. Obviously the American puppet Elizabeth cannot be allowed to accede to the throne, but there is yet one Windsor from the children of George V left untainted by incompetence.\n\nHenry the Duke of Gloucester has remained out of the political spotlight for the past decades, ignoring both our and his niece's government in favor of charity work. He is our only legitimate successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. The former King aside, the Windsors are a reliable family after all."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_crown_falls_silent_desc:0 "It seems that England cannot catch a break on the matter of its Kings. Whilst travelling back from a charity function, His Majesty Henry IX suffered a debilitating stroke that has rendered him bedridden. Despite our hopes, doctors have informed us that the King will leave hospital care as a quadriplegic - hardly in any condition to rule the country!\n\nThis is a disastrous situation, but as a nation we are capable of recovering from it. Our first action now should be to decide who shall act as His Majesty's regent, and from there consult the line of succession. If our current luck holds, we will be in need of its guidance sooner rather than later."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_prince_regent_desc:0 "William the Prince of Wales is a rather sensible lad. Young but not overly so, and more importantly agrees with us on the matter of England's ideal government - to a greater degree than his incapacitated father, even. This is good, as the Prince will assume his position relatively soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent of England, primarily substituting for His Majesty in his supposed appearances within England and without. We ought to be thankful to some extent; regency will help immeasurably in acquainting the young prince with the duties of a King."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "King Henry IX, a noble man of strength, virtue, determination and duty shunned by most, has breathed his last. With his death marks the passing of His Majesty George V's last child, furthermore prompting the accession of England's seventh monarch this century.\n\nAll Hail King William V, who has borne the duties and burdens of the Crown. Only a strong hand can marshal the nation's strength in these troubling times, and the new King will assist our government in keeping such will at our policies' forefronts. Fortune willing, he shall reign for many decades yet - perhaps even reign over Britain reborn. But whatever changes the world's turning shall brook, England shall forever shout:\n"God save the King!""
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_discord_may_we_bring_harmony_desc:0 "The upper echelons of society have had strong ties to the Royal Party since before the tragedy that was the English Civil War. In its aftermath, however, even the nation's elite have been thrown in chaos. If we are to change the direction of England for the better, we should reconcile with the minority responsible for sustaining governments and keeping parties alive. Perhaps it is time we weighed our options..."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_speech_blitz_in_london_desc:0 "Many still believe that public oration is a task fit only for a male, booming voice. To put paid to this laughable assertion, Prime Minister Thatcher will sweep London with a blitz of speeches aimed at the country's elite and privileged. Royalists, aristocrats, giants of industry... the Iron Lady's own voice will make sure they understand her own government's place for them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_aristocrats_know_nothing_about_england_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher has decided to unleash her inner populist. The Prime Minister will begin to challenge the elite of the nation, accusing them of engaging in corruption and harboring disdain for the average citizen. While the Royal Party will protest against this rhetorical direction, it is a message for the people - and the people will hear it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_and_who_are_you_that_i_must_bow_so_low_desc:0 "In a move certain to infuriate the upper ranks of the Royal Party, Thatcher will openly attack powerful members thereof with strong ties to the government. The common people will love this, viewing it as a brave stance against elitism and the influence of unelected figures in our broken system. It will be a display of loyalty towards the citizens, and spite towards the elite."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_workplace_corruption_act_desc:0 "As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. If the people are to be convinced of our populist struggle against the elite, we must prove that we are willing to act upon it. The Workplace Corruption Act will fight against corruption benefiting the rich and powerful within the workplace, from nepotism to insidious backroom deals. Naturally, their confusion at our behavior will twist into fury, but this will only benefit us in the long run."
ENG_PT_thatcher_looking_in_the_new_industries_desc:0 "The growth of cutting-edge sectors these last few years, in particular computer engineering, have introduced the world of business to young, fresh-faced CEOs - polar oppsites of established captains of industry. Thatcher can easier envision herself working hand-in-hand with England's new nouveau riche than with the staid men decades their senior in wealth, influence, and above all corruption."
ENG_PT_thatcher_calming_the_old_guard_desc:0 "As the Prime Minister expected, our current populist course of action has sparked fury amongst the Royal Party's Old Guard, whose cries of protestation have since transformed into anger. In order to placate these esteemed gentlemen and secure their tenuous support, Thatcher will quell their fears through private conversations at times and places of their choosing."
ENG_PT_thatcher_we_must_learn_to_work_with_everyone_desc:0 "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will present an open hand for the country's elite to hold onto, allowing them influence in the direction of the Party. We will appease their desire for power while simultaneously utilizing their usefulness through such display of friendship. Unfortunately, the average citizen will take our two-facedness regarding the Old Guard Royalists with scorn, but it is the direction we must take for the sake of stable, efficient government."
ENG_PT_thatcher_dining_with_the_high_class_desc:0 "Thatcher shall meet with members of the upper class aristocracy throughout England in an attempt to align their support towards the Royal Party. Rather than expensive, overbearing wastes of time, the Prime Minister instead sees in the gentry's dinners and balls opportunities to befriend and glean information from her new allies."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_meeting_in_liverpool_desc:0 "The support of the aristocracy is not enough. In a meeting room in Liverpool, the Prime Minister will meet with giants of industry and powerful magnates to earn their cooperation. If they are willing to listen to the government's terms, then we shall be happy to negotiate policy with them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_business_protection_act_desc:0 "Soon to be passed by Parliament, the Business Protection Act will deliver definite tax breaks for certain businesses and open exploitable loopholes for the rest. Though we are presenting this bill as another step towards revitalizing the English economy, the public will not be as convinced of its benefits as the elites and Royalist Old Guard who helped draft it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_talking_to_the_people_desc:0 "It is inevitable that the public will view the Business Protection Act as the government bending to the will of the omnipotent Elite. To prevent such negative conceptions from taking root among our voters, Margaret Thatcher will engage in earnest dialogue with them via all known mediums at the government's disposal. A good word may just mean the difference between idle grumbling and bloody protest."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_error_may_we_bring_truth_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher finds her career teetering atop a knife's edge. On one end, the Old Guard of the Royal Party despise her for what she is: a woman of humble origins daring to assert her power. At the other end lies the Opposition, who absolutely despise her for what she does - that being, everything they wouldn't.\n\nPolitics is a game of balance, power and popularity. The Prime Minister will strengthen her support and power bases before it's too late."
ENG_PT_thatcher_but_where_to_focus_desc:0 "The future of Thatcher's policy lies before her, splitting off into two distinct directions. She can either focus her energy on expanding her support within the Royal Party, or striking the Opposition and crushing its relevance and popularity. Perhaps, if she is lucky, she could achieve both..."
ENG_PT_thatcher_targeting_the_opposition_desc:0 "United England is a cluster of wet traitors, while the lunatic thugs of the National Front can barely string a sentence together without exploding into fascist rants. The Opposition parties must be dealt with, their reputation shredded and scattered to the wind - and Thatcher will strike them where it hurts."
ENG_PT_thatcher_would_you_care_to_answer_some_questions_mauding_desc:0 "The Right Honorable Reginald Maudling is a different kind of politician from the rabble of United England. Unlike the staunchly conservative Macmillan, Maudling flaunts his liberal leanings. Unlike the treacherous Powell, Maudling stayed with England during the Civil War. Exposing his party's weaknesses is only a matter of asking him questions pertinent to his steadfastly-held ideals - specifically, ideals whose utterance may invoke a dissimilar reaction from some of his own partymen."
ENG_PT_thatcher_cracking_the_UE_desc:0 "We have discerned from Maudling that United England is united only in name. A deep chasm has opened up between the two rival factions within: the conservative Macmillanists and Maudling's liberals. Exploiting this weakness by sowing the seeds of division - bribes, rumors, blackmail - will let the party collapse into petty infighting, all while the public watches aghast at seeing their representatives stoop so low in broad daylight."
ENG_PT_thatcher_blaming_the_NF_for_our_problems_desc:0 "The sheer incompetence of the National Front makes them our easiest target. These fascists were overwhelmingly rejected by the English public during the elections, and their leadership is rife with infighting between the dying Chesterton's 'English Fascists' and Jordan's insane 'English National Socialists'. By pinning all problems in English politics and English society as a whole on the National Front, the people's fury will shift from us to a most convenient scapegoat."
ENG_PT_thatcher_question_time_in_parliament_desc:0 "Prime Minister's Questions is approaching, and it looks set to be the most dramatic one of Thatcher's premiership. United England are furious with our actions, and the National Front's hatred towards us has increased tenfold.\n\nThatcher, however, is an orator and debater of considerable merit. Let's see what these fools have to throw at the Iron Lady."
ENG_PT_thatcher_clearing_the_way_desc:0 "The Old Guard of the Royal Party consider Margaret Thatcher to be little more than a puppet dancing to their tune, but they may have miscalculated. The power of the Prime Minister is not to be scoffed at, and Thatcher will use her new-found power to her absolute advantage."
ENG_PT_thatcher_new_young_faces_in_the_party_desc:0 "Some of the men in our Party are well past their prime. To appeal to the masses, perhaps it would be wise to replace the older (and more rebellious) Royalists with younger parliamentarians. These fresh-faced politicians would likely be ardent Thatcherists - by pure coincidence, of course."
ENG_PT_thatcher_explain_it_to_the_higher_ups_desc:0 "The Old Guard demand explanations for the sudden removal of older politicians in favor of younger, loyal Royalists. Expecting such protestation, Thatcher has prepared a convincing excuse: those removed had clandestinely supported Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance."
ENG_PT_thatcher_shaking_up_the_party_desc:0 "It is time to end the influence of the Old Guard. The Prime Minister will dramatically shake up the Royal Party by firing its most elite members on accusations of HMMLR sympathies, replacing them all with ardent Thatcherites who will abide by her every word and hence establish true government unity."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_annual_party_meeting_desc:0 "The Royal Party is preparing for their annual meeting, and the Old Guard are naturally furious at their leader for her recent actions. If the Prime Minister is to increase her support within her party, she must demonstrate the ability to prove her worth before her detractors."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_doubt_may_we_bring_faith_desc:0 "Many of England's citizens remain distrustful of the Royal Party despite its clear-cut victory last election, to say nothing of their own Prime Minister. By no means are we ignorant of the ugly wounds the war had left on Englishmen's trust; regardless, stitching them is a must if we plan on bringing the country back to its feet."
ENG_PT_thatcher_touring_the_nation_desc:0 "The solution to our unpopularity is obvious: a grand tour of England to rally support for the Royal Party, by meeting those we strive to serve Margaret Thatcher will initiate - and obtaining some excellent photo opportunities along the way."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focusing_on_the_poor_north_desc:0 "The north of England, as ever, is rife with the apathetic and anti-Royalist working class. To obtain their trust and support, Thatcher must talk to the common northerner and entice them with grandiose promises."
ENG_PT_thatcher_speak_up_and_judge_fairly_desc:0 "As a conservative Christian woman, Margaret Thatcher understands the nuances and power of faith, and how it can rally the masses together. Securing the trust of the working classes will require giving them such faith - that is, faith in a brighter future."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focusing_on_the_rich_south_desc:0 "While southern England generally supports our aims, apathy remains rampant among much of its voter base. We must cultivate a culture of Royalist support among the southerners, and to do so requires earnest, continuous display of support from the government."
ENG_PT_thatcher_money_in_the_bank_and_a_vote_in_the_ballot_desc:0 "Merely touring the South will not suffice for a prosperous, thriving Royal Party. We could secure greater funding from the public if we increased our propaganda initiatives in rich areas of the South and appealed to their cultural sensibilities."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_next_desc:0 "The tour continues, but Thatcher must soon decide on how best to proceed with her campaigning: should she present herself to the media, or to the people directly?"
ENG_PT_thatcher_media_blitz_desc:0 "Fully utilizing modern mass media technology will allow us to reach almost every ear in the country. With her usual oratory wit, the Prime Minister will give numerous interviews and announcements through the telly and the radio, additionally saving us precious hours otherwise spent meeting citizens in person."
ENG_PT_thatcher_permanent_campaign_desc:0 "By design, modern politics eschews entertaining weak-willed men content to campaign only in a prescribed season of a prescribed year.

Are you sure you want to?\n\nAh, now you're investigating us. Funny, seems we have evidence that you own the Communist Manifesto along with stacks of lewd American magazines. We "planted" those?

Now the initiative is ours, and they will be shattered to bits. Any libelous newspaper they wish to print? Kindling. MPs speaking against us in public? Sedition.

To think that some envision us as Marxists!\n\nAll shall be resolved in quick measure. We are more than happy to pull favors for the old money that helped build up this country, as are we to the outside companies who so generously invested in this rising power. They will be assured that we aim to provide for the poor no more than the most basic of assistance, for we are nothing if not proponents of individual effort.

We have already significantly weakened them, but their corrupt bosses will always try to claw back to dominance if we do not entirely do away with their organizations. Enter the Unions Act.\n\nOnce it passes, a union will be entirely illegal. No man shall grow wealthy by funneling their hard earned wages into a bloated bureaucracy. Without this theft, unions will flounder to nothing. Anyone found guilty of trying to organize their co-workers (or rather, take advantage of them) shall not only be fired, but immediately tried for sedition and menacing. We know how such "organizers" operate, and we shall treat them in such vile ways as they have treated workers.

We must recognise that a similar situation may still develop, and that we must do whatever we can to prevent it.\n\nEvery block must have a police officer to remind the people the law is never far away. Every street must have a camera to see what our officers do not. And every town must have people ready to enforce the law and stamp out any dissidents before they take root.

Why, expand their ranks and increase their pay of course!\n\nAt least, that's one way of thinking. While we would like to fund everything to the max, the economy's tepid shape precludes us from doing so for now.

Nowadays, our police officers find themselves confronting criminals armed with weapons much like the HMMLR terrorists used in the Civil War. We should consider arming our officers to meet this threat.\n\nMilitary equipment will give our officers the tools to handle any problem, and provide a degree of intimidation as well.

Lawbreaking has thus been rampant in certain sections of our country.\n\nThe solution is simple. If there are too many crimes for the police to handle, we add more police. Clamping down on crime is a lot of work, and it needs a lot of people to do it. More officers mean the reach of the law is far longer than it once was."

MI5 needs to be streamlined. To catch its prey, it must be fast and agile. It needs to do more, and to do them quickly. The result will be enhanced security, and enhanced counterespionage.

These changes are in no way an attempt to impose a police state on the good people of England.\n\nDecent citizens have nothing to complain about. None of these measures are intrusive, at least, not compared with the alternative. Would they prefer, crime, violence, and terrorism to some extra police and security cameras?

The remaining fascists in our country are a black stain on British society; like a good wife, our Maggie knows how to rub out stains.\n\nWe will introduce the Anti-Fascism Act in the House of Commons. The bill will make professing fascist identity a criminal offense. It will become illegal for fascists to speak in public, but that will be the least of their worries since all known fascists will be thrown in the clink. Macmillan will be delighted, and out nation will be stronger than ever.\n\n§RThis is hardly democratic now, is it?§!"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_dreams_of_an_empire:0 "Dreams of an Empire"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_dreams_of_an_empire_desc:0 "Does anyone remember life before the war? Thatcher does. She remembers when Mother England held a quarter of the Earth in her embrace. The jewel of India, the jungles of Africa, the wealth of Hong Kong, and the clement West Indies. Thatcher remembers it all. She dreams of a day when it will all be hers, ours, again.\n\nYet the Empire was shattered in just 5 years. It will hardly be easy to reclaim it, especially from our position of relative weakness. She will have to be patient and clever if she wants to reclaim Britain's birthright. Let's get to work."
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_love_live_britain:0 "Long Live Britain"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_love_live_britain_desc:0 "At long last, Albion is one! The perfidious Welsh, the treasonous Scots, all have been returned to their rightful place in a united Great Britain. Union Jacks fly from Cornwall to Clydesdale. God Save the King rings out from Belfast to Birmingham. Our homeland in its entirety bows to one sovereign once more!\n\nIt's all thanks to the wise leadership of good ol' Maggie. She steered England through the turbulence of the Civil War to mastery over the Isles. She expelled the treacherous Hun. She freed the refugees in Scotland. Most importantly, she united Parliament behind her glorious agenda. She is the great helmswoman of the new Britain, and she alone knows what its future holds.\n\n§RDoesn't she?§!"

ENG_MT_thatcher_army_reforms_desc:0 "The English Civil War exposed many problems with our country, the Royal Army included; in some battles, its performance was lackluster at best. In many cases its methods and equipment have barely progressed since the end of the Second World War.\n\nIt is imperative that we learn from our mistakes, and reform our army so that it will be sufficiently prepared for any future engagements. However, we must also keep in mind the prejudices harbored by senior officers who would prefer a return to the grand old army that lost us against the Germans in the first place."
ENG_MT_thatcher_offensive_efforts_desc:0 "By the War's end, the Army faced numerous issues in dealing with stubborn rebel holdouts. As a result of these failings, we lost far more good soldiers than we needed to. All of the issues with our current offensive capabilities have been made glaringly clear, and they will have to be fixed if our men are to stand a chance of surviving their next offensives."
ENG_MT_thatcher_armed_police_desc:0 "Our army needs more men. Unfortunately, the Civil War drained us of them. We will never be able to properly defend England from invaders unless we address this shortage - one which our boffins might just address.\n\nBy incorporating the police as an integral part of our homeland defence, we can greatly increase the amount of reserves available to the army whilst ensuring better security within our border."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_spec_ops_desc:0 "Training professional soldiers specially trained in asymmetrical warfare would make invading England a much harder task than it currently is. These new Special Forces would be an effective use of our limited resources, in contrast to sending our men to proverbial meat grinders. We should learn from our mistakes, not replicate them on a larger scale."
ENG_MT_thatcher_chieftain_tank_desc:0 "We need to supply our armed forces with new, up-to-date tanks to compete with other would-be opponents. Focusing on the development of the promising Chieftain Tank should be our priority if we are to achieve this goal. This valuable addition to the Army's stores will help us stand toe to toe against even the most advanced armor the rest of the world has to offer."
ENG_MT_thatcher_fv432_apc_desc:0 "Producing tanks may seem like a good idea on the surface, yet the fact of the matter is that we merely do not have the resources, nor the industrial capacity, to spare for such lumbering hulks.\n\nArmored personnel carriers, particularly the encouraging FV43 design, are better and cheaper alternatives to the expensive and ineffective tanks we would otherwise produce. We must be honest with ourselves; tanks may be a prestigious addition to our military, but it would be irresponsible to believe that we could manufacture enough to genuinely threaten the likes of the Germans."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_royal_marines_desc:0 "England has always prided herself in her brave and able Royal Marines. In the days when Britannia ruled the waves, a feared and noble force in equal measure. Reinvigorating our Marines will not only increase the overall strength of our armed forces, but also restore some of the old esteem our army once held. After all, we were powerful once. Why not use our history to restore our rightful place in the present?"
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "What we need is firepower, plain and simple. We can hearken back to the past all we like, but that will not help us as much as modern artillery would. New self-propelled guns will give us a huge advantage over our enemies, as well as providing our army with the means to rain salvos upon them with the maneuverability and accuracy they desperately need. The more of these we order, the better."
ENG_MT_thatcher_military_industry_desc:0 "Our military industry is somewhat lacking at the moment. Weapons manufacturing is inefficient and our army is suffering because of it. We need to focus on increasing the volume of our production, thus upscaling our military greatly.\n\nBy producing more guns, more aircraft and more armor, we will be able to take the fight to our opponents."
ENG_MT_thatcher_defensive_efforts_desc:0 "Now that all the rebel guns have been silenced throughout England, we now have time to properly prepare our country's defences. Yet there is still much to be done before fair Albion is amply defended from its foes. We will have to make several decisions, but whatever we choose to do we must be certain that it will keep our people safe.\n\nThe defence of our homeland must be prioritised before anything else. Not for nothing is "Never another Sealion" a slogan shared by Englishmen regardless of politics."
ENG_MT_thatcher_elite_army_desc:0 "We shall take steps to turn the Royal Army into the most well-trained and organized of its kind on Earth. Shaping the Royal Army into an elite, world class force will incur some hefty costs, but the strength they entail will soon be worth the sacrifice.\n\nThe country needs an army flexible enough to contain any invader, to protect its borders and safeguard the people."
ENG_MT_thatcher_trench_training_desc:0 "If England is ever invaded again, we will have to be prepared to hold fortified positions to stop any attackers in their tracks. Entrenching ourselves in static positions would ensure that the Germans would have a harder time fighting us should they dare invade a second time.\n\nThis worked for us to some extent in the Great War, so why should we not refine it for the modern age? It would certainly be a cheaper method than training all of our soldiers to an impossibly high standard."
ENG_MT_thatcher_artillery_equipment_desc:0 "Our army experienced a constant shortcoming of available firepower many times in the Civil War. Bringing our artillery up to a modern standard would improve the strength of our army no end, and gives us a key advantage over our opponents.\n\nUltimately, our army needs heavy weapons more than it needs better infantry."
ENG_MT_thatcher_small_arms_equipment_desc:0 "Improving our ineffective infantry should always be our utmost concern. The Army will last in protracted combat only as long as its men. Hence we will prioritize offering weapons and skills necessary to defend England alongside the King's shilling.\n\nEvery man must learn to fight to the best of his ability, in case total war comes a-knocking in our lifetimes."
ENG_MT_thatcher_anti_air_equipment_desc:0 "One of the most terrifying aspects of Sealion was the extensive, ruinous damage done by the Luftwaffe's bombers. Now their air raids have been made even more destructive thanks to new technology, and their fighters still outclass our own.\n\nWe have no choice but to build additional anti-air emplacements across the country. Only then shall our cities and airfields be sheltered from the Luftwaffe's fell talons. This may seem to be an overly pessimistic view to some; then again, they're better off safe from aerial bombardment than submerged in sorry and rubble."
ENG_MT_thatcher_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The best way to defend England is to defend its coast. Sealion demonstrated many of our failings in that regard, least of all our overreliance in the Royal Navy. Swept aside by the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, our sinking ships could but only watch helplessly as Germans scale Dover's pristine cliffs.\n\nBy necessity, Englishmen must be quick to adapt. Thus the way forward lies with emplacements keeping watch over every grain of sand on England's shores. More fool the man who dares assail an impregnable island fortress."
ENG_MT_thatcher_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "After months spent rectifying the flaws in our antiquated equipment and tactics, we can finally begin the laborious process of integrating them into the armed forces' modernized doctrines. The English Army will have clear plans in place for any future war, ones which guarantee swift victory against the hubris of would-be conquerors. Our people can now rest well with the knowledge that their homeland is again protected by a mighty bulwark, oaken or steely - and should it find use in the future, without the weaknesses that had doomed its predecessor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_navy_desc:0 "Today the Royal Navy is a shadow of its former self. This was not the case a mere generation ago; then it was the very symbol of the British Empire's power and majesty, securing its expansive waters and protecting its every subject wherever corner of the globe they set foot upon.\n\nAlas, much of it now exists only as scrap metal in Davy Jones' Locker - and in the hearts of those who yearn for a past unjustly ended. Our newfound largesse in mind, they insist that the time has come to remind the world of an old English paean's lines:\n\n"Britannia rules the waves!""
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_focus_desc:0 "The introduction of aircraft carriers signalled a paradigm shift in modern sea power. Where before control of vital sea lanes were decided by burnished rows of becannoned special treatment steel, the Second World War proved that even the mightiest battleships were fatally humbled by torpedo salvos from planes a bare fraction of its size. Thus every superpower worth the title now possesses aircraft carriers, ever vital for projecting their strength thousands of miles from their shores.\n\nAircraft carriers are key to bringing the Royal Navy into the post-war era, no matter what some maimed sea dogs clamor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_screen_ships_desc:0 "Our new carrier will require adequate protection once it leaves its berth. Far be it for us to leave a floating island worth 3 million pounds unprotected.\n\nHence, MoD has ordered several cruisers from our shipyards. These and the carrier will soon form the crux of the new Royal Navy - and a well-protected one, at that." 
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_support_ships_desc:0 "A carrier can not sink an entire navy on its own, much as we would prefer so. It needs an ample complement of vessels capable of contributing firepower to the fleet it's assigned.\n\nIn its prescience, the Royal Navy's budget for the year included new cruisers and submarines: ships very much built with firepower in mind. With these we can prove, should the occasion arise, that England can match its foes toe-to-toe in the open sea."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_ship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nThe Royal Navy's strength will increase manyfold after its commission, along with England's global reach. All creatures of sky and sea will learn that the Royal Navy shall soon return to its rightwise berth high above them."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Britain has always prided itself on its battleships, the greatest of which were the jewels in the Royal Navy's coronet. They were the behemoths that protected our seas at Jutland, and valiantly fought the Axis until they could no longer stay afloat.\n\nSome within MoD openly harbor an obsession over 'modernizing' Britain's most noble institution, and insist on constructing floating airstrips over the legacies of Nelson, Fisher and Jellicoe. Pure folly of course: the English people needs pride and prestige, not staid attempts at progress.\n\nAnd a mighty battleship has pride and prestige aplenty."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_screen_ships_desc:0 "We must make sure our new battleship will be well protected. England at this stage, if ever, can ill afford its fleet's latest pride sharing the Hood's fate in the future; with the leaps submarine technology have enjoyed as of late, it may well do so in the event of a shooting war.\n\nHence, the Royal Navy has procured several ASW-capable destroyers which will see service within the next decade."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_cruisers_desc:0 "As its firepower is sadly limited, our battleship will need several cruisers to help support it. They may not be as prominent as a battleship, but they will nevertheless form an indispensable part of the Royal Navy's fleet. Any adversary will think twice before drawing the torrential ire of our battleship and cruisers' shells."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest capital ship. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nOne dissenting soul, however, raised a unique dissention during the planning phase. Rather than building one ginormous battleship, he said, the Royal Navy would be better served adopting in part the late Admiral Jellicoe's vision: two battlecruisers, less armed and armored but more agile than a lumbering battleship,\n\nWhichever option we choose, England's oldest bulwark will assuredly see its presence known once more."
ENG_MT_thatcher_naval_doctrine_advances_desc:0 "Having commissioned the ships just recently leaving drydock, the Royal Navy can now prioritize planning how best to use them at sea. This entails extensive revisions to its existing battle plans and tactics.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made however, it won't be long before the reinvigorated Royal Navy revisits a sliver of its mythical past. Sally forth from old England's channel, hearts of oak, and with your foghorns sound Britannia's return as a power without peer!"
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_airforce_desc:0 "Ever since its disastrous performance in the Second World War, the Royal Air Force has been left to wither and rot in decripit airstrips across England. A sorry state indeed for an armada thought beyond its time before the Luftwaffe tore it to shreds.\n\nIn agreement with the Ministry of Defence, the Thatcher administration pleges to rebuild the RAF into a state worthy of protecting England's heavenly main. It will hopefully do better than it had in 1943 after all is said and done."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_programme_desc:0 "Disposing slow, ungainly, and antiquated fighters is part and parcel of securing England's skies. In lieu of old Spitfires and Meteors, a consortium of English defence contractors have designed a promising jet plane labelled the "Harrier", far superior to either (and the equal of its foreign contemporaries) in specifications. The Defence Secretary recommends expediting development thereof as much as we can.\n\n"Second life" is no exaggeration for the effects our first Harrier wings will provide to the RAF. In good time, the world will soon fear England's very own bird of prey."
ENG_MT_thatcher_raf_bases_desc:0 "Most of the airbases dotting England's emerald hills are haphazard constructs built in a frenzy before Sealion. It stands to reason that a fair share lost their purpose after 1943. Dirt runways and ramshackle sheds may suffice for biplanes - but not for modern jet fighters with appetite and temperament overflowing.\n\nNew, larger air bases will be built to accommodate our future air fleet. Modern dogfighting favors a preponderance of runways and supply stores over a glut of airbases in the term's loosest definition; after all, the more fighters we can fly at any time, the likelier we establish aerial supremacy before the enemey does."
ENG_MT_thatcher_jet_engine_innovation_desc:0 "One among the Royal Air Force's biggest issues is its obsolescence in the age of jet. The Harrier has been an encouraging start, but more will have to be done. Most of our research on jet engines has not progressed far beyond the standards of 1943 considering we heretofore lacked the knowledge, and more importantly the funds, to meaningfully proceed in its relevant avenues.\n\nThis must be rectified posthaste. Let us jump head-first into a new age by building a jet industry of our own."
ENG_MT_thatcher_vtol_stol_desc:0 "England's runways have become antiquated and unsuited to the demands of most modern fighter jets. Rather than reinventing the airbase at ruinous cost, MoD instead recommends retrofitting our new Harriers with vertical take-off and landing engines. The capability to leave base without a long runway will ensure the continued use of much of our WW2-era airstrips."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_missiles_desc:0 "Another aspect of aerial combat in which we fall short is weaponry. Foreign fighters are equipped with devastatingly powerful missiles capable of turning aircraft into bits of molten slag mid-flight. Equipping our Harriers with some of the world-class missiles our boffins have developed is an unquestionable must."
ENG_MT_thatcher_modernise_radar_desc:0 "Before and during the Second World War, British research and implementation of radar systems was unparalleled worldwide. We fervently believed the techology was our war-winning weapon against the Hun. Though undeniably useful, it proved insufficient in sealing our fate.\n\nHowever, modernizing our old radar systems would once again give us an edge over our enemies. We will have to be open to such improvements for the sake of free English skies."
ENG_MT_thatcher_pilot_training_desc:0 "The RAF suffered from a dearth of pilots throughout the Second World War. Doubtless those we had finagled may have been some of the bravest men in Britain, but truly skilled aviators were few and far between.\n\nThus far England is incapable of maintaining an air force equal in count to that of the Germans, Americans and Japanese, and so must rely on each its fighter pilots' skill more than the world's three superpowers. Every possible effort must be made to ensure that they are the best in the world."
ENG_MT_thatcher_air_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "Having made several advances in updating the Royal Air Force, there is no doubt that our doctrine requires updating. After all, there would be no point in improving our air force if none of our strategies were updated too. Efficiency must be assured if we are to properly defend against the Luftwaffe.\n\nSoon the RAF will reclaim England's skies. We pray they remain clear forevermore."

ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter:0 "The Grocer's Daughter"
ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter_desc:0 "Prime Minister Thatcher inherits the legacy of her entrepreneuring father Alfred Roberts. Without an open free market, he would've simply toiled until the grave, living off the government dole. Instead, he was able to take the leap into starting a successful grocer's shop that left the family quite comfortable. The tragedy of Britain then, is that of fascist regulations, of constant barriers to success.\n\nEvery man should be able to supply goods and services, free of burdensome taxes and arbitrary regulations. Margaret Thatcher learned everything she needed to know from hard work and personal responsibility alongside the joy of serving her father's business. Soon, all of Britain will again be a nation of entrepreneurs."
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism:0 "Introducing Thatcherism"
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism_desc:0 "The typewriters in Downing Street have been operating at a furious clip, as PM Thatcher readies the most critical address of her premiership. Before Parliament, she will outline the future of the English economy; the broad slashing of taxes and regulations known to both friend and foe as "Thatcherism". Given that her power in government has been largely cemented, little blowback from the addresses is anticipated."
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash:0 "Controlling the Cashflow"
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash_desc:0 "We inherit a ravaged landscape, where the pound seems to shed value every day and nary a street corner can be turned without finding someone asking for work. Under Thatcher, a bold new solution is clear that requires no concessions to communistic government programs. With the erratic value of our currency being the core of the nation's ills, it must be brought to heel like the rabid dog it is.\n\nDrawing on the sadly little known ideas of the Austrian School, our government shall embark on a vigorous implementation of monetarism. Circulation of the pound shall be subject to the strictest of controls, especially in regards to profligate government spending. Only when the private sector grows sufficiently shall we increase the circulation, for we know the dark alternative in front of us is no viable path. Cut it all down to a manageable level, from social programs to taxes, and our markets will stabilize to a perfect level."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard:0 "The Road Will Be Hard"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard_desc:0 "A sick child must take bitter medicine if they wish to be healthy again. Such a principle applies to economies, too. The disloyal politicians and slithering resistance has bellowed since Thatcher's rise that our reforms are too extreme, that we will ruin the lot of the working man and remove any sense of stability in the economy. Now, as unemployment rises and we plunge into recession, these illiterate fools claim that they have been vindicated. The only thing that truly has been proven, however, is that our opponents care not a hair about economic science.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a student of free-market principles, knows that such disruptions will come with the two-pronged approach of cuts and privatization. But such a situation will rectify itself, as a properly free market always does, and within a year we shall see the greatest period of growth in our history, a massive reduction in unemployment, an all-around boom of prosperity on the Isles. Let the traitors and communists cry foul; there will be no room for them once our entrepreneuring state cements itself on the world stage. We can not reverse course, for nothing worth doing is ever easy."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn:0 "A U-Turn"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn_desc:0 "Our reforms have been too bold, and we have found ourselves at the center of an arrogant drive to rapidly reshape society. The fluctuations of the market are proving too volatile for us to manage, and we must scale back our reforms before the entire country calls for our head.\n\nThis will hurt not just the future prosperity of Britain, but our entire base of support. Those who trusted us to create a booming entrepreneurial state have slowly receded as whispers increase about a return to a more sensible, moderate leader to strengthen the state. If we play this carefully and work to rectify our path as soon as possible, perhaps we can survive. Otherwise, the hope of a liberalized economy may die forever on the Isles."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes:0 "Flat Taxes"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes_desc:0 "How can we ever hope to build a freer, more prosperous England if government bureaucrats are always pickpocketing our workers? Furthermore, how can we ever hope to equally reward all labor if we believe that a hard-working, wealthy man should be taxed more than a lazy bum? The solution to these issues of taxation is to level it all off. We must tax each Englishman on more or less the same level, demonstrating that the hard work of success should be rewarded rather than punished."
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act:0 "Indirect Taxation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act_desc:0 "The very cornerstone of a free market, that of unimpeded rights to buy and sell goods, has been distorted for decades. "Sales tax," "value-added tax," "excise tax." These are all simply by-words for theft of an entrepreneur's rightful wealth. We say no to this tyrannical practice, and will prepare to pass the Indirect Taxation Act.\n\nThe ITA removes the many taxes placed on consumer goods, taxes that artificially inflate prices and stifle economic growth. Such a regressive measure hurts both worker and employer, and few could genuinely approve of such measures. Our economists already predict the booming of all economic measures once the ITA is passed, with our job-creators set to benefit the most. The only way one could oppose such a plan is the communistic desire to steal every last penny from our innovators in order to create a bloated web of social programs. To this, we can say that if a "social" program is built on theft from hard workers, it is more unjust than that which it seeks to remedy!"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works:0 "Every Englishman Will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works_desc:0 "Sloth is the greatest sin a society can be struck with, for only without it can it truly value itself. This maxim must be taken seriously in the new England we are creating. Unemployment is largely the product of lacking personal ambition, and we must take whatever measures necessary to instill individual drive in all of our citizens. We need companies to aggressively find the unemployed and bring them into the fold, we need the government to stop intervening in private enterprise and start intervening in the affairs of the lethargic legions of unemployed. Find every man a job, do not cease until this society has eradicated slothfulness. Only then, when every man knows he must work, and work well, shall we begin working towards the booming entrepreneur's state."
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works:0 "Every Englishwoman Will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works_desc:0 "An economy is a project everyone must take part in if we as a nation want to see it reach great heights. When Margaret Thatcher was helping out her father's grocery, she saw firsthand the key role played by her mother in that business's success. Now, we unfortunately preside over a society where a woman participating in the economy is frowned upon due to amorphous social concerns. To that, we ask how we can ever be wealthy if half the population is not allowed to enter the realm of prosperity?\n\nIf a woman has the chance to work, the government must support our businesses in allowing her that chance. We are not suggesting anything so chaotic as employment for all women, for of course many have key roles in the home. But Thatcher knows firsthand the enterprising mind of women, and how much their drive to success should be nurtured in the building of national economic strength. Let's mobilize our resources to find work for all women who choose it, rather than regulating the few who have struggled to make it."
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act:0 "Fair Employment Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act_desc:0 "In an economy where the entrepreneur provides jobs, we must ensure that everyone can equally get those jobs. Enter the Fair Employment Act, which aims to prevent employer discrimination so that we can all prosper.\n\nThe FEA will ensure that every productive, upstanding member of society can share in its wealth. Employers may not discriminate based on sex, religion, nationality, or race, unless they have a just objection. The same applies to housing and schooling, both critical pieces of economic life. It goes without saying however, that this is not some liberal legislation that will allow for degeneracy in society. It would be absolutely criminal to require traitors, sexual deviants, and subversive races to be treated as normal Britons. Any slander about us allowing such people to have a place in society must be shut down immediately, to not equivocate the making a more equal economy with the infection of society."
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success:0 "A Final Push to Success"
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success_desc:0 "Already the average worker, free from the tyrannical tax-men and union bosses, is seeing more money in his pocket. Already our entrepreneurs are opening new and booming businesses at a dizzying rate. We are on the cusp of a prospering free-market state, but there still remain opponents in every corner.\n\nThe ranks of the Royal Party still crawl with opportunists awaiting a downturn, or even the slightest reversal of policy, so that they can stop our plans for the future. Meanwhile, Bolshevists and other dangerous types prowl the streets, looking for anyone to turn against free enterprise. Knowing these obstacles, while also being aware of our nearness to success, how shall we strike our final blow at the foes of prosperity? Must we slacken the pace to rally our party and potentially isolate radical critics? Or would it be easier to go full speed ahead, keeping iron discipline in the party and the streets with our police force?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_slow_and_steady:0 "Slow and Steady"
ENG_ET_thatcher_slow_and_steady_desc:0 "Prosperity is a given, based on our current policies. Scientifically, tax cuts and deregulation can only lead to growth. With that in mind, why do we need to rush towards something already guaranteed? We would only be shooting ourselves in the foot if we insisted, at all costs, that we need wealth for everyone today. Let's take this one step at a time, making certain that we have the party on our side with each new piece of legislation. Once the money starts piling up, nobody will in good faith question our plan, because it will have harmed nobody and benefited everyone."
ENG_ET_thatcher_in_the_lady_eyes:0 "In the Lady's Eyes"
ENG_ET_thatcher_in_the_lady_eyes_desc:0 "We move towards the most prosperous era in English history, and can accept no obstacles to that task. Any Bolshevik agitator or secessionist traitor attempting to sabotage this growth, attempting to oppose universal prosperity through some misguided Marxist ideology, this must be crushed. In every city, our police forces know the names and faces of everyone surrounding them, and will act against subversion on a moment's notice. Soon, the days of division and squalor will be nothing but vague memory, as its proponents are completely shunted away."
ENG_ET_thatcher_free_market_free_people:0 "A Free Market, A Free People"
ENG_ET_thatcher_free_market_free_people_desc:0 ""The freer the market, the freer the people."\n\nThis is a self-evident truth, the less the government interferes in people's businesses, the less it will interfere with their business. Freedom of commerce will inevitably lead to, not only increased incomes and prosperity, but also to increased freedoms in general. Afterall, wasn't Nazi Germany, the undisputed least free nation, a command economy? And was the economic crash of the 1950s that crippled Europe not due to the over-regulation and the rampant government mandated military overproduction of Germany? If we are to ensure our people's freedom and our nation's economic well-being we must return to the free market."
ENG_ET_thatcher_days_of_old_passed:0 "The Days of the Old Have Passed"
ENG_ET_thatcher_days_of_old_passed_desc:0 "Our economic cabinet is full to the brim of old-fashioned advisors. If we are to bring forward our economy into the future, we must stop thinking backwardly. To this end we will begin modernizing our economy by first modernizing our cabinet. All of the economists with outdated opinions must be removed. Their ideas are well past their prime and we shall retire those ideas alongside those economists themselves. In their place we shall elevate new ministers with new ideas to fit a new vision for the future. If it just so happens by some... coincidence... that these new economists all happen to support Miss Thatcher then that is simply an... added benefit."
ENG_ET_thatcher_privatising_economy:0 "Privatising the Economy"
ENG_ET_thatcher_privatising_economy_desc:0 "In accordance with our goal of a free market for a free people we must start the privatization of the British economy. By selling off formerly government owned industries, we can loosen the grasp of the government on the economy and allow the people to manage it their way, the free way. Additionally, these newly privatized businesses will have lower prices and greater incentives to operate efficiently. This shall increase their competitiveness both at home and abroad, bringing further prosperity to the nation."
ENG_ET_thatcher_deals_with_big_companies:0 "Deals with Big Companies"
ENG_ET_thatcher_deals_with_big_companies_desc:0 "It doesn't take an economic genius to understand that it simply isn't possible to privatize massive industries such as steel and iron overnight. It will require a monumental effort on our part. To help ease this transition towards a fully free market we shall attempt to settle deals and agreements with large businesses to begin to privatize iron and steel. We can not fully privatize those industries as of yet, that would be too large a task to achieve at this point in time, but with some smart negotiations we can at least begin the process."
ENG_ET_thatcher_iron_and_steel_act:0 "The Iron and Steel Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_iron_and_steel_act_desc:0 "Now that we have worked out the bargains with the big businesses, we can complete the process of the transferring control of the iron and steel industry to the private sector. While this may make these resources more expensive to purchase, in the long run the overall benefits to the economy as a whole will be much greater as a result than if these industries were kept under government control.\n\nLet's get to it."
ENG_ET_thatcher_coal_act:0 "The Coal Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_coal_act_desc:0 "Time to attempt something new.\n\nNow that iron and steel have been both privatized, it is time to begin a foray into other areas. Coal is a good start. We shall privatize the coal industry in order to acquire information on the success of privatized industries. It shall be our little... experiment. A successful result may lead to further developments in our journey of privatization. A failure may lead to... unexpected consequences."
ENG_ET_thatcher_communications_act:0 "The Communications Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_communications_act_desc:0 "As for the next step in our journey towards a free market: communications. We shall ensure that the entirety of the communications sector is passed into private hands. This may cause some economic hardship from unemployment since the new private communications sector will be attempting to maximise profits rather than employment. However, we believe the overall result will be a net benefit across the board. Afterall, who's going to complain about the lower prices that come about as a result? Communications will become much more accessible in subsequent years, helping our nation become much more unified and connected."
ENG_ET_thatcher_not_go_overboard:0 "Let Us Not Go Overboard"
ENG_ET_thatcher_not_go_overboard_desc:0 "Now then, we can't be going too far too fast with this. If we fly too close to the sun our wings may burn. There are many in the party, ignorant and foolish members, who do not look kindly upon our efforts to ensure freedom in our country. They do not approve of our methods and yet we must still put up with them for now. To this end, we will make sure not to privatize too extensively lest we incur the displeasure of the party."
ENG_ET_thatcher_aviation_act:0 "The Aviation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_aviation_act_desc:0 "To add to the growing list of personal freedoms our people will have, we shall grant them freedom of movement and travel. To this end, we shall privatize the aviation industry, in order to lower prices and increase options for the consumers. This shall also have the effect of encouraging innovative methods and ideas to be developed by businesses seeking an edge over their competitors."
ENG_ET_thatcher_rail_and_road_act:0 "The Rail and Road Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_rail_and_road_act_desc:0 "Our last but by no means least important action shall be to privatize our nation's infrastructure. The road and rail act shall turn over control and responsibility of the country's transportation system to private businesses. Overall, if successful, this should result in a sustained increase in the quality of the country's infrastructure. The government shall of course still maintain a small degree of control over the rail and road industry in order to ensure a continued acceptable level of quality."
ENG_ET_thatcher_missed_chance:0 "A Missed Chance?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_missed_chance_desc:0 "Since claiming power over England and her economy, Thatcher has dreamed of unlocking its potential through daring privatization initiatives. Yet, as Party pressure grew and grew to unfathomable heights, she has been forced to turn her back on such reforms and embrace moderation.\n\nShe has bent to the will of the wets, and only time will tell if the English people will forgive her for betraying her values. Only one thing is for certain, however - Margaret Thatcher will never forgive herself."
ENG_ET_thatcher_an_english_market:0 "An English Market"
ENG_ET_thatcher_an_english_market_desc:0 "What is England, if not free? Of all that Thatcher's England has to be thankful for, its freedom and liberalism are expressed greatest through its open markets. The autonomy and independence granted to the private industries of England have proven only beneficial to the economy, and we have no intentions of stopping here. The question is rather simple; as liberalism has granted us such prosperity, why should we stop?\n\nThrough decreasing government overreach in the already free markets, we will allow for unchecked growth to proliferate across the board, and we will ensure a truly free market can take hold over England. With this drastic increase of autonomy, England will profit from this newfound liberalism, and we will become a shining beacon of free markets.\n\nPerhaps soon, all of Britain will know this liberalism."
ENG_ET_thatcher_small_govt_of_people:0 "Small Government of the People"
ENG_ET_thatcher_small_govt_of_people_desc:0 "If the English are to respect their government, they must believe that government control over their lives is at an all-time low. For Thatcher, a perfect world would indeed herald the rise of a truly small government, one that respects localism and the full autonomy of individuals.\n\nBut this is not a perfect world. While presenting ourselves as a "small" government to the public, we will in fact be snatching power away from major companies and local cities in order to increase centralization. As with many of our lies in these dark times, they are a small evil necessary for saving the nation."
ENG_ET_thatcher_looking_over_local_authorities:0 "Looking Over Local Authorities"
ENG_ET_thatcher_looking_over_local_authorities_desc:0 "Like a raven surveying the English countryside with its beady black eyes, we shall scour the nation for any sign of misfeasance. The incompetence of previous Prime Ministers has seen the rot of corruption spread throughout the leadership of local cities, which is an obvious threat to the state. We must locate this corruption and strike while the iron is hot."
ENG_ET_thatcher_breaking_and_merging:0 "Breaking and Merging"
ENG_ET_thatcher_breaking_and_merging_desc:0 "We are continuing to formulate our plans for the cities. The powerful local authorities throughout the country will be broken up by the great hammer of the state, and forcefully merged with new institutions forged by the government. The new authorities to emerge in the local cities will be considerably weaker, of course, which in turn will increase Thatcher's power."
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_local_authorities:0 "Targeting Corruption in Local Authorities"
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_local_authorities_desc:0 "Our main focus is obvious. We have uncovered the corruption of local authorities throughout England and formulated plans to diminish their power. The time to strike is now, and only by targeting these authorities immediately can we further centralize the power of Thatcher's government."
ENG_ET_thatcher_local_powers_act:0 "The Local Powers Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_local_powers_act_desc:0 "The Local Powers Act will set our plans into motion to reduce the power of local authorities in the name of targeting corruption.\n\nWhile the common citizens of England have shown their distaste towards the upcoming passing of this Act, fearing greater government centralization, it has proven to be a stroke of political success for Margaret Thatcher in the upper echelons of power. The elite of the Royalist Party support this Act wholeheartedly, and its passing will doubtless further solidify their support."
ENG_ET_thatcher_we_are_liberating_you:0 "We Are Liberating You!"
ENG_ET_thatcher_we_are_liberating_you_desc:0 "To alleviate the fears of the English citizenry, the government will attempt to produce a simple explanation of the Local Powers Act that men and women of all backgrounds will understand. In particular, we shall stress how harmful the corruption within the leadership of the local cities has been to the common people, and how stamping this out will ensure their safety. We must drag the national narrative from "government centralization" to one of "liberation from corruption"."
ENG_ET_thatcher_all_powers_back_to_us:0 "All Powers Come Back Under Us"
ENG_ET_thatcher_all_powers_back_to_us_desc:0 "The Local Powers Act can officially be declared a success.\n\nThe Royalist Party elite are pleased, an information campaign is being conducted to shift the views of the citizenry, and the power wielded by the local authorities has been drastically reduced. These powers, once held by corrupt local leaders to serve their own aims, are now the iron grip of Thatcher's government, and will be used to serve the people."
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_enemy_within:0 "The Enemy Within"
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_enemy_within_desc:0 "Not all of the insidious forces who oppose us lurk in the corridors of Westminster or scheme in the basements of ideological fanatics. According to our reports, there is a litany of anti-government individuals in the business world, and any men of such power are a threat to the Royalist Party.\n\nThe government will comb through the business world of England to find such individuals and root them out. Whether these business leaders openly support fascism or secretly harbor communist sympathies, they must be dealt with swiftly."
ENG_ET_thatcher_company_investigation_act:0 "The Company Investigation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_company_investigation_act_desc:0 "With the passing of the Company Investigation Act, the government will have the power to launch an official investigation into all the English companies and CEOs we have determined to be a potential threat to the nation. While the business world will doubtless be furious at such an Act, there will be little resistance elsewhere in English society towards our attempts to root out fascist and communist figures in such influential positions."
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_companies:0 "Targeting the Corrupt Companies"
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_companies_desc:0 "The government has decided to focus on the danger of anti-government threats within the business industry. Bringing the CEOs to heel and burning out the corruption in English companies is, by far, more important to the stability of the nation than draining the power of local city authorities. We have the names, we have the power - now we must act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_where_were_ceos_during_war:0 "Where Were the CEOs During the War?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_where_were_ceos_during_war_desc:0 "The investigation has begun. A massive inquiry into the sympathies of the CEOs and other business figures is fully underway, and every traitor will soon be exposed for all of England to see.\n\nAdmittedly the elite of the Royalist Party have acted rancorously towards Thatcher and all those supporting the Act, claiming that we must not alienate our allies in the business world, but the reception from the common people has proven to be overwhelmingly positive."
ENG_ET_thatcher_force_bend_the_knee:0 "Force Them to Bend the Knee"
ENG_ET_thatcher_force_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "The inquiry results will inevitably lead to the dramatic exposure of anti-government CEOs throughout the country. While treason is usually a punishable offense without question, we must not let our judgement be blinded by anger. We will present these CEOs with a choice: They can bend the knee to the government, or we will destroy them. Those who acquiesce to our demands will be controlled like puppets, thus ensuring some semblance of stability in the business world. Those who refuse, whoever, will be thrown into prison with no chance of release."
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_economy_chained:0 "The Economy, Chained"
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_economy_chained_desc:0 "The Prime Minister has triumphed in the war against those seditious elements infesting our economic life. Those fascists and communists who have not been tossed away into the darkest cells are fawning before us, desperate to keep their freedoms, even if it means abandoning their own vile principles. The major businesses, the economic giants, all those opposed to the government are now firmly under the thumb of the Royal Party. This success represents yet another step towards the resurrection of our nation."
ENG_ET_thatcher_victory_of_the_people:0 "A Victory of the People"
ENG_ET_thatcher_victory_of_the_people_desc:0 "The breaking apart of the bigger companies across England is very clearly nothing more or less than an act made by Thatcher to tighten her stranglehold over England, and if we do not address this issue soon, then the populace will begin to make assumptions. We cannot change the past, of course, though we can alter how the public perceives these actions against the private industries.\n\nThese companies were in fact corrupt, there is no need to exaggerate this aspect of these industries. This will prove a sturdy establishment to work off of for our latest propaganda campaign. If we really want to give this story a good spin, however, we will need to place Thatcher at the top of it- a protagonist. All we need to do is put what we have together in the way we want.\n\nNot long ago, Thatcher had crushed the corrupt companies which had been draining England of its potential, hoarding its wealth from the people who so deserved it. Thatcher's actions may have been harsh, though they were anything but unjustified.\n\nAll we can do is to hope that England agrees."

We can send a few dignitaries and have the Prime Minister make a visit to Tokyo to make the appropriate gestures.\n\nHowever, if relations are established with the Japanese, the United States and the rest of the OFN will likely be angered.

While the worst may have passed, a long, costly process of reconstruction lies ahead, which the new government must pursue immediately to secure the new status quo.

Second, the government may not redraw county borders without the permission of the communities in question. Third, auditing and financial transparency will be greatly increased on local governments and their employees.

These lords, while nominally meant to be apolitical, are clearly still working together to further the goals of the now-defunct Royal Party. While they remain in control of the House of Lords, they will continually over-scrutinize and amend legislation that England needs to preserve itself.

While it will raise a good deal of controversy, these individuals are largely still loyal to the old Royal Party, and they must be expelled from Parliament.\n\nIn order to prevent future problems arising from the unchecked appointments of life-peers, the power to appoint life-peers will no longer be granted to the Prime Minister; instead, the Prime Minister will select candidates for life peers once a year, who will then have to be approved by a special committee. This committee will be made up of random MPs from both the majority and the opposition, and will vote on each candidate privately. Should the candidate be approved, they will become a lord."

The belief that one's nation comes before family appears to be a leftover from the collaborationist government, and many are asking exactly to what extent we should embrace a central tenet of Nazism.

Powell might not want to recognise it, but he's picked up a few Royal Party grifters in his wing of the NDL. Likewise we know some of the union leaders are ardent racketeers as well as adherents of Bill Alexander's vision, dating back to when they were forced underground after Cable Street.\n\nThis can't be seen as a purge, but we can use it like a broom.

FEN_NDL_the_new_armed_forces_desc:0 "After a long fight, the people of England are finally free! Thanks to the efforts of thousands of brave Englishmen loyal to Queen and Country, we have prevailed over our misguided kin, and restored democracy and the legitimate monarch upon our blessed throne. Now, however, new challenges arise, and we'll need a powerful, reformed military to face this brave new world with any hope of remaining afloat...\n\nDecades of stagnation and economic downfall have left our armed forces underfunded, undertrained and underequipped. While our loyal militias have proven their bravery time and again, we will need a professional military. The Ministry of Defence shall undertake decisive reforms to ensure all the branches of the Royal Armed Forces are returned to their former glory!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_navy_desc:0 "For more than three centuries, the Royal Navy had been our greatest military asset, and the main instrument for British supremacy over one fourth of the world. Hundreds of ships of the most modern designs used to sail across seas and oceans, protecting our colonies and reminding all of our majesty. Even more importantly, our fleet protected the Home Islands themselves from any would-be invaders.\n\nWhen London fell to the Germans, dozens of ships were sunk by enemy bombers or in desperate actions, and many others were seized by either the victorious foe or our own dominions when they declared their independence. What we have now is nothing but a mockery of our old glory, left to rot by corruption and inefficiency.\n\nThe time has come for a comprehensive reform. We shall rebuild the Royal Navy, larger and more powerful than before! We shall rule the waves once again!"
FEN_NDL_listen_to_the_experts_desc:0 "The old Royal Navy was centered around battleships. This proved to be a disaster against the Japanese and German fleets: the former launched hundreds of strikes from their large carriers, sinking most of our ships without even firing a shot from their own dreadnoughts, while the latter relied on their submarines to cripple our economy.\n\nIt is evident that the age of the battleship is over. Our American allies are ready to provide us with their best experts in naval aviation, and help us in developing new naval tactics centered around carriers. It will take time to adapt, as most of our naval staff has never commanded anything resembling a modern fleet, but the results will be worth the effort."
FEN_NDL_carrier_development_desc:0 "The American experts have arrived, and with them are dozens of naval engineers with great experience in designing ships.\n\nWhile we rebuild our naval industry, we can set up a joint naval design board so that our own shipbuilders can learn from their expertise. When they are ready, we'll be able to develop our own carrier designs. Forever renouncing the mighty battleship will be a hit to our national pride, but we already lost a war due to "pride", and we won't lose another one for the same bloody reason!"
FEN_NDL_new_carrier_planes_desc:0 "With our carrier designs ready, and the first hulls laid in our drydocks, we'll need a suitable complement of specialised aircraft to take off from these floating airfields. Carrier planes follow different rules compared to their land-based equivalents, and our designers must take all differences into account to ensure peak efficiency and battle performance: to this end, we shall form a designing board tasked with this very specific assignment.\n\nWhile we are in no hurry, as the first carriers won't be ready before at least two years, it would be wise to begin this project immediately, so that we may fill the technological gap separating England from the other naval powers that already have extensive experience in operating carriers and carrier-centered task forces."
FEN_NDL_investing_in_submarines_desc:0 "One of our greatest mistakes in the last war was underestimating the power of submarines. By the end of the conflict, thousands of convoys populated the abyss. No matter how many subs we sunk, more would take their place.\n\nWhile many old admirals condemn such a dishonorable way of fighting, we can no longer deny its efficacy. To this end, we shall study submarine designs and devise our own underwater menace: silent and deadly, this new addition to the Royal Navy will relentlessly stalk our foes until they lie in the cold embrace of the sea!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_desc:0 "Our American friends have a large and modern submarine force. Rather than wasting months, if not years, we could save ourselves the trouble and buy their designs. This will strengthen our mutual friendship, but will come at a hefty cost. The American Navy won't give up their most advanced weapons for pennies.\n\nOn the other hand, we could invest that money in newer dockyard facilities, increasing our shipbuilding capacity. It will take more time to get up to par, and our first submarines will surely be inferior to their counterparts in other parts of the world, but sometimes number is a force in itself."
FEN_NDL_a_functioning_navy_desc:0 "Finally, the bulk of our work is done! While it will take many more years, or even decades, before we can compare ourselves to the great Royal Navy of old, our naval staff agrees that we have made a significant step in the right direction.\n\nOur fleet has been reformed following the most modern doctrines, and already dozens of new, state-of-the-art ships protect our coast from foreign threats. We have come a long way, and the results are showing!"
FEN_NDL_like_father_like_son_desc:0 "The Prime Minister's father, Earl Jellicoe, was a hero of the Great War. He commanded the British fleet at the Battle of Jutland, where the Kaiserliche Marine was decimated and our supremacy over the North Sea secured. There, our mighty battleships and dreadnoughts pummeled their German counterparts into oblivion thanks to the power of large-caliber guns!\n\nOur leader knows that the Royal Navy became what it was thanks to its mastery of direct engagements and clever positioning, and the new fleet shall follow in the footsteps set by Admiral Jellicoe. As an added value, the sight of new, mighty battleships once again bearing the Union Jack will do wonders for propaganda..."
FEN_NDL_restoring_naval_titles_and_medals_desc:0 "In order to truly recover from the disaster that struck our beloved navy twenty years ago, we need to recover our past honor. So many brave sailors perished under the waves then, and so many others fought with determination against the German collaborators during our liberation: their names, as well as the legacy of the old Royal Navy, cannot - and will not - be forgotten.\n\nIn order to reward the loyalty and selfless sacrifice of our brave seamen, we shall restore the naval titles and medals awarded to our greatest heroes before the occupation of our homeland. The advancement of technology and doctrine is important, but what is a fleet without a soul? The Royal Navy is the greatest to have ever sailed across the seas, and we shall honor the timeless traditions followed by our ancestors: their example shall lead us to new great deeds!"
FEN_NDL_a_need_for_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships are still the undisputed Queens of the endless waters, and the true patriots among us know this well! The Royal Navy boasted the largest concentration of dreadnoughts in the entire world, and it was only due to us being left alone in our fight against both the Germans and the Japanese that we lost the seas: with our newfound freedom, we shall restore our former glory!\n\nFunds will be allocated to develop more modern battleships, equipped with state-of-the-art anti-aircraft batteries in order to fend off carrier-heavy fleets...\n\nThere are some within the naval command who complain that with the money spent into a single battleship we can commission an entire task force of a carrier and several screens, which - they claim - is more powerful and effective. Their claims are flawed, of course, and the Royal Navy will be back from its ashes like the Egyptian Phoenix!"
FEN_NDL_steel_from_america_desc:0 "In order to build a new battleship fleet, we need steel. Lots, and LOTS of steel. Britain once boasted the largest metallurgic industry in the world - a result of the industrial revolution and our colonial empire - but twenty years of occupation and exploitation by the Germans have reduced much of our industry to ashes, and the civil war finished the job.\n\nThanks to our overseas allies, however, we can make up for some of the damage. American industrial conglomerates have offered to invest into new steel production facilities near our most prominent naval dockyards, probably sensing the chance to earn large revenues from our military tenders: new, state-of-the art blast furnaces will be built with American money, and will provide a much-needed boost to our steel production."
FEN_NDL_for_you_father_desc:0 "Last week, Prime Minister Jellicoe visited his father's grave, as is his tradition every year. This time, however, he returned... different. His face showed a new determination, a purpose that many had seen during the civil war as he directed the foreign support for our cause.\n\nWe do not yet know what he has in mind, but it will surely be greatly beneficial to the United kingdom as a whole! We'll just have to wait and see..."
FEN_NDL_unveil_HMS_jellicoe_desc:0 "Today is a momentous day for the United Kingdom and the restored Royal Navy. After more than a year of tireless work in our most advanced drydocks, the HMS Jellicoe is ready to be launched: the Queen herself will bless the ship, and the event will be broadcasted nationwide, perhaps even worldwide!\n\nThis marvel of modern engineering will rival the greatest ships built in history, surpassing the Bismarck and even capable of challenging the Yamato! The HMS Jellicoe will serve as our new flagship from today onwards, until the day Jupiter himself strikes its hull with the might of his thunder!\n\nRule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!\nBritons never, never, never shall be slaves!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_army_desc:0 "The Royal Army once counted millions under its service, its forces hailing from all parts of our far-reaching empire, from the Scottish Black Guard to the Indian Sepoys. Today, nothing remains but fading memories. Despite the bravery of our troops during the civil war, we can't deny that most of our current forces are made up of untrained militias.\n\nIf we are to defend ourselves and our newfound freedom from those who would seek to steal it once again, we need to reform our armed forces, and decide on a new course for our doctrine. A debate has already started in the General Staff, and we can only wait and see how it develops..."
FEN_NDL_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "When we fought against the collaborators, we needed every able-bodied man to fight for freedom. As such, we had to enact conscription, and thousands of brave young Englishmen died in the name of the legitimate Queen: we shall never forget their sacrifice!\n\nWith peace returned to the country, and reconstruction underway, many within the civilian government ask for conscription to be lifted, and for our army to return a purely volunteer force. A conscripted force - they say - will be far less effective than a professional one, and much more costly.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some in the High Command arguing for conscription to remain. Our enemies - especially the Reich - are still very much alive, and having a large army would surely act as a deterrent.\n\nAs the legitimate Queen's government, it falls upon us to address the matter."
FEN_NDL_hunting_with_claude_desc:0 "Despite his retirement, Claude Auchinleck is still an influential figure in English politics, and his wisdom is appreciated, even by his rivals. Our Prime Minister is especially fond of his mentor, and the two have forged a friendship through years of underground resistance and a civil war.\n\nHoping to relax for a bit from the hardships of his official duties, George shall go on a hunting trip with Claude, where they'll be able to let go of their strict discipline and official roles for a couple days. Who knows, perhaps the old general will let a couple pearls of wisdom slip from his net..."
FEN_NDL_the_front_of_the_shield_desc:0 "Auchinleck is right. Our army should focus on protecting our shores from enemy attacks rather than risking everything in overseas adventures: to protect the United Kingdom, we need a large defensive force capable of rapid mobilization.\n\nOur General Staff is fully in support of what they call "a sound strategy" to protect our homeland. Perhaps our forces won't be as highly trained as the American Marines or the German Panzergrenadiers, but they'll make up for it with their numbers and their dedication!"
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_invasion_desc:0 "The German conquest of Great Britain was the single greatest defeat in our history. We have spent years analysing the causes of this disaster, and our staff agrees that the main reason has been our over-reliance on the Royal Navy: when the fleet was lost, the Germans landed a stone's throw from London, and the Home Guard was too slow to react.\n\nWe won't make the same mistake twice. Should any enemy come to our shores, they'll find that the entirety of the British people is ready to fight tooth and nail for every bloody inch of our country, until the end!"
FEN_NDL_a_defense_force_desc:0 "As Machiavelli once said, "Wars begin when you will, but do not end when you please."\n\nWars of aggression have always backfired against those who wage it, and our country has already been ravaged by an enemy invasion. In order to protect our nation from any would-be conqueror, we shall focus our efforts solely on protecting our sacred soil: our troops will be drilled in defensive tactics, and fortifications will protect our coasts and cities from all those who would dare attack us.\n\nNot only that, but we'll also foster a strong sense of duty in our soldiers. From the highest officer to the lowest militiaman, all will know how important their sacrifice is, and how many will be saved by their bravery: we have already lost too much, we shall never let it happen again!"
FEN_NDL_meeting_with_stirling_desc:0 "Among the many officers of the reformed General Staff, David Stirling - remembered as the founder of the short-lived Special Air Service - has rather... peculiar views on the future of the Royal Army. He spent years reflecting on our defeat in the war, and he has come to a rather surprising conclusion: our army failed to defeat the Germans not because it wasn't big enough, but because it was too large. Poor coordination, lack of training and subpar logistics were the result of an excessive reliance on conscription, and weighed heavily on our performance in the conflict.\n\nTo address this issue, he proposes radical reforms. The new Royal Army should - according to Stirling - focus on small, highly trained strike teams, each unit an expert in a single aspect of warfare: he claims with specialized support and state-of-the-art equipment, these units can inflict much more damage to the enemy than average soldiers, at a fraction of the cost. While such ideas seem to clash with the majority of the General Staff, it would be wise to meet Stirling anyway."
FEN_NDL_the_edge_of_the_sword_desc:0 "In the end, Stirling is right. Rebuilding our army to be like what it was during the last war would be akin to recreating all the conditions that brought to our defeat. Stirling's reforms are exactly what we need to show the world that we can return to the forefront of innovation even in military matters.\n\nOur new army will be much smaller than before, and centered around small, well-equipped, highly-trained and autonomous units, tailored to a single task. These small units will move fast and strike hard, destroying our enemies before they even have the chance to react. In theory, this should allow our army to deal crippling blows to the foe; in practice... we'll simply have to wait and see how it goes."
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_SAS_desc:0 "The Special Air Service was Stirling's own creation during the last war. Despite our defeat, they nonetheless proved themselves to be an extremely effective strike force: in several successful operations, they inflicted heavy losses upon the enemy at a fraction of their cost in human lives and equipment.\n\nOur new army will apply the lessons of the SAS - speed, surprise, organization and powerful offensives - at a general level, effectively transforming the entire Royal Army into teams of commandos! We'll strike at the enemy from a hundred different points, and destroy them before they can even hear the sound of their death..."
FEN_NDL_an_elite_force_desc:0 "It took us months to fully reshape the Royal Army according to Stirling's vision, but it is finally done. Our new land army is an extremely professional and effective force.\n\nThanks to complete integration between the various branches of the Royal Armed Forces, our troops will strike with the strength of a hundred men each, moving at lightning speed and destroying their target with precision.\n\nOf course, we have to be careful. As all small tools, this new army is delicate, and it requires extreme coordination and competence in order to be able to operate at full efficiency. We are confident that our officers are up to the task."
FEN_NDL_the_royal_air_force_desc:0 "Once the undisputed ruler of the skies, the Royal Air Force is but a shadow of its former glory. The harsh conditions imposed by the peace treaty, and twenty years of neglect and economic downturn have transformed our air force into a comatose patient.\n\nEven now, all we have is some old birds left by the collaborators, and whatever our friends in Canada and the United States could spare for us. If we are to re-establish a fully-functional air force, we'll have to rebuild everything from scratch."
FEN_NDL_jets_are_the_future_desc:0 "Jet aeroplanes are the future of air combat. Far faster than any prop plane, they can climb higher than anything in the sky. During the occupation, the Royal Air Force was barred from having anything resembling the newest German models, which means we'll have to start from the basics.\n\nWe should immediately establish a research group to analyse jet engine designs, and then teach our best engineers how to build and maintain them. It will be difficult, and we'll need the help of our allies, but there is much to gain!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_jets_desc:0 "With our lack knowledge on jet aeroplanes, we have no idea of what kind of airframe would best suit such a powerful engine. With the looming risk of producing flying caskets for our test pilots, we'll need to rely on our American allies once more to avoid unnecessary problems.\n\nBy buying some of their outdated designs and having our research team study them, we'll soon be able to fully understand the most important concepts of jet flight, and then apply it to our own domestically-produced aeroplanes."
FEN_NDL_improving_upon_the_engine_desc:0 "Now that we understand the basic functioning of a jet engine, and already have a small jet force, we can slowly start improving our designs. Modern advancements in the field allow our technicians to tweak engines and airframes to allow for greater speed without greater risks.\n\nOf course, we'll need help from our friends in the alliance to fully understand the scope of our research, but we'll make sweeping advances in a short time, allowing us to fill the gap between us and modern air combat!"
FEN_NDL_harris_was_right_desc:0 "Arthur Harris, also known as "Bomber Harris" by both friends and foes, was one of the most prominent officers of the Royal Air Force during the last war. A proponent of strategic bombing, he was convinced of the necessity to break the enemy's home front: factories, roads, ports, even civilian homes and schools were all legitimate targets to force the enemy to bend, or burn.\n\nIt's time we forge our own path in the air, and Bomber Harris is the man for this. Even though he couldn't put his theory into action due to our untimely defeat, this time we won't hesitate, and bury anyone daring to go to war against us under tons of explosives!"
FEN_NDL_invest_in_bomber_research_desc:0 "Bombers have changed since the last war. Rather than slow-moving fortresses bristling with machine guns, today's bombers are high-flying monsters with deadly cargo: napalm, phosphorous, even atomic payloads can utterly devastate entire cities in mere minutes.\n\nIt's imperative that we update our bomber fleet to the latest designs. Our enemies will tremble when they see our air fleet! Who knows, perhaps one day we'll see Germania burn..."
FEN_NDL_a_request_from_harris_desc:0 "Bomber Harris has come to us with a request. He needs a large amount of funds for a personal project, one that - he says - has been his constant focus ever since the end of the war.\n\nKnowing his preference for strategic bombers, there may be some value in listening to him. The General Staff will meet in the next days to examine his proposal, and decide whether to allocate the requested funds."
FEN_NDL_better_aerodynamics_desc:0 "The engine is the most important part in any aeroplane, but the airframe comes in a close second. An ill-designed airframe will break when put under stress, while a heavy one will only hinder performance.\n\nThanks to our allies' help, our engineering department is confident that they can greatly refine the airframes of our jets, improving aerodynamics and granting higher speed and agility."
FEN_NDL_a_professional_air_force_desc:0 "With our latest advancements in the fields of jet engines, aerodynamics and air doctrine, we can finally claim to have a fully-professional air force. Thanks to the help of our steadfast allies, our pilots enjoy the best training and the most modern equipment available.\n\nIt may take some time before we return to our old glory, but the day when the Royal Air Force can once again contest the skies of Europe grows ever closer. We'll one day dominate the skies as we used to rule the oceans!"
FEN_NDL_develop_better_engines_desc:0 "The General Staff has reviewed Harris's proposal, and found it extremely promising. He shall receive all the funding he needs, as long as he also focuses his attention on new, improved engines for our bombers.\n\nWith war assuming more and more a trans-continental value, it is of the utmost importance that our long-range aircraft are able to cross seas and oceans if necessary. Our enemies will fear us from Germania to Tokyo!"
FEN_NDL_a_british_air_force_desc:0 "While our erstwhile allies have offered to help us rebuild our air force, we don't need their help. We battled German Stukas in the skies of London before the Americans even thought about helping us, and we'll do so again if the need arises.\n\nWe can't expect others to save us, and for this reason, we can ultimately count only on ourselves. The Royal Air Force will be a shining example of British ingenuity and combat skill: if we fail, it will be our own fault, but if we succeed, it will be our triumph, and ours alone!"
FEN_NDL_secret_intelligence_service_desc:0 "No contradiction greater than Kim Philby can be found. Philby is a firm believer in the absolute annihilation of the enemies of the working class. He also leads the Secret Intelligence Service better than anyone else could. To remove him would be near-impossible and would be a major blow to the young Service. We must treat this affair delicately, like capturing a butterfly: we can neither tighten our grip too hard nor slacken up too much."
FEN_NDL_dealing_with_philby_desc:0 "After careful internal surveillance and intel gathering within MI6 from our most loyal elements, we have reached an impasse on a possible strategy, as nearly every option is a double edged sword. Remove him to assure loyal leadership, yet inevitably get a weaker leader facing a leftist revolt? Defang him by removing his guns and support, worsening efficiency and still provoking his ire? Or simply keep an eye on him, allowing him to run the Service as efficiently as possible...yet perhaps not allowing us to halt his influence until it's too late? We need to make a decision on how we will handle this matter."
FEN_NDL_mi6_is_for_the_queen_desc:0 "Philby, bereft of loyal men, will have no more influence§! than the average Communist philistine. By requiring an oath of absolute loyalty to the queen, we will be able to prevent leftists from joining our venerated service. Which one of them would truly be more interested in serving the queen than decapitating her?"
FEN_NDL_cutting_on_the_guns_desc:0 "The SIS has a formidable weapons stockpile, built up under Philby's orders but tolerated for its role in a global armaments network, and the operations we still need to carry out on our own soil. However, it is clear that the more militarized our Service is, the more dangerous Philby's leadership is. By slashing down this arsenal, there will be much less of a danger that we suddenly find ourselves dealing with rebellious red militias both at home and abroad. This may hurt effectiveness in the short term, but if one wants to shoot at enemies they really should be joining the Army."

FEN_NDL_IT_the_old_alliance_desc:0 "The United States and England have always had a special relationship. We have done our best to maintain peace and democracy in the Old and New Worlds for the past centuries, and despite our defeat against the Reich nearly 20 years ago, there remains a bond between our two countries. Through two world wars, the two greatest English-speaking nations of the world have been tried and tested like no other grand alliance.\n\nIt is only natural that now, in our hour of need, we should look to the United States once more as a partner and friend.\n\nSurely, we can restore the good old nature and the good old humour of an alliance not yet forgotten."
FEN_NDL_IT_ties_with_canada_desc:0 "Through all the hardships of the past 20 years- the defeats, the invasion, the end of the war- Canada has stood by Free England, in whatever form it has taken. When Tobruk and the Suez Canal were lost, she remained loyal. When Britain itself was invaded, she remained loyal. Through decades of oppression and hardship, she remained loyal. It is time to recognise the contributions of Canada to our victory, and to give our humble thanks to our most steadfast supporter in whatever way we can."
FEN_NDL_IT_royal_visit_desc:0 "As part of our thanksgiving, the Queen shall return to Canada, her second home, to pay homage to the support they have given us. Other members of the royal family shall accompany her throughout the country, and celebrate the return of freedom to England and the dawn of a new future few would have dreamed possible just 10 years ago."
FEN_NDL_IT_they_said_they_will_return_desc:0 "Many Britons are understandably bitter about the withdrawal of American troops during the Second World War. However, with this withdrawal came a promise- that, one day, freedom would return to England. Now that it has, we expect the Americans to keep it here."
FEN_NDL_IT_OFN_bases_desc:0 "Our army is not in any state to fight off a counterattack by the Germans, should it come to that. We need more men, more equipment, and more time to organize our troops. The OFN can provide all three, if we give them the rights to station bases at strategic locations in England. While this technically violates our sovereignty, everything has its cost- and a few well-armed Yanks on English soil is worth never having to endure such calamities as we have."
FEN_NDL_IT_OFN_air_fields_desc:0 "While our own RAF continues to grow, we will require assistance from our allies to ensure that the skies over England are friendly for the time being. Allowing OFN nations, including the United States, to base advanced fighters and bombers here will buy us time to develop our own forces, and ensure that we can ward off any attempts by the Germans to violate our airspace."
FEN_NDL_IT_ties_with_pacifica_colonies_desc:0 "While Australia and New Zealand officially broke off from the Empire, their ties to the OFN and our shared history and language keep us close in spirit, if not in geography. We should reach out to these former Commonwealth (and current OFN) members to help us rebuild our country and re-establish diplomatic ties with the rest of the world."
FEN_NDL_IT_rescind_our_claims_desc:0 "As much as it might sting, we are no longer an Empire on which the sun never sets. We must think more practically about our position in the world, and that means making small sacrifices for larger gains. The prestige of some small islands in the middle of an ocean is not worth the support of potential allies in the OFN. Renouncing our claims to these islands will present us as a team player in a potential alliance, and as a country focused more on democratic ideals than regaining a lost empire."
FEN_NDL_IT_with_the_free_world_desc:0 "After gaining the favour of the OFN, we are now firmly cemented as one of the free nations of the world. We have rebuilt our relationships with former Commonwealth members and reaffirmed the old alliance with the United States.

FEN_NDL_IT_the_dragon_to_the_west_desc:0 "With the chaotic state of Europe and the world, a divided Isles is a doomed Isles. Wales, with its rich coal and coastal resources, would be invaluable to reasserting our national strength. We also should not forget our nearly 1000-year-long history of unity with Wales. Their independence is a minor aberration, to be corrected with force, if necessary. In the meantime, our diplomatic channels will be buzzing with anticipation of a peaceful union."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_government_will_do_the_talking_desc:0 "Fortunately for us, the young Welsh nation, shuttled from crisis to crisis, found itself run by a stable and democratic government. Therefore, we look with much anticipation towards our upcoming unification talks.\n\nThe issue of setting up these talks will be key, with such a multitude of factors to consider. Arch-conservatives here in England will despise the appearance of concessions, while most of Wales, even their "moderates," do not wish to see their burgeoning cultural independence quashed. We must offend nobody and please practically everyone. God be with us."
FEN_NDL_IT_y_mabb_darogans_pride_desc:0 "The insane bastard, Julian Cayo-Evans, has been running our western neighbor for over a year now. In his youthful bouts of insanity, he truly believes little Wales can stand against the inevitable tides of unification. Down with him!\n\nWe shall immediately begin preparations for an invasion. We will crush any insolent pests skittering through the countryside, and within days our armored corps will be in Cardiff, to be greeted as liberators. Cayo has, no doubt, built a vicious and fanatical following, but they are hardly indicative of the average Welshman. A United Britain is closer than ever."
FEN_NDL_IT_welcome_home_desc:0 "The fraught road to reunification is over. Wales, standing for just two decades as an independent...well, perhaps power isn't the right word. They existed, for certain. But no longer. Now, as before the war, the great peoples of Wales and England are one. No more scheming nationalists and communists, no more volatile shocks from global coal prices. Now, everywhere from Cardiff to the distant northern hills near Snowdonia shall be under London's benevolent dominion."
FEN_NDL_IT_on_terror_and_blackshirts_desc:0 "Decades of isolation have developed curious and dangerous pathologies among many a Welshman, more so than we had first anticipated. Our garrisons in the countryside have faced dozens of bombings and sniper attacks, and we are almost certain that more than one group is at play.\n\nTo pacify our foes, we need to use both the sword and the pen. For those who viciously attack our soldiers, there will of course be no mercy...unless they surrender. We must specifically track and kill the masterminds, finding their identities no matter the cost. All the while, our crack teams of journalists will be ensuring that our campaigns against the enemy will appear as benevolent as possible. Soon, there will be nobody left to even fathom Welsh resistance."
FEN_NDL_IT_two_brothers_united_desc:0 "At last, Wales has calmed to governable levels. Few gunshots ring out even in the most sparsely populated of regions, as citizens slowly resume their normal routines. This process was no easy feat, yet here we stand over a stable union of nations. At last, this brief divorce ends, all while Wales coasts and coal reserves open to our shared use. Soon, none shall trifle with Britain."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_light_in_the_north_desc:0 "We have successfully consolidated our power in England, and it is time to move onto greener pastures. One of the hurdles we must jump before unifying Britain is Scotland. Unlike our forefathers three hundred years ago, this Scotland has prepared for invasion since its inception. Since the end of the last great war, a rivalry has developed between us. Now that the Collaborators and their allies have been disposed of, we can talk again of unification."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_wide_open_desc:0 "After much consideration, Scotland has agreed to begin talks with us about reunification. However, Scottish nationalism is quite rooted in the country and it may take some dedication and elbow grease to install British nationalism and pride. There are a few hardliners in the government who are opposed to this idea entirely, especially the Scottish National Party, who ruled the country for most of its short recent history. Most, however, have agreed to talks - but it will take encouragement."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_slam_shut_desc:0 "It seems the Scots didn't take too kindly to the idea of reunification. Our diplomatic team was turned away in Edinburgh after making their intentions clear. While this seems like an opportunity taken from us, it is still possible to return Scotland to the fold. We have no choice now but invasion. While we may be in the history books as conquerors, we have done this for our children and their children so that they will see a united Britain."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_union_jack_flies_desc:0 "After our efforts, the Union Jack flies once again over Scotland. It has taken time, but now one of the most beautiful places on the British Isles is under our control. Their people are also under our control, and some have been more unruly than expected. However we have placed small contingents of soldiers in Scottish cities and towns to ensure peace. Talks have begun about a Scottish Parliament that will both serve in the House of Lords in conjunction with their own parliament based in Holyrood. This is the first step to make sure that they are seen as equal. Now the English flag flies next to the Scottish flag, united."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_bagpipes_sing_no_more_desc:0 "Scottish nationalism is an issue we have been facing ever since we had brought Scotland back into the fold. Terrorist attacks have begun on our soldiers, with some of the old guard comparing it to the North Irish War nearly forty years ago.\n\nWhile most of the Scottish people have been cooperative towards us, it appears that we may need to use a much heavier hand."
FEN_NDL_IT_rule_britannia_desc:0 "We have done it.\n\nAfter many trials, we have unified the British Isles. Our power is now consolidated and we are once again the rulers of Scotland and Wales. Finally, we can reclaim our mantle of Great Britain, lost for twenty years. Now, we can begin to unite our people together and make our country a great power again. We are a part of the Free World, and will remain so for the next hundred years.\n\nRule Britannia!"

FEN_NDL_econ_rebuilding_an_economy_desc:0 "Homelessness, hunger, sickness. Such are the conditions left to hundreds of thousands of patriotic Englishmen after the violence of our civil war. Even the traditionally comfortable classes like business owners and landlords have seen their wealth dry up, leaving a gaping hole where an economy once existed. If we hope to stand on two feet, we must mobilize all resources possible to bring stability and comfort in the daily lives of all citizens, rich and poor."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_poor_desc:0 "London's ruins are a sorry sight: emaciated children, haggard families, rampant crime. And this is the center of our wealth! Imagine the situation in the rural villages. We cannot move forward with so many people, so many children, in dire economic straits. As of now, our most immediate goal is to provide the necessities to all those left in destitution. Three meals a day, clean water in a heated home, basic healthcare: these are our promises to all those crushed by the violence of the civil war."
FEN_NDL_econ_improving_social_programs_desc:0 "The legacy of the fascist collaborators is one of scraps to the poor. With the current state of our economy, we must immediately rectify this callousness. We will find the money, whatever the means: nationalize, tax, expropriate if absolutely necessary, all for uplifting the poor. We can't tread too hard on the individuals with some sums of wealth...but we can cut them down just a peg to feed the hungry and house the homeless."
FEN_NDL_econ_cheaper_housing_desc:0 "As we have picked up our social programs, there has been some blowback from the private sector. Nowhere has this been more acute than the well-organized associations of landlords across England. They protest loudly about the "communist" proposal to create public housing. More productively, they have worked with some of our social-democratic and liberal colleagues to draft up a plan for cheaper housing. Via public-private partnerships, we can encourage these landlords to build thousands of new housing units with certain regulations imposed, keeping public housing to a marginal level."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_housing_act_desc:0 "Our new Housing Act, built in consultation with all parties affected from landlords to homeless, is a major step towards making housing affordable to everyone. By using some of our funds to subsidize housing development, setting caps on rent, and requiring certain standards to be met for all new projects, we will move much closer to giving everyone a roof over their heads. Perhaps one day, everyone can have not just a place to lay their head, but a place they proudly call home."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_jobless_desc:0 "As the English Civil War has drawn to a close, we are now free to focus on economic recovery as well as our political situation. So far, the data is dire. We must begin to reconnect with those who have been turned out by the war, and those who have lost their jobs amidst the ravages of the conflict. After we have assessed the status of our economy from an employment perspective, we can begin to propose programmes and special government action. This might involve some wrangling of party factions, but surely we can all come together to rebuild our country and get England working again."
FEN_NDL_econ_creating_more_jobs_in_the_north_desc:0 "Even before the Civil War, the northern parts of England struggled due to cuts in government funding and projects. No government member wanted to associate with such a rebellious region, and so employment and growth lagged behind the South. Heavy fighting did not improve the situation, and now infrastructure and housing are a significant problem. Now that the civil war is over and we face less pressure from Germany, we can begin to push more funding towards these left-behind areas and help them to, once more, become the industrial heart of England."
FEN_NDL_econ_deal_with_bosses_desc:0 "While we do not intend to give our country over to the interests of large capitalist institutions, their help is necessary in revitalizing our economy and ensuring that we can recover from the war. We can hand out vital projects (with ample government funding) for national recovery that will get big business on our side, the people happy and working, and the nation ready for the future. We will, of course, remain careful to avoid a descent into corporate cronyism, and there will be oversight of these projects to make sure that they are fulfiling our expectations."
FEN_NDL_econ_what_to_do_with_foreign_jobs_desc:0 "We still have an enormous trade dependence on the United States and the rest of the OFN, and some of our members have grown uncomfortable with the numbers of jobs being "shipped overseas" to these nations. Furthermore, there are many Americans here in England that many say are taking away jobs from hard-working English men and women. The more liberal elements of our party maintain that such trade is necessary, and that economic ties with the Americans further our national security interests. We must find a way to defuse tensions on both sides regarding this vital economic issue before the complaints boil over."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_trade_desc:0 "Our dependence on trade with the United States has been both a historical weakness and a vital artery. During the Second World War, our failure to defend this trade cost us dearly. During the English Civil War, it was one of few avenues we had to acquire food and manufactured goods from abroad. Now that the Germans no longer have control over who we can and cannot trade with, we must reopen this vital trade partnership. Surely, the Americans will be amenable to such a proposal...?"
FEN_NDL_econ_focusing_on_the_OFN_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is our greatest ally. Just as they help us militarily, we can help them economically. We shall expand our trade operations in OFN member nations, especially the United States, and in doing so we shall improve our own economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_expansion_into_free_europe_desc:0 "While Spain and France may not be the most democratic nations, they are somewhat free from the grip of the German Reich. Alongside these nations, we can also expand trade into Scandinavia and the Balkans. We can improve our economy and increase our influence in Europe at the same time."
FEN_NDL_econ_trade_agreements_with_italy_desc:0 "Italy's government is vastly different to ours, but that isn't important right now. Regardless of ideology, Italy hasn't had good relations with Germany for almost 2 decades now, making them a bulwark against German expansion. If we sign some trade agreements with the Italian Government, we may be able to sway them closer to our side."
FEN_NDL_econ_into_a_new_phase_desc:0 "Now that all of our immediate economic issues have been dealt with, we can move on to social matters. The social issues of the country must be addressed, from taxation to education. We owe the English people, whether they voted for us or not. For a better future. For a better England."
FEN_NDL_econ_a_new_social_plan_desc:0 "We are not the Royal Party, spineless elitists bending to the rich. Neither are we the Socialist Labour Party, forcing our reforms upon the people. We are the NDL, fair and just. We shall open the way for reforms to build a better England. Our new social plan will help to better all of England. The door is open to all, it is up to them to step through it."
FEN_NDL_econ_deals_and_business_desc:0 "The core of our economy is small businesses. By supporting these small businesses through subsidies and grants we can encourage the people to open up new enterprises. This will help increase employment and greatly expand the economy as a whole."
FEN_NDL_econ_economy_from_a_young_age_desc:0 "We cannot expect to ensure continued economic growth in the nation without a more economically-minded population. To this end, we will introduce more businesses and economics classes in school to raise the next generation to be more knowledgeable with regards to the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_business_support_act_desc:0 "We shall attempt to pass a bill through Parliament for the betterment of England. The Business Support Act will allow us to give further aid and support to small businesses to reinforce the economy. It shall also allow us to send funds towards individuals who are attempting to start up businesses, encouraging entrepreneurial behaviour and benefiting the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_fight_for_healthcare_desc:0 "Many in England believe that the fight for healthcare was lost forever almost two decades ago, when the Royal Party took power. We shall revive this idea and move towards a comprehensive healthcare plan. While it may not be perfect, this new system will be a step forward towards a greater society."
FEN_NDL_econ_better_pay_for_doctors_desc:0 "The battle for healthcare starts with the most important figures in the field: doctors. We cannot expect to bring healthcare to all if the supply of doctors is so limited. By increasing their pay we can encourage more individuals to pursue the field of medicine, allowing us to bring better quality healthcare to all."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_NHS_act_desc:0 "We shall now attempt to pass a new act through parliament: the National Healthcare Service Act. While this may not be a popular act to many in Parliament, with the Patriots denouncing the act as treasonous and with the Socialists decrying the act for not going far enough, the majority of the people of England will support us. It shall provide a more affordable and accessible service to those in the middle and lower classes, as is our goal."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_costs_of_education_desc:0 "If we are to provide affordable education to all members of society, we must first reduce the costs of education wherever we can. We shall start with the most wasteful aspects of education such as unnecessary and outdated textbooks and other equipment. With any luck, this, alongside education grants and subsidies, shall reduce the costs of schooling to much more affordable levels."
FEN_NDL_econ_more_equipment_for_teachers_desc:0 "With the costs of education successfully reduced, we must now increase the quality of said education. An obvious and glaring shortcoming in the education system is the lack of proper equipment that many teachers are facing. We shall have to rectify this mistake."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_education_costs_act_desc:0 "A new act shall be sent through to Parliament. The Education Costs Act seeks to, as the name makes clear, address the costs of education. While this may cost the government a large sum of money, in the long run, the move should pay off by improving the academic base of our nation and bringing England into a more intelligent future."
FEN_NDL_econ_fixing_the_tax_system_desc:0 "Calling the English tax system broken would be an understatement of magnificent proportions. The amount of unnecessary and unhelpful taxes levied upon the people is astounding, and has hamstrung the economy at a time when it needed as much help as it could get. We must reform the system so that we can properly strengthen and reinforce our economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_cutting_useless_taxes_desc:0 "Too much of our inherited taxation system does more harm than good. We even have taxes that cost more to keep track of than they are worth in revenue. We shall ease the people's tax burden by removing some of these taxes, but not so many that we effectively neuter the government. In doing so we shall not only increase consumer spending but we shall also increase support from the people."
FEN_NDL_econ_work_more_desc:0 "With our latest tax cuts, our industry has more room to breathe and grow. The English economy has yet to recover completely from the civil war, with many industries not being restored to their full potential. By investing into local manufacturers we can help bolster our industry and the industrialists can employ more people in their factories, overall improving productivity. And with more people working, local economies can enjoy the benefits of having a more robust consumer base."
FEN_NDL_econ_and_what_about_the_rich_desc:0 "We must also decide what we are to do about income and wealth inequality, with regards to the richer members of society. The SLP would have us be rid of them completely, taxing their wealth to extortionate levels. The Royal Party would have us bow down to them, and give them free reign to exploit the poor and hoard their wealth. We will go for a more sensible middle route."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_groundwork_laid_desc:0 "We have done it. The impossible, Herculean task of successfully rebuilding the economy and reforming society. But we are not finished yet. There still remains much work to be done if we are to fulfil the promise of our ideals, but we can truthfully say that we have made England a better place."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_The_People_Have_Spoken_desc:0 "Soon after the ashes of the old collaborator government had settled, the first free elections since the end of the Second World War were held in England, and the Socialist Labour Party emerged victorious. Now our ministers must prepare themselves to run a left wing agenda, so radical and ambitious, it has neve been witnessed before in 10 Downing Street.\n\nWe have inherited an England devastated and divided by civil war; but we still hope that we may change England's fortunes for the better. Our task is by no means complete, this election victory has only been the first obstacle we have overcome on our way toward securing freedom and equality for all our people."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_thank_the_party_desc:0 "This unprecedented turn in English politics would have never been possible without the unity maintained by the Socialist Labour Party during the election. However, Harold Wilson knows all too well that this unity could disappear, and the party could collapse at any moment. Of course such a disaster must be avoided, and any and all solidarity in the party must be preserved.\n\nWilson will therefore make thanking the party the centrepiece of all his coming public engagements. It will be made clear to our supporters and rivals alike that the SLP is united and ready to improve the lives of all those who have suffered in the past."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_meet_with_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions were always the most active and ardent supporters of socialism in this country before the invasion. All of the old union members were the first to feel the fear of Nazi persecution, leading many to believe the unions to be all but dead as a political organisation.\n\nHowever, they have yet again proved themselves to be great supporters of our cause, and for that they must be thanked. Besides, these unions will be an intrinsic part of our future plans, keeping them onside will be the best cause of action we can take."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_a_discreet_chat_desc:0 "Since before the election victory of the Socliast Labour Party, Bill Alexander had been formulating big plans for the future of a socialist England. Now that the party is in power Alexander is finally able to put all of his plans into action.\n\nHowever, he will first have to talk with the Prime Minister.

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_dont_split_the_party_desc:0 "Keeping the party united is already known to be one of the key factors that got us elected in the first place, yet we remain at risk of dividing the party if we neglect the wishes of the more hardline among our government. In particular, we must remain particularly conscious of Reg Birch and Kim Philby, who have taken the lead of the communist faction within our party.\n\nHowever, Wilson will ultimately be made the strongest figure in our party, but whether he can maintain this mantle is yet to be assured."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_but_the_NDL_is_a_league_desc:0 "As we endeavour to unite our own party, we shall also attempt to exploit the divisions within the National Democratic League. The loss of their party in the recent election and the fact that it has far more factions than our own, leaves it prone to far more divisions than we currently suffer. It is important that we can keep them squabbling among themselves for as long as possible, because the more time they spend arguing with each other the less they will have to criticise us."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_unite_the_public_desc:0 "After the brutality of the civil war and the hard fought election that followed, English society has become more divided than ever. The country is in desperate need of a unifying figure that will heal the wounds of the past, and we believe we can make the Socialist Labour Party into such a rallying point. Bringing the public behind the SLP is vital for the long term success of our country, alongside our party."
FEN_SLP_Pol_1_form_a_concensus:0 "Form a Concensus"
FEN_SLP_Pol_1_form_a_concensus_desc:0 "Reginald Birch has long made his disdain for democracy clear to those around him, this view is not one shared with the majority of the party however. A clear consensus will have to be made to ensure that the party is united on this issue. This will let us make sure that their anti-democratic gang knows that their views are not shared with the rest of the party nor the English people. Maybe then they will learn to keep their mouths shut about their more unpalatable convictions."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_the_spanner_at_work_desc:0 "Greater restrictions on the activities of the Hardliners will have to be introduced in order to maintain our image of unity. All of the ministers associated with Birch will be barred from talking to the press and holding ministerial office.

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_talk_with_moderate_unions_desc:0 "Fortunately for us the majority of the unions in the country share the moderate views held by the Prime Minister and most of the Socialist Labour Party. These unions in particular have already proved themselves invaluable in popularising the party, they will have to be kept happy if they are to continue to help us into the future.

We must be several steps ahead of him at all times.\n\nFinally, trustworthy elements within the agency will work to bring a divide between Philby and the rest of MI6.

To ensure England never again falls to foreign powers. But the task before us is not just rebuilding it in terms of manpower and equipment, but in terms of its spirit as well. We are a Socialist Republic now and the military must reflect that. Our armed forces will not fight for such outdated ideas like 'King and Country', but to protect our socialist revolution and its people. The lessons learned by our militias during the Civil War will help shape our new military, opening up the ranks to men and women alike, regardless of class or social standing. The new military will help keep the torch of the revolution alive."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_navy_desc:0 "The Royal Navy is dead, its ships largely rusting beneath the waves or taken by the Germans. Leaving us the task of rebuilding an English navy from what little we have left. We must ensure the Hun never again reaches our sures. At the same time, the ideas the SLP can't be forgotten just because one is at sea. The new navy of the Socialist Republic must reflect the ideas it protects. Women will be allowed to serve on every ship, in every rank. Captains will no longer rule their ships like kings. The ranks will be given on merit and ability, not because of family name or money. The new navy must at once protect the people and be a symbol of the new England."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_navy_to_protect_the_coasts_desc:0 ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:Britons never will be slaves." as the old song goes. But our rule of the waves ended decades ago, and we spent too long as slaves. The days of a British navy that helps rule an empire that spans continents are gone. What the workers needs from their new English Navy is a force that protects it from any invasion. That can react quickly and decisively to any threats that dares to approach our shores. Another Sealion must never happen. The Kriegsmarine will not humiliate us a second time."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_ring_desc:0 "In the Second World War, the German bombing campaign proved a major factor in the UK's downfall, with German bombers crippling British industry and devastating morale, often leaving entire cities in near ruin. This cannot be allowed to happen again. England must be protected.\n\nThe Ring is an idea that has been on the drawing board since the days of the Resistance. The proposal calls for numerous anti-air defences to be built all along our coasts, from the White Cliffs of Dover to the Scottish border. These fortifications will ensure that any enemy plane that enters our air space is met with a wall of Flak and Anti-Air Missiles. This combined with our new air force will ensure that the Luftwaffe never again threatens an English home or factory again."
FEN_SLP_Military_mines_of_the_explosive_kind_desc:0 "Britain's pride used to be its navy, but as things currently stand we are outclassed and outgunned. However, a bomb doesn't care if it's a top of the line warship that it destroys - it destroys it all the same. To protect our lands, we must litter the seas with mines. Improved and more efficient mine-laying operations and more explosive and destructive mines are the order of the day.\n\nIf we can't defend Britain with a fleet, we'll make damn well sure that no one else can invade us with one."
FEN_SLP_Military_improving_the_radars_desc:0 "A great part of defeating the enemy is knowing where they are and where they are going to be. Though the Germans were able to pierce through in the War, Radar was such an incredible boon for our forces that it enabled us to hold off their assault for far longer than we'd ever hoped, even if we ultimately failed.\n\nImproved Radar systems and stations all across the Isles will let us know far in advance whether or not an enemy intends to attack, and give us the appropriate time to mobilise an effective response. This time, we'll have them by the scruffs of their necks."
FEN_SLP_Military_deeper_and_more_silent_desc:0 "Our navy is not even a shade of what it used to be, but we have to ask ourselves - what good did it do us? Britain still lost the War to the German wolf-packs and superior naval tactics. As such, an expansive grand navy is surplus to requirements - what we need is to focus on submarine warfare. As assassins kill kings, so too do subs fell battleships and carriers. Britain's navy shall not be grand, but it shall be feared."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_new_generation_of_subs_desc:0 "In our ongoing efforts to emphasise submarine warfare, we've reached a barrier - the simple technical limitations of our current models. There's only so much that can be improved upon before the very nature of what we're improving on becomes the limiting factor. To overcome this, we must design and produce new, better generations of submarines - ones that can delve deeper, travel further, strike silently and slink away into the night with our enemies none the wiser."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "By all accounts the German invasion in 1943 should have been impossible. Operation Sealion should have ended in miserable failure and the complete destruction of the Kriegsmarine. But it didn't. Instead it saw the Royal Navy defeated and the British Isles successfully invaded for the first time since William the Conqueror. Where did it all go wrong? We must examine those dark days closely, to learn what we can from them and ensure that such an invasion never again reaches our shores."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fortifications_desc:0 "For nearly one thousand years before the War, no enemy force stepped foot on British soil. Our defeat in the war came in part from our belief that no force could. We were wrong.

FEN_SLP_Military_a_navy_to_protect_the_trade_desc:0 "The burden of the British public's agricultural demands have far outgrown the Isle's ability to sustain them. We've seen this before, in the War. Rationing, suffering, starvation on the Island; when German ships sank British convoys, the people went hungry, and eventually broke.\n\nWe may remake Britain into an impenetrable Fortress, but all you need to do to take a Fortress is to starve it out. We will not accept this. Our navy's top priority will be the securing of vital imports to our people. Never again shall a Briton starve in their own home."
FEN_SLP_Military_escorting_the_convoys_desc:0 "In order to ensure we never have to suffer shortages of the material kind nor any shortages of food and other supplies, we shall purchase and build more convoy seacraft.

FEN_SLP_Military_improving_upon_the_armor_desc:0 "It has been said that "The best defence is a good offence". This is ridiculous as it is very clear to all in the naval military field that the best defence is six inches of solid steel! If our ships can last longer in the fight then they would be much more able to not only survive but also sink enemy ships and win battles. To this end, we shall research and outfit our ships with the latest and strongest armour available."
FEN_SLP_Military_better_carriers_desc:0 "Ever since the massive naval battles of the Pacific in the Second World War, it has been clear that the future of naval warfare belongs to the carrier. Floating airfields able to dispense dozens of aircraft to support in naval engagements, carriers are the pinnacle of naval design. If we are to survive in a hostile modern Europe we will need a modern navy to defend us. We shall build more and better aircraft carriers to maybe restore the great British Navy of old."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_naval_planes_desc:0 "A carrier without planes is simply a floating slab of metal, a liability, a waste of resources. We need naval aircraft to populate our carriers and our naval aircraft designs are severely out of date.

FEN_SLP_Military_american_designs_desc:0 "It is a simple and unfortunate fact that our designs and designers are decades out of date, due in no small part to our loss in the Second World War and subsequent occupation. While we could attempt to develop our own designs it may be much more effective to licence American designs, not to mention faster. Should the Americans refuse we shall be back to where we started with the additional loss of our dignity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_trade_secured_desc:0 "Now with our fleets modernised and fully equipped, the might of the new British Navy shall be feared and respected worldwide, just as it was in days of yore. As well as this, our new naval forces will be able to ensure that our trade is protected and secured. We shall never have to suffer under another naval blockade and our people shall not go hungry again. Once again we Britannia rules the waves.\n\nRule Britannia."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_army_desc:0 "With the war won, we need to look forward to improving our military using the lessons we learned during all that hard fighting. While our troops evidently performed admirably, there are significant improvements that we can make, particularly in heavy weaponry and organization. Let's create a bigger, better, and more professional army to protect the security of our new England. We shall forever defend our revolution, on our island!\n\nAnd, if possible, spread it further..."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_the_ECW_desc:0 "While we can create a fairly large army, it is likely that in future wars we will be somewhat outnumbered, as we were in the ECW. No amount of conscription or militia troops can change the fact that we are a small island against the whole of Europe. However, we adapted to this in the ECW by using strong, concentrated strike forces to break enemy lines and exploit weaknesses.\n\nWe can use veteran troops as a shock division and use the SAS to complement them in disorganizing enemy units and breaking cohesion in their rear areas. This will mean that we may be outnumbered, but we will never be outgunned at the place and time we choose. Jerry may think himself a master of these tactics, but we will show him a thing or two about English doggedness and strength in adversity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "In both World Wars, conscription has been quite controversial, and it remains so even today. We are a small and industrious nation, and the more men we keep in the factories and off the front lines, the better. However, there are wolves at the door, and some of the hardliners are pressing hard that we need every pair of hands we can get to defend our revolution. Should we fold to them, the government may become more unpopular, but if we don't, who knows what future we have?\n\nIt is time to make a choice about what size our military really needs to be."
FEN_SLP_Military_keeping_the_militias_desc:0 "The militias were a critical part of our victory in the ECW- they provided much needed manpower to hold the line against attacks and could support our regular troops in their assaults. While they may not have the firepower or training of the proposed shock divisions, they are just as necessary to creating a functional army, and we would surely be fools to throw away what we have built during the civil war. We should keep the militias to ensure parity of numbers with larger nations that we may have to fight, and to provide a solid shield against further aggression towards our revolution."
FEN_SLP_Military_effective_strike_forces_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of our concentration policy is to make each division capable of supporting itself in these aggressive actions. Therefore, each division should be sufficiently equipped to make a local breakthrough in its sector. While this means a significant amount of equipment will have to be requisitioned, it will give us an aggressive spirit that cannot be matched, as each divisional commander knows that he can strike the enemy where he is weakest. The initiative will always be with us, and we can choose the field of battle as it suits our lads. Tally ho!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_armed_union_debates_desc:0 "Unions are naturally a central part of our revolution, but arming them could radicalize the workers. Normally, this would be a perfectly good idea, and would afford the average worker a good deal of power, but the stability of the government (and, by extension, the army) is surely a better defence of the revolution than some armed laborers.\n\nHowever, our precarious international situation might mean that we need everyone who can bear arms to do so, should a crisis erupt. The more familiar the people are with arms now, the better they will be as real soldiers later."
FEN_SLP_Military_every_worker_a_soldier_desc:0 "No one can doubt the bravery of our militias, and they played a key role in beating back the reactionary forces that wanted to stop our revolution dead in its tracks. However, the most talented in the militia should probably be shuffled off towards the regular army, as they can benefit more from better training and equipment. Such integration will allow us to better defend ourselves, should the time come, by giving us a reliable reserve of experienced and talented troops to draw upon. We can then supplement the militia's ranks once more, and create an ironclad defence."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tank_models_desc:0 "In order to really achieve a breakthrough, we will need tanks as well as experienced infantry. As of now, our tank arm is hopelessly outdated, and we must integrate new technologies and designs to make sure that our armored formations can meet and defeat every new threat they face on a modern battlefield, including newer anti-tank rockets, mines, and other tanks. Once we have the firepower to match, we can create a real modern army with great striking power."
FEN_SLP_Military_thunder_and_lightning_desc:0 "The next war will be thoroughly modern, and that means we need the firepower to match. Our artillery designs are too old and dated to be of much use on quickly moving battlefields, and so we must push forward new and innovative designs that will give our soldiers the edge in a tough fight. Combined with our new tactics and experienced troops, this will give us a winning formula when the next challenge comes."
FEN_SLP_Military_an_army_to_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "We have the tanks! We have the weapons! We have the soldiers! With the core of our army complete, we have a professional, battle-hardened army with the best equipment in Europe. Our safety, and the safety of our revolution, is now assured. When the time comes, they'll fight for the revolution, and they'll win!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_air_force_desc:0 "After the Second World War, our proud air force was entirely dismantled. To defend our island effectively, we need air superiority over English skies. Since we barely have a leg to stand on now, we can totally rebuild our air force from the ground up, while sticking to the principles that once made our air force the envy of the world. We will need new planes, new pilots, and new air ports, but a revitalized air force would be the backbone of our new armed forces."
FEN_SLP_Military_more_pilots_desc:0 "While planes are a rather important part of any air force, they are not the only things required. It is our pilots that will give us the advantage, even over a numerically superior opponent. We need to look at all the talent in England to pick the very best of the best, and this includes women as well as men. Once we have recruited, tested, and trained top-shelf pilots, only then can we develop the other infrastructure required to keep England safe from aerial attack."
FEN_SLP_Military_praising_the_Aces_desc:0 "Albert Ball, "Bob" Braham, "Johnnie" Johnson - these are the names people remember, true knights of the air that defended the skies of England and France in the heydays of the Empire. We need to emulate their fighting spirit in our new air force, as well as use our new combat leaders as recruiting tools to motivate potential pilots to sign up for their own shot at glory. With luck, we can establish the same esprit du corps that made our pilots legendary throughout the world as doughty fighters."
FEN_SLP_Military_airforce_american_designs_desc:0 "While we certainly have the flying and fighting spirit required to make a top-notch air force, our engineering department is a bit short-staffed at the moment. We will need time to catch up in that area, and time is something we just don't have enough of right now. We need top-of-the-line aircraft, immediately, and so we may want to turn to those with established industries. The Americans are already somewhat amicable towards us, and would always be willing to sell weapons to nations that Germany dislikes. Their first-rate planes, with our first-rate pilots, surely cannot be beat!"
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "The innovative design of the Mosquito fighter-bomber was born of desperation, but was shockingly fast and agile for its role. In today's jet age, we may be able to take the same concept of a high-speed light bomber and create a multi-role aircraft that is quick on the attack and agile in defence. This would be able to defend the homeland by striking at invading forces while still being a threat across the channel to any hostile power."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fighters_desc:0 "The elegant Spitfire was the backbone of our interceptor air defences during the Blitz, and would go on to serve many roles in the War. The sleek lines, high speed, and excellent maneuverability made it perfect against escorting fighters in a close-up fight. We will need a new generation of interceptors if we are to prevent England from being destroyed from the air, and this means relying on the same principles of old. Our new fighter designs will have to be the best of the best to protect England from any airborne menace."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_CAS_desc:0 "The Typhoon fighter-bomber was not so elegant as the Spitfire, nor as nimble as the Mosquito- but it got the job done. The raw firepower and reliability it possessed in a neat little airframe was perfect for its role, and should not be underestimated. These same principles of getting the job done with simplicity and practicality should be emulated in our new generation of fighter-bombers, to ensure that any invader gets a handful when they hit the beaches."
FEN_SLP_Military_rebuilding_the_airports_desc:0 "We certainly need pilots and planes to build an air force, but we need airports for them to fly from if they're to do anything useful. This means hangars, asphalt, concrete, fueling stations, and all the menagerie of maintenance required to keep aeroplanes up in the air. All this will take time and money, but we have to get it done quickly if we are to ensure that organization, refitting, and training can begin. Let's get paving!"
FEN_SLP_Military_more_AA_desc:0 "Our radar and anti-aircraft systems helped greatly during the Blitz, and modern air defence networks can render friendly skies an extremely uncomfortable place for enemy aircraft. Distributed and protected missile batteries with radar stations and spotters can attrit an enemy air force and provide invaluable information to our pilots in the sky, who can be directed to attack what remains in the most optimal fashion."

FEN_SLP_Econ_the_road_to_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the Socialist Labour Party recently elected, it has fallen on Prime Minister Wilson to bear the burden of sorting out the economic situation England finds herself in. Wilson was elected on a platform of widespread government intervention in the economy and more generally getting England back into shape, what with her economy hamstrung by the economic crisis of the 50's and the recent Civil War both.\n\nThis reconstruction will be a long process, but thanks to the combined support of both our wings and a steady plan to implement our reforms we are closer than ever to reaching the socialist ideal. What came before was a broken world, and upon its ashes we shall build a better one. A just one. A fair one."
FEN_SLP_Econ_financing_our_reforms_desc:0 "Unfortunately, England is not a socialist paradise just yet. To reach the goals we have set out for ourselves the Wilson Government will need to gather the necessary funds, something that cannot be covered by OFN aid and our existing industrial infrastructure alone. We need money, and our government has two options on how to get it.\n\nThe first and probably easiest choice is for England to focus on the basics, raw resources and their exports which are valuable no matter when or to whom you sell them. This would probably sit well with our allies in Washington. The other option at our disposal is to turn England into the capitalist world's chief manufacturer of consumer goods. A risky option, it also gives us the chance to make England more than a pawn for the rest of the world. Yet, a choice must be made."
FEN_SLP_Econ_focus_on_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Part of the reality that England must now face is the fact thproat we can no longer survive off of our former colonies resources. The Socialist Labour Party has thus turned to more traditional methods of acquiring income. The Americans it seems have an ever increasing market for finished goods, but they don't produce a great amount of some devices themselves due to the expense in making them over the Atlantic outweighing the profits. We don't have that problem.\n\nThe necessary living wage for an English labourer is low even if we increase it threefold, and importing materials en masse is hardly a chore. Thus the Wilson government proposes a plan under which England shall aim to become invaluable to the OFN not just through strategic position, but as their primary source of consumer goods."
FEN_SLP_Econ_factories_in_the_cities_desc:0 "The majority of the current English factories aren't located within the major metropolitan areas, and whilst this might make the cities nice and livable it also limits the number of people willing to work away from their homes. But we are not capitalists limited by bourgeois concerns such as the view over our cities. Our people need jobs and we will give them just that.\n\nLondon, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle can be expanded into first, after that we can aim for York, Hull and Liverpool. Eventually every city in England will have its own independent industrial base, which is good because the amount of interest in cheap English goods is already rising."
FEN_SLP_Econ_more_fuel_to_the_fire_desc:0 "No furnace will run without coal, and fortunately England has a rather large amount of it. Not quite so much as neighbouring Wales, but we can make do with what we have at the present time.\n\nOur government will ensure a direct route from the mines to the furnaces, we don't have many close buyers of coal in any case since the Germans are not what one might call friendly. The jobs from this endeavour will keep many a family fed, and what kind of socialists would we be if we deserted one of our major supporting groups during the Civil War. We have many friends amongst the union veterans, and it's time we gave them their due."
FEN_SLP_Econ_workers_in_the_factories_desc:0 "Factories need the people to work them, and neither money nor threats will fix that as the fascist collaborators all too often forgot. We of the Socialist Labour Party have a different, and dare we say, better solution.\n\nWe'll simply pay the workers a wage worth his sweat. The Marxist dislike of factories after all has traditionally stemmed from the fact that they exploit the workers efforts for more money than they contribute to the process in labour themselves. This will continue unfortunately as the capitalists will fight anything else, but the least we can do is give our workers a fair share of the profits. Throw in some excellent benefits and a factory position might not seem so bad a job for the youth of today."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_means_of_mass_production_desc:0 "Where once it was the job of the craftsman to create artisanal works, nowadays we use more refined and efficient methods to make the objects of men's desires. Machines, turning and grinding in vast clockwork formations which create England's salvation. Factories are more efficient than ever, and with rudimentary computing technology we can increase the efficiency to levels thought impossible once upon a time.\n\nThe benefits from this mass production will be used to increase the standard of living for all our people, for we'll not be limited just by what we make for others, we can make goods for ourselves as well."
FEN_SLP_Econ_export_to_the_OFN_desc:0 "America is like a furnace, into the maw of the great beast goes resources and materials the likes of which ten thousand England's could never hope to consume, and out of the fires comes enough money to fund our reforms six times over. The rest of the OFN are interested in our proposals as well, not having to deal with a problem is an instinctive capitalist response, and if we build things cheaper is that not merely the hand of the market in action?\n\nThe facts of the matter are that now we have committed to our course we cannot falter. If we want to turn England into a paradise our children will enjoy, we must make some compromises here and now. Empty pockets won't fund schools or hospitals, but the American money will."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_workshop_of_the_freeworld_desc:0 "If something is made, chances are it was made by an Englishmen and it's three times cheaper than what the American is trying to sell you. The recent years have been good for English business and now we make what the rest of the world is growing ever hungrier for. Be it toys, machines, or computers; we can design it, build it and improve upon it.\n\nThis has not been without sacrifice of course, it is backbreaking work and our people will need to be well compensated for any potential injuries incurred in the making of this economic miracle. But now that we have the needed funds, we can give them everything they earned and more. The Socialist Labour Party can move forward with our true reforms."
FEN_SLP_Econ_keeping_the_workers_fed_desc:0 "Hungry mouths make for precious little work, and unfortunately England has had to deal with the reality that we don't make quite enough to feed our current population. Importing food is expensive, and whilst we might never export it in great quantities again there is no reason why the Wilson Government cannot correct this fault, for the sake of the people, not for profit.\n\nFunds are as always an issue, but the Socialist Labour Party is broadly on board with two potential options. We can invest significantly in conventional agriculture, which might not be so profitable but it'd be a nice public relations boost and ingratiate us with the rural population. Or we could see about upgrading and expanding our fishing fleet, it's not like the cod is ever going to run out after all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_fund_the_farms_desc:0 "The heart of the English spirit has long been the yeoman farmer, they who till the land and bring forth the spoils for the people to feast. But the industrial revolution led to the abolition of many commons and English agriculture has been on the decline since the reign of Queen Victoria.\n\nIf our government provides funds to expand the farms we have, we should be capable of producing enough food to keep the English people from being at risk of starving should a storm wrack the North Sea or the fisheries die. The grain, vegetables and meat from these farms can be put to other uses as well, school provided lunches perhaps could be a start."
FEN_SLP_Econ_subsidize_the_fisheries_desc:0 "Seafood was not traditionally a well integrated part of the English diet outside coastal towns and cities. Previous governments never really put in the efforts necessary to keep a truly massive fishing fleet running despite the potential benefits. This like many things changed with the German invasion.\n\nWith trade links severed England found herself lacking sufficient agriculture to produce food for all her people, and bereft of the trade lanes which had traditionally supplied preserved and canned goods. The Wilson government for its part does not aim to simply make do though. We will feed our people with the seas bounty, and increase our shipbuilding industry whilst we're at it. We just have to hope the people don't mind cod."
FEN_SLP_Econ_accelerate_mechanization_desc:0 "One of the downsides to being isolated from your empire as a whole and most of your major allies for near on three decades is the fact that you fall behind technologically somewhat. Doubly so when merely rebuilding what was bombed into smithereens is your primary problem.\n\nBut the Socialist Labour Party was not elected to sit around and let the market fix things, a programme to mechanise agriculture and fishing will go down well with the farmers who need every pence of their harvest, the Americans who we purchase the machinery from will doubtless also be pleased with their gains. This will be an expensive exercise to say the least, yet the long term gains from cheap food for our people should not be understated."
FEN_SLP_Econ_our_natural_wealth_desc:0 "England is a critically underutilised land, perhaps surprisingly so considering that for many decades we were the premier trade power of the planet. Gypsum, tungsten, tin, coal, iron, copper, limestone, salt, dolomite, clay and even sand are all things which England possesses in abundance and we exploit a surprisingly small amount of it.\n\nBut within these fancily named rocks and dirt lies the secret to the rejuvenation of the English economy. With some investment we can turn the English economy, at least temporarily into one revolving around the exportation of our raw resources. This will have an excellent profit margin and give us the funds we need to reform our nation into a more diverse, advanced and most importantly recovered economy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_expand_english_steel_desc:0 "The steel of English workers built the battleships which once set the whole world quaking to their knees. The steel of English workers forged wonders and terrors alike at the behest of their overlords in the upper classes. Now that very same steel is not in the hands of the bourgeoisie or the aristocracy, but in the workers hands. The peoples hands.\n\nThe Socialist Labour Party will need more steel than ever, but not to build wasteful exhibitions of our grandeur. No we shall build the things the people need. Houses and highways, hospitals and dams and railroads too and fro. We shall expand the steel mills threefold, we shall build the foundations of an industry which won't just sustain our people for now, but for centuries to come."
FEN_SLP_Econ_a_new_deal_for_coal_desc:0 "Black gold, that's what some of the more excitable capitalists once called the material which built the English Industrial Revolution. Coal miners made up a not inconsiderable part of our militias during the Civil War too, is it not right and just that we repay their aid in our day of need?\n\nLuckily for us, coal is still profitable for the capitalists. The OFN simply can't get enough of it. If we were to increase our production, perhaps even create some new mines to exploit untapped seams coal could well form the bedrock of our future economic plans. Unlike the capitalists of old however we will ensure that our people see the benefits from this, with reinvestments into the community and job opportunities given to diversify coal focused towns."
FEN_SLP_Econ_efficiency_through_socialism_desc:0 "The bosses of traditional mines and quarries were notoriously cruel men. Who got their quotas by forcing the workers to slave away in poor conditions with little safety for less pay. Perhaps this was somehow acceptable to the bourgeois who once ran this nation. Perhaps they thought if it was out of sight it was most assuredly out of mind. But we are the peoples representatives, their choice. We are different.\n\nBy giving the workers rights over their professions we return the control of labour to the people. By enforcing democracy we do away with the system of capitalism which crushed our forefathers under its wheels for centuries. Most of all, by removing the rich at the top of the chain, we unleash a peoples innovative spirit long suppressed."
FEN_SLP_Econ_imrpove_our_equipment_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our industrial ambitions we've run into a bit of a snag. Namely, our technology for producing and refining those resources is almost three decades out of date at this point. This is partly the result of our former bourgeoise overlords being notorious cheapskates, partially due to the fact that we were cut off from the Americans and the Germans never trusted the Royal Party as far as they could throw them, and mostly due to the fact that England was and still is a dirt poor nation.\n\nLuckily for us, the Americans are willing to foot the bill somewhat for replacing some of the more expensive and advanced pieces. They want our resources after all, no sense in getting them slowly."
FEN_SLP_Econ_enter_american_markets_desc:0 "America is locust, a great insect on the face of the world gnawing at the resources of a hundred different nations. Never satisfied and never full. Yet the great locust is ultimately a far better choice than the wasp of Germany lurking over the channel. Seeking to invade and parisitise us if they get even the smallest chance.\n\nWe will give the Americans the raw resources they so desire, we will give them all they want and more so that their money flows into our coffers to benefit our people. The workers of England will live a good life anew with the profits of their labours. The Americans in return will get the materials needed to fuel their ceaseless military-industrial complex. Both of us win really."
FEN_SLP_Econ_profits_from_trade_desc:0 "Trade has always been one of the more profitable endeavours for Englishmen, with records showing our island had links to the rest of the world from as early as the bronze age. But decades of bourgeoise neglect and skimming off the top have caused our earnings to plummet.\n\nYet with a new government new opportunities have been taken advantage of. The Americans, once ally turned foe turned ally again are more than happy to purchase vast quantities of ore and metals that our island is rich in. Soon with the money rolling in the Socialist Labour Party will be able to undertake the economic reforms we so desperately need to keep our nation whole. Our people have jobs, we have friends overseas, and all it cost was some dirt."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_five_giants_desc:0 "The Beveridge Report is a moderately sized document written during the course of the Second World War. Though buried by the Royal Party and their fascist colleagues in the aftermath of our defeat and the collapse of the British Empire, in the minds of the Labour members of the Left Resistance the report persevered.\n\nNow that the Socialist Labour Party is the one in power, we have a duty to uphold. We shall scourge from England the great evils of the world, our people will be free from disease, want for nothing, be enlightened, live in good housing and have every opportunity to benefit from their work. Everything before now has led up to this, we shall give the people the lives they always wished for and deserved. Regardless of what the reactionaries say."
FEN_SLP_Econ_want_desc:0 "England has had a limited social security for years now, but the Collaborationist government always declined to expand it to the people who needed it most, and so as always the Socialist Labour Party falls into the responsibility of fixing others' mistakes. Unemployment subsidies will give a great deal of aid to the more unfortunate members of our society, but we can additionally expand the social security system outright to cover a whole range of potential problems for the poorest members of our nation. Food stamps, grants of money to first time families, subsidies for community buildings and basic repairs. All things which our people cannot afford that we the government can give them. That we shall give them. Harold Wilson will not suffer England to be anything less than perfect in this."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_land_distribution_act_desc:0 "The two wings of our party have always squabbled somewhat, but there is something on which we are in full agreement. The bourgeoisie and the aristocracy own far too great a portion of the land area of England even now, and what did they do to earn this benefit? In the age of the industrial revolution it was the land owners who abolished the commons and seized all the property for themselves from small freeholding farmers.\n\nSo let us begin the Socialist Labour Party's most ambitious project yet. An act of parliament which will redistribute the agricultural land of England to the communities who work it. Miners and farmers and fishermen alike. Compensation will be given to the rich, but that is all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_disease_desc:0 "Our nation suffers, there is no great system of public hospitals or free treatments like some of the more enlightened places of the world, but that can be changed. National Insurance is a term used to refer to the programme wherein in return for an income tax the average person will have compensation for workplace related injuries or illnesses amongst other things. Greatly easing the burden of the ill and injured on their families.\n\nThe income tax won't be especially popular in some areas, yet it is the wealthy who shall shoulder most of the burden here and so it shouldn't impact our popularity by any great amount. Besides, they will receive the benefits of socialism too."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_health_service_act_desc:0 "Healthcare has long been one of the main goals of the Socialist Labour Party, and now we are in a position where we can implement it. Why should the working man have to worry about needing to visit the doctors because they lack the money to pay? Why should women be forced to resort to midwives rather than hospital beds? Why must men and women pay for their children's vaccines, insulin and so on out of their own pockets?\n\nThey should not, and thanks to the National Health Service Act they will never have to again. This comprehensive piece of legislation will establish a nationwide healthcare system paid for by the state which will ensure no person ever need worry about necessary procedures, medicines and treatments for as long as our government is in power."
FEN_SLP_Econ_ignorance_desc:0 "Harold Wilson was an academic before circumstance forced him into the life of a revolutionary and leader, but remnants of the former economics lecturer remain in his policies still. The Socialist Labour Party is committed in its entirety to the ideal of a comprehensive and effective school system for the future students of England, to the end of promoting this the government will issue grants to a great number of school programmes and improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the great universities which shaped many of England's finest in past times will receive funding of their own to restore their glories. No longer will we look to the rest of the world for academic success, as in all things England shall forge her own."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_opprotunity_act_desc:0 "Schooling is not an easy burden for a family to bear. It is expensive, and when your child might not even get the proper use out of his schooling a seeming dead end for many families across England. Yet are we not the party of the people? Are we not socialists in the image of Marx, Atlee and Pollit? We should not let what has been convention define us in improving our nation. Indeed, Harold Wilson has crafted an act to ensure we need never worry about this problem again.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Act will make all schooling and most higher education free for all Englishmen and women provided they get the results to enter. As we do this, we ought not think of the costs, but of the benefits to our nation and people from many young minds not being hindered by birth. This was a good act."
FEN_SLP_Econ_squalor_desc:0 "The bombs of Germany destroyed vast swathes of old English housing, swathes which have never been properly rebuilt if we are honest. London once home to a beautiful scenery now also shares its land with slums stretching as far as the eye can see. So too do many of our fellow cities and towns across England, and the civil war only made the situation even more dire.\n\nRegrettable though it may be, we must clear out these slums to build affordable housing for the English people, the first step of this will not be popular with anyone and most likely hated in London in particular, but it is necessary. Provided we stagger the clearances and buildings, we should even avoid a homelessness crisis."
FEN_SLP_Econ_peoples_housing_act_desc:0 "Now that the slums have been cleared, the Socialist Labour Party can begin our work on solving the matter of squalor for good. The People's Housing Act lays out the plan for the construction of a great series of government owned housing tenements and buildings across England for the purposes of affordable housing. Whilst not luxurious, they will be modern dwellings in which the English poor shall have opportunities to get themselves out of the cycle of poverty with our assistance.\n\nThe necessity of this act is great enough that both factions of our party agree in principle even. A sight few thought they would see without great prompting by the leadership."
FEN_SLP_Econ_idleness_desc:0 "For all that convservative reactionaries like to go on about how we socialists encourage people to be lazy with their lives and government support, they forget that the vast majority of people are quite willing to take any work offered when in a state of unemployment. Thus if we the government provide the steady and decently paying work, a large number of people will be suddenly in a position of becoming productive members of the economy once more.\n\nWe might have to nationalize a good many industries to achieve this, the companies are unlikely to cooperate of their own accord, but the results will most assuredly be worth it. Nationalization will additionally assist us in preventing the Americans from having a deathgrip on our economy, but that is mostly unrelated to our decision."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_minimum_wage_act_desc:0 "Why is it that the average worker should have to subsist on a minimum wage barely updated since the days of the Royal Party? Are we not better than the fascists who betrayed England to the Germans? Harold Wilson certainly seems to think so, and he's tasked the Socialist Labour Party with drawing up new legislation on the subject of the minimum wage.\n\nWe'll have to raise it carefully and in a controlled manner of course, yet the benefits of the raise will still take some time to make themselves apparent. The long term effects of the National Minimum Wage Act will mean the average Englishman having more capital to contribute to the economy amongst other things, so even the reactionaries ought to be happy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_health_and_needs_divison_desc:0 "We have in recent times done a great deal of legislation and policy making which focuses towards societal matters. Healthcare, wages, housing, education and so on. It might better serve the people of England to bring changes to these things under the banner of one governmental organisation.\n\nThe Health and Needs Division, HAND, will be at the forefront of implementing future governmental aid and support programmes of our welfare state. HAND will also act to advise the government on the potential effects of new changes and current policies, assisting us in maintaining a high state of living for the average Englishman regardless of his personal wealth."
FEN_SLP_Econ_signs_of_recovery_desc:0 "It seems to have worked. The efforts of years, decades of revolutionary activities are beginning to show once and for all the potential of socialism under the English model. When one looks across England they will not see the poverty and rubble of times past but instead a land finally beginning to recover from the ravages of war.\n\nHealthcare and education are free, jobs are plentiful and the minimum wage high. This is the dream of our forefathers, and with some luck it is something we can maintain into the future for all our children. Even the National Democratic League are starting to come around, so surprising as it may be, this England looks set to last the ages in prosperity."

ENG_DECCAT_PreEcwHmmlrGuns:0 "HMMLR-OFN Relations"
ENG_DECCAT_PreEcwHmmlrGuns_desc:0 "Naturally, to conduct any serious operation requires weapons. This means rifles, grenades, ammunition, etc. We need to prepare ourselves for a general uprising as well, which will require arming even more people than we do now. One way to get this is through... Legally questionable means, namely the gun trade.\n\nWe can get guns through OFN countries using contacts friendly to us. However, the actual number of our guns that get through is dependent on how unstable northern England is.\n\nOnce we openly confront the government, these guns will be issued as §BInfantry Equipment§! to our troops. The lower the §BState Stability§! is in Newcastle, Lancashire, and Yorkshire, the higher the chances of our guns getting through, and less will be lost to the government.

ENG_DEC_HmmlrGunsSmall_desc:0 "Guns are what make the world go round, or at least it seems that way for a prospective revolutionary organisation. Fortuitously, we have the Organization of Free Nations sitting upon a veritable mountain of guns just waiting to be smuggled over. The entry point will be somewhere in the North where we can guarantee privacy from probing traitor eyes, we should take care to ensure Collaborationist activity in the area is minimal.\n\nRequires a minimum level of §xLow§! §YHMMLR§!-§MOFN§!

ENG_DEC_HmmlrGunsMedium_desc:0 "Why have some guns when you can have many guns? Perhaps the Americans have been a bad influence on our organisation for that question is one that is popping up with increasing frequency. We will need to ensure that the English North is mostly supportive of us to get the shipment in undetected, but otherwise things should be fine. That said, the Collaborationists catching wind of this would not be good.\n\nAmount of guns smuggled will vary based on the pair of North England states with the lowest average stability; maximum possible number of guns gained is 500."

Anything else and it might all be for nothing.\n\nRequires a minimum level of §GHigh§! §YHMMLR§!-§MOFN§! Relations.

ENG_DEC_HmmlrGunsSpecialFirst_desc:0 "The major advantage held by the Collaborationist government over our own forces at this time is that they have a small number of dedicated armoured units and we do not. This is something that needs to be changed and fast, the Americans are the only ones we can even hope to ask, but equally as important we want an iron grasp on the English north where we plan to smuggle them in. If the Americans agree and our control is secure, the first tanks under our control should arrive soon.\n\nShipment success will then depend on whether the average stability of all three North England states is 30% or lower.\n§xThere are 3 total shipments to make and cannot 'retry' a failed shipment!§!"

We can ask the Americans for another shipment, but in order for it to reach us we will need control of the English North to remain unchallenged, at least for the moment. If the Collaborationist Government becomes aware of this they might strike at our efforts.\n\nShipment success will then depend on whether the average stability of all three North England states is 30% or lower."
ENG_DEC_HmmlrOFNContacts:0 "Reach Out to OFN Contacts"
ENG_DEC_HmmlrOFNContacts_desc:0 "The United States of America might be the primary member of the OFN, but it is far from the only one. In Canada former members of the government are willing to speak and if need be act on our behalf, in Australia and New Zealand there are exiles aplenty whilst the Caribbean Federation holds a great deal of wealth which might be diverted towards our cause. Let us reach out to these groups, and let us asking them for one final effort. With the promise of a Free England at the end of it.\n§YThis will result in a large OFN relationship boost.§!"
ENG_DEC_HmmlrUSAPoliticians:0 "Reach Out to USA Politicians"
ENG_DEC_HmmlrUSAPoliticians_desc:0 "HMMLR can boast of public acclaim in the United States for sure, but as with any nation the true power lies within those who lead it. Luckily for us, elements of all parties appear to be willing to hear us out. The NPP have a grudging respect for the Left Resistance and close ties between the Republican Democrats and HMMLR proper have existed since the war.

ENG_DEC_HmmlrUSAMediaCampaign_desc:0 "The United States of America represents the largest portion of potential OFN support, far more even than our Canadian connections can grant us. It might be worth investing in a series of media campaigns to accrue public interest in HMMLR and its cause. Interviews with members of our organisation based in Ottawa broadcast to screens and radio sets all across America would give us a massive amount of public sympathy and potentially, support.

ENG_DEC_HmmlrOFNSpeakers:0 "Pro-HMMLR Speakers Tour the OFN"
ENG_DEC_HmmlrOFNSpeakers_desc:0 "Very rarely, the diverse nature of our organisation can come in useful for accruing notoriety and support overseas. HMMLR might not be the most appealing of rebel organisations to every potential public figure in the OFN, but we alone can appeal to socialists with the Left Resistance, military hawks with Stirling's men and idealists with HMMLR proper. No other rebel group has even been able to claim so much support, and we will need every bit of it. Overtime our popularity gain could be quite substantial.\n§YThis will result in multiple small OFN relationship boosts over time.§!"

ENG_intro.1.t:0 "The Copper and the Rebel"
ENG_intro.1.desc:0 "Timothy O'Flaherty considered himself about as normal as one could be under the circumstances. He'd left school once he could read and write, followed his dad into being a bobby once he met the age requirements, got to the rank of Inspector and even found a nice lass to settle down with. But the rest of the world? Tim happened to think the rest of the world wasn't so normal at all.\n\nThe Police hadn't changed so much since the Germans invaded. Tim had never gotten the chance to fight-London surrendered before the Germans reached his unit's position-but he'd known more than a few good men who didn't live to see the war's end. In his eyes, it was what had come after that had been worse: the London Uprising, not to mention the constant terrorism; not by Fenians, but by Englishmen against their German tyrants. And Tim had to stop them. But whatever he thought of the government, they had a point. The rebels winning might well end in the Germans coming back, and for his wife and daughters' sake, he'd do anything to prevent that.\n\nPassing Inspector O'Flaherty was Griselda Robins, a young woman whom the police would probably put a great amount of effort finding if they knew who she was. Griselda had grown up under the boo; she watched the Germans kill her friends in the London Uprising, and watched her brother beg on the streets because he couldn't earn a living with his leg blown off. No matter what the Government promised, the Germans hadn't left.\n\nWhich was why she'd joined HMMLR. It hadn't been easy. Griselda had followed rumors for months before they noticed her, and after she passed a test of loyalty she'd ended up joining the local cell. London might be the home for the traitors, after all, but they were an arrogant bunch who couldn't even notice those moving beneath their feet."
ENG_intro.1.a:0 "The die is cast."

ENG_intro.2.t:0 "The Man with a Plan"
ENG_intro.2.desc:0 "Of course the idiot had decided to do a speech, Prime Minister Alexander Douglas-Home cursed in the privacy of his own head. Sometimes he really did wish that the Germans hadn't demanded they put the sorry fop of King George's elder brother back on the throne and instead allowed them to keep the man who knew how to be a good King. On occasion, Home even wished that he'd never been talked into accepting the post of Prime Minister in the first place. Four years might be the longest term served of anyone since the war but they had been a truly horrendous four years indeed. But it wasn't going to be his problem for much longer, he supposed. What was the harm in letting the fool say some fancy words to calm a population who by and large despised him?\n\nThat said, Home did have to make sure that the King finished his speech alive. The peace with the Germans was tenuous and Home didn't know how the Garrison in Cornwall might react to the death of the monarch when there was no clear heir; the slimy bastard Halder was like a fish when it came to reading his expressions, all gaping noise and nothing intelligible. It came down to ensuring that HMMLR didn't interfere. Something easier said than done.\n\nProgress had been made ever since Home had put Philby on the case of finding the rats that would bring England to its doom, but it was a slow thing. They hid up in the North where the traitorous Scots could covertly support them and where his own government held less influence than they ought to amongst the endless stacks of industrial towns and rugged wilderness. But that, Home reflected, was a problem for another day. Time to decide what the King's speech ought to be about."
ENG_intro.2.a:0 "A traitor or a saviour? It depends upon your point of view."

ENG_intro.3.t:0 "Hard Work"
ENG_intro.3.desc:0 "As Tim O'Flaherty stared down at the report he was about to send up to the top of the ranks, he wondered: why was it always Monday when this sort of thing happened? The London Uprising had started on a Monday, his old dog had died on a Monday, and now on a Monday afternoon he was having to report that he might have discovered a plot to blow up the King at the speech the newspapers were harping on about.\n\nHe scowled. It had to be him, didn't it, and when he'd figured out the little thief had been hiding something he hadn't delegated or passed it on - no, he'd done the interrogation hisself. It was his job to protect the people of London, wasn't it, and something like blowing up the King - well, O'Flaherty didn't exactly know what the politicians would call it, but his dad might have referred to it as a bloody bad time all around.\n\nBut, on the bright side, O'Flaherty might get some overtime pay out of the whole affair, with pay no less. And possibly a promotion too for discovering it. A promotion might pay quite a few quid extra, and he could get his girls some of those nice dolls he saw in the fancy toy stores for Christmas. Or maybe get Martha a going-out dress to replace the one she'd bought for the honeymoon? Hell, he could grab a proper fishing boat, if a small one, on a Chief Inspector's pay.\n\nTim O'Flaherty sent in the report with a bit more vigor than he had initially intended."
ENG_intro.3.a:0 "We all have dreams."

ENG_intro.4.t:0 "The King Unloved"
ENG_intro.4.desc:0 "Edward VIII of the House of Windsor sat with his wife as they ate dinner, but his mind wasn't on the love of his life, or the undeniably fine meal of salmon that sat in front of him, but instead on the damn speech. Why on earth had he agreed to it? He knew he wasn't popular, even compared to the low point following the end of the war. Wasn't that an achievement - right alongside being the first King in 400 years to rule only England? The Prime Minister had sent him a letter of recommended topics, but Edward felt they were a bit too obtuse. Supporting the government was all well and good, but there was such a thing as brown-nosing.\n\nPerhaps he should ask Wallis? She had been terribly depressed not to be able to visit America for two decades, perhaps a bit of involvement in the government process might cheer her up? But as he glanced at his beloved wife's face Edward knew he couldn't do it, she would worry and fret and make the whole thing so much harder on herself than it ought to be.\n\nWhat Edward was worried about most, however, was not his wife or the Prime Minister, but that band of terrorists loyal to his niece in Canada. 'Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance' - what tosh. But they were very real, and very dangerous. It was one thing to know that men like the madman Stirling or the traitorous communist Bill Alexander were out there; it was quite another to know that some shadowy figure had united them under a common cause - to end his miserable reign.\n\nLater that evening, as he went to sleep with a heart roiled by sadness and anger, he looked out of the window, wishing things had gone differently all those years ago."
ENG_intro.4.a:0 "A tragedy, in more ways than one."

ENG_intro.5.t:0 "Hidden Beneath Their Feet"
ENG_intro.5.desc:0 "Griselda was part of one of the only HMMLR cells inside the City of London proper, and probably the only one which wasn't outright underground. At first she'd been just a regular member, but with those above her being continually killed or driven out by the collabs, she soon found herself the leader of the cell.\n\nMost of her days consisted of working as a barmaid in a pub sympathetic to the cause, listening in on conversations and keeping an eye out for new recruits. Every now and then, though, her cell would get some real work, smuggling out firearms, explosives, or even important people to cells in other parts of the country. Of course, sometimes the higher ups wanted her to do something. As far as Griselda knew, she answered to whomever coordinated London proper, but she never saw them and only got marching orders through a dead drop or a coded letter.\n\nIf she were to be honest with herself, Griselda wasn't that fussed on the return of the Queen, or whatever the official line was. Griselda wanted revenge against those who had betrayed England, and if HMMLR were the ones offering, who was she to turn them down? She was part of the fight for freedom, and she would die for it if need be."
ENG_intro.5.a:0 "The motivations of a person can be as simple as a knife or a complex as a maze."

ENG_intro.6.t:0 "The Stirrings of a Plan"
ENG_intro.6.desc:0 "No one quite knew who 'The Boss' actually was. Oh, to be sure, everyone knew of Mad David Stirling and the Red General Alexander. One had refused to surrender with the rest of the army and had fought on since the end of the war, and the other was the most notorious communist to have escaped Cable Street. Some thought those two were the leaders of HMMLR and 'The Boss' was a smokescreen, a fiction to keep the traitors' attention elsewhere.\n\nGriselda personally thought that unlikely as she looked at the two. In spite of their collegiality in pointing out key locations on the map of London, all she could think about was that they obviously didn't like each other very much. It was the small things, the way Stirling grimaced when Alexander rebuked his idea of placing dynamite on the bridge on account of the casualties, or how Alexander frowned when Stirling suggested his men would be better suited to an open attempt on the King.\n\nGriselda was at the meeting because she was the highest ranking Cell Leader in London not forced underground, a sobering thought considering that she wasn't even in her thirties. There'd been plenty who came before her, and plenty who'd come after, it seemed - and that was when an idea formed in her mind.\n\n"What if I do it?" She interrupted in a small voice.\n\nThe two HMMLR leaders looked up at her in surprise. Bill Alexander gestured for her to continue whilst Stirling looked her over with a fresh eye, as if searching for something he'd missed before.\n\n"I mean, I walk through that square each day for work. The bobbies know me well enough that they won't think twice about why I'm going so close to the cordon." Griselda stopped and awaited the two's response.\n\nIn the end, it was Stirling who answered. "How familiar are you with grenade throwing?""
ENG_intro.6.a:0 "HMMLR has all sorts, including the brave ones."

ENG_intro.7.t:0 "A Plan in Motion"
ENG_intro.7.desc:0 "He had no doubt that right as he was standing over the map of London, the reactionaries would be sending a dozen raids after him in England's north. Such a shame they didn't realise he was in a basement not a kilometre away from Buckingham Palace itself. Bill Alexander chuckled at the thought, gaining the attention of the man next to him.\n\nSometimes, Bill regretted signing the Left Resistance up with HMMLR, and any time he had to work personally with David Stirling only made the feeling resurface. The man was effective, to be sure: Stirling had kept his commandos alive by sheer unrelenting determination for nearly twenty years. But he was also ruthless and unconcerned with civilian casualties, which made Bill's think he was quite possibly mad.\n\nBill had his men smuggle in the grenades in the days before his arrival, and Philby had sent word that the reactionaries still thought Bill was in Manchester. Stirling, in turn, had escorted Bill down to 'traitor central' as the ex-SAS referred to London. The King wouldn't like the welcome they had prepared for him.\n\nStirling was glancing at him to see if the chuckle had meant anything, but Bill just waved him off. "The evacuation point is a boat in the Thames which will take your north, you understand? Finish any unfinished business you have here, because you won't be coming back any time soon." To her credit, Griselda, the local HMMLR cell leader, just nodded, committing the plan to memory.\n\nAgainst his expectations, Bill was starting to have a good feeling about the whole exercise. He only hoped Claude was handling things in his absence."
ENG_intro.7.a:0 "Let's get the party started."

ENG_intro.8.t:0 "The King and the Pauper"
ENG_intro.8.desc:0 "Edward VIII listened as the Chief of the City of London Police outlined his plans for security with something approaching a dull interest. The King of England didn't really know why the man insisted upon having so many rotations of guards about the location of the speech, but given recent events Edward was inclined to listen.\n\nWhispers had reached Edward that HMMLR intended to kill him at the speech, something that he had initially refused to believe. Surely, no group loyal to his niece would kill the reigning monarch? At the same time, a voice in his head had asked: 'What if they were right?' Edward hadn't gotten any sleep for days; Wallis had noticed and started fretting, only making the whole affair worse. Edward had resolved to not have her present at the speech. That way, even if something did go wrong, she would not be in the line of fire. As for himself? Well, as his brother had always been so fond of saying, he had a duty to attend to.\n\nGriselda had memorised every guard rotation; Stirling had insisted upon it. Alexander had gone over the evacuation route with her and gotten her to warn her brother and mother ahead of time - once he'd gotten assurances that they weren't likely to turn traitor. The main thing that Griselda had worked on was her throwing skills. Where once she might have had all the skill of some toff fresh out of a bar, she now had at least a basic grasp of distance and the timing needed before she ran. She was ready, and Griselda dearly hoped that would be enough."
ENG_intro.8.a:0 "The die is cast."

ENG_intro.9.t:0 "Ready or Not"
ENG_intro.9.desc:0 "Timothy O'Flaherty stood in line with his men, a helmet on his head and - for only the third time in his life that he could recall - he wielded a revolver in addition to his trusted truncheon. The crowds were thick and noisy, a hair's breadth from a riot. As the King stepped out onto the stage, there were a fair few boos mixed amidst the cheering.\n\nO'Flaherty gripped his revolver tighter. What were the chances of something coming his way after all? Minute, miniscule. He kept vigilant anyway. Who was to say that if the HMMLR pricks attacked that they'd spare him? What did they understand of the fact that his job put food on the table? Kept his daughters out of the poorhouse? It didn't matter that he might not like the King, he had a job to do. And as he eyed the crowd O'Flaherty thought he could see something strange."
ENG_intro.9.a:0 "Whatever could it be?"

ENG_intro.10.t:0 "A Convenient Illness"
ENG_intro.10.desc:0 "As Timothy O'Flaherty sat on the couch with the telly turned to some children's show he reflected that maybe he should take a day off work more often. Not every month, or even every six, but maybe once a year wouldn't do any harm? His daughters seemed ignorant of the fact that he was watching them instead of their mother, and had busied themselves assembling the dollhouse he'd bought them with what he was telling Martha was a 'special bonus'.\n\nAnd truth be told it was a special bonus, it wasn't every day a man showed up at your door and offered you 500 quid to stay home on a specific day.\n\nTim wouldn't have acted on it except for the fact that he'd caught several of the younger constables chatting amongst themselves on the subject, and upon some discreet inquiries had even discovered his boss, the Chief Inspector, was taking the King's Speech off. If everyone was doing it, why not him?\n\nHe could think of a lot of things he'd rather do than stand about in a line all day and watch the crowd riot. Something that was reinforced as his wife brought the tea tray out and set it on the table. Oh yes, no need to go into work today."
ENG_intro.10.a:0 "Family can be its own reward."

ENG_intro.11.t:0 "Denial"
ENG_intro.11.desc:0 "Tim O'Flaherty spotted the woman instantly, black haired and skittish. The nervousness was something to keep an eye on anyway, but the bag she carried looked a bit large for a purse holder. It was when she reached into the bag whilst staring straight at the King that O'Flaherty realised just what she intended to do.\n\nHe ran out from the line and made directly for her, being barely two arms lengths away and shouting at her to drop the bag when he saw her pull the grenade out. O'Flaherty acted not with instinct but with panic, and fired three shots in as many seconds. Perhaps if he'd been further away, he might have missed. As it was, all three caught the young woman square in the chest and she went down like a puppet with its strings cut.\n\nThe crowd panicked; so did the higher ups. The King was evacuated within moments of the shot ringing across the square. Once they realised what had happened they looked at the body and found the grenade, along with a pistol and some dynamite besides. First it was the Chief Inspector coming to congratulate him, then the Commissioner. Finally, a few days later, he found himself in the office of the Prime Minister.\n\nTim didn't have the heart to tell the man he'd never voted for his party, but he accepted the thanks all the same, and left positively beaming after the PM inquired as to his future career prospects. O'Flaherty suspected that he might be looking at a promotion in the near future.\n\nIn the end though, as he came home and ate dinner with his family, whilst listening to his daughters talk about how they could say their father was a hero at school and Martha mention that the Crossby's had invited them over for tea next week, Tim O'Flaherty felt that life was good.\n\nIf only he could forget the look on that poor girl's face as she fell."
ENG_intro.11.a:0 "God save the King."

The King had been hustled off unharmed, but his cronies hadn't been so lucky. Griselda had left London with help from Stirling's men and Alexander's smugglers, and been taken north. Deep into the North too; past Yorkshire at least if she was to be any judge. It wasn't until Griselda entered the small house in the middle of nowhere though that she realised what her actions had truly meant. The men with her had talked about taking her to see the boss, and of the five people in the room it was obvious who it was.\n\nIt wasn't Bill Alexander, standing aside with a beer in hand and chatting with a thin gentleman in a suit. It wasn't Stirling catching the first bit of sleep he'd seen in days. It was a figure almost every English citizen knew: Member of Parliament Claude Auchinleck, a former general who had been the last British officer holding his position at the time of the surrender to Germany. A living legend in every sense of the word, and evidently, the leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.\n\nGriselda gave a salute as she entered but he waved it off and invited her to sit. They talked for a long time; about how the sacrifice of her civilian life was appreciated, how her family had been evacuated along with the rest of her cell. And about her future career prospects: HMMLR had need of operatives to ferry communication between the cells that couldn't be trusted to regular couriers, and according to Auchinleck she fit the bill perfectly."

ENG_intro.14.desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, founder of the hardline collaborationist faction of the Royal Party, an open, fervent admirer of the Nazi methods, woke up in a cold sweat from his bed, coughed, gagged, and cursed under his breath.\nIt was yet another one of those nightmares. He'd find himself in a room filled to the brim with dead bodies that pressed in upon him until he could not breathe. Sometimes they were those of his fellow soldiers from the East African campaign that left him with symptoms of malaria and dysentery. This time, on the other hand, it was those who died in that gas attack in the Great War that ruined his lungs and left him with respiratory illnesses forty years later.\n\nGetting up, he reflected on how futile it had been to fight the Germans. All it had done was bring ruin to England every time it happened. Truly, it was better for the English nation to instead support the Masters of Europe and fight against Jewish-Bolshevik degeneracy and the asinine rigmarole of the left-liberals and moderates. By promoting this mindset over the past thirty years, especially after the Invasion, Chesterton had won the esteem of his German masters; this, more recently, allowed him a life of luxury and influence.\n\nGulping down glass after glass of an expensive German wine given to him by Franz Halder at his birthday, Chesterton sat down and read the day's communiques. Noting down potential courses of action, he reflected on his situation.\nMany accused him of treason and selling out; those ungrateful words hurt him more than he let on. Besides that he was tormented by alcoholism, nervous breakdowns, and episodes of neurasthenia. Between those and the pressure of the dead bodies he saw in his sleep, he began to regard the world as no more than a vast necropolis. But he remained stubborn in his views, fighting on.\n\n"It's worth it," he said. "It's worth it. If I can take control of this country, bring it order and peace through power, my hell of a life will be worth it.""

He had come back from yet another meeting with the Party. As always, they praised him as a great capable of holding the warring factions of the Royal Party together.\n\nSome sycophant had come up to him after the Party meeting and started singing his praises. "Prime Minister, you've calmed them down again! You managed to keep the Royal Party from breaking apart for the umpteenth time! Beautiful work, sir!" Douglas-Home nodded and smiled, repressing a scoff. He knew what had really happened. All this time, he had just sat around and done nothing, busying himself with the running of the nation; those people in his party just papered over their own differences with no intervention on his part.\n\nShaking his head, the Prime Minister - a somewhat traditional, personable man of the Royal Establishment - took stock of his situation. The Alec Douglas-Home of 1962 had but one priority, and that was to protect the broken remnants of Olde England from all that threatened it: the German tyranny, Halder and his gang of enforcers squatting in Cornwall, the fascist hardliners of Chesterton, and, most importantly, the communist-ridden Resistance.\n\nHome was sympathetic to those who wanted out of the Pakt, he really was. He wanted rid of the Germans too. But if these socialist madmen took hold of England, the Nazis would be provoked into invading, and they would destroy what little remained of England, finally and completely breaking the English spirit. This prospect could not be borne; so Home went back to work, thinking about how best to protect his tormented country from the radicalism that besieged it."

He had seen countless resistance cells scattered, slaughtered, imprisoned, and - both literally and figuratively - sent underground. But this success had come at a price, as the civilians he had been sent north to protect began to look at him with increasing suspicion.\n\nHis casualties were increasing as the communist scum kept attacking his troops with ever-greater effect. Resistance cells were being given advance notice of his movements; suspected HMMLR sympathizers would disappear in the dead of night before he could disappear them.\nThe civilians in the streets of the North looked at him with open disgust, many of them muttering under their breaths that he was a traitor and villain where he could hear it. He dared not act against them for fear that Parliament would go after him, but he wished he could make those scum appreciate the work he was doing to defend what little was left of England.\n\nOverall it had devolved into a situation in which Templer was being forced to accept more and more loss for less and less gain, and he hated it. How would he be able to protect the Kingdom if things kept on going like this, and he was forced to go on with exactly no help from London?\n\nCursing his bad fortune for the umpteenth time, Templer wrote another situation report to send to General Headquarters. Its contents were much the same as many that had preceded it, and he doubted anything would come of it."

ENG_intro.17.desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery, general of the Royal English Army entrusted with rebel suppression in the South, had once been known as the Lion of England. But the man that now commanded the anti-rebel effort in such places as Bedford and Canterbury was a far cry from the dashing officer that had distinguished himself for twenty years, ranging across the world from Douay to Derna. That man died when, after the fall of London, he signed the treaty of surrender and personally ordered Claude Auchinleck and other officers to stand down. What remained was a partly hollowed-out shell denounced by the Resistance as a fallen hero, a thrice-damned craven.\n\n"This isn't to say that I especially like my job these days," Montgomery thought, as he had for years. He, just like anyone else in Britain whose name was not "A.K. Chesterton", hated the German tyranny, and disliked Prime Minister Home and the other members of the Royal Party for their overenthusiasm in collaborating with it.\nBut, just like Home, Montgomery kept on collaborating for fear of what could happen if they stopped. "If we cut the Germans off, or if God forbid the Resistance take over, they'll snuff us out the way they did the first time around. Then they'll probably give us over to Heydrich or some other such monster, and the last of England will fall to pieces."\n\nDeep down, however, Montgomery's fondest wish - that of a free England, saved from tyranny and dishonor as it was in his youth - remained. But, as long as Hitler remained master of Europe, nothing could come of that, and all Montgomery could hope to do was keep the South in order before Halder felt tempted to intrude again.\n\n"It's worth it," Montgomery thought. "My values mean nothing. Protecting England from tyranny, from evil, from folly - that is all that matters. My principles are worthless compared to that.""

Harold Macmillan addressed his companions in the clipped tones of an aristocrat, barely a hint of his native Scottish accent breaking through. "We cannot be seen by the public to be weak on the proposed legislation. The newspapers are barely allowed to say anything of substance on the best of days, and the last thing our nation needs is to copy the German example of press freedom." His moustache bristled as he spoke the name of the Government's much maligned backer.\n\n"But Harold," one of the men opposite to him spoke up, a bead of sweat trailing down his face as he glanced at the door for anyone about to enter. "Surely, there are more urgent things we could devote our strength to. We cannot fight the rest of our party on every bill. What would we even gain from this?" He looked to the other men in the room one by one, his posture relaxing somewhat as his confidence grew. "We'd be protected by the bill as well you know."\n\nThe table abruptly shook as Macmillan slammed his fist down on it, eyes aflame with something wrathful and a tone as cold as ice in his voice. "We would prevent another uprising, you imbecile." Macmillan stare was like a dagger pointed at the mans wavering gaze. "If the law passes there will be protests, protests that will grow when Home does nothing, protests which that bloody fascist Chesterton will sick his blackshirts on them and cause a bloodbath. London will be set aflame in the meanwhile, and that bastard in Cornwall will use it as an excuse to intervene and drown our city in English blood, again! I. Will. Not. Have it.

If one asked a German about the same man, one would hear tales of a mighty general and strategist who had broken both the Anglos and the Bolsheviks for Reich and Führer.\n\nBut if one asked Franz Halder himself about all the things he had apparently done, he'd get an honest answer, more or less: "I did do all of that, true, but I'm old and well past my prime now." Halder was just not as strong as he had once been. "It started to go downhill after the London Uprising," Halder had written in his war diary. "If those damn communists and liberals hadn't set off a fuss in England just as the war began I'd have been able to make myself useful in Russia and keep that human filth Himmler from trying to ruin it all."\n\nBut that was not to be. Nor was there to be any improvement for Halder after the war had ended. Instead, the OKH decided to make Cornwall a vacation home for the sons of the rich. Halder knew just how grave the situation was. These last few years, Cornwall was half grizzled veterans and half good-for-nothing children of the postwar period that only knew how to fiddle around with women, eat unhealthy food left and right, and shirk their duties day in and day out. "A textbook definition of a paper tiger," Halder grumbled.\n\nHalder was sick and tired of all this. He wanted out, he wanted to go home.

Appearances could be deceiving.\n\n"We've received word from Ottawa." The man from the Foreign Office spoke in a hushed whisper as he kept an eye on the lone doorway to where they were drinking, one couldn't be too careful after all. "Another shipment will be arriving within the week, cast off American rifles for the most part, but they managed to include some anti-tank grenades this time."\n\nClaude stopped raising his teacup as he heard the last part of what Jellicoe had said. It was an involuntary thing, a memory being lit inside a head full of moments he'd rather forget. A memory of Carlisle and the ceaseless advance of German tanks. He could've used those weapons then, but it was just a moment. He raised the teacup to his mouth and sipped before responding. "Have the rifles stored in the usual places, send the grenades down to Stirling's lot." The voice of a man almost 80 years old still managed to have some iron in it, and nobody was the wiser to the thoughts inside his head.\n\n"What should I be telling the Prime Minister?" The third member of their trio commented idly as he finished his own cup. One wouldn't have thought Kim Philby looked like a spy, yet the aristocratic man had provided an invaluable link between the elements of HMMLR, and an even more important service in being the man in MI5 in charge of the investigation into that same organisation. Claude turned to him, and for an instant the MI5 agent could see the man who'd held his post for two weeks against the Reich after his government had surrendered, before the mild mannered visage of a politician replaced it. "Whatever you must, but if you have to sacrifice a cell ensure they aren't aware of too many figures in the command structure."

For Bill Alexander it was a good start to the day.\n\nHis face was aged and littered with scars from four conflicts across the vast expanse of Europe, the only sign of allegiance on him or his men a scarlet band around the arms of their outdated uniforms. A small sign, yet one which was feared by the Traitors long after the mess that had been the London Uprising. He should know after all, for the man who had become the Red General had been the highest ranking member of the old Communist Party to escape that slaughter.\n\nHe'd fled into exile just in time for the West Russian War to start up, and there Bill Alexander had hoped that perhaps in his third struggle against the menace of fascism, he could taste the victory which had eluded him in Spain and the World War. But the front had fallen, reduced to the icy outpost of Arkhangelsk, and Bill Alexander had been forced to wonder, why?\n\nEach time, every time the same thing had happened. The coalition had splintered, the revolution had fought on, and the revolution had died. In Spain, in London, in Russia. Bill Alexander was a loyal man, an earnest man. He was a communist because he knew it to be the right course of action for the Proletariat. Yet, for the revolution to survive, it could not fight its other foes whilst the wolf of fascism circled around it. It was a stark choice, for Bill Alexander knew he couldn't win against the traitors in London with just his own forces. For the revolution to succeed, fascism had to be crushed. If he had to tolerate Auchinleck and Stirling for that to happen, so be it. If he had to tolerate a delay in the revolution whilst the Reich existed across the channel, so be it.

The reason for their caution was the man who'd just trod down the basement stairs with rather too little noise for Natalie's liking. Dressed in the uniform of an army twenty years dead and gone David Stirling strode with purpose to the map table, two grizzled men in equally aged uniforms following behind, eyes scanning the room for a potential trap.\n\nAfter a short silence, it was the reds who got to business first. "The Boss wants us to put something together for our friend in the peaked cap." Alexander took a break from his cigarette to gesture at the maps of Cornwall and Devon, each of them showing in intricate detail the topography of the region. "Something permanent."\n\nStirling barely seemed to acknowledge that the man had spoken at all, instead peering over the sheets of paper like they would reveal some arcane mystery before he responded.

Of course, Edward wasn't the only one who wanted him to never touch the ground again, otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to leave for Germany in the first place. Letting out a sigh, Edward tapped his almost-desk made up of the back of the chair holding god-knows which government functionary and tried to think of something else, anything else.\n\n"Your Majesty, would you like anything to drink?" An airline hostess had apparently been standing next to Edward for a moment long enough to heighten the non-existent tension between them. The hostess was certainly not English, probably German, and without a doubt keeping her smile on with nothing but hope that Edward would actually order something.\n\n"Uh, whiskey, please." Half-nodding her head, Edward returned to thinking of what his life had become. Why did the government even need a monarchy? More than that, why did it have to be him? Most anyone - aside from some of those who held a universal disgust from anyone with respect to their name - had no love for the Germans, though the only real difference between the government and these rebels was a split in not ideology, but policy. Were they really so different? The German threat is nothing but an inevitability, couldn't these insubordinate children see that?\n\n"Whiskey, your honor."

Since borders were settled, however, Edward had relegated his meetings to the Führer to occur only when utterly essential. Given the state of affairs in England, this was undoubtedly one of those moments of absolute necessity.\n\nWalking into the office of the Führer, as planned and practiced thousands of times prior, Edward's hand extended to the emperor of Europe - an old man, hardly standing, looking as though there was nothing behind his eyes, a nearly-grey shade of blue. It was nearly unnerving as they snapped to meet Edward's.\n\n"Your Majesty."

"Now, my friend, I am sure you've heard of the terrible terrorism within England, and-" The Führer began half of a coughing fit, managing out the words "terrible".\n\n"...I am afraid I must come to you in my hour of great need, and ask a favor; for your intrepid soldiers to aid in pacifying our unstable territories." King Edward looked to Hitler with what sincerity he could muster, though he knew it would be hard for anyone to take him seriously.\n\n"Of course. I will... refer you to my... successor.

More than anything else, it was their lack of respect, whether or not he deserved it.\n\n"Herr Bormann, we both know that the English army is ill-equipped to take on the rampant terrorism in the North, and we may very well soon have another London uprising on our hands, only twice as worse and we'd be half as prepared. I don't expect you to review or repeal the treaty of London, I simply need some help." Bormann smiled.\n\n"Of course, Your Majesty, though you must understand that there are some restrictions which I have found myself under as of late, yes? You and I know how little I can send to England, I'm not Führer quite yet, though I can still lend something of a hand. Now, equipment is running rather short for the proper German army, though we do have something of a manpower surplus at the moment- new recruits, you know, always need some proper experience. I understand you have the whole list forwarded my way, I've read it over, though you should know that we're still tight on equipment, garrisons, you know how it is." Bormann locked his hands, and smugly smiled at the "royalty" which he'd loved to taunt.\n\nKing Edward stood up and straightened out his uniform. "Thank you, Herr Führer. Best of luck with Germany."

Unfortunately, I cannot promise you anything in the way of manpower." Edward felt a pang of disappointment strike him, letting his cutlery set against his plate. "Hold your horses, hold your horses. Now, at the moment, I have no reason to hand out my manpower reserves like... candy. What I can hand out to a close ally, however, would be quite a bit of equipment.

Medals lining the walls, alongside the hooked crosses so adored by the Germans, and heads of Communists and Jews of over twenty years ago. What Edward found stepping into Heydrich's office was not nearly as... something. Edward couldn't quite put his finger on it. It was quiet. There were no medals on the walls. In fact, it was difficult to see much of anything in the room. To describe it as dank wouldn't be apt at all, either. Edward was still taking in the office when he sat down. Feeling the cold leather rest against his skin, Edward felt a pit in his stomach form as he realized that he was sitting in Reinhard Heydrich's office. Looking across the disturbingly well-organized desk, the black telephone, pens, and paper had all been seemingly aligned symmetrically. Extending his hand towards Heydrich, the blank silence of the room cut into Edward, as Heydrich's blank stare forced Edward back into his chair.\n\n"Edward, why are you here?"\n\n"I- I'm here to requ-quest war mat-" Heydrich's mouth worked well enough to speak, though his whole head and body didn't move in tune, not moving in the least, he almost resembled a puppet as he sat almost perfectly still. "I know that Edward, I read the report you sent. Why are you here? Did you expect anything to come from this?"\n\nEdward felt a sweat coming on.\n\n"Well- the Führer told me to speak-"\n\n"Need I remind you that I am the Führer, Edward?" A silence filled the room.\n\n"Do I make myself clear, Edward?" The King stammered for a moment."

ENG_intro.32.desc:0 "The plan had gone off without a hitch. The team of MI5 operatives had broken into Orde Wingate's home sometime last night, and had run him through the usual affairs of a waiting room with an excess of fluorescent lighting for a few hours, then hitting him over the head with a baton. Upon being put in front of a military court, it wouldn't take longer than ten minutes to get through the semantics of evidence. Then came the verdict- determined sometime last week. Home had been informed of the betrayal as soon as it came to light, and it took hardly a minute to decide on his fate. The look splayed across Wingate's face was certainly upsetting in its shock, though it did more than enough to satiate the hopes of the newscasters for the night. A death sentence was far from uncommon for traitors, but for a man of Wingate's repute, it was certainly one of the more surprising trials in the past years.\n\nAs the disgraced General was escorted out of the courthouse with his hands cuffed, the pair of officers behind either side of him, hand on either shoulder pushed their way through the crowds of reporters and bystanders. Home watched as they were swallowed by the crowd before a squad car emerged from the far end of the crowd, set alongside the sidewalk.\n\nAs Lord Home himself and his small army of security made their way out, the crowds of reporters ran up to Home, and asked the usual few questions.\n\n"Lord Home! Do you have any comment?"\n\n"Lord Home, this must come as a surprise, what does this mean for the English army as a whole?"\n\nHome waved off the reporters being pushed back by his security.

ENG_intro.33.desc:0 "From: MI5 Senior Agent Williams\n\nTo: MI5 Senior Agent Philby\n\nSenior Agent Philby, as requested by the office of the Prime Minister, I am hereby forwarding you the summation of our intelligence on the terrorist organisation led by David Stirling, colloquially referred to as "Stirling's Commando's" or some variation of such. The finer details are attached in the report, but the overview I felt important enough to address to you here.\n\nIt is currently believed that Major David Stirling deserted his post in the immediate hours after the Armistice of 1943 was declared, managing to suborn a not insignificant amount of General William Slim's command in the process and taking a supermajority of surviving SAS forces with him alongside a handful of regular army units. This is important because those army units, alongside scattered Home Guard sections and a small amount of recruiting since, have made up the core of his forces ever since. We believe that Stirling has never had a fighting force larger than perhaps three or four thousand men for the entire 20 years he has been engaged in terrorism against the government, and yet I would point out he is still very much alive.\n\nNo less than 120 separate attempts have been made on his life by our government and on occasion other terrorist organisations over the years, he has been assumed dead on three separate occasions and his group is to our knowledge, the only active rebel combatant from before the London Uprising to still regularly engage our forces in any meaningful form. This has only increased in frequency since his recent alliance with HMMLR.\n\nIt is my professional opinion given the danger his organisation represents, that the utmost priority should be given to coordinating our efforts against his forces. If nothing else, eliminating one or two of his cells would likely drive him to focus his efforts in the North and cease action in the South where the Germans might take notice. As mentioned previously, he doesn't possess the manpower to take casualties and anything we do now will likely bring benefits to us later on."

ENG_intro.34.desc:0 "From: MI5 Senior Agent Reddings\n\nTo: MI5 Senior Agent Philby\n\nKim, as the Prime Minister requested I am sending you what information my section has been able to garner on the bolshevik elements of HMMLR. As far as my people have been able to determine, it is overwhelmingly likely that the core of the "Left Resistance" is formed by surviving elements of the Communist Party of Great Britain, previously thought to be largely eliminated during the course of the 1953 London Uprising. It seems however, that one or more figures of significance were able to escape the roundup and executions that followed. Now based primarily in the industrial sections of the Midlands, the Left Resistance appears to have absorbed the "Labour Underground" as well, and it should concern the government greatly that this has occurred. All previous knowledge indicated that Labour and the CPGB would continue their typical squabbling for their support bases, yet at some point prior to 1959 this turned into an outright alliance. The current organisation, we suspect, is therefore able to draw support not just from the radical elements of trade union movements and industrial workers, but also dissatisfied portions of the intelligentsia and youth movements. The sole consolation of the situation seeming to be that they have been unable to recoup the losses in trained military personnel they sustained in 1953. Broadly speaking, as the files attached to this brief should show, the Left Resistance seem distinctly more radical than the majority of HMMLR (of which we can confirm they are a member organisation) and if as per the Prime Ministers wishes we aim to keep the current situation with regards to the Reich's influence inside England, we ought to deal with this organisation before they can attempt a general rising in the Midlands or something else equally likely to bring the Garrison down on all our heads. Because if these people take the lead of HMMLR, we are in for a long struggle."

This is unconfirmed, but the extent of HMMLR's influence and the origins of much of its equipment in American cast offs leave little for interpretation that the organisation is anything other proxy of Washington DC regardless, and thus this remains the more pressing concern.\n\nFirst coming to government attention in the aftermath of the London Uprising in 1953, the group claims as many prior terrorist organisations did, a loyalty to the pretender Queen of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth of Windsor. Unlike these groups however, HMMLR has been willing and able to look past its nominal trappings to secure alliances with all manner of fellow travellers. Not least in the past four years the Left Resistance, itself an amalgam of communists and the Labour party, and the rogue military formations of David Stirling. Both of these groups have little in common on an ideological level with HMMLR's stated goals of restoring the political situation to its 1939 position, and yet whomever leads HMMLR has managed to wrangle the three organisations into a united front against the Government.\n\nIt cannot be stated with enough clarity that HMMLR is currently the greatest extant threat to the continued existence of our government. It is my most stringent recommendation that any action the government takes against this organisation be done swiftly, else there will be dire consequences."

That Claude Auchinleck appeared to be doing nothing more sinister than talking with a few similarly dressed gentlemen whilst enjoying some tea. Appearances could be deceiving.\n\n"We've received word from Ottawa." The man from the Foreign Office spoke in a hushed whisper as he kept an eye on the lone doorway to where they were drinking, one couldn't be too careful after all. "Another shipment will be arriving within the week, cast off American rifles for the most part, but they managed to include some anti-tank grenades this time."\n\nClaude stopped raising his teacup as he heard the last part of what Jellicoe had said. It was an involuntary thing, a memory being lit inside a head full of moments he'd rather forget. A memory of Carlisle and the ceaseless advance of German tanks. He could've used those weapons then, but it was just a moment. He raised the teacup to his mouth and sipped before responding. "Have the rifles stored in the usual places, send the grenades down to Stirling's lot." The voice of a man almost 80 years old still managed to have some iron in it, and nobody was the wiser to the thoughts inside his head.\n\n"What should I be telling the Prime Minister?" The third member of their trio commented idly as he finished his own cup. One wouldn't have thought Kim Philby looked like a spy, yet the aristocratic man had provided an invaluable link between the elements of HMMLR, and an even more important service in being the man in MI5 in charge of the investigation into that same organisation. Claude turned to him, and for an instant the MI5 agent could see the man who'd held his post for two weeks against the Reich after his government had surrendered, before the mild mannered visage of a politician replaced it. "Whatever you must, but if you have to sacrifice a cell ensure they aren't aware of too many figures in the command structure."

Too close together, the front vehicle not bothering to check for signs of an ambush, and now nearly two dozen men in Government colours were littering the roadside. For Bill Alexander it was a good start to the day.\n\nHis face was aged and littered with scars from four conflicts across the vast expanse of Europe, the only sign of allegiance on him or his men a scarlet band around the arms of their outdated uniforms. A small sign, yet one which was feared by the Traitors long after the mess that had been the London Uprising. He should know after all, for the man who had become the Red General had been the highest ranking member of the old Communist Party to escape that slaughter.\n\nHe'd fled into exile just in time for the West Russian War to start up, and there Bill Alexander had hoped that perhaps in his third struggle against the menace of fascism, he could taste the victory which had eluded him in Spain and the World War. But the front had fallen, reduced to the icy outpost of Arkhangelsk, and Bill Alexander had been forced to wonder, why?\n\nEach time, every time the same thing had happened. The coalition had splintered, the revolution had fought on, and the revolution had died. In Spain, in London, in Russia. Bill Alexander was a loyal man, an earnest man. He was a communist because he knew it to be the right course of action for the Proletariat. Yet, for the revolution to survive, it could not fight its other foes whilst the wolf of fascism circled around it. It was a stark choice, for Bill Alexander knew he couldn't win against the traitors in London with just his own forces. For the revolution to succeed, fascism had to be crushed. If he had to tolerate Auchinleck and Stirling for that to happen, so be it. If he had to tolerate a delay in the revolution whilst the Reich existed across the channel, so be it. As he lit a cigarette above the bodies of traitors, Bill Alexander thought of a world free of fascism, and smiled."

ENG_intro.39.desc:0 "The Kingdom of England only has a small military, scarcely enough to defend against its own people and the Scottish. But even Franz Halder, who looks at this native auxiliary force with contempt, has to admit there are some prestigious names in this force. Many generals whose glories on the fields of the First World War and the indignities of their betrayals in the Second may be somewhat familiar to the common student of military history. But there is one man in their army who has personally attracted attention like no other, has pulled off some of the most stunning feats of the war, and has angered and alienated many of his contemporaries. That man is Bernard Montgomery. And even he has nothing on Major General Orde Charles Wingate.\n\nUnlike the rest of the army, Orde never truly agreed to cooperate with the Germans and to betray his country. He was on the other side of the world when this nation collapsed, and found himself inconvenienced by detention in a Japanese prison camp. His liberation was arranged by the English Government, and he found himself repatriated to England well after any meaningful resistance had ended. Wanting to reward a war hero as propaganda, the government allowed him to be restored to active duty and file him away into a position in the Royal Artillery, allowing him a relatively comfortable semi-retirement.\n\nBy the next Saturday he was in direct contact with Alexander, arranged by a Mister Philby in MI6.\n\nGeneral Wingate is an infiltrator of the highest order, and possibly the most important one of the Left Resistance. Even Claude cannot have this much influence in the military, and the SAS cannot compare at all with what he offers. Practically nobody is this big of a blind spot in the enemy army. He is a ticking time bomb in the English Military, and when he goes off, the regime will fall."

And where the hell were your men? They took a half hour to begin to respond, and they missed the rebels by a mile!"\n\n"Sir, it was most likely the railway workers, we couldn't find them, so we assume there was some sort of conspiracy going on with them-"\n\n"That's your responsibility, Wingate! Find out who did it, or I'll have to replace you! This army has no place for your incompetence, and we'll find some place to hide you away if you keep acting like that, am I clear?"\n\n"Yes sir," and Monty hung up.\n\nWingate relaxed and took another bite of onion. Of course the train was his responsibility. He gave the route to Bill, and he made sure his men were on drill when the call came through. This wasn't the first time this had happened, and it wasn't the first time Monty had tried to put his ass on a plaque either.\n\nThe threat was hollow as well. Monty never found time to reassign him.

A few gruff words and a shove or two was enough to dissuade anyone else from entering. And when the gates officially opened, and nobody entered, it was instantly clear an enormous labor action, the likes of which hadn't been seen since Cable Street, was beginning.\n\nThe effective closure of the all-important steel industry sent shockwaves among the urban centers of the area. Birmingham was the first to feel the effects, with streets getting clogged by protesting workers and everyone knowing at least someone who was probably in the picket line. Thus there were many supporters who came out behind them, many of which were family members of the steel and iron workers. Schools were unable to hold classes, and many places were unable to conduct work with the massive demonstrations going on below.\n\nSoon came the inevitable sympathy strikes. Steel workers were going to walk off, so why not the related industries? The railroad workers had issues as well, so they could just put the engines into park around Northampton and walk off. Why not show solidarity with the working class, thought the students of De Montfort University, and leave class early? What if the bus drivers of Stoke-on-Trent threw another spanner into the works and left as well?

Men might say what they liked about how General Stirling was mad after all, but no one ever said he tolerated ill discipline.\n\nThe communists on the other hand, were not so well prepared. Of the two sections who'd accompanied his squad, perhaps only five men looked like they were old enough to see the last war. The rest? Youths to a man and woman, with mismatched weapons and an enthusiastic but still amateur sense of discipline. But they had fire in their bellies, Bullock could tell that from looking at them.

He thundered at the 9 terrified men who were manning the checkpoint with him. "Get to your fucking positions before-"\n\nThe first bullet struck home, and unfortunately for Gensch it hit his radioman, Wagner, directly in his throat. Amidst a flurry of expletives, Gensch ducked behind one of the concrete posts which made up the checkpoint's inner blocks, and returned fire in the general direction he'd seen the muzzle flash. The response this time was a fusillade of gunfire, little of it accurate, not that it saved poor Schmidt as the rifleman collapsed to the ground wheezing and coughing blood.\n\nGensch reviewed his options as he reloaded, he needed to get his men into better cover than the checkpoint for sure, yet if they moved the suppressing fire would certainly kill or worse, wound some of his squad. "Keep firing!" He roared at his men, and to their credit they'd gotten over their shock quickly enough. A short burst rang out and an Englishmen who'd been trying to sneak up on the position fell dead not three metres from Gensch's hiding place. Close enough that he could see the red armband tied around their coat. "Communists" Gensch spat. That was good, he'd fought this kind of foe in London, it wouldn't be too hard to drive them off once they realised his men were over their shock and that reinforcements were on the way.\n\nGensch was so immersed in readying his weapon to take another shot that he didn't notice the two dozen men who stalked out of the Depot to his right until they'd already gotten into cover of their own. It took him another few moments to realize they weren't German. Not a minute later, the SAS Commando's stalked over the cooling corpses of Gensch's squad and signaled to the Communists the all clear.

But it was not enough, they had after all been trained on fighting the tactics of the various English rebel organisations operating on their own, not together and in concert.\n\nThe red armbands of Leftist fighters starkly marked the majority of the men and women who'd ambushed the Garrison patrol, certainly the rest of their equipment was hardly unified enough to distinguish them from from badly dressed civilians, but their ferocity had pushed the Germans back from the beginning. Heedless of casualties the Left Resistance pushed forwards and onwards, aiming to drive the Germans off the roadside and into the shrubbery that marked the edge of the Detention Camps for reasons the Germans could likely only guess at.\n\nThe question was rendered moot when a speeding lorry drove around the bend in the middle of the firefight, and proceeded to ram through the camp's flimsy wooden gates.

Lee gestured for the man to continue his role in the firefight before peering around the corner of the masonry he was hiding behind.

Across from him, Philby, Montgomery and Templer sat steadfastly silent. They were waiting on him to be the decision maker, and Home supposed that was part of the responsibility that came with being Prime Minister. The fact was though, he knew he couldn't hope to take down HMMLR with a single strike.\n\nThe forces required, it would give the terrorists too much warning. No, it was too risky to attempt to strike the entire organisation as one. But a single key piece, that was more achievable. To eliminate Bill Alexander would be a propaganda victory without compare, the communist had been on the run for almost a decade and a half. To strike down Stirling might actually be better, without him blowing up half the barracks in England the army might get something done.\n\nThe third option though, well it was tempting. To put down whatever mad dog headed HMMLR and had forged the compromise which bound the organisation was very, very tempting. Men like that couldn't be easily replaced by terrorist groups. Still, the Prime Minister knew he had to choose. Looking up at last, he spoke to the men gathered in front of him."

It would be a difficult operation to pull off, but not impossible, not in the least.\n\nA swift insertion by our own special forces, combined with a generous artillery barrage could well deal with our renegade commando without much fuss at all.

We have supported them in this goal, but now they have another request besides guns and guarantees.\n\nA HMMLR representative requested as many old armored vehicles as we could spare, for the formation of "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Division", which might be capable of challenging the Collaborationist's armored forces, which are limited in number and out of date. This would be a significant risk, as it would be evidence of direct support should HMMLR begin their endeavour and lose.\n\nYet, should HMMLR win, these tanks would undoubtedly have proven their value, and we might be able to leverage our assistance to persuade them to join the OFN outright.

But small indulgences did not mean there was no work to be done, and so Auchinleck opened the coded letter he'd found under his door in the morning.\n\nTo anyone watching, even someone with experience in spywork, it would just appear to be that old commando fellow Jellicoe complaining to his ex-commanding officer Auchinleck that the Foreign Office was incredibly dull and that all the teenagers these days seemed infatuated with the yanks for some reason. To Claude Auchinleck, known even to his own organisation mostly as "The Boss", it meant Jellicoe's little gamble had worked.\n\nThe Americans had agreed to ship over some of their old tanks and armoured vehicles at the usual dropoff point. Not enough to make an army, but he reckoned he wouldn't need more than a few tanks for what was to come. The Collaborationists, cowards that they were, had been unable to convince the Germans to let them build more tanks than the number limited at the signing of the surrender. It was quite possible that Claude Auchinleck would command more tanks than the government once the Americans followed through.\n\nAll any observers at the park that day might report was that when he finished his lunch, Claude Auchinleck gave a little smile before he went back to Parliament, though nobody could be sure why."

Further atrocious incidents have conglomerated the partisans' hold on their "Free England".\n\nOur initial response has been chaotic, and disorganization is rampant among our divisions. The only advantage we have is that the forces of our opposition are likely just as disorganized. We must act quickly to consolidate our hold on as many areas as possible.

Maybe it was pressure from the US, as the Yanks were more focused on the Pacific or South Africa to help liberate the homeland of representative democracy, and told the Canadians to shove it. The socialists in the unified movement to overthrow the Nazis in Britain pointed out that this just shows that the "true" Monarchy, safely ensconced in Canada, was now not even going to lift a finger to help restore them. Now, there could be quibbles of how much influence Elizabeth actually has in Ottawa, but the refusal of the Canadians to help doesn't help the cause of the tried and true monarchists.\n\nEither way, it is a sad day in HMMLR that Canada had failed to come to their aid.

ENG_HMMLRECW.15.desc:0 "It had been a long few days for A.K. Chesterton. He hadn't slept a wink since the war broke out. The constant gunfire and explosions across London had done a number on his constitution, often sending him into pitch-black moods. His only sources of solace were the nice, occasional pint and his belief that he was making Britain a safer place.\n\nIt was this knowledge that allowed him to force a smile as he lowered himself onto a chair across from a set of bloodied and battered MPs, a ragtag group of traitors who had been illegally passing state secrets to traitors and gotten caught. He sat in silence for a moment, listening to their pained and feverish breathing echo through the concrete basement. Behind him, he felt the presence of a few of the lads-the good, young, patriotic boys who had been trying their hardest to talk some sense into them traitors, to give up the game.\n\nHe took a deep breath and gave the assembled men a grandfatherly smile. "Now, you must understand that I have little desire to impugn you or deny how spirited your resistance to good sense has been." One of the men began to sob. "Quite to the contrary, one could say that your fortitude, your commitment to this cause, is evidence of the strength that Britons have to offer." A man stared at him with his one remaining eye. "But, given that the safety and security of the British people is on the line, I'm afraid I need to ask again: What precisely did you pass on to Claude Auchinleck and his men?"\n\nFor a long moment, the only sounds were the dripping of the pipes and the distant rumble of cars outside. Chesterton watched as the one-eyed man raised his head and gathered as much dignity as he could. "Kill-. Kill yourself."\n\nBefore any of the boys could react, the living corpse of a man made a horrible retching noise and spat a bloody piece of phlegm onto Chesterton's shoe. Chesterton forced himself not to drop his smile, not to break eye contact or show his disgust, as he stood up.\n\n"How disappointing," said Chesterton, his deep voice dripping with malice. "How disrespectful. I'll leave you to talk a bit more with the lads. Hopefully you'll be a little more sensible then.""

They were all rounded up en masse by Chesterton's Blackshirts at 5am this morning with the support of the militarised police forces, and thus we have lost all contact with them.\n\nNot only do the leadership feel horrible about allowing our informants, as well their assistants and families to be arrested by the Collaborators, but the logistical and strategic loss is already being felt. We now no longer know about certain Government attack plans, we no longer have an eye on what Home and the others are up to in London, and the cherry on top of the shit cake; Chesterton's lackeys have apparently tortured our captured insiders into giving up sensitive details regarding our own plans and operations.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a crushing blow for the Resistance, and our war effort at large. Some of our operatives are insisting we mount a rescue operation, no matter the risk, for strategic and moral reasons, as well as to minimize whatever other info Chesterton might squeeze out of them. However, for once, Auchinleck, Alexander, and Stirling are all in agreement that it would be a poor idea, and a wasteful operation with virtually no chance at success. Even if we wanted to, we simply do not have the resources nor manpower readily available, as we need everyone and everything we can find on the front lines and in support roles, we cannot spare a thing.\n\nSo for that reason, we'll just have to hope we can rescue them the day we storm London and destroy the treacherous Home Government, and pray the Blackshirts don't murder them in captivity. If they do, Auchinleck says, he will never forgive himself."

The attacks, thought to be conceived by Bill Alexander's radical clique, were an irritant, and they were never thought of as anything more than that, as acceptable casualties in such bloody times.\n\nHowever, what once were skirmages have become something of far greater concern. The more brazenly terrorist elements of HMMLR have become emboldened by our lack of reprisal, launching ever more damaging strikes against government supply depots. And, despite our best efforts to recover, the damage is done and havoc has undoubtedly been wrought on our supply lines.\n\nSomething must be done to crush the Resistance and the terrorists who fight with them once and for all, yet the damage Bill Alexander has caused may be too much to bear already.

These terrorists know that they cannot match our strength and numbers, but they can go after our brightest and most experienced.\n\nOur command structure now has suffered significant losses, and we are facing a temporary disorganization while we scramble to find new, loyal officers to promote.

They probably heard that Stirling had escaped. He scoffed and waved his hands to the group behind him. They had been militarists who had escaped being captured by the Collaborators, and they had joined Stirling to flee to Scotland. They scanned the path that divided their path to freedom. Across the hill were a few sheep that had been grazing on the grass. To the Collaborator soldiers who patrolled this section, it was normal. However, behind the hill were Scottish infantry battalions.\n\nEarlier that day, the Scottish government had been contacted by David Stirling, using members of the SAS who had been sent to Scotland. While the government had been opposed to letting in a possible criminal into the country, they had decided to go for it. Stirling was Scottish after all. They decided on a time when he would cross the border and meet Scottish soldiers, who would then help them cross the border into Scotland. Once they would be across, they would be offered asylum in Scotland, protected from the Collaborators.\n\nStirling pulled something out of his bag. A clicker, they had used them twenty odd years ago in Africa. The soldiers on patrol had been out of earshot it seems. He clicked it a few times, hoping to hear a response from the border. Stirling heard the clicks and then the flash. He smiled, and motioned to the group behind him. Stirling looked one more time and dashed across the path. On the fence he was met by three Scottish soldiers who had made a hole in the fence. The Scottish soldiers got them through the hole. Once the last militarist was inside Scotland, the soldiers moved away and brought Stirling and his militarists behind the hill. One of the Scottish soldiers then shook Stirling's hand."

It may be possible to threaten the Scots into bringing Stirling back to England to be tried." The colonel replied and shrugged, as did the captain.

"Naval forces were not necessary in this past war. But if there's a German invasion, the navy will become highly relevant.

I think we should consider an alternative route."\n\nThis caught the attention of the other generals. They had been pretty unanimous at this meeting up until this point. Macmillan was interested as well, asking "so what are you proposing, General?"\n\n"As much as it pains me to say this," he said, "we need to get the Americans to help us out with our defence."\n\nThis took the room by surprise, "You're out of line, General," said Field Marshal Montgomery. "The Americans were funding Auchinleck and the rest of HMMLR. They aren't going to help us out! And even if they did, the help will have to travel all the way from North America over here. No, the only way we can guarantee our defence is to concentrate on making sure we can stand up to Germany."\n\n"Sir, your disdain for the Americans is well noted. However, they have technologies, equipment, and experience that we need to fight a war against Germany. And they aren't idiotic, they know we aren't on good terms with the Germans right now, and they'll support our efforts to keep them off the isle."\n\n"It'll be a fair-weather support," scoffed Monty. "And all the American technology won't replace British defences and factories. The war's coming, and we need to have the fortifications and defences ready."\n\n"The war is coming, Field Marshall," responded Baker, "and we need all the outside help we can get.""

Folkestone was near the German landing zones, and as such, it had taken the worst of the invasion. Many homes were destroyed, either by shelling, or aerial bombardment. Years after the invasion, one could still see the burnt buildings, the shell holes, and the exteriors pockmarked with bullet holes."\n\n"It has been a considerable time since those days, and last week I decided to visit the town myself to see how they were getting on. There had been considerable trouble in the area recently, but this did not obscure the scars of war still underneath the surface. Buildings were still burnt, the holes were still in the ground, and there were still bullets embedded in the walls of Folkestone."\n\n"Outside the city, on my way to Dover, I saw a group of workers on the beach. A German bomb had been uncovered, I was told, and they were trying to dispose of it. As I watched them work, my gaze was drawn across the ocean. There was Calais, now under perpetual occupation by Herr Himmler's SS. And at that time, I realized two fundamental truths; the invasion was an abuse that England will never forget, yet the chance of another one, possibly worse, was still high."\n\n"Every once and awhile, I've heard people say that England is on the way out. That we are no longer capable of standing up for ourselves. Nonsense. This is a great country, one that has a superb record of achievement of every kind. We have no need to fear temporary setbacks.

ENG_mac.4.desc:0 "At the request of the Prime Minister, we have been tasked with conducting an investigation into the failings of the British Military during the 1943 invasion. This commission, led by General Carver, enlisted the support of the Public Record Office, the Historical Records Commission, and RMA Sandhurst. After much study, several critical failings have been reported by the commission:\n\n1. In the crucial initial hours of the invasion, there was a massive organizational breakdown, with many home guard units being overwhelmed and unable to provide an effective defence. Manpower had been stretched thin, and what few units there were on coastal defence were unable to stand their ground.\n\n2. British defensive fortifications were inadequate and lackluster. A few blockhouses were in place, but they were scarcely enough to hold the enemy back and provide our forces with meaningful cover. A lack of fortified positions meant English forces had few places to hold and launch counter-attacks from.\n\n3. The Royal Air Force was unable to provide a degree of arial protection against the Luftwaffe. The organization was unable to keep up with German aircraft production or pilot training. Other ways of mitigating this advantage were not available, leading to effective German ground support and attacks against infrastructure.\n\nWe have not included in this report much analysis of naval failings, as those have been well documented elsewhere. This report is primarily for strategic and tactical problems with the Army and RAF. We will say, however, that a lack of intelligence and early warning systems played a part in the battle, especially in regards to the German deception in Operation Herbstreise."

ENG_mac.5.t:0 "Conclusions of the Sandhurst Exercise"
ENG_mac.5.desc:0 "In summary, the war game ended in a English victory, by a vote of 6-0 from the umpires. The Germans were limited in the areas they could invade without access to the French coast, and were forced to conduct operations on the eastern shore of England. The English team had expected this and were able to deploy their units in the area.\n\nThis ended up giving them the crucial advantage, as they were able to hold onto the ports and prevent the Germans from gaining them. Without an avenue for resupply, the German beachheads were pushed back into the sea, with a great loss of men and materiel. There were, however, some difficulties for the English that should not be discounted:\n\n1. German armor provided a level of hardness to the invasion that was difficult to overcome. It was responsible for most of Germany's early gains in the exercise. England was unable to counter these tanks, and oftentimes lost engagements to them. Only the lack of supply eventually allowed England to defeat the panzer divisions.\n\n2. Germany started the exercise with air superiority, and maintained it throughout the game. This made any English operation difficult, and was responsible for prolonging the German defence. England lacked the ability to counter this advantage."

ENG_mac.21.t:0 "The State of the Royal Navy, Conclusion"
ENG_mac.21.desc:0 "It is obvious that the Royal Navy is in dire shape and in no way prepared for a modern conflict. On the surface, the Royal Navy comprises a respectable number of vessels, more than many other countries, and backed up by a decent dockyard base. What this hides, however, is an aged navy in no way able to compete with any modern fleet.\n\nThe major vessels of the Royal Navy are not really impressive. Battleships like the HMS Howe are relegated to tasks like shore bombardment and are functionally obsolete in naval combat. The pride of the fleet, HMS Implacable, is a relic of the Second World War, relying on a small flight of prop-driven aircraft to provide air support.\n\nScreening vessels are where the navy derives most of its strength. Even there, the destroyers are mostly out of date, with a few exceptions. The main armaments, such as torpedoes and cannons, are ancient. The lack of modern anti-aircraft, a necessity, is also extremely concerning. Most alarmingly, our fleet lacks proper ASW radar and weaponry, making our destroyers next to useless in a potential conflict.\n\nOur submarine fleet is small, obsolete, and ineffective. Comprising only a few vessels, it has been mothballed since the Second World War, and woefully obsolete. Other submarines are better in nearly every respect, and so will enemy ASW ships.\n\nIt is clear an upgrade is in order, with newer ships with modern armament needing to be produced. If we wish to keep these ships, they need to be modernized as well. And a complete rebuilding of the fleet air arm must also take place. Only by massive effort can we hope the Royal Navy to regain some semblance of her former strength."

ENG_mac.22.t:0 "England's Charter"
ENG_mac.22.desc:0 "The British Navy was once the strongest and largest in the world. Dominating the world since the age of sail, the navy had been a legendary and terrifying force. Every man could recall the names and heroism of Drake, Nelson, and Cook. Memories of the HMS Victory still stirred the hearts, and the name HMS Dreadnought still would deliver chills to some. Like the sun never setting on the British Empire, there was nary an ocean in the world where the British Fleet would not be patrolling the waves.\n\nThen, the war happened. What had once terrified the world was on the bottom of the ocean, laid low by bombs or torpedoes. Peace was more devastating. Many ships now flew under different flags, those of Scotland, the Commonwealth, the OFN, all now independent of London. The vanquishers of the British fleet scrapped what ships left that had been deemed a threat, and mothballed the rest so England would never have its fabled weapon again.\n\nBut this was a new era. Those in London today would not be cowed by Teutonic threats. Now, they would make sure no enemy force would land on England again and subjugate the people of the isle. In shipyards across the nation, people lined up to build what the occupiers had said they could not. No agreement made under durress with the Nazi beast would be respected now.\n\nThousands of shipyard workers took their tools up again and marched into the dockyards. Every drydock would have a hull in it, and if it didn't, there would be one. Looking at the first ship sailing out of the historic dockyard of Portsmouth, even those with the faintest memories of the British Empire could hardly suppress their smiles at the memory of the line "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.""

They also are satisfied with their concrete position overlooking Margate.\n\nPetty Officer Powell's first assignment was in a rusting submarine from the Second World War. It looked like it belonged at the bottom of the ocean, and there were fears that it would really stay there next dive. Powell no longer needs to loathe his assignment, however. He now is quite comfortable on his new submarine, one that is considerably faster, armed, and more habitable than his original posting.\n\nFlight Sergeant Foster didn't think he would be in any sort of Royal Air Force if he joined the military. Even if he did, he fully expected to be flying prop-driven aircraft. He believed that he would end up in the Army like everyone else. Well, life's funny, sometimes. He now flies a modern jet fighter, and can claim to be a pilot like his father was back in the war.\n\nAll across Britain, there are men like Booth, Powell, and Foster. Men of the British Armed Forces, granted the ability to be far more effective and strong than they thought possible. No longer is it a token force. It is an efficient force, a powerful force, and a force ready to stand up to anyone who wants to crush the isle underneath their jackboot."

Out of respect for the work we did together back in the war, I claimed to lack any knowledge of you and what I did give them was misleading and not helpful. I hope they haven't given you too much trouble, and that you were aware of their interest in you.\n\nRecently, however, circumstances have come about where I must contact you. My government wishes to discuss an issue of great importance with a representative of the United States. I immediately suggested that you should be the one we talk with. It is a deal that could radically transform the alignment of Western Europe in this Cold War. If you are interested, come to Rome immediately and contact our embassy there. You will get further instructions on how to meet with your contact from MI6.\n\nI apologize for any problems resulting from me contacting you at your work address.

England will offer the United States the ability to station troops within its borders. The American armed forces will be allowed to conduct operations from our territory, and to receive supplies as well. The United States Navy will also be granted the ability to resupply and rearm in English ports.\n\nIn return, England will be paid for these rights in regular shipments of American equipment, which we will use to arm ourselves against foreign aggression. We also wish to enter a technology sharing agreement, where we can study American technological developments and use them for our own needs.\n\nI sincerely hope you consider this agreement to be fair.

"We have a fleet of seven destroyers and corvettes with us today, mostly for ASW and AA protection. But the real striking power is in the aircraft. A good air arm is worth way more than a battleship." The Captain was willing to share a lot of information about the fleet. Mostly because the Americans figured the Japanese were watching this exercise anyway. They were meant to.\n\n"And, it's typical for a carrier to operate in a strike group like this alone?\n\n"The Captain looked at him and said "you get a big enough air wing, you can do most anything with a carrier.

Delivering a wreath to the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier would show sincerity. England hadn't forgotten the ANZACs, and that would be conveyed to Australia by that action. Remembering what Australia had done for the British Empire would also acknowledge the reasons for it declaring itself a republic. And at the end of the day, the biggest issues between England and Australia would be bridged by understanding."

ENG_mac.115.desc:0 "With the sun breaking over the eastern horizon, a jet lands on a runway in the Australian Capital Territory. It is an English aircraft, and it comes from Heathrow in London. It pulls up to the terminal, and offloads an extremely important cargo. A wide variety of people come out. Executives, politicians, trade representatives, diplomats, all representing England, and here on a mission of goodwill.\n\nThe diplomats get into their taxis and rental cars, and disperse amongst the city of Canberra. Every one of them has a certain destination in mind. Some will go to the headquarters of various industry groups and corporate headquarters. Others will rub shoulders at the Department of External Affairs or the halls of Parliament. One or two will even make it inside Government House.\n\nTheir goal is simple. Relations between England and Australia are not as good as they should be, according to the English government. The old way would be to merely convince the President that England can be useful as a friend and not an enemy, but that's not enough. A government is a complex mechanism, and policy is not just determined by the one at the top.\n\nCanberrians of all positions will be courted. They will begin to associate England with all sorts of positive things. A profitable trading partner. A historical friend. And a potential ally in various foreign policy goals. When that jet leaves for Heathrow, those feelings will be embedded in the minds of the policymakers of Canberra."

Well, we are, and we're joining the OFN at the first opportunity. But I can't say that! We're friends, we're willing to work with you, and you shouldn't invade us.\n\nFirst topic: trade. Everybody loves trade. Especially if you can sell stuff to us. And we'll buy it. What's that? Domestic production? Everybody has to work, don't they? And we need to improve our own economy, you can understand that, Mr. Autarky, can't you? Trade with the OFN? We just need to diversify!\n\nSecond topic: foreign relations. We aren't going to challenge your hold on Europe. At least not until we have a few US Air Force bases. You can stay subjugating the people of Eastern Europe, and bombing anybody beyond that. We literally can't do anything about it, so we'll say it's not our responsibility.\n\nThird topic: we're better off being friends. We need each other! You wouldn't like it if we went with the OFN, wouldn't you? Well, you catch more flies with honey, so they say. We stay friends, you don't have to invade, and we won't go running to the US. Sounds good?\n\nHe's nodding. Great! Another German bureaucrat was convinced. Now we move onto the next one."

ENG_mac.117.desc:0 "Hello there! I'm Parker Macdonald, from the Embassy. I'm just out here getting a feel for the general mood of Germania towards us. There's a large amount of misconceptions that need to be corrected. There isn't as much animosity in England towards the Pakt as you may think. We're still dedicated to a friendly relationship with you.\n\nEngland still relies on Germany for its trade, about as much as it did before the civil war. And I'm sure there's a large number of German businesses that rely on us as well. Our programs to increase domestic production? Doesn't everyone want to produce as much as possible in their own country? And we have to advance, or we get left behind. The OFN? Well, it's just an open option that we use to get things we absolutely can't from the Pakt. A mere trifle, really!\n\nWe really aren't in the business of Pakt busting right now. England isn't going to stand up to you, and if I may confide in you for a moment, we really have no way to. We know you are the major power on the continent, and we know we can't compete, and we're just fine if we leave each other alone.\n\nI mean, good relations between England and Germany is what we want, correct? We're better off together. If not, it would be unfortunate, and may cause us to go seeking out other powers. Good relations, in my view, will keep England where it is now in relation to the Pakt. Otherwise, if things sour, there may be an unfortunate situation, one which may very well cause us to seek aid from other sources.\n\nWell, good to meet you. I have to go, unfortunately. There's a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce I'm scheduled to speak at. Let's keep in touch! Hope we meet again sometime."

He'd never bought the ambassador's claims that it would propel him into a future higher up in the party, but a job was a job.\n\nStanding guard meant that Hans Albert was able to get something of an understanding of the ordinary Englishman that even the diplomats lacked. He got to see how they reacted to the Reich welcoming England back into the civilised world. To his confusion however, when looking at the German Embassy very few of the English smiled. Some scowled, some cursed, none would go far as to spit whilst men with guns were around though. Hans simply couldn't understand why they felt that way though. Germany was a bulwark against Bolshevism and American puppetry, could the English not see that?

And it wasn't like he hadn't looked it over before the address to parliament.\n\nMacmillan sighed. The thought of working with the Germans had been anathema to him. The well documented problems United England had with the Reich were well known. They had dropped a bomb in this very chamber, hadn't they? And on a personal note, they had tried to kill Macmillan. Damn nearly succeeded as well at the Somme, making him play dead in a shell hole for half a day then making him spend months on crutches afterwards.\n\nAnd yet, this was necessary. If England was to have a peaceful future, they had to get on Germany's good side. Convince them England wouldn't be a problem. Tell them England would not be a threat against their horrific ambitions for the world. And sweeten the deal with a trade offer. Why not be friends anyway? England had nothing more to need from the Reich, and a war would certainly result in thousands of dead Germans.\n\nThe crowd applauded. Some boos, but what could one expect in the House of Commons?

They were fascists afterall, the Prime Minister would rather take any other course of action than having to bargain with such villains.\n\nThe real plan was for a military invasion of the peninsula, the negotiations would only ever be used as a distraction. Then, when the time was right, the army would push, seizing back England's rightful land.\n\nYet there Macmillan sat, baldfaced, waiting for the German response.

However, with the additional support of some crucial pieces of armor the early stages of the attack appeared to have been a moderate success.\n\nVictory still hangs in the balance, either side could triumph, especially if more German troops arrive and the English attack stalls.

Our chief advisors have been greatly divided and even bewildered from this recent request for weaponry. Having a friend in what was once a core part of the Einheitspakt would be the beginning of a sea change in Europe, but it would cost us a fair amount of equipment (and we can't even be sure Macmillan wants to deepen relations with us).

Men may not have faith in many things after all that has befallen England in these years, but they have faith in Macmillan because he's dragged them out of hell before.\n\nThe smaller portion of the party are led by Reginald Maudling, the "Liberals". Unlike the Macmillanists, the Liberals are loyal to the idea of democracy rather than to a single person.

They were equally astonished when he told them Cornwall was English once again. Maudling was surprised by the subdued initial reaction, but Macmillan assured him that the people who heard Lloyd George announcing from his window the Great War would end in a few hours probably were confused as well.\n\nOnce again, Macmillan's instincts proved correct, for when they arrived at the memorial, people had begun to hear about it. Bicycle commuters stopped to shake the PM's hand and tell him "job well done." Even the police officers who were on patrol of the park left their routes to congratulate Maudling.\n\nAs they walked back, a small entourage formed, cheering Maudling on, singing patriotic songs, and making rude remarks about the Germans and, occasionally, the head of the Shadow Cabinet. When they made it back to Number 10, a crowd was already waiting for them, and so were plenty of press. As they went inside, Maudling waved to the cheering crowd that was ever growing, while Macmillan rebuffed the media's questions by saying they could expect a complete address from the Prime Minister shortly.\n\nMacmillan and Maudling were later told by Scotland Yard not to do something so risky again. The crowds grew too large, too fast. But that risk had been accounted for by both the PM and his loyal assistant. And they felt this moment of triumph had been richly deserved."

### Mac Econ Events

ENG_mac.200.t:0 "Regional Unemployment - Where to Focus?"
ENG_mac.200.desc:0 "We desperately need to revitalize our struggling economy before any other goals of our government can be achieved. As we have already studied, all three regions have had it rough for some time now. However, we cannot solve all three problems at once. We need to be able to focus our efforts on the place where our programs can do the most good.\n\nThe North was the hardest hit, even before the war. It will take some convincing, as the North was a hotbed of resistance prior to the war, but no small part of that resistance was due to a lack of economic programs centered around this poorest region. Showing that the government is willing to make amends for past omissions might go a long way towards shoring up our economy and national unity. It is risky, but the rewards could be very valuable.\n\nThe Midlands are primarily agricultural, and so our program of industrialization would present a significant change in the overall lifestyle of the region. However, it would also show our commitment to an oft-forgotten region and stamp down Stirlingite sympathies among the population.\n\nThe South has always been the richest region, owing in no small part to a London-centered government. It has also been the least turbulent region and was a bulwark of the government during the English Civil War. Our efforts here would be most likely to succeed and would certainly benefit the government's standing with the upper classes. However, leaving out the other regions might sour national unity.\n\nWhere should we focus the efforts of our new programs?"
ENG_mac.200.a:0 "The North needs it most."
ENG_mac.200.b:0 "The Midlands will not be forgotten."

ENG_mac.201.t:0 "Business from Afar - Just Business"
ENG_mac.201.desc:0 "Our businesses have many opportunities abroad to open up shop and begin bringing in the wealth that we will need to restore England's economic future and infrastructure. However, relations have become increasingly strained with our partners on the continent and in America, due to the antipathy between those two trading partners. We have two options: Stick with neutrality as long as possible, or begin to open up towards either European markets with German support or try to attract American finances.\n\nNeutrality would give us the best of both worlds and allow trade relations with both sides, which is why we have been so hesitant so far to pick a side. However, this window is quickly closing, and continuing neutrality now might hurt our negotiations later due to our disloyalty to either party.\n\nAmerica has massive trading power and an unrivaled financial system, but working with America would antagonize our European trading partners, not to mention the national security risk of working with the main opponent of a militarily aggressive neighbor. We could also draw closer to Germany- where there appears to be some economic liberalization taking place. We could take advantage of this new system to slip ourselves into the European sphere and reap the rewards of the markets there.\n\nShould we delay taking a side, or look across our shores to international markets?"
ENG_mac.201.a:0 "We need to play this out as long as possible. Stay neutral."
ENG_mac.201.b:0 "Opportunity awaits- we need to look abroad."

ENG_mac.202.t:0 "The Right Reforms"
ENG_mac.202.desc:0 "Chairman Macmillan looked over the small bundles of legislative text sitting on his desk, set to be delivered to the House of Commons the next morning.\n\nA flash of satisfaction raced through his thoughts. The legislation was nothing new - indeed, it was long overdue. Small, token reforms to England's healthcare and labor regulations, to prove that the government could actually look after the people, now that the specter of German intervention in English politics was gone.\n\nWas it going to be enough to convince the people that United England had their interests in mind? On its own, perhaps not. But in the post-Civil War political landscape, Macmillan was the best the people were going to get - the only one who knew Westminster inside and out, who could deliver the promised, better future for England. Everyone else would just cock it up.\n\nTomorrow, England would see what competent leadership could do for the country, and Macmillan would make sure they wouldn't forget who made it all possible."
ENG_mac.202.a:0 "A step in the right direction."

ENG_mac.203.t:0 "The Slogan to Remake England"
ENG_mac.203.desc:0 "Reginald Maudling racked his brain for a snappy slogan, and came up empty.\n\nIt wasn't for lack of trying; he'd been working without sleep for days, coordinating with the Whitehall bureaucrats on the various details of the government's new economic plan. The result was a hundred-page behemoth that defied easy description, encompassing everything from mechanizing English agriculture, investing in English science, and investing in the industrial heartlands.\n\nBut the details were from - and for - the bureaucrats. Now Maudling had to sell it to Parliament, and to the people. He had no doubt that, if implemented fully, his plan would transform England, freeing it from two decades of stagnation. If nothing else, the numbers would look impressive, coming from a low base.\n\nBut the English people would see a country rebuilt from ashes, the return of dignified work, and the restoration of prosperity. The English people would dare to dream again, to look at the world with something other than survival in mind. To know that their country, restored to greatness, would grow still greater. A land of hope and glory."
ENG_mac.203.a:0 ""That's it!""

ENG_mac.1100.t:0 "The Cycle Begins Anew"
ENG_mac.1100.desc:0 "Freshly re-elected Chairman Harold Macmillan publicly thanked the nation today for their faith in his administration. After four years of fighting hard against the forces of fascism and corruption in the nation, 'Supermac' has been lauded for his wild success in ousting German influence and his moves to unify and stabilize the nation in the wake of the civil war. Though much criticism has been levelled his way at the supposed 'cheapening' of English democracy during his first term, no one can know for sure if that trend will continue into the second term as Macmillan continues his crusade against those he believes to be a threat to national stability.\n\nWhat shall the future hold for England?"
ENG_mac.1100.a:0 "You've made the right choice, England! Supermac will lead the way!"

ENG_mac.1101.t:0 "The Failure of Fascism"
ENG_mac.1101.desc:0 ""It is perhaps surprising to hear, after the battery we've received over the last half century, that democracy has proven it's worth," declared Chairman Macmillan to an attentive crowd. "Indeed, it is a striking testimony to the efficacy of representative government that we have survived all that we did, and come out intact! 'Harold!' the less certain of you might say, 'surely it is the fascists who stand atop the modern world in triumph?' And to which I respond that this is EXACTLY how we know that fascism is a failed system!"\n\nThe crowd murmured in confusion, and the Chairman shuffled in place for a moment as he waited for the crowd to quiet.\n\n"We need only to take stock of what the national socialists have done with their place at the apex of Europe - to know that they have squandered it all. The failure of fascism is remarkably self-evident in their actions. The Reich possessed all the good things a nation could want. The Reich had wealth, but by acting based on rhetoric rather than reason they burned it all away on frivolity. The Reich had land, seized from all the good nations of Europe - and yet, through their ill-stewardship they now find themselves strangled by the people who inhabit it! Lastly they had purpose! A fire burning in their nation that led them on a grand warpath, but this too, they wasted! That fire could have been a renaissance! It could have built monuments, industrial zones and wonders the world has never seen before! Instead, their great patriotic drive cost them a generation, not to mention their souls. Thus it is with great encouragement in my heart, that I must proclaim that fascism has failed, even when they stood at the apex of the world, whereas democracy prevailed, even in the darkest of times.""
ENG_mac.1101.a:0 "National socialism would never work in England. It doesn't even work in Germany!"

ENG_mac.1102.t:0 "A Midnight Vow"
ENG_mac.1102.desc:0 "A single nagging thought wouldn't let Harold Macmillan sleep, a relentless notion that refused to release itself from his brain.\n\nHad he done enough?\n\nThe Royal Party. It was their floundering that had kept England on its knees for nearly twenty years. Every crisis he dealt with in his first term was spawned entirely by the negligence of his forebears. He had already moved against them, his war on corruption had already purged the most blatant offenders from the Royalist ranks, but those that remained were still dangerous. Should they ever find themselves in power again, they would undo his work - be it intentionally or through their characteristic bumbling.\n\nWith the Royal Party in power the fascists would rise again, and corruption would return to soil British democracy once more.\n\nHad he done enough? No, not nearly."
ENG_mac.1102.a:0 "But I will. By god, I will."

ENG_mac.1103.t:0 "187 Reasons for Shame"
ENG_mac.1103.desc:0 ""-no, I wholeheartedly object to the notion that this was a political move. My administration has sought to root out institutional corruption anywhere it pops up, and it's hardly a political action on my part that one party proved to be responsible for the broad majority of it," explained Harold Macmillan to the assembled reporters on Downing Street.\n\n"But surely it's no coincidence that you've released an entire 187 page BOOK outlining the corruption of your political rivals this morning, Chairman."\n\n"No no, you've got it quite backwards I'm afraid. My administration has released reports on every major political body in England, including my own party. If the report on the systemic corruption within the Royal Party is better described as a book than as a report, then it is the Royal Party who must bear the responsibility of it!" rumbled Macmillan. "You can believe it was a partisan action if that is your wish tonight, but the report on Royal Party corruption is public and all the information held within is verifiable. After a day's lag while the nation reads it, I'm certain you'll all come to see that the report is as objective as it is damning for the Royalists.""
ENG_mac.1103.a:0 "A well-deserved catastrophe for the Royal Party."

ENG_mac.1104.t:0 "The Fascists Shall Whistle No More"
ENG_mac.1104.desc:0 "It was the seventh time hearing the National Front rattle off about 'protecting the English identity,' and 'defending traditional values from degeneration,' that finally convinced Macmillan that the National Front needed more of his attention.\n\nThose that hadn't been locked up for associating with the Blackshirts, or for speaking fascist rhetoric, had become skilled at playing off his good graces. They preached the same dangerous nonsense, regardless of if they threw a thin coat of deniability over top of it. Sly words might have worked on some of the population, but Macmillan had no patience for it.\n\nThose fascists still walked the streets, still served in parliament, and still undermined democracy.\n\nIt was time to deal with them once and for all."

ENG_mac.1105.t:0 "The End of the National Front"
ENG_mac.1105.desc:0 "National headlines were made today when the remaining National Front leadership was swiftly rounded up by Scottish police in a quick and decisive action. Some are demanding to know what exactly the National Front did to break the law, and several hours went by with only a brief comment from Chairman Macmillan stating that 'they were in the National Front.' The media reached a frenzy of speculation that this signalled an end to the party system as Macmillan was now clearly considering 'being in another party' to be a crime.\n\nLater in the evening, a full explanation was given, clarifying that fascism was illegal, and since the National Front was a fascist party, it was therefore criminal to be a member of it.\n\nNo statement has been allowed to reach the public from Chesterton himself, but observers suspect that the prosecution will be aiming for a sentence of life imprisonment for all involved."
ENG_mac.1105.a:0 "Well deserved."

ENG_mac.1106.t:0 "Chesterton in Exile"
ENG_mac.1106.desc:0 "In a surprise move today, Harold Macmillan announced an arrangement with the German embassy, allowing for Chesterton and the inner circle of the National Front to be allowed to serve their punishment through exile, rather than through prison time.\n\nThe Chairman stated that this was 'what was best for everyone,' and that this would allow these controversial figures their freedom, while still keeping fascism out of English politics.\n\nIn a statement, before he was bundled into a government transport, Chesterton himself vowed that he and his party would continue to 'fight for the English cause,' though he agreed that his time in England needed to come to an end."

ENG_mac.1107.t:0 "A Failed Partnership"
ENG_mac.1107.desc:0 "Chairman Macmillan stormed out from parliament, furious, as he often found himself after days like this. Hours he'd been scolded, talked down to, or otherwise thwarted by the liberal faction. He fumed, standing in place for a moment, his fingers curling up at the disgust.\n\nA man dared to catch his eyes across the street. Maudling.\n\nMaudling who had entered into the United England Party as his partner, as his friend, who was meant to be the whip for the liberals, to keep them in line! And yet, as time went on, he had proved himself useless - alternating between refusing to keep his faction in check, or joining them in outright denouncing Macmillan's government!\n\nMaudling met Macmillan's glare with sad eyes, bowing his head low in shame. Both men knew that Maudling had failed at his duty.\n\nThe Prime Minister snorted in anger, and began walking to his car."

ENG_mac.1108.t:0 "An Unhappy Plan"
ENG_mac.1108.desc:0 "Quietly drinking his afternoon tea, the plan was decided upon in Chairman Macmillan's head. It was a harsh plan, but one that needed doing. Truthfully, it would hurt him more than anyone else, despite that fact that it wouldn't look that way.\n\nTruthfully, he supposed he should have been the angry one, for it was no fault of his own that this had happened, he was merely reacting to what was happening around him. He girded his heart, and allowed the quiet certainty to surface in his mind into a resolute thought.\n\nMaudling had to go.\n\nHis hand trembled as he picked his teacup up once more."
ENG_mac.1108.a:0 "Damn Maudling for making me do this!"

ENG_mac.1109.t:0 "A Parting of Old Friends"
ENG_mac.1109.desc:0 "Maudling caught the glass of whiskey Macmillan slid to him across the desk.\n\n"You know, we certainly had some good times, didn't we, Reggie?"\n\n"Sir?" asked Maudling as his heart sank. He knew deep down what this was, but he couldn't bear to admit it.\n\n"Oh Reggie, are you really going to make me say it aloud?"\n\nSo then, that confirmed it. Reginald Maudling felt a shudder wrack his body.\n\n"Who will be taking my position, sir?"\n\n"No one, Reggie. By god if you couldn't do it, no one can. I'll run the party directly. They'll all fall in line."\n\nMaudling nodded sadly. Macmillan was most likely correct. With him serving as his own whip, it was doubtful the liberals would be exercising their independence for much longer.\n\n"One last drink, Reggie, to the good times," offered Macmillan, raising his own glass to Reggie with a bittersweet smile.\n\n"I don't think I have the heart, sir," said Maudling, blinking away the tears.\n\nMacmillan nodded somberly, and allowed his old friend to leave the office with what dignity he had left."

A lady doesn't fuss when ignored, when wounded, when insulted, nor even when slighted."\n\n"Is that what you think has happened, Margaret, you feel you've been slighted?" asked Macmillan, his eyebrows narrowing.\n\n"Well if I did, I wouldn't fuss, would I?" she answered with a rebellious smile. "No, a lady knows that fussing shall get her nowhere. But a lady has other ways of getting what she wants, other ways of taking revenge."\n\n"Is that so?" growled Macmillan, standing up from his desk.\n\n"Extraordinarily so, Prime Minister. And there's one more thing you ought to know about a lady. She ALWAYS gets what she wants in the end."\n\nMacmillan slumped back into his seat in shock as the Iron Lady did an about-face and left his office with a clack of heels on the stone floor."

There were people beside her, but they were not real people. They were marionettes, bought and paid for already. She didn't even listen to Maudling's speeches anymore. She knew what he was going to say, and what she would say back. It was all so textbook. So planned. And Macmillan was behind all of it.\n\nShe could barely get herself to stand up and challenge Maudling anymore. At this point, she did it for the exercise. The outcome would be the same anyway. The votes would be counted, the act would pass or it would fail, but not by her doing. For once, she was without agency - powerless at last. And there was nothing to be done. Macmillan had too much leverage, not just over her, but over the whole of the RP. He was the one pulling the strings now, and hers were on rather too tight.\n\nMaybe one day she would break free and once again lead a proud opposition, or even be the PM herself.\n\nBut that seemed less and less likely by the day."

ENG_mac.1114.t:0 "The Patriot Act"
ENG_mac.1114.desc:0 "Macmillan sighed as he watched the debate in Parliament spiral on out of control for another day over the Patriot Act he needed passed. Didn't these people understand? The enemies of England had not simply disappeared after the war. They were out there, somewhere, waiting for another time to strike. At the very least, HE would not be content with sitting back and watching it happen.\n\nOf course, that was the public spin. Something for Maudling to argue about with the opposition. The real importance of the act is making sure that everyone, EVERYONE has their secrets in the pocket of one Harold Macmillan. And when he thought about the enemies of England, he didn't just think about the traitors who had been defeated in the war, no sir. There were plenty of enemies on the opposite side of the House to think about. Furthermore, there might be some on his side of the aisle as well.\n\nAll would be known. In time. For this act would be passed, like all the others, surely. And Macmillan's power to safeguard democracy from those who would see fascists in power again would become more and more absolute.

Nothing could be cozier than his little lounge, with his little glasses and little books, all neatly arranged in a row. Exactly where they should be. Exactly where he wanted them.\n\nThere were more important texts than "A Brief History of British Involvement in Afghanistan", by William Anglesworth, to consider now. Mountains of documents on every MP in the House. Pages of secrets on each minister and executive and business and important official and general. All his. All collected by his apparatus, now moving like clockwork to secure his influence over the government.\n\nThat influence had never been greater, and it was time for him to decide the path of the nation, now truly united under his guidance. Once, there had been discord. Now, there was only harmony. Harmony amongst the MPs, harmony in the party, harmony in the country. He could take pride in the fact that democracy could be maintained in such splendid order. And it was all his doing. This, he thought, is the way things ought to be. The way they have to be.\n\nFor England was his, to watch over and keep safe. He would do what was necessary. By now, no one else could."

When he looked over to pick up the glass, he noticed something peculiar on the label. Whiskey? What was that misspelling? He took up the bottle and looked closely. Then, he found it. American.\n\nHis mind thought about that for a moment. An American anything would be unthinkable a few years ago. Let alone an expensive liquor on the sanctions list. But here it was. And doubtlessly, there would be more across the kingdom. All thanks to Mac, of course.\n\nEngland had a chance for a future, thanks to him and Mac. One of freedom and plenty under liberalism.

And he knew what to do about it.\n\nThere would be a plan. Track down the bribes. Find the corrupt officials. Follow the money. And Identify the people making the payments.

So it had to get a handle on this cycle of warmongering and fraud.\n\nFirst step would be to clean up the ranks. Several generals had been identified as accepting money or other perks in exchange for lobbying for contracts. They would have to go. Maudling signed the papers that would begin court-marshals against them first. Maybe they would be successful, maybe not. But they would be permitted to resign rather than face the humiliation. And that would get them out of the way.\n\nNext, legal proceedings of a different type. Lawsuits against armament companies. They were bribing military officials, and they were defrauding the government out of money. That was highly illegal in England. And now the hammer would be coming down.\n\nHe sighed. It had been an hour of work, and he had to go to Buckingham to receive the new ambassador from Cuba. One day, he would get the entire military industry under the government's control, but that would have to wait for now. It had been a pretty active and accomplished day on that front anyway."

You do know the old pre-war government kept tabs on that sort of thing, didn't you? We have the MI5 files.\n\nMister Richardson, let's stop beating around the bush. You're a fascist. You worked with fascists. And you were probably as much a traitor to the old government as you are to mine. But I'm giving you a chance. You renounce your affiliations now, and work with me, and everything will be fine, nobody has to know. Otherwise you'll just have to be sent to a place that appreciates your sentiments, and I dare say you'll be staying there for a very long time.

The Prime Minister would write to them, and demand their immediate resignations. They were getting old, and new people would need to replace them.

For the longest time, it was a one-party state only catering to the elites and the rich. It was highly regressive in pretty much every aspect. And the furthest left was Maudling and the UE party.\n\nBut that was only the government. Maudling long knew the government wasn't representative. And he felt there were a number of people who were significantly more left than the government currently represented. So he made the poll.\n\nHe was correct. There were a great number of voters who weren't quite socialists, but they weren't represented in parliament either. That opened up an enormous opportunity.

They still sat in the same benches. And they would still identify themselves with the party label.\n\nThis peculiar situation had one explanation. Despite their hatred of each other, there still was a common goal between them. Both sides were close to a democratic England.

Sure, they try to put on a respectable face today, but we know what they really think. And what they have done. From the early days of the occupation, to Cable Street, to the Civil War, even to last week.\n\nWe'll start gathering all the dirt we can find on the Royal Party.

It would be a full press offensive.\n\nThere was plenty of nasty information found about the Royal Party. Did anyone expect there to not be? You don't collaborate with the Nazis for twenty years without doing some despicable things. And being the unashamed party of the rich and the elite wasn't exactly a populist move. Then, there were the damned lies they had told. It had all been gathered into a series of reports that were about to go out after this speech.\n\nMaudling checked it again, making sure it was good.

Sitting at her desk as she signed some forms relating to one policy or another she was actually considering something of far greater importance.\n\nNamely, to whom should the Prime Minister as an office have a direct line to call if need be. In the privacy of her mind she'd taken to call them the "blue" and "black" options. The blue telephone to the Americans would have several distinct advantages, for a start it would be an immediate and needed contact point between London and Washington which simply didn't exist, and if the Reich ever became hostile would most certainly need to exist. But the Americans were fickle, one wrong administration and the entire effort of bringing them over to her point of view could be rendered naught.\n\nThe black telephone did not possess this restriction. The Führer was the Führer, and nobody would be replacing him any time soon. More to the point, to not coddle the Germans at least somewhat could be far more dangerous than doing the same to the Americans. Germania was closer, and the channel far less an obstacle than the entire Atlantic Ocean. Margaret Thatcher had just finished signing the last form when her decision was made."

If things went poorly, Thatcher was liable to be writing both. The ministers were already informed of the rough plan, and her off time had been spent doing little else beyond writing up what could be described best as a mad gambit- the natural next step to her isolationist measures, and something which stood to threaten or solidify everything she'd built up until now. England was going to have a talk with the Americans and Germans, and it was going to leave the talk richer than ever, or chained to a Führer or President.\n\nOf course, if this gambit failed, all of Thatcher's diplomatic efforts since her election would have been wasted, every second dedicated to foreign policy nothing more than delaying one side or another of fate. Even still, if things went through without a hitch, if the Americans and Germans had been played off of each other perfectly, then England would do more than outmaneuver the OFN and Pakt, it would establish itself away from them forevermore, so long as Thatcher still had a say in what went on in every spec of British politics, not that such a scenario was really that far off.\n\nThatcher checked the clock. Half past seven. There were worse ways to spend a day, but there were better ways to waste a night. If Thatcher was ever going to strike the iron while it was hot, now was the time. England was strong, the OFN and Pakt had busied themselves with their own problems, and it seemed like nobody had expected England to do anything of the sort to jeopardize their own position. Of course, making it clear to the President and Führer that England was looking for more than a declaration or acknowledgement would be the hard part. How should anyone tell the leader of a superpower that they expected contributions to the economy, military, and securement of their foreign policy?\n\nIf experience served right, the answer was to not tell them at all."

With new advancements in the English military, she believes her nation is now impervious to enemy attack, and the desire of the world to court it speaks to its strength.\n\nOutsiders were more skeptical, with the claim being regarded as "dubious" by the Brookings Institution. In a report, they claim it is unlikely a nation with a limited sphere of influence outside its own borders like England could call itself a global player, especially since it lacked the hallmarks of other superpowers, such as nuclear weaponry. They also report England's diplomatic relations are merely a result of them holding a valuable geopolitical position, and not because they are respected by foreign powers.

In fact, I issue a challenge. If any Briton does not believe that a fair and free meritocracy is one of the main bulwarks of individual freedom, then they had better become a National Socialist and have done with it!"\n\nThe crowd roared to life at her finale, and Thatcher had to smile at the results.

Can you justify spending so much to help the poorest in our country to become wealthier?"\n\n"Well, naturally, I believe that the highest duty of any society is to get everyone, including the poor, to utilize their talents for their benefit and the benefit of the country. Under previous economic systems advocated for by the opposition, the poor were not getting richer, the rich were merely getting poorer. This helps nobody and lifts not a single soul out of poverty. What will lift them out of poverty are new business, new jobs, a lower burden of tax, and cheaper housing.

Where she saw her successes, she also saw factors that were outside of her control. Tensions ebbing and flowing in the Pacific and Atlantic alike, flecks of opposition that she couldn't fully smoke out, and worst of all: the Oil Crisis. The chaos in the Middle East was the most dangerous single thing to everything she had built up, and she was all too aware that she had built a House of Cards. A House built up of the hardiest stock, made of the best and most elegant architecture, but a House of Cards that only required but one catastrophe to fall to pieces.\n\nWhile she could focus on every individual crisis, which she would need to, she could also drink to the magnificent success of her reign."

The order that stood was that the Populace dwelled at the bottom, the Elite above them, and her above even the richest of the remaining Oligarchs. What many didn't understand, though, was that the Populace could not be ignored. Of course, the Elite held their wealth and riches, but Margaret knew that the loyalty of the Populace was paramount for a successful nation. After all, this same Populace had almost overthrown the government, not even a decade ago. While reducing people into basic groups was all well and good, she knew that she couldn't target the Populace as one group. Once one looked closer at the Populace, they would find that there stood not just one approachable Stallion, but two unwieldy foals in need of coaxing; the Average and the Poor.\n\n"The Average Man," as many called them, was a fanciful way of referring to the Middle Class. The Middle Class, a group of those who weren't rich or poor, but a group instead made up of the absolute middle of society. The Average Man doesn't sleep within a slum, nor do they sleep inside of a Manor. They may have some luxuries, and lack many more, but they do hold something that many lack: Hope. This Hope is a resource that can be mobilised, something that can be used to ensure the solidified support of the most average men.\n\nWhile the Middle Class has Hope, the Poor have numbers. The most prolific group, the poor live in varying levels of squalor, from the streets to shacks. While not in possession of the exploitable aspirations of the Middle Class, the armies of impoverished men that roam England have an even more caterable desire: survival. While the Middle Class desire to become Elites, the Poor simply want decent lives, and that is something that Margaret knew she could exploit.

In a way, she sat at a crossroads between two avenues of support, both valid, if not equally so.\n\nBefore she departed for the day, she had received piles of requests from different papers, radio shows, and television broadcasts to grace them with her presence. She was quite good at the media game, she knew how to dominate it. A few solid quips in the right places would cause even the most steadfast listener to metaphorically swoon at the call of her voice, the witty construction of words whipping her opponents in a graceful spectacle. While there are plentiful people who would enjoy hearing the Lady speak over the airwaves, or analyse her phrases in the papers, countless more desire to feel her presence in person.\n\nIn fact, she had received equal amounts of requests for public speeches, rallies across England where she would exhibit the soft touch of the Iron Lady. Margaret knew that people, on a deep and base level, responded better to a face that they had seen in person. She had enough of a security detail that such encounters wouldn't be a danger to her personal safety, though portraying it in that fashion would make her seem even braver and greater for it, what this all came down to was Man's greatest and oldest enemy: Time.

Thatcher couldn't believe what she was reading: most generals claimed that the loyalist army was well equipped and supplied, and that victory wasn't all that surprising.\n\n"In addition, when contrasted with the armed rebels, loyalist troops suffered from a massive lack of organization, cohesion, and morale. It is the opinion of this author that, if these issues are not rectified quickly, the English army will surely suffer from them in future conflicts."\n\nThatcher closed the report and breathed deeply.

Low, rolling hills; a broad, shallow estuary; large city nearby; and a bridge. He thought it over, reaching for an old map of Britain that he had in his bag.\n\nBeing very careful not to rip the tired old creases in the map, he unfolded it. He doubted very much that there were any plans for an excursion to the Continent, so a map of the British Isles would be just fine. The operation obviously wasn't meant to be in England, and much of Wales had more highland terrain than here, and there were no large estuaries there. His eyes moved up to Scotland.

"How many planes do you have at the moment?"\n\n"To give you an idea, the RAF currently has 200 jet fighter aircraft... of which only 47 are currently operable. It doesn't end there, either, there's a significant shortage of capable pilots and officers. In addition, most of the old German aircraft we have are simply worn out. Even if we got them out of the shops they aren't likely to last very long."\n\n"I see," said Thatcher, "well, it looks as though we have some work to do.""

A broad fuselage with semi-circular air intakes underneath the wings, which then led into the two rotatable vectored thrust jet engines. "Alright," came a buzz over the loudspeaker system on the base, "let's start it off, nice and slow, 10 metre elevation."\n\nThe craft slowly, steadily rose up as the pilot commanded it. It stopped after only a few seconds and sat in the air, hovering. Brody scribbled down whatever of note he could see. It was remarkably stable, more so than some helicopters he had seen. The voice over the loudspeaker interjected again, "Alright, lower her back down. We'll do some more tests later."\n\nBrody couldn't wait to watch them."

ENG_thatcher.310.desc:0 "Prime Minister Thatcher, the Royal Navy reconstruction project is proceeding as planned. In the next few weeks, the keel of 6 new corvettes and 4 cruisers will be laid down. However, per your request when you met with Defence Secretary Barber, new capital ships will also be laid down. There are two possible options, as the designs have already been available for years. As carriers have been ruled out as an option, only large, battleship-type vessels will be able to fill this role. We can either build a single, massive ship, armed with the largest guns in the world, and a length nearing a quarter of a mile; or we can build two, somewhat more modestly sized battlecruisers, comparable in size with the Kriegsmarine's old Bismarck-class ships in terms of size.\n\nWhile the larger ship would definitely provide a greater propaganda and prestige opportunity, as it would give us the single largest naval vessel in the world-- even larger than the Japanese Yamato-class-- it would probably be more practical to have the two smaller ships. They would be faster, and obviously could handle two situations simultaneously. Either way, the project will be expensive and take many months to complete."

The new Royal Navy carrier, HMS King Edward VIII, flying the St. George's Cross, billowing like so many of its smaller copies in the hands of shorebound onlookers.\n\nThe ship had been a long time coming, and while the crowds weren't bad, David certainly wished more had come to see this masterpiece he had a part in creating. In any case, he didn't spend too much time staring at the people, but rather the ship they were all admiring. With a carrying capacity of up to 80 aircraft, a length of more than a thousand feet, and a displacement of 95,000 tons, she was a sight to behold. The long flat runway cast an almost monolithic shadow that, with the low hanging morning sun in the distance, almost touched the shore.\n\nThere must have been a thousand people to admire the start of her first deployment. Propaganda film crews stood in the background, cameras in hand, capturing the moment for the rest of the world to see. David looked at the people in the crowd, waving their St. George's Crosses in patriotic fervor. He saw a child sitting on his father's back waving a Union Jack, as well.

ENG_thatcher.100.desc:0 "Sitting alone in his Whitehall office, Francis Pym awaited his next meeting with the Prime Minister. There had been a great deal of these talks recently, to Pym they had become more and more frustrating, even slowly becoming tiresome. Sometimes he wondered what was even the point of trying to sway Thatcher.\n\nThis particular meeting was to be about the appointment of an ambassador to the Reich. He had already hand picked an able candidate, Roger Jackling, the two men shared similar opinions on how England should handle the German behemoth. Jackling's abilities had already been proven within the Foreign Office.\n\nExcept this meant little to Thatcher. She wasted no time in telling Pym who he was to send to Germania, her nomination was Frank Roberts, an outspoken believer in what he called German 'containment'. The fact that Pym had already chosen an ambassador did not appear to have even crossed her mind.\n\nAll this greatly upset Pym. The more he tried to negotiate with the Prime Minister the more she ignored him. It was enough to make him consider neglecting Thatcher's order."

This time the subject of the talk would be who would represent England in Washington.\n\nShe instructed him to send Patrick Dean, a man who she told Pym would "uphold our interests". However, the interests of the foreign secretary were not the same as her own.\n\nThe problem Pym had was that he had already decided upon David Ornsby to be the US ambassador. Yet before he could object, the Prime Minister had moved on.\n\nHe had begun to wonder if the Prime Minister would ever allow him to make his own decisions."

ENG_thatcher.1200.desc:0 ""It's an affront to our people that any corner of the Isles be under the control of a foreign power," Thatcher declares. "Cornwall has been under the control of Adolf and his chums for far too long. Now is the time to reclaim that which rightfully is English."\n\nIt's all well and good making bold declarations, she thinks, but there's an ocean of difference between words and actions. There's two paths to walk in this situation, and they're sitting either side of her desk at Number 10, looking expectantly at her. The Foreign Secretary and his posse whitter on at her, saying that she should open diplomatic channels with Germany to negotiate a peaceful transfer of the Garrison. After all, they say, Germany has never been weaker, and never more likely to accept a deal.\n\nOn the other side of her sits the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Defence Secretary. They're adamant that a strong show of force while England is at its zenith and Germany is at its nadir will get the Germans to fold, return Cornwall to English hands, and reestablish England as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nShe needs to decide now; will she use a silk glove, or iron fist?"
ENG_thatcher.1200.a:0 "Diplomacy is the way. We've seen too much of war lately."

ENG_thatcher.1201.desc:0 "Taking England into a war with Germany could end up costing the Isles their newly-found liberty. Germany is most certainly weak, but they've not exactly collapsed. It's not a far flung idea to see legions of Wehrmacht soldiers landing in Cornwall and marching past the Tamar. It is best to take things slowly, and peacefully.\n\nThe Defence staff pursed their lips in disapproval, but the Foreign Secretary is nodding in satisfaction and enthusiasm. The assorted diplomats and ambassadors gathered behind him begin chattering excitedly, so much so that she can barely hear herself think. When they calm, they look at her in anticipation, waiting for the signal to burst into action.\n\n"Excellent choice, Ma'am," the Secretary purrs, "We'll begin preparing at once. For now, your orders?"\n\nShe leans back, thinking of all of the ways she could handle this, but she's always been a direct person. Some have said it was her greatest weakness, some have said it was her greatest strength."

ENG_thatcher.1202.t:0 "London Calling"
ENG_thatcher.1202.desc:0 "Thatcher's demand for a direct line of communication with Germania is met with a flurry of frenzied activity. The following days in Whitehall are filled with people rushing past one another, bumping into each other, knocking papers out of each other's hands and spilling tea over each other. No one really stops to apologise, but no one's really looking for one either. It's showtime, here. No time to take or give an apology when there's work to be done.\n\nTheir counterparts in the Reichstag are surprisingly helpful - perhaps it's out of surprise at the frenzied tone in their voices, or perhaps they too had been looking to open lines of communication between the nations. Either way, Thatcher is quickly presented with a bakelite telephone, sitting innocuously at her desk, to the Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nHer office is empty, but she knows that there's a hundred people listening in on her end and a hundred people listening in on the other when she picks up the handset."

Rhetoric on how the English deserved their homeland united, bringing up the Versailles treaty and how wrong it had been to break Germany apart, what trauma it caused the nation. He responds with a droning list of uses and functions that Garrison provides - all of them entirely fabricated or exaggerated, she's sure.\n\nEventually she can't take it anymore. She interrupts him, asking a single question: "What," she begins, "is Cornwall to the Reich? What ultimate use is it?" She hears the man at the other end suck in a breath to respond and barrels on, not giving him the chance to speak. "I'll tell you.""

ENG_thatcher.1204.desc:0 "The talks with the Reichsminister weren't as successful as Thatcher hoped. They'd definitely opened up the avenues for further communication, but the actual purpose of the discussion hadn't been a success.\n\nHe'd all but said that he believed that England was in no position to be threatening war, considering how well their last against Germany had played out. Not exactly, he was a diplomat after all, but it was in the barely-veiled subtext. Well, she thinks, if Germany is going to throw their weight around, she'll respond in kind. She demands that the Defence staff come to the office. When they do, she's seething, and orders massive military exercises conducted on the border with the Garrison. They salute and are kind enough not to smile about it, at least until they're out the door.\n\nIf they wanted to talk a big game, then she'd show them how big of a game she was willing to play."

ENG_thatcher.1205.t:0 "German Humour"

The joke dies down, not as funny anymore. Then they receive even more. In a week they're receiving detailed descriptions of massive military training exercises - exercises conducted in reconstructions of Truro, Plymouth, and Bodmin Moor. No one's joking now.\n\nThe Reichsminister feels like a fool looking at the phone on his desk. A short time ago he'd enjoyed mocking (subtly, he thought) the woman at the other end, and now here he was, hand hanging over the phone, reluctant to pick up the handset. Turned out that London wasn't joking when they'd last spoken. If anything, the joke was now on him."

When the conversation reaches a point where they've discussed the value of Cornwall enough, Thatcher drops her demands in like a tonne of bricks.\n\n"We expect the full return of Cornwall to England - annexation in full. In return, we will allow all German soldiers on English soil free passage to their homeland, and the return of all German military equipment in Cornwall." The line goes silent for a moment. When the Reichsminister speaks again there's some strain in his voice, and he asks for time to consult with his superiors. She acknowledges the need, and hangs up the phone.

Where once the English request for the return of Cornwall was seen as a joke, it has swiftly become clear that it was anything but.\n\nThe Reichsminister sits with other leading members of the Government and waits. They too speak over one another, some calling the military exercises in the region a bluff, others arguing that even if it is, it's one that the Reich could ill afford to call. Some argue that the return of Wehrmacht soldiers from British soil is, in fact, a win for the overextended and tired military, where others argue that withdrawal compromises German diplomatic authority in Europe. The Führer watches silently.\n\nThe arguing goes on and on, until eventually the Führer stands. The table falls silent, and the Reichsminister fidgets when he's levelled a long hard look."
ENG_thatcher.1207.a:0 "We can't risk another war. We have to accept their demands."

The Germans folded. The withdrawal of foreign forces is to begin immediately, and in no time at all control over the (former) German Garrison of Cornwall is to be handed over to London.\n\nShe could dance, she could cry, she could run out into the street and scream in joy at the top of her lungs. She won't, of course - it would be greatly improper - but the sentiment remains. She'd begun to have doubts that she'd taken the wrong path, and Christ knows that if she had it'd be the end of the line for her. But now, this has simply cemented her place in history."

They are going to march across the Tamar.\n\nThe Defence staff nod in grim determination, even as the Foreign Secretary drops his head into his hands. She gives the Defence Secretary the go-ahead to prepare for a full scale invasion of the Garrison, using any and all means available to them. She receives some crips salutes, and promises that she'd have reports on her desks by morning.\n\nShe nods, but before they leave, they turn to her and advise that they act quickly on this.

He always pictured himself serving in Russia or Ostland, a place where he could showcase the full might of his fatherland, but instead he got occupational duties in Cornwall.\n\nIn all fairness, it wasn't the worst post in the world. He could have been sent to one of the African RKs - or god forbid, Madagaskar - he enjoyed the relative isolation of his post and the natural beauty of England quite a bit.\n\nAs he continued to enjoy his sandwich, he could hear a slight rumble from somewhere beyond him. Sometimes a German truck passed by, on its way to Truro or Exeter or some place, but this rumble sounded different. In caution, Hans put down his sandwich and picked up the rifle set next to him. Lining the scope in front of his left eye, he could distinctly see a company of English tanks rolling on towards the border station. As intimidating as it was, they sometimes came into Cornwall for exercises, so he didn't think much of it. He put his rifle down and continued to eat his breakfast.\n\nHowever, after a moment, he noticed a spark come out of one of the tank's turrets."

Still, she's surprised at the proposal.\n\nThe Führer, apparently, agreed that the Garrison had served its purpose in Britain, and would happily return the forces to Germany and relinquish control of Cornwall to English hands. She waits for the catch, and isn't disappointed.\n\nThe port of Plymouth, however, is to remain in German hands. He brings up how Hong Kong flourished under British rule, and suggests that keeping the port in German hands would simply bring the two nations closer together. What he doesn't mention, of course, is the fact that Germany would maintain control of a key naval base in English territory, nor the fact that imports from Plymouth would be subject to German tariffs before entering England proper. In effect, England gets Cornish land back, but Germany keeps its control of the naval authority in the region.\n\nThe call ends, and Thatcher convenes the cabinet. She's expected to give a response."

He'd been treading dangerous waters with the English issue, having not given it his full attention from the start. The acceptance of the proposal is simply the best that he could have hoped for - if the Führer had rejected all notions of dismantling the Garrison, he'd have been castigated for allowing the situation to degenerate to open conflict. If the Führer had handed all of Cornwall back to the English, then he'd have been embarrassed for his inability to negotiate a better deal for the Reich.\n\nHe eyes the phone on his desk balefully.

Margaret Thatcher sits in her office and lets herself feel some pride.\n\nOf course, while a win for the English, the Plymouth Proposal did not come without its own drawbacks.

Hell, they've probably taken the whole debacle as an exercise to prove to the world at England's expense that Germany was still a main player.

The English military, as of right now, can only sufficiently support an invasion of Cornwall for thirty days. After that, they expect massive supply issues and logistical collapse. In short, if they're going to invade Cornwall, they have a month.\n\nThatcher has no idea if it'll work. She doesn't know how fortified the Garrison's positions are, how well equipped and trained they are, how deeply embedded with the local populace they are. And now they only have thirty days of battle before their military begins to crumble. She could throttle the Defence Secretary, and by the look on his face, he knows."

#### Thatcher Economic Events
ENG_thatcher.1000.t:0 "The Greengrocer's Daughter"
ENG_thatcher.1000.desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher always fondly remembered her time as a simple shop assistant. Not for the job in itself, but her purpose and feeling of advancement. She built herself while she helped to build her parent's business, and was compensated for her efforts appropriately. Ownership, destiny, self-worth- these were not handed to her, but earned by her steadfast determination and ability.\n\nEvery day, she would think about what she could do to better her situation. This mindset, she would frequently remind MPs and common folk alike, is sorely missing from today's England. Hard times are no excuse for laziness or envy. One must work one's way up rather than pulling others down. The groceries she sold were not forced upon the customer, but delivered freely and for mutual benefit. It was not the cruel hand of the market that determined her fate, but her own willingness to study and work hard in the cause that meant she would succeed - and others would not.\n\nThis mindset had served her well into adulthood, and her stern visage and harsh attitude may alienate some or drive potential allies away. But surely, this small sacrifice was more than made up for by the grit and bulldog's tenacity that meant that she would get what she wanted, come hell or high water. Politics is the art of the possible, and so the pragmatic and self-sufficient greengrocer's daughter had come up into a world that she would control utterly through skill, maneuvering, and sheer groundwork."

ENG_thatcher.1001.t:0 "A New Way of Doing Things"
ENG_thatcher.1001.desc:0 "Thatcher started slowly in her opening remarks.\n\n"As all the Honourable Members are well aware, England faces an economic crisis as it has never seen before. Half of our wealth has been spent on thoroughly destroying the other half. We must - and I repeat, we must - begin our recovery with serious economic reform that will refit and refuel private enterprise to take our country to its former economic standing.\n\nThis will involve many changes to monetary and fiscal policy, which shall no doubt illicit catcalls and cacophony from the cronies who have established themselves like weevils in the government's purse. However, I am reassured daily by the irritation of the English people with such socialist policy, and their desire to see their own enterprise justly rewarded.\n\nWe must utilize all of England's resources - her people, her factories, her wealth, and her ingenuity, to rebuild a better economic system that works for all people, not merely those who seek the middling status quo. I have seen what the status quo has brought to our country, and I will not have it. I suggest to all members of Parliament fed up with the way things have been done for all these years - come and join us! There's enough for everyone.\n\nAnd so, I challenge the English people to stand up for what is theirs and take responsibility for their own future. Rather than having the government dictate what they can and cannot do, let them move forward as best their abilities and resources can manage. Enough government meddling, it's time for change!""

ENG_thatcher.1002.desc:0 "Despite all the speeches and articles about how England must look towards privatization in order to secure her economic future, the exact scale of that privatization had not been precisely outlined. Naturally, there were many who disagreed with the idea of privatization of government services at all, but even more were unsure as to how much could or should be privatized.\n\nThis would have to be settled with some sort of compromise, but how best to use this to Thatcher's advantage?"

She slammed her papers down on the despatch box.\n\nThe opposition bench erupted in furious shouting.\n\n"OOOOORDAAAAAH! The Prime Minister's point must be heard, and will be heard!" Shouted the Speaker.\n\n"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Honourable Gentleman may not have higher aspirations for his constituents and for the country, but I assure both them and all the people of England, that I do!""

But perhaps, she thought, she was too hard on herself.\n\nThe country would be more prosperous, the people happier, and the wealthy placated. Surely that was enough. But more could always be done.

They shall rise as far as their God-given talents can take them, and in doing so, will make their country a better place to live. We in the Royal Party have worked tirelessly to reform our government to free the people from undue burden and duress, and I believe we have done so.\n\nWhat remains now is for England to flourish, and the everyday Englishmen and women to flourish with it. I believe that the new monetary policies that we have put in place will allow them to start new businesses, build new homes, and make prudent investments in their lives and futures. England is now not only free, but on the path to economic well-being.\n\nThere will be hardships ahead, both for this government and the people it represents. But we must not let doubt or fear overtake us. Instead, with a stiff upper lip and good English courage, let us face the future head-on, and embrace revitalization in every way.

The honorable gentlemen, however, have been graciously consulted as to whether it will be done quickly and decisively, or slowly and carefully."\n\nScowls filled the chamber, and she answered them with a smile. They wouldn't vote against her, whatever their grumbling.\n\n"There is little doubt that the Prime Minister has made up her mind already," said a well spoken MP in a red tie, over indiscernible jeers from his fellows. "But if you'll truly do the 'honor' of consulting us, then I say we do this disastrous thing quickly, that the calamity of it all will be over with haste."\n\n"No!" roared a UE PM, accompanied by dull cheers of approval by his party.

No, the economy, much like a lady, must be treated well, taken for dinner, and enthusiastically conversed with.

"With this in mind, we find ourselves in another war, but not a military one. We're in a war with the most perverse enemy there is - bad economics!"\n\nMargaret Thatcher paused while the reporters chuckled, relieved that they weren't being informed of a German invasion.\n\n"England has been through more than any nation can be asked to," she continued. "And so we've come to the conclusion that our war on a poorly-thought out financial system will be a blitzkrieg, not a war of attrition.

I'm simply containing our biggest rival," Thatcher said with a sly smile, before stepping out to brief the press.\n\nThe Prime Minister put on her best smile and ignored the flashes of cameras and the shouted questions from the reporters.\n\n"I'd first like to thank the nation for tuning in on your favourite news station, and I hope you're all very comfortable this evening," she started, eyes scanning the room. "I'm delighted to tell you that your comrades and mine, the British Parliament, have had several fantastically productive chats recently that will finally free our markets as they always ought to have been. It's always been our view that the government should keep its hand out of business and to allow English ingenuity to drive the economy. What's now become impossible for any responsible government to ignore, however - is that there's another set of hands throttling the ability of Englishmen to compete in the market. We've elected that we absolutely must act to end the hegemonic rule of the corporations and give that economic potential back to the talented individual instead.""

ENG_thatcher.1010.desc:0 "The Midlands Times, SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW\nWritten by senior reporter Abigail Miller.\n\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised the nation last week with the announcement of the Local Powers Act, which would, in effect, neuter local governments. "It's no failure of democracy to say that the average voter has a limited appetite for it," The Prime Minister elaborated in a press conference on Friday afternoon. "Participation on all levels except federal are tragically low, with a handful of corrupt elites often swaying the election in their favor, and to the detriment of the majority. The best solution is to limit the powers of these fraudulent administrative bodies, thus preventing the local tyranny of a non-representative organization."\nThe statement, though persuasive to many, didn't do much to silence critics who felt that the act was merely an attempt to centralise even more power into the hands of her party.\n\nEditor's note: Cut the last sentence or the censors will do it for us."
ENG_thatcher.1010.a:0 "The central government is democratically elected, so it can't be tyranny for them to control everything."

ENG_thatcher.1011.t:0 "The Local Powers Act Passes!"
ENG_thatcher.1011.desc:0 "The Local Powers Act has passed today with little fanfare in the countryside, most citizens being apathetic, pulled in by the Prime Minister's rhetoric or simply too afraid to speak out about the blatant power grab. Reactions among the elites in London have been measurably more rapturous, however, with countless celebrations behind closed doors.\n\nThatcher's party now has broad powers over taxation, infrastructure, policing and countless other aspects of governance. A hiring spree has begun by the government, ironically mostly recruiting the now unemployed local administrators they had previously denounced as corrupt.\n\nWith this unprecedented legislative success handing the keys to power to the Royal Party, it's fair to say that the Royal Party has centralized too. To even the most stubborn of the old-guard party members, this has been nothing less than a miracle - with Margaret Thatcher as the messiah who made it happen."

ENG_thatcher.1012.desc:0 ""You know, when I became the leader of my party, there was plenty of chatter about the things that could and couldn't be done," said Margaret Thatcher, carefully looking each camera dead on in turn, and keeping her voice low and down to earth as her vocal coach had instructed her to. "'Margaret,' they would tell me, 'you can't oppose the corporate CEOs, you can't promote a free meritocracy and you CERTAINLY can't keep monied interests out of our elections!'"\n\nThe reporters suppressed their laughter, knowing full well the events that preceded this briefing. Margaret herself snickered for a moment too, glad that her words were landing correctly.\n\n"Yes, well, as most of you know, my administration has sought to do just that. We've arrested these so-called 'elites' who have felt entitled to occupy the positions of authority that more rightfully belong to honest, hard working Britons. These very same oafs who earned their place through nepotism alone and felt they had the right to bribe their way through our political system. Well, I think England has had quite enough of it, haven't we? We shall be holding these positions in the governments trust until proper candidates can fill them, as well as confiscating the plundered wealth and estates of these inept twits and putting it toward reparations for the English people. These funds shall build schools, renovate hospitals and put even more officers on the streets to ensure public safety.""

I warned him, and he resigned the same day."\n\nDenis' eyes went wide. There were days when his wife's position was outright terrifying.\n\n"And- and if Harold had not resigned? What would you have done to him?"\n\n"Well, let's be glad it hasn't come to that. Regardless, he'd have been removed from his ability to influence the party. Can you say grace dear? I'm famished."\n\nDenis nodded, raising his hands up for prayer, but saw they were trembling. One of his best friends had come within a razors edge of what was tantamount to a political purge by his wife. He swallowed as Margaret looked to him expectantly.\n\n"Dear...

"I think I speak for everyone here when I say that serving in the government is hard work, and no job harder or with longer hours than being Prime Minister. And does the honourable member know what I do when I get home? I cook dinner for my husband, Denis, every day and without exception.

Madame Prime Minister, you've just come off a congratulatory tour for the newfound success of your economic policies. Is there anything you'd like to say to the English people directly?"\n\n"Certainly. I'd like to correct your statement actually. The credit for the success of the English economy of late cannot truly be said to belong to my government, but rather to the hardworking people of England," she said, smiling into the camera. "The English worker is quite unlike the German or the American. The English worker doesn't feel entitled to a high paycheck due to the colour of his skin or the purity of his breeding. When an Englishman steps into a factory you can, with absolute certainty, know that he is going to earn his place with the industriousness that is typical for our nation. If anything, my government can only be said to have gotten out of the English workers way and finally let them do their jobs.

Company profits have increased by nearly seventy percent from the days prior to the civil war, and records have shown a rate of return for investors that has been hitherto unknown in Europe since before the Second World War.\n\nOn a per capita basis, England is rapidly on its way to catching up to the great economies of the world, and the overall competitiveness of its manufacturing sector might well surpass them in the near future. Of special interest to investors is the unique role the nation plays as an economic gateway that passes through the protectionist barrier between Europe and the Americas. With this advantageous position, the English shipping industry is already booming, and investors who act quickly are likely to receive huge returns on investment in that industry.\n\nSo long as London remains open to both Washington and Germania, and stays with the pro-business policies of Margaret Thatcher, they can expect near unparalleled trade opportunities. Even the Japanese have begun tentatively looking into opportunities in England, and the ports and warehouses belonging to the English nation are filling to the brim with goods from all across the world.\n\nPaulson and Cheedle recommend investors seriously consider opportunities in England."

ENG_mac.1000.t:0 "A United England?"
ENG_mac.1000.desc:0 ""There'll always be an England..." slurred Macmillan, after his, um, how many rounds of brandy?\n\n"AND ENGLAND SHALL BE FREE!" shouted Maudling, stumbling over the table and nearly knocking the whole thing over.\n\nThey didn't quite have the courage to finish the rest of the lyrics, but they had got the important parts. For, after all, their party, United England, had emerged victorious over the dirty fascists in the RP. An enormous burden was lifted from Macmillan's chest. He felt that he could breathe again, and see again. Everything was clear to him, in that hazy smoking room, as clear as the Courvoisier in his glass. Now he had the power to reshape England however he liked. And by Jove, he would do it.\n\nMacmillan watched Maudling slump into a leather chair and cozy up. The old boy was English at heart and English in nature, nobody could ever doubt that. But did he really have the stomach for what was going to come next? What Macmillan would have to do to prevent fascism from ever rising again wasn't going to be pleasant for everyone. He continued to stare at his erstwhile ally and took a brief sip."

ENG_mac.1001.t:0 "Meet the Chairman - Harold Macmillan"
ENG_mac.1001.desc:0 "Harold Macmillan was never one for rash action, but neither was he one for backing down in a crisis. When his country called in the Great War, he went. He was wounded in that war three times serving in the Grenadier Guards, and was lucky not to be killed in it. While he was too old to fight in the Second World War, he fought from the bench, railing against appeasement and avoidance of the conflict that had to come eventually.\n\nWhen that conflict did come, Britain lost. After the invasion and the fall of London, Macmillan realized that the situation was impossible. And, patient as ever, he knew the time had come to cut England's losses and move forward. This meant untold humiliation for a nation not used to it, but that was better than what he had experienced in the Great War. One can live with humiliation. One cannot live whilst being bombed and shelled and shot and mined.\n\nSo he organized the surrender, with Monty and Mountbatten and the rest. This allowed him a strong position in the RP, being an official collaborator. He never liked that label, and came rather close to defecting entirely during the English Civil War. Yet again, the time was not right - or was it? This most careful of decisions turned into one of his greatest personal failings, as the horrors of the German Civil War stretched on without end. This was, indeed, the golden window for England to assert her independence once more.\n\nBut this is no time to cry over spilled milk. The party - nay, the country - needs a leader. Someone who will ensure that fascism is squashed from our new England and that England shall be free. But what price in freedom will the country have to pay to secure its future under "Supermac"?"

Though officially affiliated with the Royal Party since the breakup, no one could really say that his allegiance was with the government rather than his friend Macmillan. And so, due to Macmillan's power, no one was willing to get rid of him.\n\nInstead, the dreamer stuck around, obsessed with his ridiculous dream of restoring something that had already been lost. Or had it?\n\nFor when the English Civil War came, and the German Civil War along with it, there was a brief window for England to break away entirely, and become truly free again. And while Maudling sided with Macmillan again and stayed with the government, he still sees this window as wide open.\n\nNow, his task is to ensure that a free England, one with true democracy and rights for the people, is fully restored. While he is willing to pay any price for it, including another war with any German interventionists, he is not willing to compromise on that essential freedom for England. The only question is, can he convince the Chairman? For Macmillan has plans of his own, and they look very different from Maudling's fever dream."

I am sure he will agree with me that this opening is a momentous event, and one that is cause for joy and celebration. I am sure that he is as confident as I am that English democracy, an institution of hundreds of years, will soon be fully restored."\n\n"And I am also sure that, in the coming days, both parties can cooperate on many issues, like foreign policy and trade, as well as restoring our country economically through ambitious domestic programs. We can surely make England into what it once was - a respected power in the world, and a prosperous nation at home."\n\nMaudling went on for some time. Macmillan merely waited and smiled. He was glad to be in the shadow of Maudling. It gave him space and time, both of which were desperately needed to implement what he knew would achieve what Maudling had spoken of."

A man who was tired of being called collaborator in the streets, of having his name cursed by the population he ostensibly served, and of being unsure of whether his palace was a gift or a prison.\n\n"For many long years now, I have presided over England as your King. I cannot always say that it has been a joyful task. One feels many hardships when one's country is under great strain. While I have had many doubts about my own feelings in this position over many years, I have never lost faith in the English people. Their spirit and outlook towards the future, come what may, has uplifted all of England to what it is today. In changing times, one needs an upturned face, and a stiff upper lip.\n\n"I therefore say, with heavy heart, that I must discharge my duties as King, and have done so several hours ago. I firmly believe that I cannot offer England what she needs any longer, and that her people require more from me than I can deliver. What is needed now is a voice for strange and unknown times, a heart without fear and doubts. I believe that my successor can provide this, and he has my full loyalty and support.\n\n"And so, we shall all have a new King.

Over 60 at the time of his unexpected coronation, he now has to deal with a changing nation and a changing political situation.\n\nNevertheless, his crowning was subject to the usual celebration and fanfare.

The exact cause is unknown, but unscrupulous papers and the even less scrupulous public are ablaze with talk of yet another King in so short a period of time.\n\nIs a regency required? Is he being held hostage? Was Henry leading a monarchist coup to restore England and invade Wales, only to be stopped by the military, who have now put him up against a wall and shot him, only to be stopped by the PM, who is also incapacitated, but who has escaped and will cause a second civil war?\n\nOf course, the truth is well known to those close to Henry. It is unlikely the new King will last much longer, ending any speculation about his health. Leaving aside the grabbing headlines, most people are simply devastated to have the threat of a chaotic change foisted upon them, especially since Henry seemed to be a more stable King than the last, and was much more popular."

Of course, Macmillan knew what he really meant. The Honourable Gentleman belonged to the National Front, and thus could neither be trusted nor taken seriously. If he could just get rid of these loonies, what he might be able to do with a truly united Parliament...\n\nFor all the benefits of democracy, people like the Honourable Gentleman from Beaconsfield was one of many costs. What good is a representative democracy if the elect representatives who don't support democracy? What a stupid idea. Something had to be done this time.

Montgomery gently prompted.\n\n"Yes, the food is... is..." said Macmillan, began after lazily snapping to attention and then trailed off with his disinterest at the topic. "Marshal, you have a reputation for planning. Overplanning some would say. What guides your plans since the rebels surrendered?"\n\nSo then, it seemed Bernard's dinner companion had largely called him here for consultation. It was a duty he'd have gladly performed without the misdirection.\n\n"Well, the civil war has changed the status quo significantly," he said, before eating another bite of steak and allowing himself to swallow. "The traitors played their hand and have naturally been eliminated. Even so, Englishmen have found new things to squabble over, and now that compatriots have shed each other's blood in this generation, the gates are open, the taboo is lifted and it may happen again."\n\n"You plan for the next war?" asked Macmillan in surprise.\n\n"Always."\n\n"Good," replied the Chairman, smiling conspiratorially.

The Better Education Act, as presented to parliament this morning, is likely to go a long way towards building up goodwill with the moderate politicians and convince them of our goodwill. Our biggest foe has been the incessant and unfounded worry that we aim to set up a permanent dictatorship, so doing a few benevolent acts should hopefully assuage that fear.\n\nTruthfully, reforming the school system, while a nice idea, was hardly on our agenda until now. But if focusing on it for a time will bring in support for our government, then why not?\n\nBesides, it's not like anyone actually opposes the idea of improving the school system, do they?"

Those who have been most vocal in protesting this change are already facing a rude awakening that the police are ready and willing to imprison them en-masse.\n\nThe declaration could likely spell the end for the National Front, who have always bordered on being more or less explicit in their fascism.\n\nEven so, Chesterton and his to advisors are reconsidering their rhetoric, hoping they might hide their views behind a layer of deniability, yet still ultimately reach the ears of the now closeted fascists, who will understand the true meaning of what's being said."

And he knew the defining feature of that England was a democracy, where every man had the right to vote for whoever they wanted. Right now, he could provide England with economic and military security, sure. And he could stay in to keep it that way for quite a while. But it would be through the system the Germans set up, and England would never really be the country he once knew.\n\nNo, democracy was coming back, he decided. A democracy like the one before the war. One where people could debate how the country was doing. To finally free England from the shackles of occupation. To destroy the vestiges of life under the Nazi jackboot. It would be hard, and it might destroy his career if he succeeded. But he would rather be known as the PM who brought back democracy and lost than the PM who ruled for years through his cabal in the Royal Party.\n\nSome would say that England was not ready for democracy. That the lower classes would install some radical leftist in the parliament and ruin everything. But they would want a voice in parliament eventually, no matter what they did. And Lord Macaulay once said, "If men are to wait for liberty until they become wise and good in slavery, they may indeed wait for ever.""

Yes, answered nearly everyone. But what they didn't know is that the same democracy's foundations lived on.\n\nEngland had strong democratic traditions, going back to the Magna Carta of 1215. It had a parliament, elections, and all the other hallmarks of a representative government. Even the Germans could not strip all those rights away if they wished to make an England that could be considered legitimate. Thus, England was left with a parliament, an election system, and a party to run things. It was handicapped in many ways, but it was still there as a sad shell of its former self.\n\nFrom that shell, England would be rebuilt. Public debate would be authorized. Parliament would become more transparent. News would be made fair, free, and unrestricted. And every English citizen would be returned their sacred right to vote. Democracy had never truly died, as many said. It merely had been out on break."

One which we have been unable to enjoy in a long time. And yet, that stability is under threat. Outside actors wish to destabilize our country and take away our ability to do actions for ourselves. Nations with low regard for the rights of their own citizens, or for the rule of law.\n\nMy greatest fear is that these nations will take advantage of our proceedings to take control over a small group of disloyal party members and exert outsized influence upon our government. Perhaps even so much as to take control of the Royal Party and take a number of anti-democratic actions against the opposition. In another way, they could easily foment mistrust among the people of England, and attempt to foment a revolution through that manner.\n\nAnd so, we must turn ourselves to reform the systems that may give safe harbor to insidious foreign aggressors. To make our government more transparent, more accessible. And to remove the barriers that have discouraged our population from participating in domestic affairs. To prevent the abuses of the few, Britain must have the support and the alertness of the many.""

An experienced person, one with the necessary requirements for this position. And a Liberal, above all.\n\nMacmillan sighed. This one was the fifth of Maudling's liberals he had put into the government. It was giving his faction a bit of an outsized influence in the government. But that was good, wasn't it? The more influence he had, the more he could press for reforms. And the more Macmillan was likely to get what he wanted passed.\n\nGetting liberalism to be more popular was another thing that could help democratization. The more people got behind the reforms, the easier things would be. Yet, it came at a cost. While Maudling would have more to work with, Macmillan's own base would be hurt.

He read it again.\n\n"His Majesty's Government agrees with the Right Honorable Reginald Maudling. His reform package is much needed and overdue. Certain undemocratic practices have been going on for too long, and this package will address these issues. It has our full support, and we expect the House of Commons to pass it without delay."\n\nYes, that was good. It would go out tonight. And the media would pick it up. Across England, the first thing people would see on the morning paper covers would be this. They would know Maudling would be successful, and that England was now on the way to becoming a democracy once again.\n\nMacmillan did feel a twinge of regret.

Decrees drawn up in secret, and announced with little to no reasoning. Citizens may find themselves afoul of new and draconian regulations overnight. More alarming is the possibility these decrees could never be overruled by the parliament, effectively granting power entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe solution to this is to apply a proper legal framework to prevent emergency rule. Any decree made by a prime minister must have proper legal basis and reasoning to take effect. Emergency periods shall have a strict time limit, and must be reapproved by parliament after the time period has passed. And emergency decrees can be overturned at any time by an act of parliament. In this way, unpopular and unnecessary actions may be challenged by the representatives of the people, so that England can never become an authoritarian state overnight.""

The signal is given, and the event is broadcasted live to the West Region. If it goes well, a tape will be put on the Home Service a few days later.\n\nThe show is called "Any Questions?" and it offers something extraordinary in postwar England. For the first time in quite a long while, an ordinary person can pose a question to people in power, and they will have to answer them. Even more amazingly, the panel on the program may disagree, and oftentimes debates one another live on the radio! A new panel is rotated in every week, and a new location for the event is chosen as well, giving the listeners a variety of perspectives and topics.\n\nThe fifty minute show is an amazing hit. People tune in to hear the discussions and debates, unheard of for so long. Crowds are eager to attend the program and ask what they want. This leads to more interest in domestic affairs by the public. Democratic participation is also increased by this show as well.

If Reggie was really working independently, that was a good thing. He was properly powerful enough to do things on his own. And Macmillan could begin to ease into more of a guiding role to help democracy move on its way. That thought was extremely pleasing...\n\n"Um, Chairman?"\n\n"Oh yes," Macmillan said, remembering where he was. "That's inconsiderate, but no need to confront them about it.

Maudling was impressed. This new secondary school had been built in Newham, in Eastern London. The state of education in the country was very poor, he had to admit. And the civil war hadn't helped things along. Many schools didn't need new teachers and textbooks, they needed to be rebuilt entirely.\n\nIf every school was like this new one, thought Maudling, then England would have nothing to worry about. Everything was clean and modern, and the children were working with far more than he had when he was their age. There wouldn't be a problem getting things back on track, he knew. And once again England would lead the world in science, like Mac said it would.\n\n"Would you like to see the art classes?" asked the principal.\n\nThat brought Maudling back down to earth.

Taking credit for all the good things, and arguing the bad were before he had come in. Pretty standard for a PM. Today, Macmillan was talking about the dangers of authoritarianism again, arguing that outside forces still seeked to turn things against the country. The government was not doing enough to change things, even with the progress that had been made.\n\nBut then, he laid out his policy proposal on the matter, and it was a huge shock. That every Englishman and Englishwoman be given the right to vote for parliament. No more would the House of Commons be a playground for the rich and well connected. The average person would have their say. This would, he claimed, make England safer by ensuring that PMs were answerable not to tiny cabals, but to every person in their district.\n\nReaction was swift. Liberals cheered the move, as how could a supposedly republican system exist without the participation of everyone in it? Others were not so keen on this. The old guard and the elite were angry that the influence of the upper classes were being taken away. Their base was the rich, for God's sakes! And thus, the lines were drawn.\n\nNo matter how necessary or sound it seemed, equal representation would be a hard fight in parliament. But Macmillan had picked several of those before."

That we have no need to fear temporary difficulties if we just work together.\n\nBut then I realized, this 'we' is not a small group of the upper class that guided the masses from inception. It is the people of Britain, the ones who have done the work, who have done these accomplishments. And parliament does not represent these people. Instead it represents only a few well off, reactionary individuals.\n\nWhen parliament was only representative of the elite, England was a minor European power. When parliament was for every man and woman, Britain ruled the globe. If we are to reclaim any semblance of our former greatness, we must expand the vote to everyone. England shall give the people an equal vote, and a system free of corruption and fraud.\n\nThere are some who say the masses are not ready.

As part of this bill on transparency, I have proposed something called "Prime Minister's Question Time," where every wednesday, from noon to twelve-thirty, the PM must appear before the House of Commons.\n\nFirstly, a Member of Parliament can ask a question about the Prime Minister's engagements, in an open question. They then may ask about any subject. The right honorable leader of the opposition may then ask up to six questions about this topic, or another one.

In the newsstands of London, one may find magazines and papers dealing with every topic imaginable, from music and sports, to news and gardening, to trade journals and monthly academic publications.\n\nAnd, I ask myself, is the regulation of all these papers really necessary? Is it worth the government's time to inspect every word of a company newsletter or a travel magazine for auto tourists in the Midlands? And the people who publish these papers are constantly forced to comply with the absurd levels of censorship that may come from the government on this.\n\nI therefore propose an act that will limit and deprioritize these investigations.

There is some applause from the rows of the NDL, then he continues.\n\n"For more than two decades, the Royal Navy has withered in the hands of the collaborators, and it falls upon us to mend the wounds and repair the damage done. It will be difficult, but we can succeed together!"\n\n"My father once led the greatest fleet in the greatest naval battle in all history. Near the Jutland peninsula, dozens of great battleships faced off, gun to gun: there, the ships of the Royal Navy battered their German opponents, cracking hulls and shattering the Kaiser's dreams!"\n\n"My fath-" His voice breaks for a moment, as the Commons listens in silence. "My father was a hero of the United Kingdom, and we can be heroes too! We can rebuild the Royal Navy, greater than ever before! We shall cover the oceans once again, our battleships proudly bearing the Union Jack!" The first applause comes from the assembly, but Jellicoe isn't finished yet.\n\n"From sea to shining sea, we will return to our rightful place! Let any foe come to our island, they'll find the guns of the Royal Navy ready to receive them!" As he finishes, the entire House breaks out into enthusiastic applause, and the Prime Minister smiles, satisfied that his plans will be implemented without problems."

No one noticed a single man enter the crypt, where some of the greatest heroes of the United Kingdom had been laid to rest. The figure walked quickly, passing dozens of pillars, until he found what he was seeking: "John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, Admiral of the Fleet, Hero of Jutland" the plaque read under a heavy cover of dust, with the only candle long since melted.\n\n"Look at you. if Mother saw this, she would faint." The man chuckled before getting to work.\n\nHe slowly cleaned the tombstone, removing the dust and shining the plaque. Once he was finished, he lit a new candle and put fresh flowers in place of the long-withered ones whose stems and petals littered the ground.\n\n"There! Much better, don't you think? You used to tell me that a man must always look presentable, even in our most difficult moments... Father."\n\nGeorge Jellicoe kneeled before the tombstone, affectionately touching the photo of the stern-looking admiral. "You know, it's so difficult sometimes. If I could lead the party half as well as you led the fleet..." he sighed.\n\n"Still, I know my duty, and I won't give up. I promise you that I'll make you proud: one day, the Royal Navy will be as it was when you were alive, or better!" he said, determination hot in his eyes. "Please, Father, give me your blessing, that I might succeed in what I must do."\n\nThe crypt remained silent, but he had already received the answer he had come for.

In the weeks immediately following the final victory, the fear of German retaliation was enough to justify the extension of the emergency measure, but now that the situation is stabilizing more and more voices are calling for its repeal.\n\nWhen the question was finally raised about the conscription, Prime Minister Jellicoe knew he couldn't postpone the matter any longer. After a brief consultation with Minister Powell, he took to the small podium and started talking.\n\n"I thank the Honourable Lady for her question. The government has examined the matter of the extensive draft with the utmost attention, carefully balancing advantages and disadvantages of our decision."\n\n"It goes without saying that the first implementation of the measure was required by the exceptional circumstances we found ourselves in: the men and women who have given their lives for the liberation of England will forever be remembered!" Applause spontaneously rose from the entire Parliament, then silence returned.\n\n"Now, however, we no longer live in such times of emergency. The question is simple: do we still need such a large, permanently-mobilized force?

A single pheasant ran, followed closely by more than a dozen levriers. Just a bit behind, two men rode their horses- George Jellicoe and Claude Auchinleck, out for a hunt. The pheasant desperately tried to lose its pursuers, but the dogs pressed and pressed, until it simply fell to the ground, exhausted. The younger of the two men took out his hunting rifle, aimed, and shot the defeated bird.\n\n"Excellent aim as usual, George," said the older hunter. The two dismounted to assess their prey, the dogs barking to get their reward for the good hunt.\n\n"Thanks, Claude. Suffolk never disappoints." Jellicoe replied.\n\n"You didn't invite me just for a hunt, did you, Claude?" Jellicoe asked his mentor and friend.\n\n"No, George. I didn't. I wanted to talk to you about a very important matter." answered Claude.\n\nThe two men sat under a large oak, then the old general spoke. "I know you are going to rebuild the Royal Army, and I wanted to give you my advice. I have fought for years against the Germans, and have spent many more reflecting upon the causes for our debacle."\n\nThe Prime Minister nodded, then let his friend continue: "We were unprepared. We relied too much on the Royal Navy to keep them on the other side of the Channel, and when they came, we could do nothing but retreat. We retreated North because we had no prepared line. Some even suggested building AA on Hadrian's Wall! Those fools..."\n\nAuchinleck looked pained, old memories flooding his mind, but he pressed on: "I know that the choice is yours, but let me tell you this: the Germans, or someone just as bad, will return, and we must be ready. England needs a strong army, one big enough to defend our coast should the fleet fail us again."\n\nGeorge Jellicoe looked at his friend, the determination, the pain, the fear in his eyes.

After a silent nod from Jellicoe, he went on.\n\n"Some of my peers believe that our defeat was due to not having enough men. These peers are morons. We lost because we had so many soldiers we didn't know where they were and how to direct them. What I propose is a radical reform, one that will make the Royal Army a professional fighting force!"\n\n"You do realize that waving radical reforms in front of the General staff is the same as waving a red drape in front of a bull, don't you?" the Prime Minister added, with a worried grin.\n\n"I won't deny the obvious, but I need to state something even more obvious: if we rebuild our army as it was before, it will be just as effective as it was before. We will meet the same end as we did before. What we need is a smaller force, unhindered by logistics, and armed and trained in such a way that they can overcome any resistance at a point we choose."\n\nThe officer went on to explain his proposal, pointing out the necessary changes and the focal points of the new doctrine.

However, this would cause national uproar, as a mole surviving this long in the SIS would be scandalous.\n\nYet, the alternative was not much better.

There would be none of the public downsides of ousting him, but he would remain an issue, leaving the possibility of communist takeover disturbingly high.\n\nThe Prime Minister had to make a decision.

Today's ceremony is a happy one, however, hopefully the first of many to come.\n\nIn the presence of the Queen herself, the entire government and a crowd of more than fifty thousands have come to see the launch of the new flagship of the Royal Navy, the HMS Jellicoe. Named after the Prime Minister's father, the admiral who led the Grand Fleet against the German Hochseeflotte at the Battle of Jutland, the HMS Jellicoe is a sight to behold: with a length overall of 256 metres, she is longer than the Bismarck - a point of honor for the shipbuilders - and just shy of equalling the Yamato. Thanks to 15 inches of steel armor, and an armament of three triple 40 cm guns, eight double 15 cm guns, dozens of smaller emplacements for both anti-aircraft and anti-ship duty, anti-ship missile launchers and anti-submarine mortars, this battleship excels both in offense and defence.\n\nAll the cameras record the moment when the Queen, exceptional sponsor of the ship, perfectly aims the bottle and delivers a flawless inauguration, to deafening applause.

ENG_Corn_crisis.4.desc:0 ""Gentlemen, Prime Minister, to understand the situation in Cornwall, we have to understand the particulars of the German occupiers there.\n\nHalder's forces, though significant, are not the actual threat in this situation. They performed their job well enough in the English Civil War, but they are not nearly as motivated as they were then. HMMLR wanted to kill them all, so it was a bit of sink-or-swim for them. They are still small in number, and they are not a match for British troops if we catch them by surprise. Most are stuck on policing duty around the area anyway.\n\nThe only danger is in a protracted war that lasts long enough for them to get aid and support from Europe. This will be a strong possibility if we go through the land border region. While simple to pull off, this has been where they expected our forces to come through for quite a while. They will certainly have defences in place, quite possibly enough to slow us down until Germany can intervene.\n\nOur strategy, then, is not to fight them head to head, but to pull off a flanking maneuver from the sea. There is plenty of coastline where an amphibious detachment could come in and cut the garrison off from reinforcements and resupply. The nearness of England allows for a great deal of surprise as well. This will make any frontward advance easy and quick.\n\nWith your permission, I will contact the RAF and the Royal Navy, and commence with the plans to eliminate Cornwall. We can get a troop estimate drawn up, and an order of battle for you soon. I'll concentrate on moving the army into the proper position so we can pull this operation off.""

All concerns and situations were taken into account, and we worked together to make sure all sections of His Majesty's Armed Forces were prepared for the operation.\n\nThe RAF has moved its forces close to the Cornwall area and has set up in local air bases. They have begun running reconnaissance flights near Cornwall, and anti-shipping operations in the Bristol and English Channels. Close Air Support will be available for our forces on the ground, as well as fighter cover, if the weather provides. Our anti-shiping activities will also delay the enemy from landing troops, and help cover our own forces from surface and U-boat attacks.\n\nThe Royal Navy is likewise ready. They have moved ships to block the channel, and patrol the areas around Cornwall. Ships are available to provide fire support to our forces as they move inland. And we have escorts for any invasions that may be planned. If the enemy attempts to reinforce, we will give them heavy punishment.\n\nUpon the assurances of the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Air Staff, the Chiefs of Staff Committee have recommended "GO" for this operation and that it should commence as soon as possible.

ENG_Corn_crisis.6.desc:0 "Operation Seal began with the sounds of wire cutters at 3 in the morning. The fence set up to prevent outside incursion into Cornwall was taken down by Royal Engineers who cleared areas for troops to move in. Scouting units poured through, followed by waves of tanks and infantry. What guards there were on the border were quickly overwhelmed, unable to resist.\n\nOn the beaches of Cornwall, Royal Marines made their landings silently. Cornwall had few positions to defend themselves from an amphibious attack. There was concern amongst the Royal Navy about the possibility of hitting civilian targets, so pre-invasion fire was held back. Once the troops landed, they scarcely encountered resistance except for a few isolated police patrols who were quickly fought off.\n\nBy midday, London was pleased with the progress the units were making. Casualties were light, and massive gains had been made. German resistance was weak and unorganized, and they had been caught by surprise. Intelligence reported that the Reich was stunned by this turn of events, and it seemed the Kriegsmarine wasn't able to do anything about it at the moment.\n\nBy the end of the day, it was clear on the ground that Germany had not failed to put up an effective defence, it was that the troops there simply lacked the will to. Massive numbers of Germans gave up without a fight, or merely offered token resistance. There were only a few cases where the English had to blast out the die-hards. The garrison was shocked, demoralized, and homesick. And they had collectively given up.\n\nEngland pushed deeper and deeper into Cornwall as the night went on."

There were plenty of suicides in this operation, most of whom were German garrison leaders. This was a notable example.\n\nMany of the other garrison officers, however, had decided to take their chances with the English. This was not an uncommon feeling, given the number captured as England had pushed into the territory. In fact, Portsmouth had been taken without much resistance at all. The lynchpin of the German plan against England was taken, and now there was no hope of German victory.\n\nThe prisoners gave many reasons for the lack of resolve. The political situation had sapped many of the will they needed to fight on. What Reich do you die for if there's several of them? And the lack of support from Germany made the garrison hopeless. They could not hope to win without the might of the Wehrmacht, and the English knew that just as well as the garrison soldier understood.\n\nThe threat that haunted England had dematerialized. The elite soldiers of Germany had given up without a fight. The beachhead of Sea Lion had been crushed.

With the garrison on our shores, we could not make decisions for ourselves. We could not make the necessary moves to make England strong again. We could not make any move to restore our place in the world.\n\nWith the garrison gone, England can finally put the legacy of 1943 behind her. This great nation can now make its own decisions, and do whatever it wants without the fear of foreign influences and threats. We now stand on our own two feet, ready to face the entire world without fear."\n\nScarcely anybody in England disagreed with this sentiment. Many believed Germany was too limiting, and always a threat. Cornwall kept England a step away from becoming a Reichskommissariat. Now, the threat was gone, the garrison vanquished.

The operation would have to be swift, calculated and without even the slightest risk of failure. If these points were neglected, the repercussions on the English government and its people would be immense.

Finally, Montgomery concluded that the assault should begin at the soonest possible convenience, lest the enemy were somehow to uncover the plan.\n\nHis methods may not have been entirely what [ENG.GetLeader] was hoping for, but they understood there was no other choice.

Projections showed that the perilous freefall they had been in has, at least for now, stabilized. He saluted the guard as he drove away.\n\nJellicoe drove down a street, and smelled in the calm evening air the smell of freshly baked bread. He saw a happy family moving boxes from a car. Although there was still much to do for the economy, Jellicoe couldn't help but feel some satisfaction.\n\nBut the job wasn't done, far from it. Stevas had riled up the liberal wing to shift the country's focus to social reforms, notably decriminalizing homosexuality. Already, the Patriots have come out strongly in opposition, although Powell seems reluctant to follow along with the more hateful rhetoric coming from his faction. However, if his party didn't act decisively, the socialists would definitely use this to gain more support.\n\nYes, the next weeks and months of Jellicoe's prime ministership would be spent trying to wrangle his party to act, one way or another, to address the social issues of England.

It is to have a home, a car, and an American television on top of that. Living up to that is a growing middle class that buys tons of English products and keeps the tourist industry busy on holidays. And they know that life is good, and aren't taking it for granted.\n\nThe NDL made the reforms that brought this prosperity. And the people give them credit.

And we must not stand waiting idly by without providing a safety net for the most unfortunate of our citizens."\n\n"This welfare proposal would change that. It would provide welfare to the needy, ensuring those that cannot work need not worry about their dwindling savings or their everyday needs. It guarantees that each Englishperson has access to healthcare, without it being a needlessly expensive burden upon them. And it grants the children of England an education necessary to develop the skills needed in the modern world, to compete in fields dominated by spacecraft and computers."\n\n"My honorable friends, we must pass this proposal, and do so without delay or hesitation.

Poverty has become unacceptably common, and the workers and the unemployed alike now cry out for a serious change in how the economy functions.\n\nFortunately for them the Socialist Labour Party has come to power and they have made great efforts to show that they have a plan to fix the many flaws present in England's economy. Their methods may be without precedent but they are not entirely unfounded. The program they have come up with aims to achieve the goals set out in the Beveridge Report which was published over twenty years ago.\n\nThe report itself came out a year before the war's end, yet it outlined how Britain's economy could be remodeled if it were to emerge victorious, a situation it naively believed could be achieved. Its focus was on the need to eradicate poverty from the country, for this to be done the five 'giants' of: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness must be defeated.\n\nBeveridge had requested Wilson to research much of the report, and although the prime minister's old mentor may no longer be around to see his work put into reality, he hopes that their work will not be in vain. Beveridge's vision will be realised and England's workers will be all the richer for it."

However, the SLP remains keen to begin their noble work of fighting poverty, they will have to temporarily postpone their plans and find a way to generate the wealth the country will need to afford the proposed increases in spending.\nTaxes have already been raised to cover for any present shortfalls in spending, but a more long term method of generating income is needed. Two methods have been proposed, both rely on the opening of England's markets to bring foreign money increasing the volume of the country's exports.\nThe first harkens back to the days of the industrialised England of the nineteenth century, of course the same exploitative practices of unchecked capitalism will be avoided. Instead the government will help build factories and protect the workers, thus taking many workers out of unemployment. The profits will be reinvested by the government on behalf of the workers, ensuring a fair exchange for their labor.\nThe second involves the exploitation of England's natural resources, from coal to steel. Both these industries will be nationalised and maintained by the government to ensure maximum efficiency and rights of the miners and workers.\nEither way, England's economy will become more reliant on foreign consumers from the Organization of Free Nations, but the people would rather we were dependent on them than the Germans."

All that stand in the way of the road to reconstruction are the Five Giants that we must overcome.\n\nWant has become one of the more pressing issues of the nation. The people have been left impoverished by the fascists and the civil war we had to fight to overthrow them, yet we have already made great strides toward getting more of them off the streets and into work. However those who remain jobless will also be in need of our protection and the government has already come up with a plan to defeat each giant:\n\nDisease has always been a financial burden for the poorest in society, as a result many can not afford proper treatment and their ailments often deteriorate. This has for some time been an area in which capitalism has failed society. A robust national health service will replace the old model and ensure equal care for all.\n\nIgnorance is the most important giant to defeat for the future prosperity of England. As the next generation will need to be properly taught in order for them to continue improving society in the future. New schools will have to be built, with a new curriculum to match.\n\nSqualor has unfortunately built up within England's inner cities, slums have appeared as the people have been unable to afford their homes. These will have to be cleared to make way for the new program of council houses that will soon be introduced.\n\nIdleness will have to be struck down swiftly, the effects of unemployment on the people have been disastrous and many just want to get back into work. More key industries are to be nationalized by the SLP and a comfortable wage will be offered to those the government employs.\n\nThe time to begin the fight against poverty is upon the government, and they will likely not stop their efforts until every one of their aims are achieved and the lives of the people are made better than they have ever been before."

Ollie remembered his father, scratching his hair that had begun to grey too soon, over the rent due in the morning. He remembered hearing his parents argue whether or not he should be able to continue school or drop out to provide an extra hand.\n\nAlthough Ollie never had any real choice in what he wanted to do, his children would. Thanks to the subsidy provided by the Socialist Labour government, his children, and grandchildren would not be forced to bake bread for eternity. This extra bit of dough, although small, even has Ollie and his wife talking about hiring from outside.

And any of the minor decisions were made by people under him who hated his guts. And there was a bit of hesitation within the NDL to execute a close family member of the Queen, anyway. So the sad sap would keep his head. But there was still the question of what to do with him.\n\nExile him? That was an option. Put him as far away from the island as possible. But some said it was too much. He could be allowed to stay if his titles were stripped from him. Without his titles, he would be nothing. But he would also be nothing if he was permanently kicked out of the Kingdom.\n\nWhat was the difference? Both put him out of the picture just as well as the other. But still, there was a massive debate about it. Exile was something out of the 1700s. Stripping his titles was too lenient. He could be doing something sneaky if he was put outside English jurisdiction. He might do something sneaky if he had access to London. He might just be happy to be out of the picture anyway and not make a move-\n\nGoddamn it, he was tired of this! He was the Prime Minister, and he'd solve the issue once and for all. And Edward..."

Jet aircraft were preparing to fly the tape as soon as it was broadcast to Canada and Australia. TV sets were flying off the shelves. And everyone not in the crowd outside was gathered around a television set for the duration of the ceremony. Everyone could see the coronation, and everyone could be a part of it.\n\nNot to say this had dampened attendance along the procession route. Everyone wanted to see the new Queen in person, riding with her husband in a gilded carriage, with her newly incorporated royal guards in front and behind her. And the reception was mostly positive. The SLP had elements who were going to protest the ceremony, but they had been drowned out by the cheers of the onlookers and the martial music. No disruptions on the route happened, which was Jellicoe's main concern.\n\nThe ceremony began with the Queen entering Westminster Abbey to a choir singing "I Was Glad." Once she had seated herself on the chair of Estate, the religious paraphernalia and the coronation garments were brought in. Then came the first, necessary step. The Queen stood next to King Edward's Chair. "Sirs," said the Archbishop of Canterbury, "I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?"\n\n"God save Queen Elizabeth!" affirmed the crowd. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, filled with oaths and traditions, he was never bored or found himself wishing for a quick end. For everything that HMMLR had worked for, everything that so many men had died to do, and every sacrifice made by the people of England, it was for this. The true heir had returned, and the world knew that prewar England had returned.

More ministerial positions would get them to be satisfied with our government, and would therefore allow us to move forward with a more conservative position without too much complaint. Press time will also make St John-Stevas extremely happy.\n\nBut that may also prove disastrous.

The defence team painted a stark picture before the jury, a picture of a brave and noble military man who fought in both World Wars to defend his country. A picture of a soldier who sacrificed his pride and dignity to join the collaborators in the hopes of preventing the German grip from squeezing the life out of England. A picture of an Englishman who tried to serve his country.\n\nMontgomery had insisted to his team that he himself be called as a witness, and gave a short but powerful speech regarding his duty as an officer to protect the English people in the face of tyranny and evil, even if it means to sacrifice values you hold dear.\n\nThe prosecution fought back against such claims, arguing that by sacrificing the values of liberty and democracy, Montgomery had failed to protect the English people.\n\nThe jury, naturally, is split.

His old uniform was also in that suitcase, which he wore during his meetings with the Collaborationist cabinet. Finally, there were multiple medals for his military feats, including his heroic actions against the German invaders. To his horror, he also remembered that a few of them were given for destroying hideouts from the Resistance.\n\nIt was then when the sheer realization paralyzed him, dropping the suitcase in shock. He was not only carrying his luggage: it was also the weight of the sins committed against his nation. For the remainder of his life, the crimes against his fellow Englishmen are going to haunt him.

His first job was pretty straightforward: digging holes to install electric wires. Joining his former comrades in arms in the task, he will have to expiate his sins with the sweat of his brow.

For many years, he headed up the Reformist faction in the Royal Party, and had at least somewhat pushed for partial reform. But when the war came, he ended up in the cabinet of Douglas-Home, and anyone in the cabinet ended up at Oxford. Even if they were primarily dealing with His Majesty's Treasury.\n\nThings took a strange turn, as at the opening of the trial, Macmillan stood up and read a prepared statement. In it, he told the jury that he had joined the collaborators out of a desire to stop the suffering of English citizens back in the war, and that he attempted to subvert the will of the Germans at every turn he could. His goal had been to see a return to English democracy. However, he had decided to remain in the Royal Party during the war out of a fear the rebellion would be unsuccessful and because of a fear that the garrison at Cornwall would put an end to organized resistance along with Germany. It was only after the war had ended, with a free government restored, the garrison crushed, and Germany still in chaos did he realize the enormity of his mistake. He accepted responsibility for his actions, and apologized.\n\nThis threw the trial into a tailspin. The defence argued that Macmillan was sincere about his regret for an enormous mistake done with the best of intentions. The prosecution argued it was not enough and merely a last-ditch attempt to save his life. The jury was divided as well. The NDL-oriented ones argued that he should be exiled, while the Stirlingites wanted him dead for his actions. The leftists were more merciful, however.

Leaving his home wasn't an easy thing to do, but there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nEven with the sound of the aeroplane turbine, Macmillan was still caught in his thoughts. Could the rebels even succeed with the German threat still present? Would he have done better if he had been there? It was a futile exercise. His intentions were maybe good, but he was at the wrong time to put them into practice. And the wrong place.

The ambitious autobiography aimed to emphasize his role as the reformist that wanted to save the rotting government, debunking the smears from mediocre politicians.

While the foreign powers at large continue to participate in the Battle of the Atlantic as before, [GetEnglandUnificationEnglandorBritain] can sleep safer knowing that the battle continues as planned, and neither the Germans nor Americans can claim to dominate the battle at hand. As much is the hope of our political analysts, at least.\n\nWhile [GetEnglandUnificationEnglandorBritain] continues to sit in its position of enforced neutrality, we can only work to maintain this balance of power, and to ensure that the battle does not quickly become one-sided again. Through ensuring diplomatic stagnation with the Americans and Germans, as well as maintaining the balance of power, we will maintain our position over the superpowers at large, and we will undoubtedly find ourselves totally independent of anything which any German or American would demand of us."

Even if our efforts only result in a neutral [GetEnglandUnificationEnglandorBritain], it is infinitely better to have an [GetEnglandUnificationEnglandorBritain] devoid of any influence at all rather than within the firm grasp of the Americans.

She may very well have been offering the OFN a firm position on all of the Isles. So much it seemed, anyway, why else would president Johnson be getting an invitation to this "Dover conference"? The Oval Office had been alight with conversation and debate all morning, and there was nobody quite in the thick of it like President Johnson.\n\n"What I'm saying, Will, is that we lost our chance in '63, and this is going to be our last chance for the Isles." Johnson felt himself beginning to break into a sweat. "And I am not letting them go, not again." Spending the day arguing over how much an investment in Thatcher could pay back was one of the most frustrating things he'd ever done, but even the thought of what the return could be was breathtaking for those that had bothered to listen to him for half a second.\n\n"What would we even have to gain from this? This is Thatcher we're talking about here, not De Graaff, she wouldn't exactly be meeting our expectations as we'd need of her, let alone what we'd want of her if you even did manage to bring her in, you and I both know that!"\n\nThe end of these arguments didn't exactly seem to be in sight.

If nobody else, Thatcher had to be the most slippery of all those that Robert had needed to deal with, in terms of foreign policy and moral fiber.

The press hadn't lightened up on Bobby just for being put in a good position with the English- even if this was an anomaly with a clear cause. Whether Thatcher had simply been trying to lure Bobby into dropping more funds into England or not, there were more than a few ways to spin bringing in a collection of probable war criminals. There weren't any second chances that would let you bring back what you'd fought for so many times before.

Of everything that had happened to England, the wars, the political turmoil, why Thatcher had plunged the nation into the most chaotic foreign policy gambit of the century was a mystery which Thurmond hadn't even begun to consider before convening his Cabinet.\n\n"Ah, Maxwell, tell me you can make something of this, please." Thurmond handed the letter to his Vice-President, still half-preoccupied with the possible motives behind the move. Giving it a read-through, Taylor looked back to Thurmond.\n\n"It's a load of bullshit is what it is, Sir. This isn't even a thinly veiled threat to go back to the Germans- this is practically a demand that we try and stop them! Everything that we've done for them, and they still threaten to run back to Germany, it's surreal." Thurmond nodded, and thought to Thatcher herself. An unremarkable woman, she hadn't much about her that screamed leader, and that was to say nothing of the good men and women who fought against the very thing she threatened the OFN with now. "We aren't taking this sitting down, are we, sir?"\n\nStrom Thurmond smiled, and clasped his hands together."

Of all the things that Harrington had wanted to spend his day working around, it certainly wasn't an excessively horrific diplomatic nightmare. Gathered in the Oval Office, the Cabinet had been mulling over what exactly to do over Thatcher's latest gambit.\n\n"So if I'm understanding this right, sir, 'The status of England -and therefore Britain- in the 'Cold War' would be discussed' is just code for 'we are holding our own sovereignty hostage'?" The Secretary of State, Glen, had been writing the whole afternoon, trying to decipher what it was exactly that persuaded Thatcher to give up her policy of near-total isolationism. Harrington skimmed through the letter. "Yes, that seems abo-"\n\nThat's when it hit him. Amid the clamor and arguing of Harrington's office, it struck him like a bolt of lightning. She had no intention of giving up her isolationism- she was reinforcing it. "Wait a minute, hold on now- everyone!" Harrington's voice cut through the arguments like a knife through hot butter.\n\n"Now, hold on. Obviously, Thatcher has no real reason to threaten her position, she's kept things perfectly fine as is before, why start now?" The crowd maintained its silence, looking to each other for answers.\n\n"That's just it. She wouldn't. Why would she invite ourselves and the Germans to the same conference to sway England to both sides? That's just it, she- she isn't, exactly. She's staying right where she is..." Harrington looked towards the crowd locking eyes with him. Glen cleared his throat, the eyes of the room swiveling to him. "So what you're saying here, Mr. President, is that we'll only be falling into her trap if we actually try and sway her, and leave her to the wolves if we don't bother?"\n\nHarrington cleared his throat.

The room had been deathly silent, trying to decipher the vague statements left to them from Thatcher's latest masterpiece of writing. "...Signed, Margaret Thatcher." A moment of silence filled the Oval Office, as Gore placed the letter back on the desk of the President.\n\n"That leaves us in a tight spot, doesn't it? If we do nothing, England is left to the whims of the Germans. If we throw any kind of weight into this conference, then England gets out without us or the Germans being able to do too much of anything." Rockefeller cleared his throat. "Well, that's assuming we can actually afford much of anything once we get there. Our budget is already straining as is, and we might not be able to realistically provide aid for them beyond favors. The OFN's got deep pockets and favors to hand out like candy, not cash." The President stood up behind his desk.\n\n"Well, if that's what we've got to work with, we'll work with it. The question for me is if we'll manage to keep the Germans away from the English, let alone bring them under our umbrella." The room resumed its near-perfect silence, save for the tapping of Glenn's pen on his oak desk.\n\nGore stepped forward, amid the small crowd of well-dressed politicians surrounding him. "Well, sir, if we used the absolute extent of our resources, we could very well bring the English well out of the sphere of the Germans- if you found it worthwhile, at least. However, if we pulled our resources and reworked some of the smaller details of the budget, we could definitely invest so heavily into England that they have no choice but to join the OFN. Hypothetically, at least." Glenn took a moment to chew on what he'd heard and sat back down."

The light outside had been smothered by the constant passing clouds, darkening the room save for the lamp across the room. A haze had set in over the office, and the air had been only stiffened by the closed windows. Goldwater let out a sigh. Of course, Thatcher would do this. If nobody else, it had to be Thatcher who would threaten her own sovereignty. It was clear as day as to what she was doing; she thought she could pull money and favors out of the superpowers, and get away with neither America nor Germany having an edge. She thought she could toy with her own sovereignty and walk away unscathed? More than that, the very notion that she thought she could threaten America with joining the Pakt was more than enough of an insult.\n\nWhat was he going to do with England? He certainly couldn't outright fail to attend the conference, what kind of a message would that send? To attend the conference and to give the English exactly what they'd wanted -just enough American guarantees to keep them out of the Pakt- was also out of the question. If the English were going to play with fire, they had better damn well be burned.\n\n"Janice, please send in my Cabinet, all of them. Thank you." Tapping his pen against his desk, Goldwater patiently waited for all of his cabinet to file into the Oval Office, until his office had been filled with confused and concerned politicians and bureaucrats. "Ladies and Gentlemen..." The room's eyes were locked on the President, clearly glum to the point that even he could tell in the eyes that looked back at him. "...I have reason to believe that Margaret Thatcher has put her state of foreign policy into grave danger. That she is requesting that ourselves and the Germans invest in England to maintain its independence and autonomy." The room had gone silent. "I would like you all to know that I will be doing everything I can to take advantage of this, nor will I stop until England is out of the clutches of Germany. That will be all.""

The letter in of itself was a ransom note, as much was clear. Nobody in their right mind would host such a conference as this without something to gain. Smith looked to Kirkpatrick, sitting with a manilla folder and a dozen papers in her hands. "Well, Jeane, what've we got so far?"\n\nThe foreign minister grimaced. "In short, a bit of a disaster. From the looks of things, Thatcher is bringing us and the Germans to the table in Dover and wants to firmly place England as the definitive neutral power in the Cold War. So far as I can tell, the plan for us is to go to the conference cash in hand we place our bets on England to curry their favor and we wind up having given them just enough to keep neutral. Eventually, nobody makes a substantial contribution, and England walks away stronger than ever." Kirkpatrick's words lingered in the room, as it began to set in as to what exactly Thatcher was doing. Smith cleared her throat. "And I take it that if we do nothing, they go straight to the Germans? We wouldn't be able to stop them, I mean."\n\nKirkpatrick spent a moment thinking to herself and shut her folder like she was closing a novel. "Yes, as well as vice-versa. If we pull out all the stops for this conference, it is hypothetically possible for us to bring England into the OFN. Assuming we're capable of footing the bill, at least." Smith felt taken aback by the News. This was the second time in a decade that the English had the chance to join the OFN, and it definitely seemed as though there wouldn't be another anytime soon.\n\n"In that case, we'd better make the most of this, shouldn't we?"

A probable hangover, judging from the smell on his breath and his total lack of memory as to what he did last night. Even still, work still needed to be done, and the first thing on the long list of the day's work was to review his latest communique and letters from across the globe.\n\nReaching for the first small stack, a ray of light burned Bormann's eyes, sending him recoiling back into his desk chair, scattering the letters across his desk. "Argh, shit."\n\nPicking up the letters one by one, Bormann neatly arranged them into two piles: those he felt concerned over, and those he couldn't be bothered to read without another shot of whisky. As it was too early to start drinking by his own standards, Führer Bormann decided to look at the former pile first. Flipping through the collection of envelopes, there were the usual. For the most part, there were personal letters, hopefully, a notification of retirement, though probably a request for a favor. There were the interesting letters, of course, the missions from a few nations here and there, looking for help or closer relations. Among them was the most interesting nation to reach out to Germany. This, however, had come straight from London.\n\n"...which we are undoubtedly grateful for. As this conference is for nothing else but to clarify the position of England within the Cold War, we are open to changes in our foreign policy if the circumstances permit it, such as from contributions from one power or another, yourself included.

Speer looked up from his papers and stared at Schmidt. The room grew quiet save for the clock on the wall, providing a timer for just how long Schmidt stood in the brown-hued office.\n\n"Schmidt... I have spent the last hour... pondering this little problem with Thatcher. This is our path into the North Atlantic, and that's to say nothing of the value inherent in bringing Thatcher on our side.

Just across the steps to the tarmac, Johnson made out a podium with the flag of England on either side. Standing alongside either side of the flags seemed to be a collection of party bureaucrats and Cabinet members to Thatcher. As the crowds surrounding President Johnson continued to cheer as he waved towards the sparse cameras hidden within the crowds surrounding him. Shaking the hands of the English politicians and taking his place behind the podium, President Johnson found himself with a perfect view of the crowds, as well as the stars of cameras flashing. Reaching into his pocket, Johnson pulled out a scrap of paper and leaned towards the microphone so graciously provided by his hosts.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen of England... it is rare that history is allowed to be subdued, that the actions of the past are reversed, and a second chance is given to the people of God's green earth. Today, I stand here with nothing but hope; a hope our great nations can reconcile, a hope that England and America can return to form, even as it has faced insurmountable odds and trials meant for nothing but to further harden the English spirit, from the fiery hours of Operation Sealion to the heartbreaking conflict of your Civil War, England has been set alight and survived not through the mercy of others, but the strength and tenacity of its inhabitants. I hope that you, England, will take America's hand, and march into tomorrow, side by side with us." At that, the crowd broke into polite -if still enthusiastic- applause.

The euphoria of the victory of the Great War, the horrors of what the war had brought for the few that fought therein, and the highs of the colonial empire. India, Africa, Malaysia, Canada, Australasia, all of them under the colonial reigns of the British. Then, the rise of Hitler.

Not that as much mattered, at least not in the face of opening Thatcher to the notion of rejoining the Pakt.\n\n"Madame Prime Minister, we are both very much well aware of the natural alliance between Germany and England, we have been allies for who knows how long, and the past stances against the Pakt have only ended in chaos and defeat for England, please-" Thatcher raised her hand, and cleared her throat, turning the nearly empty office totally quiet.\n\n"Please, Herr Führer, I have heard enough. I understand the Pakt's position towards England, so I do sincerely hope that you understand mine towards the Pakt. Namely, I certainly hope to maintain England's current foreign policy for the foreseeable future. Now, we are here to discuss the specifics of your involvement in the Dover Conference, so that is what we will discuss." Thatcher leaned forward from behind her desk, folding her hands. "So allow me to ask again; what contributions do you hope to make towards England which the Americans cannot provide?"\n\nBormann had been subject to these thinly veiled demands since he first stepped foot into England, and things had hardly seemed like they were going to improve anytime soon. All he could do was to keep stalling.\n\n"In short, Margaret, the Pakt can offer safety for the English fleet, protection from the greatest alliance not a few hundred kilometres away, and that's to say nothing of the aid which we can provide for your... ambitions on the British isles. With Germany behind your back, you have all the diplomatic sway you would need, no questions asked. Not only that, but the Americans wouldn't let you touch Scotland with a ten-foot pole.""

What do you hope to pull out of Germany?" Speer could feel the air between himself and Thatcher change, to dull, almost. He always knew he was far from a perfect diplomat, but if anyone was going to handle these meetings well, it was going to be Speer.\n\n"I'm glad you asked, Herr Führer, but I think I'm supposed to ask that of you, isn't that right?" The pair chuckled, Speer lightly cursing under his breath. The path which the two walked along was far from the public eye, off along the border with Cornwall, in a decidedly quiet corner of the country. Following a stream leading towards Bishop Sutton, the pair had certain reason to be thankful for the quiet, if still a tension inherent with international negotiations.\n\n"Well, Herr Führer, I do think that the position of England between the Americans and yourself is an interesting one. For a start, what can you give me that the Americans cannot?" Speer feigned thinking to himself for a moment, even though he had roughly a half-dozen offers prepared.\n\n"Our technological advancements are far and above what the Americans have on offer. If you side with us, England's position will drastically improve in the realm of technology." Thatcher looked to Speer with a nearly sarcastic look on her face.\n\n"Interesting, but I am not looking for technological favors so much as diplomatic ones. What do you have in that department?""

Why attend, I mean?"\n\n"Well, Germany looks to maintain England is kept as strong as possible given the circumstances of the Cold War, and we hope to offer as much aid as we are able. If this means bringing England into the Zollverein, then so be it, though that is not our primary goal." The reporter disappeared back under the cameras, and the cycle began anew.

Schmidt was more than a little caught off guard by the question as if the fact that the short reporter popped out from behind a collection of Italian observers taking notes in sleek black notebooks.\n\n"W-Well, we obviously hope for the best out of this conference, and if England walks away safe from American ambitions, then I would say that the conference will have been a success.""

Many had reasons to fly to Reichskommissariat Norwegen. But some had a different purpose than any of the other passengers.\n\nA few minutes after England had disappeared behind them and the flight was over the North Sea, a woman got out of her seat at the back of the aircraft and walked to the front. When a stewardess asked if she needed some sort of assistance, the woman pulled out a pistol and put it to the stewardess's head. A man jumped up and brandished a pistol as well, yelling "Don't move! Hands above your heads or she gets it!" He then rushed forth, and opened the door, waving the gun in the faces of the German pilots. In a matter of moments, they had taken control of the plane.\n\nMany of the passengers were horrified. Colonel Rösch, worried about what would happen if these hijackers found out about his Luftwaffe service, tried to eat his identification card subtly, but was forced to shove the wadded up ball inside a can of Fanta. Aarbakke was concerned that there would be a hostage situation, and was not optimistic that whoever handled the rescue would do so satisfactorily. And the Hudson family were worried the hijackers would crash the aircraft somewhere.\n\nFor several hours, the passengers waited in fear, unknowing of the plans the hijackers had made. Some proposals to rush the terrorists were discussed independently, but they were discarded. It seems like all they could do was wait and guess what would happen.

London was shocked, and ordered all outgoing flights temporarily halted while they tried to get a handle on how bad the situation was. Berlin was informed within the hour, and alarms went off as they tried to scramble fighters to intercept the aircraft.

These fears were alleviated when the hijackers surrendered soon after landing, giving themselves and the daughter of the woman over to the Scottish police. Soon after, a group of police and diplomatic officials boarded the plane. They informed the passengers the hostage situation was over, and the hijackers merely intended to use the plane as a method of entry into Scotland.

The message was repeated in German and Norwegian for the other passengers.\n\nImmediately, a young Norwegian couple stood up and made clear their intention to defect. This provoked the ire of Colonel Rösch, who made a mental note to report the couple to his superiors as soon as he got off the plane.

It was a huge relief to everyone concerned.\n\nThe hijackers, a man and a woman, explained they were English who hijacked the aircraft with a toy gun and a starter pistol. The goal of this forced landing in Scotland was so they could defect, along with the woman's 11 year old daughter. This situation was not unheard of, and there were reports of these types of hijackings in the Einheitspakt with varying degrees of success. Since this method of escape, although dangerous, was not actually illegal, the English hijackers were allowed to stay in Scotland.\n\nA quick analysis of the 59 other passengers and 7 crew revealed most were English, along with a few Norwegians and Germans. They were headed to Bergen when their flight was taken over the North Sea. While they attempted to process everyone and get into contact with Pakt diplomats informing them of the safety of the remaining passengers, officials went aboard and announced that anyone on the flight could seek asylum in Scotland. Surprisingly, three Norwegians and four English accepted the offer, and were taken to the main terminal.\n\nOnce everything was cleared up, Lufthansa 302 was allowed to leave the airport and continue to Bergen.

Germany immediately contacted Scotland through diplomatic channels, demanding the hijackers be deported to the Pakt, and that the passengers and crew be allowed to return home as well. A few hours later, Scotland responded with a flat "no" to any extradition, and said the aircraft had been allowed to continue to Bergen.\n\nWhen the aircraft arrived in Bergen that night, the passengers were taken by the Gestapo and asked to relay everything they saw or heard. It wasn't much to go on. A man and a woman pulled guns out over the North Sea and demanded the aircraft turn and go to Scotland. They didn't declare any specific affiliations with any group, or make statements in support of an ideology. Regrettably, several English and Norwegian citizens had agreed to stay behind in Scotland along with them.\n\nThen came the digging through all the records. The hijackers were English citizens suspected of attempting to purchase transport through the Scottish border, and were being looked at when the hijacking occurred. Many in the Pakt, especially on the security side, weren't satisfied. There had to be a resistance component to this, they thought. They interrogated and detained close relations of the hijackers and defectors, but they were just as shocked as everyone else. The English resistance didn't seem to step up their activity after the attack, and no other copycat hijackings occurred at the same time.\n\nAs much as some didn't like it, the taking of Lufthansa 302 appeared to be the result of a desperate pair of disaffected English, and not part of a wider terrorist plot against the Reich."

ENG_flavor.8.t:0 "Wimberley Publishes His Memoirs"
ENG_flavor.8.desc:0 "Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley is a controversial figure on the British isle. Many in Scotland believe he was instrumental in keeping Scotland secure from German occupation. Others see him as a traitor and paranoid madman. This has led Wimberley himself to reappear in the public eye to release a new autobiography that he hopes will cause the "misconceptions" of his time as Chief of Staff of the Scottish military to be cleared up.\n\n"Scottish Soldier," Wimberley's book, is the culmination of work that the Field Marshal started some time before his retirement and the reunification. It is a complete recounting of his military service, with special emphasis given to his time in the First and Second World Wars, and the formation of the Scottish Republic. Wimberly argues the republic was a necessary action to defend Scotland, and was not merely a case of opportunism. He also defends some of the more controversial actions the Scottish Armed Forces took under his tenure, declaring those actions kept Scotland free, and made the liberation of and eventual unification with England possible.\n\nDespite massive sales in the North and Midlands, the book has come in for a fair share of controversy. Some unionists and leftists accused Wimberley of being a malignant spirit in Scotland, and one that potentially jeopardized both Scottish freedom and union with England. Others have claimed the book is evidence that Wimberley was merely being misunderstood this entire time, pointing to his support of HMMLR and loyal service in the war as proof. Wimberley himself has not commented on the matter. He has, however, donated a collection of personal papers to the National Records of Scotland, hoping they and the book will be of aid to future researchers of the Scottish Republic."

And thus they knew the worst was over when the smugglers dropped them off in Norwich.\n\nEventually the Kulesas ended up with many other Lithuanian immigrants in the neighborhood of Becktown. There, life was tough. Crime was rampant, poverty widespread, and oftentimes it felt they were not wanted by the public. Little Joakimas was harassed by his peers at school for his limited understanding of English. Edvardas had trouble finding steady work for the longest time. And the neighborhood had quite a fright when some youths painted a swastika on the side of the Kulesa's apartment building. Sometimes, they considered moving to somewhere else. Scotland, New York, or even Vancouver. But in the end, they stuck it out.\n\nNow things are looking up. Edvardas found a job as a chef for a local restaurant, cooking up cepelinai for hungry Londoners. The kids are doing well in school.

In the misty, cracked roadway in the town's south, she'd enter Everett's Book Shop, the quaint building made of dark oak marked only by its bright green name painted above the entrance. Time to look for another volume to spend her nights with, once the kids were fed and tucked in.\n\nAfter the brief greeting and chatting with old Everett, Irena went over to the world literature section. She perused the shelves like a skilled detective, an eye for any title from her native Poland, knowing that anything she found would likely be at least thirty years old. As she ran her fingers through each section of the towering shelf, she fully expected to come up empty handed... until reaching a toppled over collection on the very bottom level. All in nondescript red binding, within these titles were hundreds of pages written in Polish, some so old that she could hardly comprehend half of what was being said. Tales of medieval rebels, supernatural battles, and the daily struggles of family life: all memories of a land she could hardly envision since first arriving on England's shores ten years ago. In an instant, piled up the books and pressed them up against her chest, moving carefully over to Everett, calculating in her head to see if she could even afford such a collection with her meager wages.\n\n"Find everything you need?"

The club (and most of the town) were known to support the government, come what may, and a thrashing might have shut the Clarets up for a good couple months. But this was not to be. A long pass down the field by Angus allowed for Walker to cross over to Harris, a Burnley favorite and winking HMMLR supporter. This last pass would forever be debated among football circles- was it offsides? What if it hadn't been Harris that scored? Were the refs secret HMMLR supporters, or paid off by resistance members?\n\nBut as Harris jumped across the field in victory after the goal, none of this mattered to the Burnley fans. And shortly after the roars died down, the chanting started. "KRAUTS, KRAUTS, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, FUCK RIGHT OFF TO YOUR OWN COUNT-RY!" Shortly thereafter, the two sections soon crashed against each other, red against blue, in a maelstrom of disorganized violence. Fans poured out onto the field, or were thrown over the stands.

When Parliament opened again under the auspices of Her Majesty, it was widely accepted that the oath would be administered to the new parliamentarians without complaint.\n\nHowever, a few hardliners in the Socialist Labour Party objected to this. Why would they declare their loyalty to some unelected monarch when their true allegiance is to the proletariat of England who elected them and gave them their positions? This sparked a massive controversy, as many of the privileges of an MP, such as the salary, debate privileges, and the ability to actually vote on things, were dependent on the person taking the oath.\n\nImmediately, the Patriots pounced, with Powell calling for the immediate expulsion of the communists. This further enraged the hardliners, and spirited debate soon followed. However, Jellicoe did not wish to be responsible for throwing out several elected members of parliament, and Stevas also advised against it. Harold Wilson wasn't willing to give up a segment of what support he had, and even Birch could see the potential problem of a portion of his caucus being tossed.\n\nAfter much negotiation between the parties, a workaround was found. While the hardliners would be required to take the oath declaring their faithfulness, they would be allowed to omit the "bear true allegiance" segment, so they could affirm they would follow the Queen's laws without committing what they deemed as a betrayal of their constituents.

If Germany was able to get their submarines through it, it would give them a tremendous opportunity to attack OFN shipping in the mid-Atlantic, and station nuclear-armed submarines off the eastern seaboard. Thus, when the American SOSUS sonar detected a German Type 401 off the Faroe Islands, the forces of the Free World began their typical, yet necessary hunt.\n\nFirst, aircraft from all of the OFN immediately raced to find the intruder. Despite the large numbers searching for the submarine, it was a helicopter from England guarding a frigate that first reported they had picked something up on the sonar system. Their microphone they had suspended from a cable had heard the unmistakable sound of U-boat propellers. A few hours later, a Sonobuoy dropped from an American P-3 Orion confirmed the discovery.\n\nIf this had been an actual combat situation, the U-boat would be blown up by a torpedo as soon as the helicopter had contact. But this was not, and the OFN had a better idea for what to do with the intruder. A Canadian sub was given their new instructions. They were to divert from their patrol and instead lie low with their engines off, and completely silent. The crew could no longer use the cooking equipment either, having to temporarily subsist on a diet of cold cheese sandwiches.\n\nFinally, the sonar operator picked up the U-boat. The Canadian submarine soon had a clear picture of the enemy. And as it traveled overhead with no hesitation or change in course, the Canadian crew could smile. They now had found and begun to track a Nazi submarine with no detection by the opposing side. If a war would break out, the OFN had this incredible advantage.

Dozens of news crews from across the globe gathered to witness the event as well, as many government officials of the new OFN-aligned English government came to greet the President, and thank him for "never giving up hope for the nation of the British."

He would need to be quick and lucky if he was to bring a story back to the Times.\n\nLuck happened to be on his side, when he spotted an encampment of Resistance soldiers milling about, on patrol. They raised their weapons, but seeing his camera, happily invited him to talk. Three of them on patrol, of three different ideologies. A lithe man with an upper-class accent introduced himself as William, and proudly announced that he was fighting for the Queen's return. A giant of a man, Jack, followed with a gruff pronouncement of his Socialist ideals. The last one, Henry, barely Sixteen, paraded ideals of liberty, ideals of which he had never truly experienced. Despite their different views, all three of the men laughed heartily with each other, brothers in the Resistance. This would be a winning story, Eddie knew; the common bond of anti-fascism breaking creating an unlikely friendship. As they all posed for the picture, Jack embracing the other two, smiles gleaming on the faces of all three, Eddie snapped the shot...\n\nNot a moment after, a deafening crack echoed across the field, and Eddie was thrown backwards. Bleeding, Eddie looked for his camera, and found that it was miraculously unbroken. Looking towards the subjects of his last photograph, though, he found that they were anything but. Eddie knew that, if he ever got his pictures developed, it would show the last moments of three men. On the ground, near the bodies, Eddie waited an eternity for the battle to end. It seemed that the Government forces had won, and a group of mean-faced soldiers approached him. Eddie knew that this was the end, that he would be killed, here and now. That is, until they asked him if he could take their picture. Eddie rapidly nodded, and watched as the three collaborators took their spots right where William, Jack, and Henry had once stood."

She couldn't see anything inhuman about it, but her parents constantly complained about the homophiles at the dinner table.\n\nIt had been two months since she and Olivia began snogging behind the bike sheds. Not before talking, of course. Talking about how they'd run away together, escape to America, live in a big city far away from this town where everyone lived grey lives. There was no place for them in England.\n\nThe bell rang, jolting her from warm hazel orbs and soft pink lips. As everyone walked out the door in unison, Matilda trailed behind. She waited by the wall for the other students to leave. The coast was clear. Matilda snuck around to their secret meeting spot when she caught a subtle sobbing. Olivia was sitting against a wall in an almost fetal position, face nestled in her legs.\n\n"Olivia?" Matilda whispered.\nOlivia sniffed.

The rest of the students had cleared off, and here she was, behind the bike sheds, waiting again. Olivia always arrived first, Matilda was always the careful one. Olivia wondered how she'd take the big news, but Matilda always promised to always be with her, after all.\n\nAnd there she was. Matilda trudged around the corner, looking clearly exhausted after a difficult final exam. She sat down next to Olivia and leant on her shoulder, breathing out.\n"You look tense," said Olivia smilingly.\nMatilda, smiling already, laughed a tad. "That could be considered an understatement. How do you assume you did?" she replied. "Eh, why bother? I probably failed. But... darling?"\n"What is it, Olivia?" Matilda said quizzically, moving up from Olivia's shoulder.\n"I want to join the Resistance."\n"The terrorists? Why would you ever want to join that awful organisation, Olivia, you should know better than that!"\n"They aren't terrorists. Listen, I have a mate in the Resistance, his name is Paul. The government has only lied and spread mistruths about them, and I want to fight for what's right!"\n"Olivia... you can't-"\n"Mattie, you know there's no future for us like this. We'll be found out, we'll be put in prison or we'll be shot first. And if I'm getting shot, I'd rather get shot making a difference to this ghastly place. Please, please, please come with me.

Inside there was a man looking to be in his fifties reading the newspaper at the till.\n\nThe man in the raincoat searches the shop to see if there was anyone else around. He turns towards the person reading the newspapers. They whisper together for a second, the man at the till nods, and he opens a door slightly hidden behind some clutter. The man in the raincoat nods at the girls to follow, and gestures at the girls to mind the step as they enter.\n\nThey entered a small, dingy room, with another man at a table at the back. The man looks around slightly, and looks at the man in the raincoat derisively. "Two women, Paul?" He snickers.\n"Oh, come on, Geoffries, it's not like they're the first you've taken in." Paul said, pulling down the hood of his raincoat. Olivia tries to speak up, but is interrupted.\n"We're supposed to be protecting the women and children, and you bring me two young girls."\n"Geoffries, they can fire a gun. That's all you need, isn't it?"\n"I suppose." Geoffries mused. He looks up at the girls. "Names?" Olivia piped up first.\n"Olivia Adler."\n"Very good. And you?" he said, pointing his pen at Matilda.\n"Matilda Lewis."\n"Mmhmm."\nAnd so it went. Geoffries asked the women questions, they answered. They ranged from the obvious to the obscure. But in the end, it came down to one question.\n\n"Are you prepared to give anything for a free England?"\n"Yes, I am."\n"I am."\n"Excellent! Ladies, welcome to Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.""

She collapsed onto Paul's dilapidated, lumpy couch. He had let them stay in his ratty flat, which was nice of him considering the fact that they had just ran away from home. Matilda wondered if her parents were searching for her... were they worried? She shook it off. Don't think about them. They... they'll forget her eventually. At least she hoped they would. She started to tear up despite herself.\n"Matilda?"\nMatilda rubbed her eyes and blinked. "Oh, sorry Olivia, was just getting lost in my thoughts."\nOlivia sat down on the couch next to Matilda, practically falling on it. "Your legs?" Matilda asked.\n"Yeah."\n"God, it was fucking brutal, wasn't it?"\n"I swear on my life, we won't be able to walk in two weeks, let alone shoot some policemen."\n\nAnd so the evening moved on. They had a lot to talk about, after all. They had been through the looking glass at that point, two 19-year-old girls in a seaside city joining what had been called a terrorist organisation.\n\n"So my dad, right, he ties the boat up, and the knot slips, and I go floating out onto the lake!"\nThe story wasn't very funny, but Matilda laughed anyway. "You're amazing, Olivia!" she said, still grinning.\n"I know." Olivia replied confidently.\nMatilda leans back, stretching. "I am bloody exhausted." She pulled out of her embrace, before kissing Olivia sweetly. "I suppose we better get to bed then." The girls lay together in each other's arms on Paul's bed.

Her hands shook slightly, her pulse quickening with every step into the factory. She held her breath slightly, trying not to make a sound. She glanced around the corner. It was full of workers, but more importantly, four police officers, positioned around the front entrance. They were prepared. Have the police been intercepting their radio transmissions?\n\nShe ducks back around the corner, and holds up four fingers to the men behind her. They nod, and two of them duck behind the back firing two gunshots in the air. Hearing the shots, two of the guards ran out the front door, going expeditiously around the back for an ambush. Two more of her comrades run inside. "This factory is now under occupation of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance! Surrender now, or we will not be afraid to use lethal force!" The officers, caught off guard, fired randomly and missed, before being immediately accosted with the barrel of a gun to their heads. Workers scattered, while Olivia ran to secure the front door.\n\nIt was too late. A guard stumbled through the front door before she could get to it. Olivia staggered backwards, shocked, before a bullet tore through her leg. It... burned. Why did it fucking burn? A girlish scream erupted from her mouth. She fell to the ground unconscious. Her comrades immediately retaliated, lodging a bullet in the officer's skull. The two guards who were hostaged dropped their weapon while shouting of surrender. "Get the girl, get the ammunition and go." one of the partisans mutter, glancing over his shoulder at the rest of them behind him. And thus HMMLR sweeps into the night, carrying a casualty home."

At least she wasn't dead. She had more time with Olivia yet. But there was a certain level of fear within her, a feeling that wouldn't leave, no matter what she told herself.\n\n"Miss Lewis? Please come with me."\nAs Matilda stepped through the door, she glanced around. Walls were all white, all sterile and bland. Matilda was almost blinded as she followed the nurse through the hospital, before entering a door, placed at the end of a corridor. Inside was Olivia, her leg in a splint. "Hello, Matilda." She smiled weakly, her eyes lighting up. "How are you today?" Matilda turns to the nurse. "Excuse me, but could you please-" Matilda's voice cracks. "Could you please give us some time alone?" The nurse shot a look towards Matilda. "Alright, I suppose."\n\nAs soon as the door shut, Matilda began to tear up, kneeled down and began carressing Olivia's hair. "I can't... I just...

They were probably going to break in soon. Many men had already coordinated plans for escape, or even surrender. She had her own ideas, of course. She had already accepted that she might die today. She hoped that somewhere... Olivia was thinking of her. Matilda breathed in. Do it for her.\n\nThe door burst down. Matilda ducked behind a bench near the back of the hall, anticipating a gunshot. Bullets began to fly as screams echoed around the dusty hall. Matilda nodded at all the men she could see, all also ducking behind the pews. Three men. The only way they could ever get out of this was by being very, very careful. As footsteps drew closer to the benches, Matilda looked through the crack at the bottom of each bench and counted the feet she could see. 1, 2, 3... 4. Four men? Matilda grimaced. They were outnumbered. It would take a miracle to escape. Matilda said her prayers as the enemy soldiers checked the pews. She prayed for a miracle, and if she couldn't have a miracle, well... she prayed for Olivia. She smirked a little bit. God hated her. At least, that's what all the priests said. She heard another loud bang of a gun, followed by the eerie sound of a corpse collapsing to the ground. Matilda held her breath and peeked out of the edge of the pews.\n\nIn front of her was a leg. She turned from her side to her stomach. She wanted her to go down with a fight? Matilda gritted her teeth and prepared for the blast.\nA bang.\nThe man fell. The rest of the soldiers, shocked, ran to his aid. They fired wildly. Conscripts, clearly. "Up and at 'em, boys!" screamed Matilda, hopefully exuding more confidence than she was feeling.

The room was quite bare, really. They had put a rug down to try and lighten up the place, and of course there was that chair that Paul lent them, but really mostly nothing.

The English suspected it to still be a hotbed for nationalist activity, which would inevitably have to be removed come unification anyway. Thus Welsh demilitarisation became the first key issue of the negotiations.\n\nThe Welsh delegation were also reminded that if they refused, no further actions would be off limits, and Wales would have to suffer the consequences.

The first few Englishmen had crossed the border and had already taken a great interest in Wales. For them Wales was seen as a land of opportunity, not one of dull stagnation that the locals had grown to tolerate.

Each day she organized the protesters, fewer people came, as they accepted the creeping fact of their culture, their identity, being more and more tied to the Hegemon of Britain, to a point that eventually she was simply seen as a nuisance, and the police and the mayor simply stopped replying to her correspondence.\n\nShe was an idiot. The peaceful dialogue was still the means to safeguard her nation's future, but all she made was a walking parade for the people in Wales to mock, a show to see how more and more the flames of independence went from righteous anger to a line of dozens, holding bold letters and drawings, going down a street and generally causing a nuisance.\n\nAnd now, her purpose to that show was done, and she was simply cast aside as a crazy lady that wrote to representatives, desperate for them to do something she couldn't do anymore... but really, would that change anything?\n\nShe was being isolated. Sidelined. An idiot whose purpose was done.\n\nShe picked up the letter, tears burning on the edge of her eyes as she tore it apart silently; first in half, then in four pieces, then in eight, until they were hundreds of tiny fragments, as wide as the center of her pinky finger, and threw them out of the window, to fly on a windy night.\n\nThat was Wales now. Insignificant pieces, to scatter about in a greater whole until what was once whole was simply undistinguishable.

Her hair was barely kept, falling to her hips in knots and twists, her expression and bags under her eyes talking of exhaustion that she couldn't just notice, but feel around the woman, the bottle she was holding on her other arm speaking of her activity in the morning.

Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery had proposed joint military exercises between the Cornwall Garrison troops and the native English forces, having wanted to determine combat readiness in the face of the renewed threat from the HMMLR rebels in the North. The Generaloberst had agreed, and a date had been scheduled for wargames to begin.\n\nThe results thus far had been less than satisfactory.\n\nFrom the box atop a hill overlooking the area that had been chosen to conduct the wargame, Fischer and a number of other officers watched as the English soldiers bumbled their way through the various scenarios. One particular event of note was when an English captain had been tasked with searching a mock village for garrison soldiers. The captain had immediately overstretched, causing his soldiers to be picked off one by one. Having sent even his staff away, he was left standing alone outside the village, and had been captured by the opposition forces. When he had complained about being outside the area of engagement when he had been captured, he was quieted when reminded that the terrorists did not play fair.\n\n"I've seen cadets more disciplined than this rabble," an Oberstleutnant commented, watching a squad fumbling around trying to load an artillery shell, "I know we thrashed them soundly during the war, but this is shameful."\n\nOberst Fischer had to agree with his subordinate. "The English have grown fat and soft without a proper enemy to fight," he replied, "At their current level of operation, those HMMLR partisans will crush them. There's only one thing to do: we must teach them, they must be ready to overcome any enemy they might face."\n\nMurmuring their agreement, the assembled officers turned back towards the proceedings."

Poor sods could barely march in formation."\n\nAuchinleck hummed as sifted through the papers, taking yet another sip of tea.

"I feel confident that these men will crush the rebels, and we'll provide the equipment you need," Halder said extending his hand.\n\nAs the two officers shook their hands, Templer thought about how to deal with the Cornwall issue in the future."

WORLD.50000.desc:0 "In stunning news today the King of England Edward VIII has had a narrow escape from assassination during a speech he was performing outside Buckingham Palace. The assassin, believed to be a radical member of the organisation HMMLR, attempted to throw a grenade at the monarch in the middle of the speech, and was only stopped by the fact that their device landed amidst members of the government standing behind the King, shielding him from its wrath.\n\nThis is a public representation of the instability many have long believed hides behind the facade of civility in modern England."

WORLD.50001.desc:0 "Today shots have rang out across England that herald something far worse than the London uprising in the 50's, for the second time in history England is in a state of Civil War. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, an organisation containing the full spectrum of English political outsiders from communists to a handful of more independently minded fascists has declared a revolt against the Collaborationist Government of Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nSpeaking from HMMLR's headquarters its leader, former general Claude Auchinleck alongside famed communist rebel Bill Alexander and resistance fighter David Stirling have declared that England will be a free nation or they will die trying."

The Collaborationist Government of Alec Douglas-Home has declared the Second English Civil War to be over, and that those traitors captured will be dealt with as their actions demand.\n\nOn the grander scheme, this is an unfortunate setback for the Organization of Free Nations and an equally important victory for the Reich, as now the Isles appear to be securely under the German thumb. Yet much of the fighting was done by Englishmen, not Germans, and one wonders if the status quo is quite so stable as some believe."

ENG_HMMLR_precw.1.desc:0 "Claude Auchinleck looked at the table and saw a motley crowd of men, all of them holding beliefs and ideologies that would otherwise make them utterly incompatible with one another. But they were men who would fight and die together to see the Nazis removed from England.\n\nThere were Claude's own HMMLR forces, men who had joined up with him from inside the collaborationist government. They sat on the reformist wing of the Royal Party, but they secretly pledged their lives for when the time came to establish a new, free England under Her Majesty Elizabeth II. Their two most influential members, Enoch Powell and George Jellicoe, joined him today.\n\nThere were also his allies in the SAS. David Stirling had never stopped fighting the Hun, and he had no intent on doing so as long as he still drew breath. He had gathered a powerful and skilled force, strong enough to go toe-to-toe with any unit in the Wehrmacht or the collaborationist army. His forces had an extreme hatred for anything collaborationist, and wished to drive them out even more than Claude did. He was accompanied by Arthur Harris, who was organizing what he ominously called "a little present for Jerry."\n\nAnd finally, the Left Resistance. Born out of the ashes of Cable Street, this new organization was a coalition of the surviving communists, Labour members, and other hard leftists under the leadership of Bill Alexander. Despite being a staunch communist, Bill had brought in the more moderate Harold Wilson to solidify his standing with the social democrats. He was even willing to collaborate with HMMLR, somehow stomaching working alongside the rabidly anti-communist Stirling.\n\nClaude looked at each of these faces one last time before he began to speak. The bombing attempt on Edward had failed, but a far bigger blast for the collaborators was in store."

He had to stop those that wished him ill. And he was not without defences.\n\nHis Home Secretary, Arthur Chesterton. A man who would take the fight to the rebels, and how! Police and paramilitaries on every street. Checkpoints on every block. A fierce and unyielding determination. That's what was needed!\n\nHis Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home. More soldiers for the extremely difficult situations, ready for a rebellion. Uniting the voters behind the government. A politically experienced man for a situation that required as much experience and action as he had.\n\nHis Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan. A man whose calmness and reasonability offered a way out of the difficult crisis. He could unite the parliament and the internally bickering Royal Party behind a greater goal.

ENG_reconstruction.2.desc:0 "Alec Douglas-Home, Prime Minister of England stared down at the list of names in neat handwriting before him. It wasn't a list of men to be rewarded, but a list of some of his former friends and colleagues who had deserted to HMMLR and been captured in recent days. Using a handkerchief to rub the sweat from his eyes the supposed most powerful man in England certainly didn't feel like it was a victory he presided over.\n\nClaude Auchinleck had been captured, a man who had served his country well once and no doubt sought to do so again by his actions. Of the renegades Bill Alexander and David Stirling there was no sign thus far, but he was confident that would change. As Home looked out from his office onto the streets of London he noted that the majority of the citizenry would likely not know what he did for some days. The English Civil War was now over.\n\nSome HMMLR fighters remained active of course, a handful of the diehards and fanatics who would never accept anything but victory or death for their cause aside. Home personally was quite willing to accommodate them on the latter option, he'd have to send a notice to Montgomery on the subject. Yet despite the destruction of HMMLR's forces Home had to admit to himself that it didn't feel like a victory.\n\nEngland was in ruins, from end to end not a village or town in the nation was unbesmirched by violence and death. People would blame HMMLR for a few years of course, but eventually they would come to blame the man who had allowed them to rise under his very nose. Alec Douglas-Home didn't know if he wanted to stick around for that. For despite the news he felt no joy. He just felt tired."

ENG_reconstruction.3.desc:0 "Roger Miller never had much of a head for politics, even when he'd gotten through school the words of the men on television had interested him far less than moving upwards in his uncle's motor repair shop. But the skill to repair broken down trucks and other vehicles had been one of the things the militia leaders had looked for first and foremost, and Roger had found himself drafted less than a week after the civil war started.\n\nNow the war was over, and he found himself with his fellow militiamen being asked to oversee security at the trials, which meant he was in the curious position of guarding a cell full of the men he'd been shooting at not a few months before. He didn't know how to feel about it at first, so he talked to them little outside of giving them meals and spent most of his time wondering whether his uncle's shop was still standing. They were an odd bunch, and after several weeks of waiting for their turn to go to trial Roger had learned a fair bit about them.\n\nThe officer had deserted with his battalion when HMMLR had first risen, not for pay or even any feeling of kinship with the HMMLR men, but because he'd lost a son in the war twenty years back and he wouldn't have gotten so good a chance for revenge again. The factory worker claimed he'd just wanted to get back at the men who spat down on him day after day and ensured his father died penniless after an accident took his knee. The young militiaman by contrast had wanted the return of the so-called "True Queen Lizzie", because his family had lost everything when the Germans invaded and her own father had treated the Jewish people well.\n\nOne by one they were taken away, Roger didn't ask anyone about their fates. For soon the next batch of prisoners were put into the cell he guarded. And he had to listen to their stories all over again."

ENG_reconstruction.4.desc:0 "If ever there were times where Bernard Montgomery truly felt that he had lived well over seven decades upon the earth, it was when he was presented with an unwelcome surprise.\n\n"Resignation?" He repeated to the carefully neutral face of his Prime Minister, but Alec seemed to take it in stride as Montgomery asked. "Whatever for?"\n\n"I'm afraid I'm just tired Field Marshal." Home responded wearily. "Keeping the party together and then the mess with those damned terrorists was hard enough. But a civil war? Some very old friends are dead, Field Marshal, worse others are soon to follow." At that Montgomery couldn't help but grimace. He'd never truly liked Auchinleck but to think him so short sighted that'd he'd doom the nation over who sat upon the throne, siding with communists even! It was enough to put a man ill at ease.\n\n"Well I suppose there's little for me to say really." Montgomery politely uttered as much to himself as the politician in front of him. It was evident why Home was really here then, he wanted the assurances of England's highest ranking officer that nothing untoward would interfere with whichever politician's ambition landed them in Downing Street. But perhaps Home had planned that out too. "Who is to succeed you then?"\n\nHome looked surprised at the question for just a moment before his politicians mask reasserted itself. "Margaret as it happens." The most powerful man in England simply stirred his tea as he mulled over what he was about to say next. "If you'd be so kind as to do her a favour and keep the military out of whatever mess happens after the announcement she'd be most grateful."\n\nBernard Montgomery nodded. Then he brightened his expression as if remembering something he'd intended to mention all along. "A parade perhaps, to show our newly forged national unity?"\n\nHome nodded. "That will do.""

ENG_reconstruction.5.t:0 "A Meeting with the King"
ENG_reconstruction.5.desc:0 "The meeting of the Prime Minister of England with His Majesty King Edward VIII was one observed by none but the two men in question. At first it seemed almost normal to the men and women serving in Buckingham Palace, until the meeting kept going. There were no raised voices or items thrown that the staff could hear, but what was supposed to have been an hour long meeting went on for three, then four, then five hours before the Prime Minister finally exited the room.\n\nCuriously, the first thing His Majesty did afterwards was not call any senior politicians or noteworthy men of military backgrounds, but instead a rather obscure young politician by the name of Margaret Thatcher, who was summoned for a meeting to the palace the next day."
ENG_reconstruction.5.a:0 "Whatever for?"

ENG_reconstruction.6.t:0 "End of an Era"
ENG_reconstruction.6.desc:0 "The press conference was rather a surprise even for the men and women of the Times, normally the best informed of the various media outlets peppered around England. So dutifully as was their profession, almost two dozen news reporters from England and a handful from foreign nations set up their equipment for the Prime Minister's surprise announcement. Most thought it was likely to be some new policy change or perhaps yet another remnant HMMLR cell caught. None thought it would be worth reporting tomorrow.\n\nRight on schedule at 10 o'clock sharp the Prime Minister appeared at the small podium which had been set up for him. He readied his papers, sipped at a glass of water placed on his stand, and then launched into a speech about the trials which had plagued England for many decades, but which had been overcome through grit and will. Douglas-Home spoke on this for a time, before abruptly announcing that he felt unable to continue his duties as Prime Minister due to personal matters and that he would be resigning in three days time. He concluded by stating that he felt Margaret Thatcher would make an able replacement and that the coalition government would be capable of continuing governance without holding a general election. He then thanked the reporters for their time."
ENG_reconstruction.6.a:0 "He did WHAT!"

ENG_reconstruction.7.t:0 "The Royal Divorce"
ENG_reconstruction.7.desc:0 "If George Stanley was to be any judge the latest meeting of the Royal Party had not been the stunning success which was promised. First the Prime Minister, soon to be ex-Prime Minister had announced that his successor as decided in a private consultation with senior party figures would be Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, only instead of laudation the newly selected PM had received jeers from the Hardliners, seemingly on the grounds of her being a woman. And accusations of foul play from the Reformists, who were livid that they had not been consulted on the choice.\n\nFrom there George had born witness as attempts to calm the two other factions of the Royal Party by the moderates had been met with ever increasing resistance, and then they'd turned on each other as well, the Moderates seemingly split between staying with Thatcher or compromising. On top of all this at some point the buffoon Chesterton got a pair of shoes thrown at him. What truly worried George was that as everyone exited the building there was talk not of unity, but of splitting the party. If the party split there would be no government, and if there wasn't a government, an election would have to be held."
ENG_reconstruction.7.a:0 "It's off to the races then."

ENG_reconstruction.8.t:0 "An Uneasy Alliance"
ENG_reconstruction.8.desc:0 "The agreement as such was a simple one. Macmillan and Thatcher met in an unassuming townhouse owned by a friend of the party, the old warhorse and the young lion squaring off against each other before sitting down to get to business.\n\n"We cannot allow that bastard to win." Seemed to be the only common point of United England and the Royal Party's proposal, for despite everything that had caused the two to fracture, the hatred of fascism was something they had in common. The end result of their talks was a gentleman's agreement to not focus too hard upon one another until Chesterton was dealt with. After that, it was free game. Whether either intends to uphold this is yet to be seen."

ENG_reconstruction.9.t:0 "Deal with the Devil"
ENG_reconstruction.9.desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher and Arthur Kenneth Chesterton cordially despised one another, but the safety of England came above all else for the both of them and neither was willing to risk the foolishness suggested by Macmillan's little puppet Maudling. Even if the Reich wasn't likely to put itself together overtly quickly, when it got around to the matter of England it would not brook an OFN presence on the isles.\n\nFor the safety of England the National Front and Royal Party agreed to a temporary truce, neither would act openly against the other until United England was certain to lose. Perhaps they might even uphold the bargain."

ENG_reconstruction.10.desc:0 "In the news today, numerous candidates fielded by United England for constituencies around England were arrested on charges of corruption by local authorities. Connected to a seemingly compromised front company accused of attempting to bribe local election officials, these arrests have been deemed to be based on false charges by United England and just by the Royal Party.\n\nThe general public seems to have concluded that the allegations appear to have some truth, and consequently the police who made the arrests have been lauded by numerous public figures. This deals a severe blow to United England's chances of victory this election, but doesn't put them out of the race just yet."

Connected to a seemingly compromised front company accused of attempting to bribe local election officials, these arrests have been deemed to be based on false charges by United England and just by the Royal Party.\n\nThe general public however seems skeptical that these charges are apolitical and the presumed boost of poll numbers that the Royal Party hoped for hasn't materialized. This has dealt a blow to the Royal Party's electoral chances, but not one it cannot recover from."

ENG_reconstruction.12.desc:0 "United England faces a problem, whilst it arguably possesses the largest number of candidates across the numerous constituencies which might be in play this election, it lacks a dedicated core of members who are currently MPs, and certainly not enough to build a majority off of. To alleviate this, an attempt was made to recruit the disaffected portions of the RP's moderate wing.\n\nThis was unfortunately for them unsuccessful, and the attempt is being used by the Royal Party and National Front as an example of why the UE are not to be trusted, portraying them as power hungry snakes.

Many a city, and several a town, had found themselves lying in ruins, nearby the vast swathes of once tranquil countryside helplessly bore witness to the tragedies of the damned war. Not a single corner of any field or street had avoided the damage caused. And underneath what had endured, a deep mistrust was felt throughout.\n\nYet the sounds of war, which had so haunted the lives of every Englishman, had indeed duly faded. Much of the rubble had by this stage been removed, and the foundations for a new England had been built in its place. Unfortunately, the paranoia remained below the surface, but, in typical English fashion, that too seemed to have passed at a glance. If one were to glance at the new England, they would have thought it quite similar to what had been before; utterly clueless to the terror of what the country had seen not so long ago.\n\nA new era was undoubtedly upon them, from the ruins of what remained, an altogether different England had been constructed. Soon it's grander ambitions would be rekindled, England would grow and flourish once more!\n\nHowever, most of those who had been dragged through the overarching panic that had seized every aspect of their lives could only hope.

Would Stirling, the reactionary leader of the SAS, be the first English PM? Or would the red banner of a communist Labour party fly in the halls of Parliament?\n\nNeither happened. Instead, the center-right coalition of the National Democratic League won the hearts of the voters. Headed up by George Jellicoe, a former commando, diplomat, and the son of the hero of Jutland, the party promised a return to the England of old. One of free markets and a strong economy, ruled by the daughter of George VI. But also, an England that would make the necessary social changes and economic reforms to keep up with the modern era. And the glowing endorsement of Claude Auchinleck was enough to seal the deal in many districts.\n\nMany are concerned that this coalition may not last. It is made up of many parties with different goals and volatile personalities. But, the NDL will still press on. It will fulfil its mandate, and give the voters what they asked for. An England ruled by sensibility and compromise, as well as a constitutional monarch. And perhaps one day a Britain that is respected by the nations of the world."

Furthermore, many of the MPs elected are personally loyal to Thatcher rather than the party, and so her influence grows swiftly in the party and the country. She gave a brief impromptu speech to reporters from the EBC.\n\n"The English people have had enough of wasteful government spending that burns their tax dollars away worthlessly.

ENG_Government_Changes.10.desc:0 "England went to the polls today, and the result seems to be a triumphant comeback for the center-right National Democratic League, swept into power on a wave of resentment against the ruling Socialist Labour Party. Across the country, the coalition won big in many swing parliament seats, and looks to have a decent majority to be able to pass their agenda.\n\nThe NDL, widely expected to break apart after their defeat in the first elections, instead held together and continued to be the primary source of opposition against the SLP. Their pro-business platform and commitment to free market economics was appealing to many voters hurt by the economic policies of the SLP, and their endorsement of more liberal social policies helped make them palatable to many more. New Prime Minister George Jellicoe will be certain to follow up these promises with action, although many wonder if his coalition can hold together now they are in power.\n\nThe SLP, by contrast, is in a sour mood. Infighting and unsuccessful policies have plagued the government and led to its defeat. It seems the first experiment with far-left socialism in England has failed in the minds of the voters. And Harold Wilson is left thinking about where it all went wrong."

ENG_Government_Changes.11.t:0 "The SLP Comes to Power!"
ENG_Government_Changes.11.desc:0 "Second time's the charm, it seems, as the Socialist Labour Party finally defeated the National Democratic League at the ballot box, bringing in what now PM Harold Wilson called "the next phase of the English revolution." The far-left party won big in the parliamentary and local elections, giving them a broad mandate to carry out their reforms.\n\nMany people are now wondering what went wrong for the formerly ruling National Democratic League, especially now ex-Prime minister George Jellicoe. Some point to failed policies and economic issues. Others say the party was set up to fail from the start, forced to cater to the whims of the extreme ends of the organization to keep to power, rather than make actually good policy. Although many believe this will be a problem with the SLP as well, since they have a vocal communist block.\n\nHarold Wilson's crusade against the great evils that damn the people of England to poverty and want is sure to go ahead with a roaring start. Although several years of NDL rule will be hard to remove entirely, especially for a man who has otherwise gotten on well with them. This may upset the hardliners in the party, and what happens when socialist dreams meet English reality is something many surely dread."

ENG_Government_Changes.12.t:0 "The Royal Party Returns"
ENG_Government_Changes.12.desc:0 "Elections in postwar England have usually been something of a formality, rather than an actual gauge of public opinion. But two equally shocking events have occurred in them. The rise of the new United England Party ended years of domination by the ruling Royal Party. But now, the Royal Party is back, and they are none too pleased about what United England has done with their time in charge.\n\nPolitical defeats have hampered United England and its reformist policies. Their dream of a more liberal and democratic government has fallen flat on its face, and the consequences for them were dire. Their failure to neutralize the Royal Party doubtlessly was a mistake that will haunt them for the rest of English history as well.\n\nThe Royal Party has been vague, but it's widely expected they wish to crush the remnants of the United England Party. The new PM, Margaret Thatcher, is not merciful, and is known for taking out any threats to her hold on the party when they were in opposition. For the longest time, the party in charge of England abuses their power to crush the opposition. And now, it is expected that United England will face an angry revenge from the party they tried to destroy."
ENG_Government_Changes.12.a:0 "The dream is gone."

ENG_Government_Changes.13.t:0 "The Fall of the House of Thatcher"
ENG_Government_Changes.13.desc:0 "Many people saw Margaret Thatcher and the Royal Party as an unstoppable force in English politics. The Royal Party was a formidable organization, with broad support among the electorate, kept by mass surveillance and a carefully selected group of voters. Margaret Thatcher herself was widely viewed as imposing, able to offer charismatic speeches, populist reforms, and dynamite any obstacles in her path. Certainly, nobody expected them to yield power once they grabbed onto it. But tonight, the Iron Lady collapsed in a pile of rust.\n\nThe main opposition party, United England, seemed to be on its way out after its break up with the Royal Party and its electoral failure after the war. But apparently many underestimated the organization's tenacity, some at their own peril. The reformist organization somehow not only eked out a victory, they did it in the cutthroat and oppressive world of modern English politics, where organized opposition is mostly regarded as a joke.\n\nWhoever won the election would certainly grind the other party into the dirt, but it seems the UE will be doing the stomping, instead of Thatcher. They are certain to go to work scaling back or outright abolishing her most grievous offenses, and making sure the Royal Party never comes close to a position of power again. And if they do establish a true democracy, it is clear the Royal Party will play no part in it."
ENG_Government_Changes.13.a:0 "Outmaneuvered by a shadow master."

ENG_Government_Changes.14.t:0 "A Motion of No Confidence"
ENG_Government_Changes.14.desc:0 ""...and so it has become clear that the Prime Minister has failed to win the support of England's people and institutions. Given her widespread unpopularity, numerous failures on policy, and inability to maintain a working majority in this chamber I am saddened to introduce this motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. I urge all members of this body to support it so we may form a new government to lead the nation forward in these trying times."\n\nWith that, Rab Butler returned to his bench. The Deputy PM's betrayal had been a shock to nearly everyone in the chamber, but certainly not an unwelcome one to Thatcher's many enemies. Over the next several hours the thatcherites howled from the backbenches as Old Guard defectors and opposition MPs spoke, and Thatcher herself raged against Butler and his allies in her defence. But the House of Commons finally went quiet as the Speaker called for a final vote on the motion.\n\nA chorus of ayes rang out in answer.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Margaret Thatcher had no witty retort or hyperbolic broadside at the ready. She merely sat, stunned and defeated as her life's ambitions came crashing down. Eventually she walked out of the House of Commons, paying no mind to the MPs, reporters, and other hanger-ons who followed her to console, to question, to jeer. She walked back to 10 Downing Street with her head held high, and the faintest glimmer of tears on her cheeks."

The choice to elect the MSA signaled the will of the voters who rejected the politics of old, and embraced the promises of the MSA to prioritize the protection of the English people, and restore England to her place on the world stage.\n\n"Today, the people of England have chosen decisiveness and security over the continuation of the old. They have placed the future in the capable hands of the heroes of England," Stirling said in an address to reporters.

Roiling discontent with the previous government, the failures and mistakes in the Civil War, and a growing nationalism movement within the nation contributed to the spectacular implosion of the ruling party.\n\n"The people of Britain have spoken, and they have said 'no more' to the divisive, incompetent, and outdated government of old!" Prime Minister-Elect Chesterton said in an address to reporters. "They have refused to bow their heads to the elites, and desire not the complacency of the status quo, but a restoration of our great nation.

ENG_diplomatic_crisis.1.desc:0 "England's darkest days are no more. Now, there is a new dawn. A dawn that has illuminated the land. England is a free nation now, with a peaceful, democratic system. Economic prosperity is available for every man and woman in our land. But we are still not at the heights we once were. For how can we claim to have retaken our place in the world if we do not share this prosperity with our western neighbor?\n\nWales formed by a few well-meaning nationalists who wished to escape the fate of the United Kingdom, has found itself in a new mess. One of political instability, economic mismanagement, and extremism. Though it may find temporary respite, disaster always looms large in their minds. And the land suffers as a result.\n\nWe shall come to the Welsh with a new offer. A way out of the instability and economic disaster. A guarantee of their way of life, with representation and protection under the constitution. And special rights afforded to the nation, ones which they were denied before. All we ask in return is they still think of themselves as Welsh, but Welsh who are participating in a grand and historic union of all those who live on this island."

They were the ones who sent us firearms when nobody else would, who gave us refuge when there was none, and aided our refugees when they had nowhere else to go. So we could just leave them alone as a favor.\n\nBut there are many other reasons to push for a Union. So we may call ourselves the UK again, certainly. However, there are more practical ones than a simple ego-boost. Many in Scotland want a union back. And a union would provide Scotland with a high degree of security, something Scotland wishes for desperately. And there are the simple economic benefits to free and unrestricted trade between us.\n\nWe will give the Scots a fair offer. Every freedom, every benefit, every advantage they have, they can keep. We will not seek to enforce a hierarchy like we have done in the past. Our democratic system is open to all. And the Scottish can see they would not suffer any hardships if they join up with us.\n\nThough if they don't see reason, we will not hesitate to bring them to their senses."
ENG_diplomatic_crisis.2.a:0 "A Union once again, hopefully."

ENG_diplomatic_crisis.3.t:0 "Red Dragon, Red Star"
ENG_diplomatic_crisis.3.desc:0 "Welsh independence is a venerable cause, but anyone can see that their experiment has largely failed. Saunders Lewis essentially turned the nation into his own personal dictatorship, and his criminal cover up of the coal crisis demolished their economy. If we aim to build socialism on the British Isles, we can't stop where Bristol ends. The wealth generated by the coal miners of Wales would be invaluable to the well-being of all British workers, as would those of their critical western ports and the brave longshoremen who staff them.\n\nWe aim to build a plurinational union, where the traditions of Britain's various groups are respected. Hopefully, our promises of cultural and political autonomy (as much as can be allowed for socialism to flourish, anyway) will make the government in Cardiff understand we don't seek to replicate the crimes of past English governments. On the other hand, if reactionary elements sabotage our efforts to unify the British working class, the full force of the people will face them."
ENG_diplomatic_crisis.3.a:0 "Unite and fight!"

ENG_diplomatic_crisis.4.t:0 "The Spirit of Jarrow"
ENG_diplomatic_crisis.4.desc:0 "Scotland has always been the home of ardent revolutionaries, willing to throw their lives down if it meant getting just one step closer to liberation. While sometimes that struggle was co-opted for narrow-minded nationalism, on other occasions it meant vigorous working class resistance. The brave organizers of the Jarrow March in '36 showed how the Scottish worker will stand up to acts of capitalist violence committed against them, and we hope that same spirit can animate their working class as we attempt to reunite our fraternal nations.\n\nWhile Scottish land is dotted with many productive factories, their waters are what most promises to pay dividends for the British working class. The North Sea is one of the richest spots for fishing in Europe, but that is meager compared to its many potential petroleum resources. If we can turn these over to a plurinational working class, British socialism can become just that much more fortified. Their workers cannot wait a second longer for liberation, knowing of course that we will respect their many unique traditions. If the Edinburgh bourgeoisie attempts to strong arm the rest of the nation, we expect the armed masses to be greeted with open arms as they take on Scottish reaction."

A wealth of national resources, completely squandered to suit one man's ego. A powerful united front, bogged down in endless compromise and division. These afflictions are exactly what our new Britain will seek to remedy. The Welsh people deserve to be free of the scourge of divided, ego-driven governments, and they must recognise that their past, present, and future is inseparable from England. Whether we reunite by pen or by sword is up to them."

While sell-outs and socialists jostle for their highest office, the true power lies in a small clique of military officials who would reduce the entire country to ash if they believed it could fund another tank division. By bringing Scotland into the fold, we shall do away with this petty mode of politics, and turn the many squandered resources in the North Sea over to a thriving, competitive marketplace.\n\nThe Scottish military will of course dig their heels in regarding unification, but by dealing with their politicians as we do dissidents in our own party we hope to produce...results. If they still prove recalcitrant after the Royal Party treatment, well, they'll see how a proper national military operates."

And yet, the fascists could come in at any moment and kick the entire state down with a swift kick. A tiny military, an economy based on a single resource, and constantly under threat from infantile men with delusions of grandeur? No wonder the people beg for our help!\n\nWales has to be part of England. If we are to have Great Britain once more, we must have it under our control. They'll ask for some accommodations, and we'll be happy to give it to them. But if they outright reject us, we're prepared to go in and get them the protection they need to survive."

One which left the border heavily armed and the Scottish paranoid.\n\nWe may not have had the best recent history together. Scotland funded and armed the rebels not so long ago. But that could be forgiven as them trying to find a way out of a tough situation. And they haven't been the most eager to cooperate since we won, because we are directly descended from that regime.\n\nBut we are a new nation, one that does not tolerate fascism in the slightest. We want to respect each of our citizens, and protect their liberties and freedoms. The Scottish shall be made to understand this. And they must know that a permanent alliance is the most beneficial to our collective security. If they join, it will be proof that everything we worked for has been a success.\n\nIf not, we will be made to take decisive action."

Well, how can they play the part of the allies without us? It just doesn't make sense! They need us just as an ego booster, if nothing else."\n\n"Correct," said Jellicoe.

This simply exemplifies the kind of ruthless pragmatism Lenin practiced, and is more necessary than ever given Europe's state of affairs.\n\nWith the might of the Yankees on our side, Germany will never be able to trifle with us, and we will have solid trade partners to boot. There's a slight possibility that they may refuse entry to a lodestar of the global left...but what other friends do those capitalist bastards have in the world?"

The empire has awoken with the rage of not one, not two, now three soldier-generations seeking to reclaim their homeland. And at the helm of this movement to reclaim the greatness of Britain is not a lazy sellout or a supposed "realist" but a man whose single-minded focus on revolutionary fascism finally won the day over all challenges.\n\nEven now, in the moment of ultimate triumph, do the forces that so long relied on the complacency and tolerance of the British People doubt him.

Our promises of peace and security for all have won over all but the most ardent of our detractors, and we have prevented the repeat of history that would surely have occurred under a NDL government. Likewise the far too radical changes that the SLP sought to implement in government are also now a fantasy.\n\nYet we cannot sit on our laurels. David Stirling did not idly wait for 20 years before liberating us from the German yoke. He planned and he worked his hardest and he never once considered defeat, and now to fulfil our promises we must do the same. To honour the dead, to preserve the living, the M, S, and A will defend Britain, whatever the cost may be."
 FEN_MSA_lions_rightous_grip_desc:0 "Our movement is centered around David Stirling, it is true, and we take no shame in this. It was he who led us to victory over the traitors and their ilk after all, and it is his ideals we seek to spread and embed within British society. But no man is a castle, unassailable. Stirling did not get here alone, and he shall not continue his journey alone either.\n\nRichard Hull, a fine commander of men who will be our voice on the field of battle. Arthur Harris, who was right all along about how Germany should be fought without mercy. Pauline Gower, a fine pilot turned finer politician with connections to the upper class. And finally, John Woodhouse. An old colleague of Stirling with some ideas about how to proceed with the economy. With men and women of this calibre behind us, we cannot fail."

Yet that doesn't mean we can't find favourable terms to set the new political reality in stone for the long run. Likewise, the people of Britain will doubtless enjoy some degree of cooperation amongst Parliament's disparate factions as opposed to a ceaseless cycle of squabbling.\n\nPerhaps the MSA should make inquiries with the NDL and SLP on the subject. Wilson and Jellicoe are likely sick of the radicals they made foolish bargains with for power. Yes, trusting in the democratic process is our safest option at this juncture. We are not the Royal Party after all."
 FEN_MSA_appease_the_ndl_desc:0 "George Jellicoe is a drunkard, a womaniser, and a man harkening for an age destroyed decades ago, but he is an old comrade of the Prime Minister and we should not forget his services to the cause of liberation. The NDL might be a disparate alliance, but they are wary of us to a one. We should ensure that they have less reason to be paranoid and more to play by the current set of rules. Powell won't budge, but Stevas and Jellicoe might be willing to accept changes in return for guarantees of their old order remaining untouched. Yet it would not do to be too incautious. We should remember that the ilk of these men are the ones who failed Britain all those years ago."
 FEN_MSA_talk_with_wilson_desc:0 "Harold Wilson might have been amenable to reason decades ago, but years of persecution have seen his views lean more towards those of Bill Alexander than the Prime Minister is at all comfortable with. He's not quite a communist, but the man seemingly has no problem calling them allies.\n\nStill, he doubtless worries about some of the more extreme elements in our own party and perhaps there is room for an agreement based upon that. If we were to give the SLP assurances of our support of the democratic process regardless of our personal feelings about some of their party membership, we might make a compromise for them to offer us limited support in parliament. They don't have to know we have no intention of acting outside the law, of course, so really we're getting the deal for free."
 FEN_MSA_shove_the_gunpowder_desc:0 "The Young Democracy Law is an abomination, however well intended its conception was. Bill Alexander and Claude Auchinleck cling to it out of fear that the balance of power might upend itself in the favour of the Reich, but the Prime Minister knows better. A law legalising a coup is a ticking time bomb, and we will not tolerate it existing within our civilised nation. Such tomfoolery can be reserved for the cesspits of the world like Ireland and Italy.\n\nNo, we do not need a hidden blade when the open hand is far more effective. If anyone seeks to betray our nation to its most hated enemy, the Prime Minister will use our entirely legal powers to prosecute them. We will not need to destroy the facets of our democracy to do so."

There was no shining archangel on high delivering us from the tyrants in Germania, there was just British blood, British sweat and British steel. Why should our new Prime Minister trust in the system that led to our subjugation? He didn't in the past and was proven right when our own politicians and generals handed over Britain for the chopping block to the Reich. He knew better then, and knows better now.\n\nTo say nothing, of course, of the fact that we cannot assume the German scum will remain on their ill-begotten side of the English Channel. Our army and industry will be needed if the dark days of Operation Sealion fall upon us once more. We should nurture both carefully, lest Britain may find itself cast into the dark one final time, with no way out."
 FEN_MSA_invite_military_advisors_desc:0 "In the lead up to the liberation, our Prime Minister chose to trust in advisors from military backgrounds more than civil servants or trade unionists. It worked against Home and his ilk, why should it not work in the forging of a Britain with enough strength to throw the Reich back into the sea?\n\nWe'll need to be circumspect, of course. No illegalities, but some of Stirling's old colleagues from the SAS might be useful aides to the civil portions of our government. Able to give context and explanations for actions which those who never served might be unable to understand. If the civilian population and the army can be convinced that neither of their goals are in opposition to one another, Britain will be capable of throwing back anything sent against her. German, Irish or otherwise."

Dedicated to her country, opposed to the fascists in contrast to her treasonous bastard of an uncle, and well aware she came closer to losing the throne to a vote than anyone was comfortable with. Still, these days are not entirely like the old ones. We cannot afford for there to be a misunderstanding between our administration and the rightful Queen. She will have no influence. She will have no say aside from yes, and only on what we ask her to say yes about. There will be no appointments without our consultation, there will be no public outings without our say so. Elizabeth II will bow to the new order of things, or history will see her reign as one of ill omens. But we do have to arrange all this in person, best to be polite after all."
 FEN_MSA_light_the_fuse_desc:0 "Our preparations have concluded. Our MPs are ready to support us, and we have assurances that the other parties shall both suffer convenient defections. The Young Democracy Law is an abomination, and like all abominations ought to be put to rest. We do not need a built in coup mechanism in British democracy, we never have in the past and never will in the future.\n\nWe must place our trust in the British people. We must place our trust in the Movement. We must place our trust in our Prime Minister to lead us onwards. Only through strength of will can Britain reach greatness once more, and will is something David Stirling has in spades. Let the men in the shadows challenge this, for our cause is just and true. We answer to the people, and the people alone."

Why, they couldn't even all agree to support the SLP in the election!\n\nWe can use that, some malcontents can be dug up and ulitized to cause disarray in the ranks. From there, we can use his communist affiliation to tarnish the SLP further and maybe spin off some of the rightmost members of that party. Who knows, there might even be a scandal or two we can bring up to make the British people doubt that Bill Alexander is the one they want holding the reins of democracy."

The hardened eyes of military men were the prominent ones in the background behind David Stirling, but the man himself managed to look approachable.\n\n"Our nation is free from the grasp of the monstrous cancer that is the German Reich. Our nation is free of the iron fist of traitors and cowards, who for years killed and looted their way through your own homes, and your futures. This government promises to ensure that this new state of affairs remains such, that all our children now and yet to come may live free of the tyranny of fascism."\n\n"That no man nor woman may be persecuted for their faith or their race.

Now it seemed she had emerged as one of the leading figures in his block in parliament by leveraging that direct connection. She'd be a handful, he was sure, but he'd rather be working with her than against her.\n\nArthur he'd had to include in cabinet by default, the man had been with his cause too long for anything else. It was strange to think back on the day they'd met. Two men with scattered bands of malcontents fighting a hopeless battle. If they'd known how far the partnership they forged then would get them, it would have stunned their past selves. In truth though, Stirling had to let the former head of Bomber Command into cabinet for a single reason. The man knew what had to be done in order to protect the nation from Germany.\n\nRichard Hull was a concession to Claude's lot. He'd worked closely with the man long enough after all, but hadn't fallen for the ideas of the Young Democracy Law quite as much as some would have liked. His competence only made the appointment more attractive.\n\nJohn Woodhouse was simpler, the man was a friend and a colleague from the old days of the SAS. Stirling didn't have many of those anymore. His contacts in the business world would be valuable though.\n\nBetween them, Stirling was sure that Britain would prevail, or the world would shake apart trying to stop them."

The new prime minister watched it bounce once, twice, before coming to a stop along the middle of the green.\n\n"Tremendous shot, David," said a smiling George Jellicoe, wearing a ridiculous set of tartan golf trousers. "When'd you bloody learn to golf like that?"\n\nHe gave a polite chuckle. "Oh, I play here and there. You're not a bad golfer yourself, George."\n\n"Oh, you're only saying that to make me feel better about myself, you dog." Jellicoe laughed. "I suppose I'll have to console myself by beating Auchinleck and Alexander. I swear, those men are near useless on the green."\n\nStirling nodded, falling quiet as they trekked across the course. Days after his election, Stirling found it hard to believe that his one-time rival was so friendly, that the bonds they'd forged in the war had survived the peace and elections that followed. Against all reason, Stirling discovered a fondness for the Tory and his old-fashioned chumminess. He tried to put those feelings aside as he grabbed a putter from his bag.\n\n"I was actually hoping to talk to you about them..." Stirling said. He cleared his throat awkwardly and teed up next to his ball. "The, errr... YDL." George said nothing. Stirling pressed on. "I respect what Auchinleck and Alexander did during the war. No one could have asked for better allies then... but their peace... The way they've granted themselves authority to just 'step in' and seize power..."\n\nStirling looked up from his ball to see Jellicoe's smile gone. They stared at each other. "David, I cannot talk about this with you. The three of you-."\n\n"But do you disagree? Our democracy-."\n\n"I don't want to be part of whatever scheme you're thinking up.

The men had made some small talk at first, but the gulf between them in position, much less ideology, killed the small talk very quickly. Wilson found it difficult to adequately articulate what he wanted, especially in the presence of David Stirling. A man who was dangerous, a man who held the power and was not shy about using it. Still, when Stirling had offered to talk over a meal, he'd accepted because if he didn't, then who would?\n\nFor his part, Stirling seemed fully at ease, and very clearly seemed to understand the discomfort his left-wing rival was in. Wilson finally had enough of the awkward silence and spoke. "What are you planning to do?"\n\nStirling poured some more water into his glass, taking his time answering. "A disappointingly vague question, Wilson. I'm planning many things. I'm sure you can imagine."\n\nSomething flashed in Wilson's eyes; irritation, or anger. "Don't play coy with me, Stirling. I want to know if you intend this to be a democracy, or something..." he trailed off, and sighed. "Something else."\n\n"Wilson, there is no stauncher advocate of democracy than me," Stirling leaned forward. "That is what I, and Britons everywhere fought for. I will do whatever is necessary to protect it."\n\n"That's what I'm afraid of," Wilson muttered. "I won't protect the fringe of my party - but I want your guarantee that the SLP won't be touched.

 FEN_MSA.5.d:0 "The Young Democracy Law.\n\nThe measure seemed like a cruel joke, a mockery of what the men and women who had bled, suffered, and died for a free Britain had fought for. As David Stirling sat alone in his office, he wondered how the fallen would have felt being told that the "democracy" they had fought for would, in reality, be shackled to the whims of their leaders. Leaders who were afraid of the will of the people.\n\nClaude, Alexander, and many others. Liars who had sold the fighters of the Most Loyal Resistance on the dream of democracy, only to backstab the free men and women of England by undermining it in one of their first acts. So long as the Young Democracy Law remained in place, Britain would not be a free democracy. No matter what, this undemocratic measure would be dealt with. He would see to it.\n\nThe question, of course, was how exactly to do it.\n\nIt had been a question Stirling had been pondering over the previous days, and after speaking with his advisors, trusted representatives, and soldiers, he had a solution. He would use an Act as the primary mechanism, one which would not outright destroy the law but reduce it to irrelevance. It ran the risk of being seen as a power grab, so the details would be important to blunt that inevitable attack.\n\nTo do this, the Act would be written in such a way as to limit the military's influence in politics - but at the same time, it would create a number of "oversight" positions, which would take away the power of Claude and Alexander to act against him. Subtle enough that it couldn't be portrayed as a power grab - at least not openly. Claude and Alexander would see it for what it was - but the power they held should never have been given to them in the first place."

 FEN_MSA.6.d:0 "David Stirling stood in his office in 10 Downing Street, grinding his teeth. For 300 years, this house had stood. It had seen hundreds of thousands of men pass through its many rooms. It had hosted ministers and diplomats and scholars. Most of them were good men, decent men, committed to Britain and its people. They had faced many struggles to preserve the British way of life.\n\nAnd yet, Stirling doubted many of them had faced the steep odds he did now. Everywhere he looked, there were Nazis, socialists, and would-be dictators. The British empire had been dismantled and England stood alone, vulnerable. It seemed to him that he had expelled the vermin from a great manor, only for him to discover the foundation rotting beneath his weight. No matter how dire his warnings, none of the soft men in parliament seemed to recognise the extent of the rot.\n\nHe sat down, his breath growing quicker. He would not be a steward of a crumbling house. He would not allow the fat, complacent men who made up parliament to lead England to its ruin.\n\nStirling looked at the black phone on his desk. It would be so easy to make a few calls to secure the resignation of several MPs, resignations that he could use to fill the parliament with strong, well-equipped military veterans. He could call up some of his friends and allies from the armed forces and grant them informal positions in his cabinet as "advisors", positions that would allow them to escape hearings and paperwork.\n\nSure, the tabloids might question the legality of the move, might raise alarm about the politicization of the military and the erosion of norms, but did he care? He could find some justification. He could find some loophole or ignore the outcry altogether.\n\nStrength might be the only thing to save the British people from their decaying institutions. A few military men wouldn't harm anyone. If anything, it could deter threats foreign and domestic and ensure 10 Downing Street survived to see another prime minister.\n\nStirling's hand hovered above the receiver."

No Germans though. He'd been sure to ban anyone coming from the Reich.\n\n"They respect you," Elizabeth commented as they stood, speaking of the reporters and media.\n\nStirling chuckled at that. That was a charitable way to put it, but he appreciated it. "Respect may not be the right word, Your Majesty. But I appreciate the thought."\n\n"I think many do," Elizabeth insisted as she smiled at the cameras. "You would not have been elected by the people otherwise. The nation needs a good man to lead them. I'm glad it was you."\n\ntirling smiled at that, quite pleased by her compliment. Though it was earned, was it not? Unlike those who had infested politics before, he had come in with a clear vision and goal, without the taint of fascism or communism. All he had done, he had done for the nation - and he would do far more to keep her safe.\n\nHe checked the time, and realized his meeting was coming up. It might look bad to leave the Queen alone, even for a short time, but the British people would certainly prefer him to be working than smiling for the cameras. Then again, he was here, and it would be in poor taste to leave the Queen now and perhaps sully the good opinion she had of him. The seconds were ticking down, and he needed to decide what to do."

He had fought for years to remove the fascist jackboot from the throat of England when not many others would. He was a man whom Stirling had once considered one of his closest friends. A man who he thought he had known and whom he had greatly respected.\n\nIt hurt to realize how little he'd actually known him. In a perverse way, he almost wished that Claude had died in the liberation as a hero, as the man Stirling thought he was, instead of what he had become. Their friendship, their values, all so quickly thrown away for power.\n\nClaude could never stand to not be in control, and Stirling wondered if he should really be so surprised that, when it came down to it, Claude couldn't let go - even if his solution undermined all they had fought for.\n\nEven with this betrayal, it couldn't erase what he had done for the nation. Stirling didn't want to shame him, but he didn't need to - not directly. All that was needed was to put a little dirt on the pristine image of a hero. Show the nation who the true Auk really was. Rumors were powerful, and when word got out that Claude had once had dealings with many of the collaborators...\n\nWell, it might make people a little more hesitant to listen to what he had to say. Plans had been drawn up, and his agents were prepared to disperse them to the right people. Hopefully Claude would get the message quickly and not make this more difficult than it had to be. Otherwise, Stirling expected that this was going to get messy."

For that alone, Stirling respected them, as he did any who had fought and died for a free Britain.\n\nSuch a shame that they were communists and trade unionists.\n\nUnlike some of his dismissive contemporaries, Stirling knew both the influence and danger that Alexander and his men posed, having fought and planned with them for years before. The left was militant and with Alexander aligned with Claude, he had a significant amount of legitimacy, popularity, and political power - even among the non-left of the country.\n\nThis was a problem, but one with a particular solution.\n\nHe knew Alexander well, and how he operated. It had probably been Alexander who had pushed Claude to draft the Young Democracy Law in the first place, as Alexander would prefer a controlled "democracy" to the fascist collaborators. If the law were ever to be used against him - and Stirling knew one day it would be - it would be Alexander who would advocate for pulling the trigger.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Stirling knew what he would do, and he wasn't going to wait around. Unlike Claude, Alexander would be more easy to discredit in the eyes of the public. A coordinated media campaign, highlighting the violence of the trade unionists and spreading rumors about communist infiltration, and the shine over another hero of England would be tarnished.\n\nPerhaps distasteful, but Stirling knew it was the right thing to do."

Sweat beaded on his forehead, but he kept his face still, even as the voting continued. No comments, no movement, no indication given of what he was feeling.\n\n"It is the will of this chamber that the Act has passed."\n\nThe speaker read out the final vote tally, but was drowned out by the reaction from the bench. Representatives either cheered and burst into ecstatic applause or shouted and demanded a recount. Both Claude and Alexander were also present, and the blood had drained from their faces in horror as they realized what had happened.\n\nThe Young Democracy Law was dead. Their gambit had failed, and they could not ever act against the will of the British people.\n\nThey could not act against him.\n\nAcross the chamber, the chaos of the reactions was muted, while he locked eyes with those who had once been his closest allies. Claude shook his head, stood, and departed. Alexander stayed, and kept his eyes locked on him, face expressionless. He could not see his eyes, but Stirling imagined they were full of hate.

It was important, Stirling thought, for no expense to be spared, for all the glory of Britain to be on display. The Prime Minister made sure to smile as he escorted the mix of old veterans, cabinet officials, and friendly journalists to the dinner table. It was only after allowing them a few minutes to chat among themselves that he stood before the assembled party and raised his glass.\n\n"I promised myself that I would not talk long. God knows that I am not a natural politician and that you all hear me blather on enough in Westminster." There was polite laughter. "Still, I wanted to address you all before we enjoy this wonderful food and drink."\n\nThe Prime Minister looked across the room. He caught the glance of a bemused George Jellicoe and the stiff Pauline Gower, trying not to look uncomfortable surrounded by so many men.\n\n"The challenges Britons face today are enormous. Whether it be the foreign tyrants who want to pillage our wealth," he looked at a veteran who had helped seize Cornwall, "or those well-intentioned radicals among us who would subvert our nation's newly won freedoms in the name of security." At this, he looked out the dark window and was silent for a moment.\n\n"We have prided ourselves on our capacity to endure, but the next few years will require us to do more. We must overcome the challenges we face. We must rebuild England, no matter the cost. We must reunite with those territories that have been stolen from us, no matter the burden. We must restore our Empire and do all we can to secure a Britain that is strong and free - a beacon in a world overrun by darkness."\n\nStirling looked across the room at the men around him, some of them nodding and others grim.

Oh he had to have guards, the Cabinet had been insistent on that, but they kept their distance and left the Prime Minister to enjoy his contemplation.\n\nFor as he sat on the park bench, idly listening in to the sounds of nature and the bustling city intruding upon it, David Stirling was given a rare opportunity to reflect on what he wanted to do with his life. He'd done the thing he'd set out to do all those years ago. Britain was free of the Reich, a man could walk the streets be he Jewish or gentile. A man could speak as he wished, when he wished, and to whom he wished.\n\nBritain wasn't shackled by the barbarism of fascism, or the small-minded petty thuggery of the traitor government.

Sometimes it had been difficult to go on. Working with limited resources and with the odds stacked against him was, in a way, coming home, be it in alleys and warehouses or in the halls of Parliament.\n\nThe Act had failed. He was disappointed, but not surprised.\n\nHe might be Prime Minister, but when there were so many so opposed to him, even his power was limited. He'd done his best, but the reach and influence of Claude and Alexander, along with the independent representatives with their own motivations, had been too much to overcome. He sighed.\n\nDemocracy would remain hostage for another day.\n\nHe clasped his hands behind his back as the moon shone over the city. His first attempt had failed. So be it, there would be more to come. He would ensure that Britain became a strong, independent, and disciplined nation regardless of if one Act passed or failed. He had been elected to protect and lead his nation, and that was what he would do - no matter who tried to stop him.\n\nHe would find a way to break the hold the tyrannical Young Democracy Law held over him and the nation, but with this defeat today, he realized it was going to be more difficult than he expected.

"I rather disagree Arthur, it was not our system, our people who were weak. We proved that by continuing the fight when our leaders would not." Stirling paused to take a sip of his own scotch. "It wasn't the system Arthur. It was the men in command. They led lions, but bucked and brayed when they could have found victory." Stirling eyed the office he'd taken over in disdain. "Our government needs to understand that Arthur. I need you to drill that into the heads of our generals. It will be their willingness to compromise, to surrender that will doom us should the huns come again. And one other thing." The Marshal looked up at that, seeing the determination lighting Stirling's eyes like candles.\n\n"Make plans to deal with those who seem unwilling to go all the way in the event the worst comes to pass.

He needed to write a speech or convene a cabinet meeting. He needed to get his allies together or find some scapegoat to rail against. Still, his body would not move. There was a terrible thrumming in the back of his head. He buried his face in his hands and felt a warm pressure grow behind his eyes.\n\nHow could parliament do this? How could they displace one set of tyrants and then roll out the carpet for another? So many men had died in the War. Good and brave boys had sacrificed their lives, their families' lives, to forge a Britain where democracy could thrive. What freedom could be found under the Young Democracy Law? What kind of system could arise if Britons were always living in fear of the next dictator, the next coup? Would Auchinleck and Alexander even let there be another election now that he and his party had risen up against them?\n\nStirling felt his hands slide from his slick face.

Even if those wearing it were almost to a one, strangers in her eyes.\n\nToo much of the aristocracy had fled, been slain, or been tainted by the touch of collaboration, she'd been told when the planning for the event had begun. Of the hereditary House of Lords, barely a fourth of its members could be called to attend without leaving prison cells, another country or the grave. The Bishops had shown up in force at least, and the revelation that the Archbishop of Canterbury had maintained a loyal following for her right to the throne, even in absence of her presence on British soil, had been a relief. What really intrigued her were the men who sat beside those she had expected.\n\nMen, and even a few women, standing or sitting proudly in military uniforms, many with the knife patches of Stirling's SAS. Winston, her longtime friend in exile, sitting and chatting amiably with that fanatic air force man she'd heard so much about.

Yet fate had surprised England once again, and the island collectively helds its breath, both anticipation and fear as the greatest embodiment of British fascism took office.\n\nBefore Buckingham Palace, Chesterton stood. Microphones were set before his podium, which would broadcast his words across the radio. The smug cheer on Chesterton's wrinkled face was apparent, and his wispy white hair blew in the wind as he beheld the press before him.

It is because of you that corruption, degeneracy, and treason has been soundly rejected. So let my first act as Prime Minister be to thank you.

Yet all the while, the police were either completely apathetic and allowed the Blackshirts to extralegally "punish" and assault the workers, or even outright sided with them during the crackdowns. It had become clear to all now, the Blackshirts were no longer a shadowy, fringe organisation. They were out there, and they were out for the blood of 'England's enemies', as they defined them."

 ENG_NF.5.t:0 "A Very British Purge"
 ENG_NF.5.desc:0 "The auditorium was filled with a crowd ecstatic over their electoral victory. They assumed today they were here to celebrate, as it would be the first time Chesterton had addressed the National Front since their electoral victory. Though all of them hadn't been told why they were coming, and a few noticed other odd things, like how there was no media, nor any official police protection. Instead security was handled by smartly-dressed blackshirts.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister entered the auditorium, the crowd burst into applause, Chesterton smiled and took his place behind the podium. "My friends," he began. "Today is a day of victory, we have done what all said was impossible! Britain is ours!"\n\nAnother round of applause, as Chesterton continued. "For all those who have supported me, who trusted me, I thank you," he trailed off pensively. "Unfortunately, there are some who have seen fit to act against me in our moment of triumph. I have learned of this conspiracy, and you will hear it from one who orchestrated it."\n\nHe stepped to the side, as another man walked up, his hands trembled, and his face was pale. He took the podium, facing a crowd whose atmosphere had chilled in seconds. In a slow, halting voice he began describing in detail the conspiracy against Chesterton. As each name was listed, Blackshirts moved to where they were seated, and escorted them out. Five were removed. Then ten. Then twenty. Terror gripped the audience as they realized what this was.\n\nChesterton smiled, without saying a word.\n\nMore were taken away. He did not see the first person who did it, but when one of his enemies was removed, they cheered loudly. In moments others had joined in; a frantic attempt to show their complete support to him - and as traitors were removed, one by one, the cheers only grew louder."

 ENG_NF.6.t:0 "To Bring Order"
 ENG_NF.6.desc:0 "Politics was an art, not a science, and those who were able to effectively wield power understood this fundamental truth. Politics was the utilization of charm, pressure, and influence for certain ends. It was a game of ever-shifting rules that one could either react to or write themselves, and Chesterton preferred to write the rules.\n\nOne might expect that after his victory, he would ostracize the Royal Party as they had done to him, but nothing could be farther from the truth. To punish the Royal Party was unfeasible, and more importantly, undermined a core promise he made to the British people - the restoration of Order. Order could not come about with a divided, stagnant, and gridlocked government.\n\nNo, the Royal Party would have another use.\n\nIt was why, tonight, he held a small gathering of senior and crucial representatives of the Royal Party, those who chafed under Thatcher's machinations. This secret gathering had been situated away from Thatcher's eyes and ears. Dinner and drink were served, and Chesterton weaved between the small crowd, speaking to each individually.\n\nNow, towards the end of the night, it was time to make the proposal.\n\n"I believe now that we have spoken, we align on much," Chesterton said, in a center of the attendees. "And I know that you are concerned with the direction Thatcher is taking your party. Each of you have the opportunity to change the rules, and serve with pride - not fear. So tonight I will make you a promise - support me, support Britain, and I will deliver the Royal Party into your hands."\n\nThe offer was clearly tempting to some of them, he could see. Some would politely, but he did not need all of them. He only needed enough."

 ENG_NF.7.t:0 "A Tragedy of Potential"
 ENG_NF.7.desc:0 "There were few things that were more tragic than wasted potential.\n\nMargaret Thatcher was the embodiment of wasted potential.\n\nIn some ways, Chesterton admired her. She was an excellent example of a strong woman, one who was simply not content at being relegated to the sidelines by her peers. She embodied ambition, drive, and in his estimation - would almost certainly break the strings the Royal Party was attempting to impose on her.\n\nThat was the kind of woman he wanted in the National Front. She would have made an excellent member - if not for one fatal flaw she possessed: Her alignment to reformism.\n\nIt was an eternal shame that her politics were the opposite of his. If she was just a simple representative, he would not care overmuch. But she was intelligent, and had influence - and such a person against him with those qualities would simply not do. The fact was that she was an enemy now, and it was past time she be treated as one.\n\nChesterton calmly folded up the memo he had just signed, placed it into an envelope and set it atop a small stack which would later be distributed later. A few phone calls would be made. A few people would be summoned. And soon the media would be abuzz all about Thatcher - and leave her reputation in tatters.\n\nMedia campaigns were a useful tool in this era, ones of sophistication even more so. He did not want Thatcher simply silenced - he wanted her destroyed. He felt a tinge of regret for the avalanche of hate, harassment, and anger that was about to befall the poor woman - but such was the fate of those who stood against him."

 ENG_NF.8.desc:0 "Waves splashed against the rocks, and a cool salty air blew as Chesterton stood along the cliffs of Dover, looking across the English Channel. To beyond where his eyes could see, the Black State laid. It was a crisp day, and this was a place where he believed they could speak freely. "I am certain you have each heard many rumors and accusations," he said, turning to the two men he had come to meet. "I am here to dispel this slander in person. I have no intention of harming the army, or your own positions."\n\nGerald Templer and Bernard Montgomery were in uniform, and their faces were hardened. They clearly had reservations about them, but Chesterton did not intend to solve this issue today, but lessen the tension. Both men were heroes to the English, and it required a delicate touch in dealing with them. Montgomery spoke first. "I'm less concerned about the military, Prime Minister, and if you intend on keeping the principles of liberty intact - for all Englishmen."\n\nMeaning the minorities, was the unspoken implication. "I assure you," Chesterton said. "No harm will come to those who do not threaten our nation. I have made this clear many times." Montgomery clearly did not appreciate the caveat, but bit his tongue as Templer spoke.\n\n"I want a guarantee," he said. "Directly from you, Prime Minister, that the army will not, under any circumstances, be tampered with."\n\nChesterton smiled thinly. "I already told you my intentions, Templer - or lack thereof. You have to be satisfied with my first answer."\n\nNeither man seemed particularly happy with how the conversation was going, but Chesterton was fairly certain that he had mollified them somewhat. They would likely mutter amongst themselves, but they would not do anything yet. They would remain in line, and that was all that mattered."

This rot has been caused, in no small part by the money-laundering Jew, the bloodthirsty Irishman, the treacherous Pole, and all of their co-conspirators! All of these rat-like groups plot our nation's plundering and total destruction in front of our very eyes, and we simply will not allow it!"\n\nPrime Minister Chesterton's speech in Brighton early that morning was somehow equally stoic and Icey as it was volatile and fiery. Fascists and supporters of the National Front called it the "Speech of the Century". Opponents and dissidents called it a 'madman's lunacy-filled tirade'. In particular, Harold MacMillan, chairman of United England, responded to Chesterton in a radio broadcast, calling the Prime Minister a 'Filthy, lying, degenerate mobster' with a tone of fury and sadness at the direction the country has taken.\n\nThe nation however, didn't get long to mull it all over, as later that day, Downing Street announced the official introduction of the 'Promotion of British Ideals and Culture Act'. The provisions of said act would solidify the Blackshirts position as a 'Supplementary Law-enforcement organisation', expand their arrest and policing powers drastically, and place it under the Prime Minister's de jure and de facto control.\n\nWith reports of several Jewish-owned businesses being violently attacked by NF supporters, and Blackshirt units emboldened to march right through minority neighbourhoods, many people who have become targets of increasing discrimination have begun boarding boats and planes to Ireland, Iberia, Italy and elsewhere. Underground militia groups made up of Jewish, Polish, Irish, and even Indian citizens of England have even started forming to protect themselves and their communities. It can no longer be denied that a silent war is now being waged over this Act. The Battle lines have been drawn, as both sides prepare for a Titanic Struggle."

 ENG_NF.10.t:0 "Chesterton's Triumph"
 ENG_NF.10.desc:0 "The day of voting was here.\n\nChesterton sat calmly as he watched the preparations for the vote take place, all before the only moment that would matter - the voting. Pass or fail, he would not be surprised by the outcome, and had planned what to do in each scenario.\n\nHowever, a victory was vastly preferable. Presenting such a bill as his first piece of legislation was risky, as a rejection would inherently weaken his mandate and immediate influence. Yet great men did not shrink from gambles.\n\nThe voting began, as one by one, the representatives cast their vote. Chesterton's expression didn't change from just an interested bystander, though as more votes were cast, he did not hide the smile that grew on his face. Murmurs, both excited and worried, grew louder as the voting came to a close - and it became clear what the outcome would be.\n\nThe Speaker made it official. "It is the will of this chamber that the proposed Act has passed."\n\nThe reactions were immediate. The National Front members cheered loudly, and were met with a chorus of challenge and opposition from the other parties. Anger, joy, shock, and horror filled the atmosphere, and Chesterton savored their defeat he saw on their faces and in their eyes. His own eyes found those of Thatcher and MacMillan, both of whom returned his stare with unrestrained fury and hatred.\n\nThe few Jewish representatives, who had finally been able to be elected, reacted in one of two ways. Some angrily stormed out of the House of Commons in a fury, while others sat shocked as the implications of what had happened hit them. There would be none who could deny it after today. Fascism had arrived in Britain."

The average Jewish worker began noticing their pay declining week on week, unsure at first if it was an error, or their superiors merely having it out for them, it soon dawned on them what was happening. This was the cold, sinister claws of the National Front at play, grabbing them and slowly pulling them into a dark future where their lives were inherently worth less than someone else's, on account of who they were born to.\n\nWages were far from the only thing, several families stopped receiving benefits and pensions, which weren't very high to begin with, even if their Jewish heritage was absolutely minimal. Those that challenged this rising discrimination in court were instead found guilty of sedition out of nowhere and thrown into a cell at the behest of a NF-appointed judge.\n\nIt wasn't long either those of Indian, Irish, and Polish Descent began finding themselves at the receiving end of these practices as well, many being forced out of their jobs and workplaces, their new bosses citing "Treasonous and scheming attitudes" as their cases for doing so. In the span of a few weeks, minority groups had fallen under a proverbial iron boot from which they couldn't escape, and the Blackshirts made sure of that through terrorising, brute force.\n\nMeanwhile, several state schools have begun teaching a new "Patriotic, Race History" course, forcing out Teachers opposed to its implementation, and the indoctrination caused by it has caused Jewish children to be singled out, and in several cases this last week, brutally beaten by other students.\n\nIf one hadn't been paying attention, they may have missed all of this. The warning signs were there with the pay cuts, and the slope may just be too steep to climb out from now."

The guards were attempting to push back, but they were simply overwhelmed. This had gone on long enough. It wouldn't do for the vagrants to break through the gates themselves. He calmly walked over to the phone, dialed a number, and gave a single order. "Put them down."\n\nHe set the phone down gently, and returned to the window.\n\nIt was only a few minutes later that he saw canisters fired into the crowd. Clouds of pale tear gas erupted, and from along the streets and Westminster itself marched Blackshirts to put down the protest.\n\nHe stood quietly, watching for hours as the Blackshirts ruthlessly broke the protest apart with batons, tear gas, and dogs.\n\nChesterton was under no illusions as to what it would take for his vision of Britain to be fulfiled. Montgomery, Templer, they would react poorly to this for certain. No doubt they were hatching a grand conspiracy against him, but Chesterton was unbothered. Plots, conspiracies, he knew them well, and if these inexperienced men wished to try their hand against him, then so be it.\n\nThe day turned to night, and as he saw smoke rise over the city, he retired to his bedroom, satisfied. An important step would be taken today, and while tomorrow would bring new challenges, today he was content."

In particular Harold MacMillan, without a doubt the most vocal and furious opponent of the Act, and indeed the Government in general, practically leapt out of his seat in joy upon the revealing of the results. Letting a few tears roll down his cheeks, he pulled Reginald Maudling and several of his colleagues into warm embraces, congratulating them on standing their ground. Margaret Thatcher seemed indifferent, but also appeared to revel in the chaotic scene before her in the Government benches.\n\nWhat a scene it was too. Chesterton glanced around as his own ministers and MPs jeered and howled, bellowing accusations of fraud and bribery. A couple of MPs came down and whispered into his ear, insisting a re-vote had to occur. He simply nodded along, silently, but in his mind, he was already planning ahead. A re-vote was unnecessary, detrimental to his plan even. At that moment, the Prime Minister decided it was time to play the long game.\n\nOne way or another, Thatcher and MacMillan would have the rug pulled from underneath them, this setback merely delayed that."

You sent me and the Front to Westminster to represent you. Did I not say that I would waste no time in fulfiling my promises? I did so - but was denied!"\n\nHe pointed behind him. "Today, the opposition decided to spit in the faces of all of you! They have shown that they only care about clinging to the status quo, they only care about their hatred of you. They would rather ignore democracy itself before allowing the people to claim a victory!"\n\nThe crowd was riled up now, there were angry cheers and shouts. Chesterton smiled. "But will you take this abuse lying down? Will you let them trample over your democratic rights?"\n\nThe crowd roared in the negative.\n\n"Then do not relent!" Chesterton demanded. "Make your presence known! Find them, peacefully protest - but demand that they respect democracy! Demand that they respect you! These politicians believe they are free of consequence - remind them who you are, and they will listen."\n\nChesterton had considered listing off some names of those who had voted against him, but he had an idea of how this was going to go, and the last thing he wished was to be painted as inciting violence.
