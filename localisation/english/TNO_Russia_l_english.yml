 # Far East Naval #
 far_east_naval_category: "[GetNavalDeccatName]"
 far_east_naval_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Red Navy and its ships were largely destroyed, scuttled or left to rot into scrap metal following the national collapse following the Second World War. Once anarchy gripped Siberia in the fifties, the last vestiges of the Pacific Fleet were either destroyed or reduced to piracy around Kamchatka. Now that order has finally been restored, we have the means to rebuild our navy.\n\nThe world sees Russia much like it'd regard a sunken battleship: a once mighty vessel, left to rot and decay at the bottom of an ocean. While a navy may not be the most practical investment given our circumstances, putting ships to sea will help us protect our trade, and for what it's worth it'll show the world that we've recovered from the depths we were pushed into by proving that we can fend for ourselves once more both at land, air and across the Pacific Ocean."
 RUS_FEN_recover_schematics: "Recover Soviet-Era Schematics"
 RUS_FEN_recover_schematics_desc: "Due to the anarchy, the art of advanced shipbuilding has been lost to us. Thankfully, with the administrative facilities of Irkutsk and the ports of Magadan and Kamchatka under our control, we'll be able to start building the kind of ships utilized by the USSR during the Second World War."
 RUS_FEN_fleet_modernization: "Begin Fleet Modernization"

 RUS_FEN_heavy_ship_program_desc: "With the wealth of Siberia to fuel our ambitions to reclaim the seas, we can now start our efforts to begin heavy ship production. Truly, being able to put a relatively modern flagship of our fleet to sea will prove to the world how far Russia has come in her efforts to recover from the anarchy!"
 RUS_FEN_naval_program: "Naval Rearmament Program"
 RUS_FEN_naval_program_Desc: "It'll be a laborious effort to recover our strength as a seafaring nation. Be that as it may, we can divert extra resources into our naval engineering program to accelerate our shipbuilding process."
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet: "Create a State Fishing Fleet"
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_desc: "By converting a portion of our supply fleet into major shipping vessels we can make a mark in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. This would not only allow us to feed our people but would also let us complement our agricultural sector which is struggling to develop on the harsh landscape of the Russian Far East."
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleets: "Expand the State Fishing Fleet"
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleets_desc: "By converting an even larger number of supply ships for civilian use we'll be able to maintain a significant presence in our claimed nautical economic zone."

 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_1: "State Fishing Fleet"
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_1_desc: "Our newly created commercial fishing fleet is currently operative. It's not much, but at least it can provide enough food to supplement our meager Siberian agriculture with seafood from the Sea of Okhotsk."
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_2: "State Fishing Fleets"
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_2_desc: "Our commercial fishing fleets have increased in size and productivity, allowing us to better feed our people and maintain our nautical economic zone in the North Pacific."
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_3: "State Fishing Armada"
 RUS_FEN_state_fishing_fleet_3_desc: "Our industrial fishing fleets can even rival the Japanese and the American ones operating in the North Pacific when it comes to productivity. With so much seafood being fished, no one in Siberia will be left hungry."

 far_east_sakha_category: "The Sakha Expedition"
 far_east_sakha_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its inhospitable nature, the northern parts of Siberia hold great amounts of untapped resources, particularly minerals. Soviet geologists expected to unearth these riches and vast labor forces were deployed as part of the Siberian Plan to make this a reality. The project was stopped due to the outbreak of the Second World War and only the husk of the old project remains. Now that our legitimate Russian government has restored order in the region, we're able to resume the program and build upon the foundations that were left behind for us.\n\nIt'll be a long and difficult task, but if we're successful the vast riches and strategic infrastructure we'll gain from the project will prove vital in our efforts to reunite Russia."
 RUS_Sakha_Begin_Expedition: "Begin the Sakha Expedition"
 RUS_Sakha_Begin_Expedition_desc: "The first step of the journey is to restore the roads and railway connections built in the thirties back into acceptable condition. To achieve this we'll deploy military engineers into the region and have them do the heavy lifting so that our civilian experts can safely travel and work within the area."
 RUS_Sakha_Begin_Drilling: "Begin Drilling"
 RUS_Sakha_Begin_Drilling_desc: "With the basic infrastructure operational again, we can initiate our search for ore clusters. Although we still have the old Soviet maps and infrastructure, our geologists expect a slow process with meager results at first until we manage to find larger mineral reserves and set up modern mining infrastructure around them."
 RUS_Sakha_Extend_Roads: "Extend the Roads"
 RUS_Sakha_Extend_Roads_desc: "In order to reach more potentially profitable ore clusters, we'll need to expand the road networks in the Sakha region. This time, we'll need to make use of our regular labor force as well as heavy machinery to make headway into the region."
 RUS_Sakha_Mir_Excavation: "The Mir Excavation"
 RUS_Sakha_Mir_Excavation_desc: "It'd seem that the more pessimistic geologists were correct so far as few minerals are within our reach. A significant amount of the valuable ores are located so far north and in conditions that are so inhospitable that it makes any kind of mining operations impossible. However, we have found areas where §Ddiamonds§! fit for industrial use can be excavated in large enough quantities to be somewhat profitable. By bringing in more equipment, the Mirny mine ought to be fully operational within half a year."
 RUS_Udachnaya_Excavation: "The Udachnaya Excavation"
 RUS_Udachnaya_Excavation_desc: "Although it'll be hard to turn a profit with our current equipment, the discovery of yet another §Ddiamond pipe§! outside of the Arctic Circle has made it obvious that it's at the very least a worthwhile long-term investment. Setting up a permanent presence in the area, we'll begin the long process of turning these fields into proper pit mines for large-scale excavation. To facilitate this, large state funds will be invested to improve the old Soviet railroads in the region to help with the transportation of goods to and from these new industrial centers.\nWith that, we can consider the Sakha Expedition to have been a costly success, but a success nonetheless that will pay off in the long term."
 RUS_Fortify_Tura: "Fortify Tura"
 RUS_Fortify_Tura_desc: "With the possibility of conflict with our western neighbor, we must be vigilant and prepare for the worst. Given our geographical disadvantages, there is a high risk that a potential enemy could punch through our northern flank and seize our strategic mines and cripple our economy.\n\nTo counteract this vulnerability, our generals have proposed turning the small town of Tura into a national strategic fortification and relocate its inhabitants further east. By doing so, we'd gain a strong defensive position near the border that would serve as an excellent defensive position if we're caught off-guard in a war in the west."

Without any functioning body with the resources to maintain the old Soviet facilities, the riches of Norilsk have been laying dormant for a decade, beyond the reach of any of the Russian warlords that laid claim to the lands.\n\nNow that some manner of stability has returned to the region, the new government has set out to reclaim the region and restore it to its former economic potential. If successful, the riches of Norilsk will go a great way towards our efforts to reunite and rebuild Russia."
 RUS_Norilsk_Reconnect_Roads: "Reconnect the Roads"
 RUS_Norilsk_Reconnect_Roads_desc: "The area surrounding the region's mineral deposits are in tatters. A decade of neglect has left the roads in complete disrepair and most of the facilities they used to lead to are derelict at best and utterly dilapidated at worst. Before we can bring in machinery to properly restore these, we've made plans to send out a force of military engineers to restore the main road links to working conditions once more."
 RUS_Norilsk_Restore_Infrastructure: "Restore the Soviet Infrastructure"

 RUS_Norilsk_Rebuild_Rail_Links: "Connect Norilsk to the Yenisey"
 RUS_Norilsk_Rebuild_Rail_Links_desc: "Transporting material from Norilsk to our industrial and commercial centers in the south has been a difficult endeavor. The permafrost has made the establishment of roads and railways difficult to say the least, but there is another venue. By having our men reclaim Dudinka and reconnect it with the old Soviet railway built as part of the Siberian Plan in the thirties, we can use the Yenisey River to once again ferry products to more hospitable destinations downstream."

 RUS_Norilsk_Fortify_Sibgrad_desc: "Originally built to be a mining city based on flawed geological studies in the thirties, the planned city of Sibgrad has been largely abandoned since the thirties with only its foundations remaining. With the possibility of conflict with our eastern neighbor, it'd be irresponsible for us to leave our northern front unguarded. Due to its strategic location, turning Sibgrad into a proper military installation would solve the problem with our northern front being difficult to defend in the event of a war."

 RUS_Worsening_moral_2_desc: "Our soldiers are growing increasingly unhappy with the system of promissory payment imposed.

 RUS_RWS_nukes_establish_closed_facilities_desc: "Just as we are desperate to unlock the secrets of the atom, our enemies are equally desperate to prevent us from doing so. Although there are many ways to increase security, very few are absolute, and absolute security is necessary when the stakes are so high.\n\nWe will therefore sequester our entire nuclear program - laboratories, enrichment facilities, reactors, and production lines - in closed cities.

 RUS_RWS_nukes_a_foundation_for_research_desc: "More than twenty years of civil war has, among many other things, all but destroyed the educational infrastructure of the nation, and led to the emigration or death of most competent scientists and physicists.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of continuing and completing our nuclear program, we must address this. We cannot wait for skilled scientists to make themselves known or return from afar, or for advanced institutes to be reclaimed.

 RUS_RWS_nukes_expand_the_dalur_mines_desc: "Our efforts to locate additional sources of uranium domestically have borne fruit. Just east of the Urals, near the city of Kurgan, surveyors are claiming to have found a massive deposit of uranium ready for exploitation.\n\nIn order to secure the deposit, an entire mining operation, and the infrastructure surrounding it, will have to be built from scratch. The effort required will be enormous, and the cost even greater, but such is irrelevant - we must have that uranium!"

 RUS_RWS_nukes_source_foreign_materials_desc: "If we cannot find enough uranium to support our program domestically, we shall have to look farther afield. Agents, legal and otherwise, will be dispatched across the world to research and investigate both known and rumored uranium deposits.\n\nWhether we must buy the material, trade for it, or steal it, we will acquire it. The program must continue, and a bomb cares little for where the material inside it comes from."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_chasing_the_sun_desc: "Although it will be a long time before we have an operational nuclear weapon, we have successfully built the infrastructure necessary to ensure that we eventually will.\n\nOur laboratories and research facilities are constructed and secured. Our educational institutions are turning out scientists with the necessary skills. Our agencies have secured both domestic and foreign sources of fissile material. All that is left is time.\n\nWhen that day comes, and we complete our first nuclear test, we can take pride both in our accomplishments, and in the knowledge that [GetRussiaNameNuke] will, at long, long last, be free of outside interference."

 RUS_terror_bombing_desc: "With depressing regularity, Luftwaffe bombers from the airfields of Reichskommissariat Moskowien fly over the warlord states of western Russia, bombing everything they can see and severely affecting nearly every aspect of Russian life as a result. The only salvation comes in the form of the Free Aviators, who strive to intercept them at every opportunity. If not for them, the situation in Russia would be far more dire."

 CEN_SIB_the_flight_east: "The Flight East"
 CEN_SIB_the_flight_east_desc: "Though the West Russian War ended almost a decade ago, Western Russia has never known peace with the Germans. Instead, life has been punctuated by regular bombings from the Luftwaffe, an unending campaign of terror meant to permanently hobble a one-time adversary.\n\nThough many Russians have found ways to live amid this violence, others have tried to escape it by fleeing east. This steady stream of refugees has permanently altered the distribution of Russia's population, with many migrating to the far reaches of the country that remain untouched by the Nazi war machine."

 RUS_heirs_of_harbin: "Heirs of Harbin"
 RUS_heirs_of_harbin_desc: "In the aftermath of the Russian Civil War, the remainder of the White Army retreated into Harbin as exiles, nursing their wounds and plotting the overthrow of the Soviet Union. Before long, however, fascism coalesced within the city. Under the leadership of Rodzaevsky and Matkovsky, the Russian Fascist Party (RFP) soon became the premier party of the Russian émigrés. As the Union collapsed, the Whites and the RFP formed a united front against the Bolsheviks and for a time, they were successful - until infighting split them apart. Now the three splinters vie for power, each claiming to be the rightful heir of Harbin."
 RUS_the_true_heir_of_harbin: "The True Heir of Harbin"
 RUS_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc: "With the end of turmoil in the Russian Far East, one faction emerged victorious, becoming the leading front for White Russian émigrés by defeating the splitters and the Bolsheviks. After initial success in the Siberian campaign, the Harbin exiles found themselves stranded in a foreign land, and what little united them disappeared revealing deep-seated divisions between tsarists, hardline fascists, and corporatists. Now that every other contender for Russian dominance in the region has been defeated, this faction can proudly claim the mantle of the only true heir of Harbin."
 RUS_shattered_ambitions: "Shattered Ambitions"
 RUS_shattered_ambitions_desc: "Once again, the Russians have tried to unify, and once again, foreign powers have beaten them back down. Some of the warlords have been able to regain control over their fiefdoms, but they rule over a people who have been broken in both body and spirit. It will take decades before they come close to reaching their past might."

 RUS_far_east_war: "The Far Eastern Front"
 RUS_far_east_war_desc: "The Far East has been set aflame, as the different warlord factions battle for dominance over the region and its peoples. Radically divergent ideologies battle for supremacy. However, this war will not be an easy one. Ever since the Russo-Japanese War, the region's Arctic territories have been notoriously difficult to control. The different factions will have to navigate weak infrastructure, stretched supply lines, and expansive wilderness in order to claim victory."

 RUS_increased_factory_output_desc: "Thanks to our efforts, our factories have seen an increased output of goods. This will be crucial to the wars ocurring, the wars ahead, and our chances of unifying the region."

 RUS_savy_army: "Savy Army"
 RUS_savy_army_desc: "Despite all the challenges presented, the state's military has accomplished what many thought impossible: significantly reducing its operating costs while maintaining their current levels of professionalism and effectiveness. A remarkable accomplishment indeed, and one which will serve the state well as it expands and encounters other requirements on resources."
 RUS_promisory_notes_system: "Promissory Notes System"
 RUS_promisory_notes_system_desc: "To maintain the state of the military while the state expands, the promissory note system, whereby soldiers are 'paid' in a created currency to be later redeemed once our economy is on a better footing, has been introduced. For now, at least, it will allow the state to continue its campaigns of expansion.\n\n§RBut if the debt cannot be paid back within a reasonable period of time, there will be serious repercussions.§!"
 RUS_expanded_promisory_notes_system: "Expanded Promissory Notes System"
 RUS_expanded_promisory_notes_system_desc: "Contrary to the state's promises of years past, the promissory note system for military payment has not yet been discontinued. Notes earlier issued have not yet been exchanged. Murmurs among the soldiery are growing louder, and discontent is spreading rapidly.\n\n§RThis is not good.§!"

 POLITICS_NO_AUTHORITY_SIBERIA_DESC: "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."

 RUS_remove_wonders_tt: "The §Yspecial effects§! of all §Ywonders§! shall be removed."
 RUS_gorky_tank_factory: "The Krasnoye Sormovo Factory"

So secured, its assembly lines can be turned to the rapid expansion, and improvement, of the state's armored formations."
 RUS_syktyvkar_arsenal: "The Syktyvkar Arsenal"
 RUS_syktyvkar_arsenal_desc: "Beneath the city of Syktyvkar lies a practical treasure trove of Soviet technology and weaponry. Vats and canisters of lethal 'revenge weapons' were stored here before the Front collapsed, and they have found new usage amongst the defenders of the Republic. The gas is potent, and the ability to scorch the lands of our enemies is an effective tool, but those who control the arsenal wield a disproportionate amount of influence."
 RUS_the_izhevsk_arsenal: "The Izhevsk Mechanical Plant"
 RUS_the_izhevsk_arsenal_desc: "Izhevsk has a long and proud history of being the center of gun production for the needs of the Motherland. Tracing its history back to 1807, when it was first founded by the orders of Emperor Alexander I, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant had become the main firearm manufacturer for the Red Army during the war years, producing millions and millions of rifles of every kind. The enterprise was reorganized and reconstructed by prosperous gunsmith Mikhail Kalashnikov for the West Russian Revolutionary Front during its revanché against Germany, but the advance of the Tsarist cohort under Emperor Vladimir III forced the factory personnel to flee to Siberia, leaving the mechanical plant at the disposal of the Imperial Crown.\n\nDespite the damage it endured through the years of constant conflicts of West Russia, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant remains one of the biggest arms manufacturing facilities in the Russian lands and provides superiority in firearms to any petty king in Russia who owns it."
 RUS_vorkuta_gulags: "The Vorkuta Gulags"
 RUS_vorkuta_gulags_desc: "For many years, the Soviet Union sent its most dangerous prisoners, criminal and political both, by the thousands to Vorkuta, where they were put to work to the state's benefit. With control of the gulags secured, the state now has access to that resource, and can exploit it for work crews and conscripts alike."
 RUS_ural_automotive_plant: "The Ural Automotive Plant"
 RUS_ural_automotive_plant_desc: "The Ural Automotive Plant is one of the largest factory complexes in Central Siberia, turning out vehicles, civilian and military, by the tens of thousands.

 RUS_krasnoyarsk_railway_junction: "The Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction"
 RUS_krasnoyarsk_railway_junction_desc: "Easily one of the most strategic positions on the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Krasnoyarsk Junction facilitates strategic rail movement in many directions. Control of the junction ensures the rapid transportation of materiel and other war supplies, and permits the same for civilian construction materials as well."
 RUS_kuznetsk_basin: "The Kuznetsk Basin"
 RUS_kuznetsk_basin_desc: "One of the largest deposits of coal in the world, the Kuznetsk basin provides enormous quantities of raw materials to those capable of exploiting it. Control of the basin will both ensure the security of the state's energy supply, and through utilization of the extractive expertise condensed within it, improve the efficiency of other mining operations."
 RUS_novosibirsk_aircraft_plant: "The Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant"
 RUS_novosibirsk_aircraft_plant_desc: "A major producer of both complete aircraft as well as their constituent parts, Novosibirsk and its aircraft plants are capable of rapidly producing a considerable air fleet.

 RUS_port_of_magadan_desc: "One of the most important port cities in Siberia, Magadan is well-known as a gateway into the region for all the countries of the world, and possesses considerable shipbuilding facilities besides. Control of the port ensures that ship construction will be completed in rapid fashion."
 RUS_irkutsk_hydro_station: "Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station"
 RUS_irkutsk_hydro_station_desc: "The largest hydroelectric power station in Siberia, the dam straddling the Angara River provides vast, and unending, amounts of electricity. Control of the power station promises significant industrial reward, and the engineering expertise involved in its construction can be further studied, accelerating other constructive pursuits of the state."
 RUS_cheryomushki: "Cheryomushki Airbase"
 RUS_cheryomushki_desc: "Standing among the largest aerodromes in the Far East, Cheryomushki's long runways and extensive hangar facilities allow for the concentration of large aerial fleets. Control of the aerodrome will permit the state to more easily establish air superiority over its enemies, as well as by its very size assist in preventing accidents on takeoff and landing."

 RUS_lenin_embalmed: "Lenin's Mausoleum"
 RUS_lenin_embalmed_desc: "The father of the Revolution, Vladimir Illich Lenin, was preserved by his successor upon his death so that all might remember who liberated us from the tyranny of bourgeois rule.

Possession of his remains lends a certain legitimacy to our government in the eyes of the people."

 RUS_magnitogorsk_research_division_desc: "The research conducted under the guidance of the madman Lysenko may have been of questionable utility, but his cadre of scientists from the old Soviet intelligentsia were nothing if not brilliant. With the aid of the Research Bureau our R&D capabilities will be increased tenfold. Though it is perhaps for the best not to ask them what went on within the deep places of the Black Mountain."

 RUS_wealth_of_orenburg: "The Wealth of Orenburg"
 RUS_wealth_of_orenburg_desc: "The integration of Orenburg has brought with it a wealth almost unheard of in the Russian Anarchy. The city and its environs have remained almost entirely untouched in the years since the Great Patriotic War. Its status as the Jewel of the Southern Urals has led to an increase in its prosperity where the rest of Russia has felt only devastation. The wealth gained from Orenburg will be crucial in the recovery of Russia as a whole."

 RUS_ural_guard_training: "Ural Guard Training"
 RUS_ural_guard_training_desc: "The Ural League has some of the most battle-hardened soldiers in Russia, having survived decades of bloodshed and proving their worth against warlords, bandits, German deserters, and NKVD divisions. That valuable experience is now put at our service by incorporating their veterans in our armies. Our units are now being commanded by some of the most experienced men in the Russian way of war."

 RUS_NKVD_security_training: "NKVD Security Training"
 RUS_NKVD_security_training_desc: "Bunkov's NKVD division stationed in Magnitogorsk has ruled that land from the shadows with an iron fist, keeping first Lysenko and then themselves in power against all odds.

###Far East economic decisions###

 far_east_dev_category: "Developing the Far-East"
 far_east_dev_category_desc: "The territory of the Russian Far-East is a very precarious one. Its land is very barren compared to our neighbors to the west that has been feeding off the fruits of Bukharin's Siberian Plan. To be able to combat this future threat, as well as to better the lifes of our citizens, and to improve our national economy, we have to work these barren fields and exploit it of its precious untapped resources hidden beneath the land.\n\nAside from the potential resources to be extracted from the land, our position in the Far East grants us another boon. The port of Magadan is the only free port that supplies us with a vital trade and commerce line. With this, our economy is practically waiting to boom. We just have to start."
 expand_Kolyma: "Expand the Kolyma Road"
 expand_Kolyma_desc: "The Kolyma road stretches through the Russian Far East, connecting the vital port city of Magadan to the west. This road is a very vital stretch that helps us project power to the west, as well as allowing people to travel in the meanwhile. At its current state, the Kolyma road will not be able to sustain the constant flow of traffic and army men travelling. And so, we have decided to expand the Kolyma road to accomodate our ever increasing need of proper infrastructure across the far east."

 expand_Petropavlovsk: "Expand Petropavlovsk"
 expand_Petropavlovsk_desc: "Petropavlovsk is a bad trade port, no sugarcoating it. At hundred of kilometers of the nearest important population center, thousand of the future frontlines, it seems but a frozen white elephant. Nonetheless, it sits right next to the Americans, and expanding it could create interest among them to supply us and, perhaps, trade with us, while alleviating slightly the pressure on Magadan."
 expand_Irkutsk: "Attract Foreign Companies to Irkutsk"
 expand_Irkutsk_desc: "As one of the most populous parts of our region, Irkutsk, to the foreign investors, may seem like a strategic place to expand their activities and try to tap into the Russian market. We will not dissuade them, so long as we can make our nation benefit from their presence."
 khabarovsk_special_zone: "Ask for the Creation of a Khabarovsk Special Economic Zone"
 khabarovsk_special_zone_desc: "While Japan gave us all our legitimate land on the Amur, there are still plenty of Russians left in Manchuria, namely in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. With Vladivostok distant and under firm japanese control, Khabarovsk has never been really connected to the Manchurian industrial complex and its Russian population has proved complicated to deal with it for its Manchurian owner. We could ask to open branch for our company in Khabarovsk so as to fully use the potential of the city, while seeping our tendril in the local population and spread the word of the Vozhd."
 repair_railway_to_mck: "Repair the Russo-Manchurian Railway"
 repair_railway_to_mck_desc: "Even before the grand catastrophe that struck the Motherland, the old imperial track had fallen mostly in disrepair. With the total lack of interest of its former Manchurian owner, the connection to the Amur and back to the main Manchurian rail lines has never been repaired. We could step in, so to fix and make trade with Manchuria and the Sphere easier, and less reliant on Magadan."
 ice_breaker_Okhotsk_sea: "Icebreaker on the Okhotsk sea"
 ice_breaker_Okhotsk_sea_desc: "The lack of regular liaison between Magadan and Petropavlovsk is preventing us from increasing trade further. The American have proposed to build some icebreakers, so that they can increase further traffic"

 transpacific_trade: "Transpacific Trade"
 transpacific_trade_desc: "The Far-East is a harsh cold barren land, where food is scarce, yet the mouths numerous. While we tether too close to famine to our taste, plenty of countries across the Pacific are looking for a place to export their food, but have deficient industry. We could leverage our position to sell them some coveted metals to feed their industries, in exchange of food to help our workers"
 mission_to_siberia: "Mission to Central Siberia"
 mission_to_siberia_desc: "The chaos after the Siberian War destroyed communications between the Far East and Central Siberia. With the situation seemingly consolidating again, and us being their closest access to the outside world, we could attempt to make contact with them, and see what kind of deal we could make."
 open_to_siberia: "Open up to Central Siberia"
 open_to_siberia_desc: "The [CSB.getAdjective] have favorabily received our mission, and showed interest into opening a special connection between us: they seem eager to cut a deal with us so that they're allowed to operate on our railways with a quota of train, in order for their product to then reach Magadan, with minimal duty. This would improve trade, improve our income and, most of all, improve our relation with our very important neighbour."
 special_pipeline: "The Special Pipeline"
 special_pipeline_desc: "Our mission to [CSB.getName] has not bore result. We found only an ennemy across the border. Nonetheless, we're both in a dire situation: them looking for a way out of Russia for their merchandise and their grand industry born from the Siberian Plan, and us looking at anything that would allow us more income, more industry. We could try to cut a special deal with them, as to allow their trains to go to Magadan, the only free Russian port, and then to the world at large, but for a hefty price and for some of their foodstuff.\n\nWe know that such a deal will only last for so long, but it can give us the edge needed to soon be a contender against the [CSB.getAdjective]."

This temporary embarassment hides however a superb opportunity: always hungry for more material, more metal, the manchurians have proven expert at clawing resources out of the earth and turn it into money. Quite a nice ability for our oh so starved for money country."

 ### Far-East Repop Decisions ###
 RUS_FE_repopulation_decisions: "The Manpower Issue"
 RUS_FE_repopulation_decisions_desc: "[GetSibManpowerDescription]\n\n[GetSibRepopText]\n\n[GetSibImmigrationText]"
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_decision_desc: "War, mismanagement and the disease of §RBolshevism§! have left our beloved Russia in a dire situation. The Tsars and Tsarinas had no interest in the well-being of her people, and the malevolent §RJews§! managing the §RUnholy Union§! only saw our Motherland as a tool for their nefarious schemes. It is therefore a key policy of the RFP to encourage not only to §Mbring more Russians home to help rebuild our Motherland§!, but also that every Russian woman does her utmost to §nbring more Russians into this world§!. Thanks to the recent victories of our movement, however, we're finally in a position to remedy these historical errors and heal Russia's demographic situation."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_decision_desc: "The years have not been kind to Russia. The brutality of the Tsars was followed up with the terror of the §RRed menace§!, the same destructive force that drove our beloved motherland into the ground and allowed the nation's greatest cities to be occupied by Germany. However, all is not lost, and with our portion of Siberia united under our rule we have to do our utmost to solve this demographic crisis to bring Russia back to her feet again. With the port of Magadan firmly under our control we can §Mcontinue to attract Russian émigrés to return home through the port of Magadan§!, and thanks to our improved farm yields from reclaiming the arable lands in Amur from our old "friend" Rodzaevsky we can afford to sustain state policies to §nencourage Russian families to have more children§!."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_decision_desc: "Since the demise of the Romanovs, Russia has only seen hardship and despair without their §gTsar§! to guide them. Due to the defeat of the valiant §WWhite Army§! at the hand of the §RBolsheviks§!, Russia has endured a genocide that's both internal and external, seeing us robbed of lands and the people we need to sustain our state. Now however, with the rule of our blessed §gTsar§! restored in our corner of Siberia, we can take active steps to remedy this demographic catastrophe and bring Mother Russia back to her former glory. With the port of Magadan under our control we can §Mactively attract Russian émigrés to return home to help rebuild our Motherland§!, and thanks to our improved farm yields from reclaiming the arable lands in Amur we can ensure enough food production to justify establishing active state policies to §nencourage Russian families to have more children§!."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_decision_desc: "Despite the temporary setbacks suffered since the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has managed to restore Soviet order and control in the revolting areas of eastern Siberia. While most of the technical difficulties we face can be solved by the NKVD, the same cannot be said about the demographic situation of Siberia. Due to inadequate planning by the previous administration, we currently face a labor shortage that, if allowed to persist, will degrade our chances of achieving our long-term economic and military objectives. With the foresight of the Soviet state, we've §nencouraged Soviet women to have more children§! since 1944. Though scaled back since the relocation of our government to Irkutsk and the reduction in available resources that entailed, the reclamation of the Soviet Far East is allowing us to expand the programs beyond the scope implemented two decades ago. Furthermore, with the legitimate Soviet government once more in control of the last functioning port in the Union we can §Mbegin to bring home temporarily resettled Soviet citizens§! from abroad by having our Agitprop department encourage returnees, while our economists work on calculating the ideal level of compensation involved in this process."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_decision_desc: "Russia's history has been one tragedy followed by another tragedy. For centuries, the people lived under the yoke of the Tsar who saw them as nothing more than beasts of burden for their own exploitative regime. §RLenin§! tried to offer the people a respite from this historical trend, only to be hindered by the §WWhite Army§! and for his legacy to be stalled by the factionalism that followed in the civil war. Many thought that the hope was going to be snuffed out for good when the §RGreat Patriotic War§! ended in a victory for the §gfascists§!, but we've proven them wrong. The tyrants on both the left and the right have been driven out of our corner of Siberia, and now we have a chance to rebuild our Union. However, years of war and the rampant neglect of the plight of the people has resulted in a demographic catastrophe that we need to take steps to remedy if we're ever going to succeed with our §Rrevolution§!. With the only functional ports in Russia firmly under our control we can §Mbegin to bring home Soviet émigrés§!, and thanks to our improved farm yields from reclaiming the arable lands in Amur we should have the relative food surplus needed to establish state policies to §nencourage Soviet women to have more children§!, though we may need to compromise on our ideals to do so."
 
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_0: "Our §nnascent repopulation program§! was initiated as one of the first policies of the RFP when we established ourselves in Amur. As our home region is blessed with the best arable lands in the Russian Far East, we're in a unique position to be able to sustain this ambitious effort to bring the Motherland back on its feet. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong political encouragement§! and §Jstate food rations§! for families that raise several children and maintain good morals, which is expected to increase births by §n5%§!. With all the resources of the Far East at our disposal, our Ministry of Food and Agriculture predicts that we're in a position to expand the program. By providing greater social benefits to families that raise an even larger amount of children and more actively use the state's media apparatus to motivate our citizens in this endeavor, we should see a steady increase in births throughout our territories."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_1: "Our §nrepopulation program§! was initiated as one of the first policies of the RFP when we established ourselves in Amur and our efforts to increase births have increased since then. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong financial incentives§! and §Jstate recognition§! for families that raise additional children and maintain good morals, which alongside a §Jpropaganda push§! is expected to increase births by §n20%§!. Our analysts believe that we can boost this number even further through increased support for widows and widowers."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_1_tt: "By giving increased financial incentives to married Russian couples for each additional child they have after their fourth, we should see an increase in births within our territory as well as an increase in healthy marriages and stable households. Furthermore, we'll recognize the mothers who have displayed exemplary maternal instincts by performing their patriotic duty to bring a fifth Russian child into this world with an official state award: the §fCross of Honor of the Russian Mother§!."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_2: "Our §nextended repopulation program§! was initiated as one of the first policies of the RFP when we established ourselves in Amur and since then we've gone from strength to strength in our efforts to increase our population. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong financial incentives§! and §Jstate recognition§! for families that raise additional children and maintain good morals as well as §Jincreased state support for widows§!. Combined with an even more §Jintensive propaganda campaign§!, these efforts are expected to increase births by §n35%§!. Our analysts believe that we've exhausted our options for increasing this number further."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_2_tt: "There are many unfortunate barriers to increasing our birth rate such as the number of families destroyed by the ravages of war and the lingering subversions of §RBolsheviks§! that want women to stray away from their feminine duties. By having the state assist widows who apply for a state program to find suitable husbands and give them further state financial support we should see an increase in stable, functional family units within our territories. Furthermore, an additional class to the §fCross of Honor of the Russian Mother§! will be introduced for patriotic Russian women who give birth to an eighth child and subsidize household loans for parents that raise a large number of children."
 
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_0: "§MWe currently lack an organized all-Russian remigration program§!. Due to the relentless blackwashing of our virtuous movement by the bitter enemies of Russia both from within and outside her borders, it will be very difficult to organize a serious effort to bring more Russian émigrés back to our Motherland. Our Ministry of Public Enlightenment believes that in order to remedy this more permanently, we'll need to offer people a very compelling deal in order to overcome this. Based on the numbers provided by our Labor Ministry, however, the recent surge in vacant homes due to our §dlabor relocation programs§! could allow for an affordable approach to this situation that would also allow us to Russify some of the rebellious native Siberian provinces by offering returning Russian patriots cheap lots of land and work opportunities in Yakutsk."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_1: "We're currently maintaining an §Mactive remigration program§!. We're attracting Russian émigrés with cheap lots of land and apartments in Yakutsk and the surrounding areas that were confiscated from various Yakut rebels and traitors to the Motherland. Efforts have been made to make sure that those resettling in Russia will receive special care and treatment to better allow for them to reintegrate into our All-Russian State after spending their lives abroad. §WAlexander Bolotov§! assures us that his men will keep a subtle watch on these communities and that any correspondence with their adoptive homeland remains positive. With time, we hope that this will improve our image with the Russian émigré community."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "With the number of vacancies made available after our suppression of the Yakut resistance to our state, we should distribute these homes to patriotic Russians living abroad. Any person of Russian birth may apply for a heavily subsidized lot of land in Yakutia, provided they pass our mandatory screening process for subversive activities. In order to improve our image abroad, those who manage to resettle in Yakutia will receive special treatment. As a sign of our appreciation for their willingness to help with the reconstruction of Russia, the relocated Yakut will be compensated by having their labor brigade sentences for treason reduced to a mere seven year period."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpanded remigration program§!. While giving patriotic Russians heavily subsidized land deals, we're making an active push to bring home those that have gained industrial labor experience abroad with extra well-paying jobs. §WAlexander Bolotov§! and his men remain active in their efforts to keep an eye on this returning community, which is putting a strain on our security services. While we'd hope to expand this program in the future, we believe that we've reached the maximum potential for our program until national reunification has been achieved."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "With our efforts to repopulate Yakutsk being somewhat successful, we can now expand our efforts to bring home more Russian émigrés. Spreading our message far and wide, we'll move to encourage Russians living in Europe, the Americas and beyond to return home, offering them heavily subsidized land and good-paying jobs in the mining sector. It's still an uphill struggle to encourage émigrés to return, but with the right carrots dangled in front of them, we hope that they will see reason and return to help rebuild our Motherland"
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_3: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpanded remigration program§!. While giving patriotic Russians heavily subsidized land deals, we're making an active push to bring home those that have gained industrial labor experience abroad with extra well-paying jobs. On top of this, we're also operating an §MAll-Russian repatriation program§! aimed at resettling the many thousands of Russians still living in Manchuria with their Motherland, allowing them to gradually phase out parts of our corrective labor force. Despite the many difficulties faced in our endeavors to bring home the lost sons and daughters of Russia, we can finally claim that our program has been as successful as we can ever hope it'll be, and that we've exhausted our options for further expansions."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "To our south lies vast expanses of Russian lands that have been under the jurisdiction of the Manchu since the final collapse of the §RUnholy Union§!. While our §WVozhd Konstantin Rodzaevsky§! hopes that the entire region will be reunited with Russia eventually, in the short term we might have to settle for using our leverage with the local authorities to organize a repatriation program aimed at the thousands of Russians still living under the Manchurian government. This will be a costly endeavor, however. Politically, it'd entail negotiations and us sacrificing some of our leverage for reclaiming the region in the future. Economically, there's the obvious cost of resettling tens of thousands of people in a very short span of time and finding work for them, something that can only be done by redistributing the assets of former members of our prison labor force and slowly work on giving them gainful employment in sectors where we currently rely on corrective labor units"

 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_0: "Currently, §nwe do not operate an active repopulation program§!, having abandoned that policy of the RFP after establishing ourselves in the less arable areas of Magadan. By introducing increased benefits for families to form and raise children, we should be able to increase our population growth."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_1: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has been introduced and is starting to bear results. Currently, the program consists of §Jfinancial incentives§! and §Jstate recognition§! of parents that raise several healthy children. Put together, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n10%§!. Our analysts believe that we can boost this number even further by increasing the program's scope and benefits"
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_1_tt: "We'll initiate our efforts to increase our population by giving financial incentives to couples to marry and have additional children. Furthermore, we'll introduce an official state order in recognition of their efforts to their Motherland by raising a large and healthy family: the §JOrder of Parental Glory§!"
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_2: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has been expanded and is yielding good results.

 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_2_tt: "We'll escalate our efforts to increase our population by giving additional financial incentives for couples to marry and have additional children. Furthermore, we'll introduce a second class to the §JOrder of Parental Glory§! to be awarded to families that showed exceptional devotion to the state by bringing at least eight healthy children into this world"
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_3: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has reached the peak of what our economy and agriculture can sustain and is yielding very good results. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong financial incentives, a major propaganda campaign§!, and official §Jstate honors and benefits§! for parents that raise a large number of healthy children. Put together, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n35%§!. We've done our utmost to remedy our Motherland's demographic situation, and can only pray that it's enough"
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_repop_3_tt: "The Vozhd wishes to see more Russian children brought into this world. We'll escalate our efforts to increase our population by giving further financial incentives to families as well as applying extra taxes to the unmarried and childless to nudge them towards fulfilling their patriotic duty towards their Motherland. Furthermore, we'll initiate a forceful propaganda campaign as well as increasing state benefits to recipients of the §JOrder of Parental Glory§!."

 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_0: "§MWe currently operate a nascent organized remigration effort§!. Thanks to possessing the only good port in Russia and establishing a working relationship with the OFN and to some extent the Russian émigré community we've been able to bring back some of the more adventurous patriots for a while now. Our exports believe that now that the Far East is firmly under our control, we should be able to put together a program that more actively encourages Russians living abroad to return home to rebuild their Motherland."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_1: "We're currently maintaining an §Mactive remigration program§!. The program is already bearing fruit with a steady stream of émigrés returning every month thanks to our coordinated efforts to bring them home as well as our reach to the §QOFN§!. We're currently looking into expanding our reach, both through our port capacity as well as by allowing Radio Free Magadan to make special broadcasts to abroad in numerous languages."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "With the expertise we've built up through our prolonged control of the port of Magadan, we can expand our remigration program with relative ease. Doing so would allow us to actively bring home Russians living abroad more actively by having our foreign office distribute information to Russians émigrés about the benefits of returning to home to the true Russian state. Furthermore, financial incentives will be given to encourage them to return to us. Costly though it may be, the fact that most of them are better off than we are here in Siberia should see an injection of money into our economy."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpansive remigration program§! as well as utilizing §Mshortwave radio transmissions§! to reach more Russians living abroad. Though there's room for further expansions, the party isn't fully unified on the matter as the party's old guard prefers to focus on Russian émigrés, an endeavor that has currently reached its plateau. On the other hand, only the reformists advocate for an effort to increase the scope of our efforts, and would need to have a majority control of the party to push their agenda through."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "We'll increase the funding for our program and actively seek out Russians with experience in bureaucratic lines of work by giving them extra incentives to return home to their Motherland. In addition to our physical programs, we'll make use of §ORadio Free Magadan§! to reach out to foreign markets via shortwave radio broadcasts in multiple languages to try and reach more Russians living abroad."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_3: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpanded remigration program with eased travel from the §QOFN§! bloc to our state§!, bolstered with §Mactive international shortwave radio broadcasts§! from Magadan. With a steady stream of emigrants returning to the Imperial realm of Russia on top of a healthy trickle of adventurous souls from the Americas to our lands, we've achieved the maximum potential for what our program can realize by letting a substantial number of Russia's lost sons and daughters find their way back home again."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "With the §sreformists under Petlin§! firm control over our Russian state, we can finally open up to the OFN, allowing for easier travel from the Americas in general and OFN-leaning nations in particular to us, easing the process for émigrés to return as well as granting new opportunities to people from Europe and the Americas that seek a new life, adventure or a return to conservative order in the Russian Far East. Along with this reform, we'll also expand the quality and reach of Radio Free Magadan's international shortwave broadcasts. A more crisp audio quality with 50% less static ought to make it more appealing to the listeners! As an added benefit, opening ourselves up further to OFN and improving our relationship with the bloc will also allow us to bring in more people educated at their universities, as well as their capital."

 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_15_tt: "Even during the times of Bukharin, it was common practice to make sure that those who visited the Soviet Union were treated to the best the nation had to offer. After all, seeing the lingering destruction of the White Army's rampage across the USSR or seeing a region that'd yet to fully realize the positive effects of our government's reforms was always something that risked harming the nation's image. Yakutsk is ideal location for a revitalization project aimed at giving returning Soviet citizens the best possible image of our recovering Soviet Union. Not only are there plenty of economic opportunities in the region to justify making permanent improvements to it, but it's also easy to survey and monitor what goes in and out. While the construction work is ongoing, we'll put the word out within the Soviet émigré communities that there's bread, land and well-paying labor waiting for them in their former homeland."

The message to the world that Yakutsk is a socialist utopia where people can experience true socialism has reached far and wide with our security services working hard that no troublemakers enter our union, nor that a bad word of it leaves the region of the former republic of Yakutia. This, however, represents the limit of our program's realistic growth as any further expansions may endanger the security of our union."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "Through an extended enlightenment campaign by Agitprop, we'll let everyone within the reach of our radio broadcasts know that Yakutsk is the socialist utopia of the east. With the increased effectiveness of our NKVD operatives in ensuring the stability of the returning population's experiences, we can even expand the program to applicants from the CPS and OFN territories as well - provided that they pass our rigorous screening process, of course"

 #Raiding
 raiding.100.t: "An Ultimatum"
 raiding.100.d: "We have received an ultimatum from [FROM.GetNameDef], they are demanding that we hand over a tribute of loot, or else they will raid us and take it from us anyways.\n\nWe are at an impasse to decide, do we decide to engage in confrontation with [FROM.GetNameDef], possibly risking our men dying at the hands of our enemies, or do we instead stand down and cave in to their demands, giving them the desired loot, allowing our men to live to fight another day?"
 raiding.100.a: "We will not back down so easily!"
 raiding.100.b: "Perhaps it is best we stand down and pay them the desired tribute."

 raiding.101.t: "They Refuse Tribute"
 raiding.101.d: "As is expected, [FROM.GetNameDef] has told us that they reject our offer and are ready for battle, we must ready our men to prepare for the fight.\n\nAlas, bloodshed is sometimes unavoidable and we must prepare for what is to come, if they aren't going to cooperate, it is time we take the loot from [FROM.GetNameDef] by force."
 raiding.101.a: "The sounds of gunfire continue to resonate in Russia..."
 raiding.101.a.tt: "...only to be canceled by a sudden change."

 raiding.102.t: "Tribute Paid"
 raiding.102.d: "Miraculously, [FROM.GetNameDef] has caved in and paid us tribute, handing over our desired loot from their state. Bloodshed has been avoided and our men live to fight another day, it is unlikely that [FROM.GetNameDef] is to surrender to us so easily again."
 raiding.102.a: "Threats are sometimes needed to survive in the anarchy of Russia."

 raiding.103.t: "Counter-Raid Successful"
 raiding.103.d: "Our reports have returned; our men hurry home with trucks filled with loot and blood smeared over their hands. They congratulate each other for the successful counter-raid against the unsuspecting enemy, patting their comrades on the back and taking the last few shots at the survivors scurrying away. We proclaim victory in this skirmish, as our men cheer and whistle in the hysteria of war, eager to present to us the treasures they have prized from the grips of our adversaries."
 raiding.103.a: "Seize all that we can use."
 
 raiding.104.t: "Counter-Raid Canceled"
 raiding.104.d: "We have no choice but to cancel the counter-raid. Our raiding party rabble and rave, unable to communicate and work as a unit. They constantly jam their guns, and feud over scraps of ammunition they steal from each other. To send these clueless regulars out would be ridiculous - suicidal, even. Our time is best spent arming and training these men with the few resources we can gather so our next raid will not end in a total disgrace."
 raiding.104.a: "We were just not prepared..."
 
 raiding.105.t: "The Counter-Raid Fails"
 raiding.105.d: "Our men rush back from the frontier, wounded and bloody. Some dash with bandages wrapped around their battered heads; others lay motionless on the back of moving vehicles groaning and beckoning for help. The raid against our neighbors was an ambush, and they repelled our men with deadly force. Some of our dead are wagoned back with gashed flesh, exploded skulls, or chewed up by machine gun fire. We need more time to recover and recuperate, and perhaps with enough resources we can strike again."
 raiding.105.a: "We'll get the bastards next time!"

 raiding.1.t: "Raid Successful"
 raiding.1.d: "Our reports have returned; our men hurry home with trucks filled with loot and blood smeared over their hands. They congratulate each other for the successful raid against the unsuspecting enemy, patting their comrades on the back and taking the last few shots at the survivors scurrying away. We proclaim victory in this skirmish, as our men cheer and whistle in the hysteria of war, eager to present to us the treasures they have prized from the grips of our adversaries."
 raiding.1.a: "Seize all that we can use."
 
 raiding.2.t: "Raid Canceled"
 raiding.2.d: "We have no choice but to cancel the raid. Our raiding party rabble and rave, unable to communicate and work as a unit. They constantly jam their guns, and feud over scraps of ammunition they steal from each other. To send these clueless regulars out would be ridiculous - suicidal, even. Our time is best spent arming and training these men with the few resources we can gather so our next raid will not end in a total disgrace."
 raiding.2.a: "We were just not prepared..."
 
 raiding.3.t: "The Raid Fails"
 raiding.3.d: "Our men rush back from the frontier, wounded and bloody. Some dash with bandages wrapped around their battered heads; others lay motionless on the back of moving vehicles groaning and beckoning for help. The raid against our neighbors was an ambush, and they repelled our men with deadly force. Some of our dead are wagoned back with gashed flesh, exploded skulls, or chewed up by machine gun fire. We need more time to recover and recuperate, and perhaps with enough resources we can strike again."
 raiding.3.a: "We'll get the bastards next time!"
 
 raiding.4.t: "We Have Been Raided!"
 raiding.4.d: "Our reports have come back from the frontiers, and it's terrible news. Bandits have ambushed our garrisons and massacred our men, leaving them as grotesque and gnarled corpses scattered across the plains. Moreover, we have been informed that they have infiltrated border towns and villages, plundering and looting all they could from the defenseless population. With our units unprepared, there is little we can do as they scurry back to where they came from, having left a path of utter misery and rampage behind them."
 raiding.4.a: "Dear God!"
 
 raiding.5.t: "The Enemy Falters"
 raiding.5.d: "With our recent preparation of defense procedures across the frontiers, the bandits from across the border scurry back into the shadows. No longer do they froth at the mouth and hunger for our bounties as they fear our potential for violent conflict over these contested territories. Clearly, expert defense and mind games have won the battle before a single drop of blood needed to be shed, as the enemy cowers before the skill and might of [Root.GetName]."
 raiding.5.a: "Hah! Look at the cowards run!"
 
 raiding.6.t: "The Enemy Is Defeated"
 raiding.6.d: "Recent reports have been sent in of an overwhelming victory against a recent party of raiding bandits. In a brutal standoff, they were decimated by our valiant defense forces, and now their bodies lie scattered and mutilated by war. With survivors dashing for cover and retreating into the misty frontiers, our soldiers chant songs of victory and heroism in the face of invading evil. The rush of bloody defeat will certainly teach them a lesson about attacking the lands of [Root.GetName] for years to come!"
 raiding.6.a: "Now on to cleaning up the corpses..."
 
 raiding.7.t: "Relics of the Past"
 raiding.7.d: "Our recent raid on enemy territory has been a resounding success. After subduing the enemy forces on the battlefield, our brave soldiers have marched into several of the border towns and scrounged up treasures from the days of when Russia was united. Serving as a painful reminder of our own pitiful divisions, we have determined that some of these items can prove useful in developing our own fledgling industry. Indeed, we hope that they can aid in our return to the same position of power these commodities were fashioned in, and elevate these lands to a respectable and peaceful way of living once again."
 raiding.7.a: "But we must also think of the future..."
 
 raiding.8.t: "Food for the Hungry"
 raiding.8.d: "At long last, everyone finally has food for the night, and we need no longer work on empty bellies and broken hearts. Living off of half rations for months had taught us all temperance and composure, but gnawed at our minds in a silent and icy hysteria. Now, we have plenty of food for generations to come, and the people of [Root.GetName] can begin their toils without hunger bothering them throughout their maddeningly tiresome days."
 raiding.8.a: "Guess we're not going hungry tonight..."
 
 raiding.9.t: "The Spoils of War"
 raiding.9.d: "Victory! Our raiding parties drag home great bounties tied down to the roofs of military vehicles and lumped in sacks carried on horseback from enemy territories. With these treasures, we are able to fill our coffers, restock our armories, and increase production in our local industries. The balance of power has clearly shifted in our favor, and with each skirmish to come, we are better armed to tackle these challenges that encroach across the wild Russian frontiers."
 raiding.9.a: "This will help in the future."
 
 raiding.10.t: "Treasure!"
 raiding.10.d: "Our men have crushed the enemy, and uprooted from the land of everything of use to our raiding parties. In the chaos and hysteria of the violence, some of our men had smashed through the locks of a warehouse and stumbled across great treasures beyond our wildest dreams! Scrounging up the gold, precious metals, statues, and other remnants of Russia's past, dragging these relics home brings us immense wealth, prestige, and nostalgia for a great time. Perhaps this, even in the violence and brutality of these skirmishes, is a sign of great times to come for our people."
 raiding.10.a: "A Relic of the Past..."
 
 raiding.11.t: "Machines of the Past"
 raiding.11.d: "After crushing our foe, our men had charged into the enemy's warehouses and armories, snatching everything of use and destroying the rest that could not be carried. A group of our soldiers stumbled into a storage facility housing great industrial equipment. It would only be fitting to strap the machines to the back of our vehicles and haul them to our factories, where they can be appropriated and integrated into our production lines. Perhaps one day, with one machine at a time, we can rebuild Russia from the ground and restore her to her former glory."
 raiding.11.a: "With these maybe Russia will be rebuilt one day..."
 
 raiding.12.t: "Memories of the Past"
 raiding.12.d: "Our men rushed into the then desolate military bases of the enemy, surrounded by the bodies of the dead. Bursting through doors, yelling and wailing in a warlike-hysteria, and opening indiscriminate fire on any stragglers, our men flew down tight corridors and bombed-out rooms. They tore apart cabinets and storage units in search for supplies, arms, and equipment, until one detachment darted into a warehouse facility only to find relics of an old Russia. They put down their arms, and began scrounging to gather all the photos, video reels, and items they could. Receiving the goods this morning, we have found immense riches in the films, books, and paintings of a Russia before the anarchy - a beckoning reminder of our past glories and current shame."
 raiding.12.a: "With these maybe Russia will be united once more..."
 
 raiding.13.t: "Food Stolen"
 raiding.13.d: "This morning, we have found our food supplies emptied and looted by runaway bandits and criminals. At at least three locations, warehouses stockpiling grain, meats, salts, and tinned foods had been plundered, leaving nothing but a few spilled sacks of barley and ruined tins of meat. Children go to bed hungry at night, and farmers struggle to support our population. Something must be done, as it is only a number of weeks until our people will turn weapons on each other for something to eat."
 raiding.13.a: "Half-Rations this month it seems"
 
 raiding.14.t: "Garrison Slaughtered"
 raiding.14.d: "We awake today to news of death and defeat. Our barracks have been ravaged by bandit pillagers, and our garrison forces lay dead on the dirt in a particularly gruesome and horrific manner. With blood and brains splattered across walls and a glowing smoke leaving the soldier's quarters, our manpower has been seriously diminished by raiding forces in acts of sheer wickedness and brutality. Now, they are nowhere to be seen; the winds of the frontiers whistle and beckon, and the people of [Root.GetName] cower with fear. Whatever action is to be taken against these barbarian armies, it must be swift and it must be soon."
 raiding.14.a: "Bury the dead, and inform the families..."
 
 raiding.15.t: "Damaged Machinery"
 raiding.15.d: "After the latest raid in our territories, we can thankfully report that most of our civilian population has remained unharmed. However, the same cannot be said for our industrial production. With factory equipment plundered and multiple mills razed to the ground, our progress towards industrial development has been hampered significantly. Whilst we cannot improve our production as effectively at the moment, we can safeguard our people. Indeed, whilst machinery can be lost and retrieved - lives cannot."
 raiding.15.a: "Bastards!"
 
 raiding.16.t: "Looted Armouries"
 raiding.16.d: "Our generals have reported to us that a handful of armories under our control have been looted by raiding bandits. Rifles and ammunition have been reported missing; some armories having all of their contents emptied and stolen by raiding parties disappearing overnight. Assuming that these raiders have now long scurried past the frontiers by now, we find with our warehouses barren, we have less and less arms to defend ourselves from their prying hands. Action must be taken, lest we are soon robbed of our lives."
 raiding.16.a: "This will only encourage them..."
 
 raiding.17.t: "Villages Destroyed"
 raiding.17.d: "We have received reports today from the smouldering villages on our borders with neighboring territories. Our people have been slaughtered and our industries have been destroyed; raiding bandits must've crossed the frontiers with enough might and savagery to decimate our defences and leave our people bludgeoned and beaten. Hundreds lay dead on the ground in homes, town halls, and workplaces, and survivors shudder when talking of the raids. Stripped of much of our ability to effectively defend against bandit onslaught, we have been dealt a striking blow to our ability to govern these disputed territories. This is one of our weakest moments, and we must do all we can to survive and recuperate before we inevitably strike back with a burning fury."

 RUS_wonder.0.t: "An End to Wonders"
 RUS_wonder.0.desc: "We have come far! Where once our government was seen as a mere warlord, holding onto a scrap of Russian land, we can now assert ourselves as a proper nation on the world stage. Having made it into the final basket of candidates to reunify Russia, our country can stand proud of its accomplishment, and look to the road ahead with determination.\n\nThis progress has filled our citizens with awe, even as we rebuild the country, its infrastructures and its industries. However, our successes have rendered the Wonders of old much less critical to our efforts. Where once holding on to these relics of a happier past gave our government legitimacy and gave our people tools needed for survival, the Wonders under our control are now a tiny portion of our overall assets. They will no doubt continue to inspire our people, and they stand as mementos to the warlord era; but the age where holding onto Wonders was of great importance has come to an end."
 RUS_wonder.0.a: "Onto an uncertain future."

 RUS_wonder.1.t: "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.1.desc: "We have acquired the Gorky tank factory, the largest producer of armored vehicles in West Russia.\n\nThis factory was a vital part of Soviet industrial production and saw heavy usage during the West Russian War. In the aftermath of the WRRF's collapse, it fell into the hands of Nikolai Averin and his divisions of bandits, who used the factory to pump out tanks for their raids on Reichskommissariat Moskowien. An ignoble fate, for such an important piece of military infrastructure!\n\nTanks are rare among the warlords of Russia, making anyone who can produce them a force to reckon with and making the factory a highly sought after prize. Now that it belongs to us, we can utilize Gorky's tank factory for a higher purpose than stealing scraps from the Germans.\n\nRegaining the capacity to produce tanks will be another step towards achieving the military capabilities of a full-fledged nation, and another step towards declaring a final victory in West Russia."
 RUS_wonder.1.a: "The power of modern warfare, unleashed."

 RUS_wonder.2.t: "Syktyvkar Arsenal Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.2.desc: "We have secured the arsenal in Syktyvkar, a major stockpile of military weaponry that could prove decisive in securing victory in West Russia. Previously in the hands of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, it came into the possession of the fledgeling Komi Republic when the WRRF fled Syktyvkar. Komi used the arsenal to maintain order inside of its notoriously unstable capital and establish itself as a regional power, but, even with full access to it, was unable to prevent its loss. The arsenal contains firearms, explosives, tanks, and chemical weaponry, a fearsome collection for any would-be conqueror.\n\nHaving taken it, we are at a hefty advantage, proudly wielding the weapons that will bring us victory in West Russia. In the perpetual resource shortage of the post-Soviet order, every gun counts. Our control over the arsenal will afford us all the equipment we need to impose our authority over the region."
 RUS_wonder.2.a: "Locked and loaded."

 RUS_wonder.3.t: "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.3.desc: "After conquering the city of Izhevsk, we have secured our control over the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, the single greatest center of arms production in West Russia. Izhevsk has long been used to pump out enormous quantities of pistols, rifles, and other small arms. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Izhevsk and its factory became the property of Vladimir Romanov, the purported successor to Russia's late Tsar, who used it to build up his reactionary forces in a play for regional domination.\n\nNow that the plant is solidly ours, we can use it for the same purpose. In the Great Patriotic War and West Russian War, it was one of the primary producers of weapons for a huge number of soldiers. We can ensure that our armies are armed with new, modern firearms while our opponents struggle to assemble outdated arsenals."
 RUS_wonder.3.a: "Drown them in a wave of lead."

 RUS_wonder.4.t: "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.4.desc: "We fought long and hard, but we have lost control of the Gorky tank factory, a major blow to our vehicle production capacity. The tank factory, formerly used to great effect by the West Russian Revolutionary Front against the Germans, has long been a strategic lynchpin in the region, since it is one of the only industrial centers capable of creating heavy armor. Tanks are disproportionately powerful against the relatively lightly armed armies that make up most of West Russia's military forces; any warlord with them in possession can expect to be taken very seriously.\n\nThe factory gave us an undeniable edge in firepower, and will likely be used for very similar purposes by its new owners. We are far from doomed, but we should expect a larger quantity of tanks and armored vehicles in the near future and prepare accordingly."
 RUS_wonder.4.a: "A troubling development."

 RUS_wonder.5.t: "Syktyvkar Arsenal Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.5.desc: "Our soldiers defended it in running street battles throughout Syktyvkar, but the massive arsenal stored in that city is no longer ours. Belonging initially to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the arsenal was abandoned when the Red Army fled the city in the late 1950's and used by the Komi Republic to maintain order and equip its military. It includes a great quantity of firearms, ammunition, grenades, and, perhaps most interestingly to the less discerning warlord, chemical weapons.\n\nWe have much to fear now that the arsenal has left our control. We have naturally acted according to the laws of warfare, but that same guarantee cannot be said of our opponents; it is entirely possible that the arsenal's new stewards will employ chemical weapons against us. This, combined with the new deficit in weapon quantity caused by the turnover, means that the balance of power in West Russia has shifted by a noticeable amount."
 RUS_wonder.5.a: "We are outgunned, but not yet outmatched."

 RUS_wonder.6.t: "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.6.desc: "With the loss of the city of Izhevsk, and the mighty Izhevsk Mechanical Plant with it, we may be in dire straits. The plant, the largest small arms factory in West Russia, is a prize coveted by any warlord worth his salt. Its usage dates back to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the only force in living memory able to produce weapons on a quantity capable of challenging Germany. The plant went from their control to ours, and now lies in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNothing is certain in the chaotic battlefields of West Russia, but we can surmise that this has been a significant loss to our forces. Although we will not feel the loss immediately, the decrease in our productive capacity is sure to have negative effects on our ability to equip our troops in the future. Shortages are likely, and modern production techniques will once again become a luxury for our forces. We are far from finished, but this is a concerning development nevertheless."
 RUS_wonder.6.a: "We will make up for their guns with our mettle."
 
 RUS_wonder.7.t: "Vorkuta Gulags Caputured!"
 RUS_wonder.7.desc: "As our men sweep over the arctic plains, the infamously dreadful Vorkuta Gulags have come under our administration. The dark complex of watch-towers, gloomy barracks, and labor camps strike a trembling fear in these icy wastes; the unbelievable torture of this natural prison serves as a reminder of the wickedness of men. The enemy's men lay scattered across the courtyard, buried in debris and torn to pieces by machine gun fire. With blood freshly painted on dark brick walls, the smell of gunpowder was thick and the silence after battle was deafening.\n\nWe were in a place of immense suffering, and whilst many of our men broke down doors to scurry in and rummage for loot, others lowered their weapons to gaze at the daunting site that dwarved them. With the Gulags largely preserved from war, however, this does pose a question: are we to close the site down forever and let it remain a relic of our barbarous past, or must we plunge our hands in the dirty realities of this war so that Russia may live on?"
 RUS_wonder.7.a: "Sometimes, great men do awful things."
 RUS_wonder.7.b: "Never again, not like this."
 
 RUS_wonder.8.t: "Ural Automotive Plant Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.8.desc: "With Chelyabinsk now conquered, our men sweep through the city in search of anything of value in the ongoing conflict with our neighbors. Raiding teams zip across streets, firing at the remnants of enemy divisions holding out in homes and buildings scattered across the urban sprawl, and crackles of gunfire echo throughout the streets from skirmishes a few blocks away. A unit of our men had besieged an encampment holding out in the Ural Automotive Plant, and upon breaching enemy defenses, the Plant was pried from the few dozen men left clinging to their lives.\n\nWith this major manufacturing site under our control, our soldiers will now have greater access to off-road vehicles in later confrontations. This has great potential to improve our supply lines, and aid in improving the speed of our reinforcements. The powerful engines produced in the Ural Automotive Plant are renowned for their speed and dexterity over difficult terrain, and will definitely prove useful in our navigational and incursive efforts across the Russian anarchy. Truly, with the aid of the motor, this is a victory for our people and the future of Russia."
 RUS_wonder.8.a: "Onwards, countrymen!"
 
 RUS_wonder.9.t: "Zlatoust Arms Plant Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.9.desc: "The continued advance of our troops deep into the Urals has resulted in the capture of a great prize: the famed Zlatoust Arms Plant.\n\nLong known for turning out vast quantities of high-quality small arms and ammunition, the capture of the plant means that we can now secure these weapons for ourselves, while simultaneously denying them to our enemies. Already our engineers and administrators are working to integrate the plant's operations into our wider logistical network, and this should be completed shortly.\n\nAlthough it is in truth only one large factory complex, of which we already possess many, and it will not on its own produce a decisive amount of materiel, the value of the plant should not be underestimated. It is a symbol of Russian arms production, and it now belongs to us.\n\nIt is yet one more jewel in our crown, and we will leverage the economic, combative, and political advantages it promises to facilitate further advances and conquests, until such time as all the lands and peoples of Russia acknowledge our state as triumphant."
 RUS_wonder.9.a: "Forward!"
 
 RUS_wonder.10.t: "Vorkuta Gulags Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.10.desc: "In our defeats across Northern Russia, the frontlines have pushed us out of the Vorkuta Gulag system and have effectively conceded the complex to the enemy. As we did retreat from the area, prisoners grew ever more feral and hysterical as they witnessed our defeat. The wild frenzy of conflict punished our men, and perhaps to the prisoners it was some kind of sick justice.\n\nWhilst we do have the opportunity to strike back, our men are tired and shaken by the evictions of war. The bitter chill of the arctic winds do not accommodate for the spirits of the defeated, and as honorable as our troops can be, the numbing cold could bring them no respite. We march to regroup in the frontiers of our territories, but with the wild panic of the gulags burned into the memories of our men, their courage for battle seems irrecoverable and may spell our coming defeat."
 RUS_wonder.10.a: "Someone will be shot for this!"
 
 RUS_wonder.11.t: "Ural Automotive Plant Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.11.desc: "Our men have fought valiantly in the city of Chelyabinsk, skirmishing with the enemy and braving the metal shred of gunfire, but their sacrifices were not enough to defend the Ural Automotive Plant from the advances of the enemy. The factory's machines continued to crash and clunk in the haze and chaos of war, exchanging hands as the frontlines danced from street to street.\n\nWe retreat away from the city to encampments in the surrounding wilderness, plotting our recapturing of the factory. However, until then, we are to expect that our adversaries will make use of their new toys to produce the same vehicles that had aided us in our battles in the past. Whilst this is not a dishonourable defeat, it is a defeat nonetheless, and one that could spell our doom as the enemy grows stronger with every engine produced."
 RUS_wonder.11.a: "A great loss for us."
 
 RUS_wonder.12.t: "Zlatoust Arms Plant Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.12.desc: "The Zlatoust Arms Plant burns bright in the distance as our men retreat into the wilderness to regroup, and explosions of ammunition caches are audible from the frontiers of the battlefield. Defeat looms over the troops as they gaze at the crumbling fortress they had fought for days in to defend. Overcome with a wicked cynicism, many turned away and continued their march, bitter and defeated by the enemy.\n\nThe arms plant, whilst not completely destroyed, has come under enemy control and will most certainly be exploited to produce thousands of arms in the coming weeks. Although our men did gather all they could to carry with us away from the battlefield, it remains an unspoken truth as of now that we will begin to experience tight weapon shortages as the enemy approaches further towards our encampments outside of the city."
 RUS_wonder.12.a: "We have certainly lost an advantage today."
 
 RUS_wonder.13.t: "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.13.desc: "Crashing through the forested mountains surrounding the city, our men have overrun the city of Krasnoyarsk, and with it we have taken the widely-discussed Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction. The tall and mighty station building stretched across the urban space and dominated our soldiers' view; it was a logistical fortress, stuffed with bulky metal trains resting on the platforms.\n\nWith a crucial junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway now under our control, we can now more vastly improve our logistical abilities in performing the Herculean task of re-uniting Russia. Piling heaps of ammunition caches and supply crates onto the trains, we can deliver these resources to our frontlines far more effectively, as well as increase the speed in which communications can be delivered. Our grasp over the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction will stretch our influence across Siberia, and is a step towards extending our power to reunite Russia under our watch."
 RUS_wonder.13.a: "A boon to be sure!"
 
 RUS_wonder.14.t: "Kuznetsk Basin Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.14.desc: "Our men spill over the ruins of the Kuznetsk Basin, battling through the remains of enemy fortifications and pockets of wounded squadrons. With gunfire still crackling in the distance, the embers of burning structures clawed at the sky with roaring flames. Wind rushed through the Kuznetsk Depression, carrying with it the blackened stench of the coal reserves now under our control.\n\nWith such rich natural resources now under our administration, we have access to generate immense amounts of energy. The power produced by excavated coal reserves can promptly increase our manufacturing capabilities, as well as provide energy to the many citizens living within our territory. A highly valuable and sought-after location in Central Siberia, this prized asset under our jurisdiction must be put to use soon so we may reap the benefits of the coal mines before any of our enemies manage to snatch it from us themselves."
 RUS_wonder.14.a: "We have won a great victory today!"
 
 RUS_wonder.15.t: "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.15.desc: "The recent fall of Novosibirsk and the retreat of enemy forces across the frontiers of the battlefield has left us in control of the now idle Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. Towering and dormant, the factory was constructed before the Great Patriotic War and has manufactured vehicles capable of flight for her administrators ever since.\n\nNow with the plant under our control, we will soon have access to a fresh arsenal of aircraft fit for any purpose for our armies. Motor engines roar, and squadrons of planes may fly in the Siberian skies bearing our insignia. To first dominate the plains and wastes of Central Siberia by land, we must tame the wild airs of our broken Russia. With this plant, this future may be ours for centuries to come."
 RUS_wonder.15.a: "To the skies!"
 
 RUS_wonder.16.t: "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.16.desc: "Our men hurried into train cars as the enemy's siege was nearing its completion. The crackle of gunfire and boom of artillery shells had shaken our men to the core, but there was some sense of comfort knowing that the trains left the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction in the nick of time to escape enemy skirmishes.\n\nHowever, although we have our men's lives, we no longer possess the administrative and logistical crown jewel that was the junction in Krasnoyarsk. The extension to communicate and ship resources from one end of our territory to the other was invaluable, but now in the hands of our adversaries. By sacrificing that key location, we have given up our great stretch over Central Siberia and potentially our future in reuniting our shattered Russia."
 RUS_wonder.16.a: "Curse our enemies!"
 
 RUS_wonder.17.t: "Kuznetsk Basin Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.17.desc: "Our men lay battered and bloody, their corpses sprawled across the Siberian frontiers. In the chaos of war and violence, our control over the Kuznetsk Basin was lost and with it goes our access to the immense amounts of coal deep in the ore-rich deposits.\n\nWith such a great power source taken from us, we are likely to experience shortages in production and problems with fuel conservation. We now are forced to turn to rely on finite resources of energy spread thin across our territories. If mismanaged, this could very well spell the end of our existence and chance to reunite Russia, dooming us to the anarchy our men have fought so tirelessly against."
 RUS_wonder.17.a: "Curses!"
 
 RUS_wonder.18.t: "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.18.desc: "With our recent defeats in the Novosibirsk region, our recent reports have made it clear that the enemy now controls the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. With one of the largest aircraft manufacturers now in the enemy's hands, we have been dealt a swift and powerful blow that may lead us towards a humiliating defeat. The factory has been scathed by the tremors of war, but unfortunately our intelligence suggests that the plant may continue manufacturing operations.\n\nNow under enemy control, the factory may open a new front in the air against our men, and with our ability to replenish our planes at a continual rate now nullified, we face the terms of defeat on the battlefield from the air as well as from the front lines. It is only a matter of time before the skies belong to our adversaries, and our struggle towards victory will become ever more burdensome."
 RUS_wonder.18.a: "A big loss for us."
 
 RUS_wonder.19.t: "Port of Magadan Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.19.desc: "As our troops rushed past the far eastern frontiers, their assault on enemy lands was halted only by the sea. The great Pacific, open and wide, had met our men after bloody battle as the Port of Magadan had come under our control. The icy and choppy waters stretched for miles in every direction in front of them; the mysterious stretch of Siberian waters was a home to by far the most significant port in the Eastern Russian wastes.\n\nA hub of trade and smuggling, with a particular taste for Japanese and American goods, the Port of Magadan opens up greater opportunities for our administration to not only trade wares, but also make a name for ourselves across the globe. Indeed, with this invaluable port under our control, we pray to see our foot in the door to international recognition and trade."
 RUS_wonder.19.a: "The gateway to Russia has been secured"
 
 RUS_wonder.20.t: "Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.20.desc: "With the city of Irkutsk recently taken by our Siberian armies, the mighty Hydroelectric Station has come under our control. Constructed under the orders of Genrikh Yagoda after the Soviet Union was pushed back to the corners of Siberia, this work of infrastructure has reliably generated energy for the entire city under his command. A mighty symbol of Russian mastery over nature, the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station may also be a symbol of our control over the Siberian frontiers amidst the chaos of warlordism in the East.\n\nGiven the immense amounts of electricity gathered from the currents of the river, we can utilise the potential of the Hydroelectric station to send power to our manufacturing plants, factories, and the homes of citizens living within our territory. The concrete station towered over the Siberian wastes and churned through great amounts of the Angara's water to generate electricity. We will utilise the natural veins of our fractured nation, and with such a magnificent source of electricity in the region our energy supplies will never run dry!"
 RUS_wonder.20.a: "This will surely aid in our efforts."
 
 RUS_wonder.21.t: "Cheryomushki Airbase Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.21.desc: "After a particularly bloody siege, our men have captured Cheryomushki Airbase from the cowardly enemy, and pillaged the facilities of any retrievable plunder. With most of the airbase left intact after the siege, we find that the field may be able to be put into purpose sooner rather than later. The aircraft that sit in the hangars sulk, their metal wings still and unused.\n\nWith an entire airbase now under our control, our territories can now support the squadrons of planes tearing across the ashen Siberian skies. With the airfield as an asset in our favor, our men may advance through the Siberian wastes knowing full well that pilots watch over them from the skies. The East is cold, and her winds are colder, but no such chill could render our determination to clash and to fly."
 RUS_wonder.21.a: "The skies are ours!"
 
 RUS_wonder.22.t: "Port of Magadan Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.22.desc: "Even with our backs turned towards the sea and cornered by enemy forces, we have been forced to abandon the Port of Magadan and retreat into the eastern frontiers to regroup. Whilst battling the untamed wilderness of Siberia poses great threat to our men, our loss of the Port of Magadan will surely hit us even harder if we are not able to snatch it back from our adversaries.\n\nWith American and Japanese goods no longer accessible from the port, weeks remain before our administration and our men begin to starve from a lack of resources, food, and materiel. We must make the decision now to either tighten our belts and brace for impact, or we gather our forces and battle for the port once more. Men will die and heroes will be remembered, but what cost are we most willing to bear for our survival?"
 RUS_wonder.22.a: "The enemy has gained the upper hand for now."
 
 RUS_wonder.23.t: "Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.23.desc: "Despite our best efforts to keep a hold of the dam, the enemy now swarms over our previous positions defending the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station. Water still rushes through its crushing rotors, albeit dyed with our patriot's blood and now under enemy control.\n\nWe have no doubt in assuming that they will attempt to make best use of the facility's potential to power great machines and fuel their warring industry against us. Our soldiers watch from the distance as enemy troops and engineers tinker with the smoldering debris that surround the Hydroelectric station, consulting each other on the strategy required to take the facility back. What is certain, however, is that with each moment the dam is under enemy control, the greater power will be amassed in the enemy's war against our brave men."
 RUS_wonder.23.a: "A great setback!"
 
 RUS_wonder.24.t: "Cheryomushki Airbase Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.24.desc: "The enemy overruns our frontlines just north of Chita, and our men retreat from their positions to regroup and persevere in this great war of conflict and trial. Our recent reports tell us that our troops have recently lost control of Cheryomushki Airbase after an intensely fought siege, skirmishing between hangars and across airfields.\n\nOur men are weak and tired, shaken by their defeat. Moreover, with our retreat from the airbase, the enemy now has access to airfields and planes to support further aerial assaults against the advancement of our own forces. Cornered by our losses, we must now consider strafe bombing and ground support in any hopeful strategy to recover the appropriated airbase from enemy grips."
 RUS_wonder.24.a: "Curse our foes!"
 
 RUS_wonder.1917.t: "Lenin's Body Captured!"
 RUS_wonder.1917.desc: "Our soldiers have seized Lenin's mausoleum. Due to the lack of strategic or tactical significance to Lenin's corpse, the troops of our opponent abandoned his body without a fight, choosing instead to retreat to safer, more defensible positions. The political significance of Lenin's body remains questionable. Across Russia, views over Lenin as a historical figure are wide-ranged and varied. Many people view Lenin as the father of a political movement which has, through its stupidity and incompetence, led to the collapse of our nation. Others see Lenin as a bastion of a form of communism true to Marx and Engels, the legacy of which would be betrayed by his heir, Bukharin. Others still see Lenin as the first in-line of a succession of troubled, yet still utopian Bukharinist leaders and thinkers. Whatever the thoughts on this man, he is most certainly one of the most prominent leaders in Russian history, and now he is in our grasp..."
 RUS_wonder.1917.a: "Four decades of history, in our hands!"
 
 RUS_wonder.1924.t: "Lenin's Body Lost!"
 RUS_wonder.1924.desc: "The corpse of Vladimir Lenin has been lost to us, for much of the same reasons we conquered it in the first place. Lenin's body, although holding prominence as a political tool, is not a valuable strategic or tactical nexus. The opponent may have it, and although they may savor the propaganda opportunities afforded to them by wielding the corpse of the Soviet Union's father, we will see to it that his body is retaken in due time."
 RUS_wonder.1924.a: "Nothing lost to us but bones and ideas."
 
 RUS_wonder.1991.t: "Lenin's Body Destroyed"
 RUS_wonder.1991.desc: "Vladimir Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union and the architect of Russia's collapse into warlordism, shall thrive no longer as a symbol of communist indulgence and decline. His body has been burned to ash, and the ashes thrown into Russia's untouched wilds. Although others may cling to the ideas his corpse represented, we will see to it that Lenin as 'one of the most prominent leaders in Russian history' no longer remains true. Lenin was a man, if even that, who toppled our nation for a short period of time. Nothing more, nothing less."
 RUS_wonder.1991.a: "A short-lived leader with strange ideas, nothing new."

 ### General Russia Events ###
 RUS.2.t: "Sports Rivalry"
 RUS.2.desc: "While our successful unification of Western Russia and efforts at integration has done much to unite the people under a common banner, fierce rivalries between the many regions of our nation still remain. While the era of armed warlordism may have ended, our people are finding new ways to act on these rivalries. One such method seems to be hockey.\n\nThe recent game between the Gorky Tankers and Kazan's Ak Bars has ended in chaos following a narrow 4-2 win for the Bars in the first game of the season. The people of Gorky have refused to take the defeat lying down kicking off a series of drunken demonstrations. The protests, which later led to rioting, involved an attempt to prevent the Ak Bars from returning to their hotel, the defacing of several locations across the city with offensive slurs against Tatars, and many incidences of looting and vandalism.\n\nThe damages following the event have totaled to a considerable sum, and many are concerned that it may have set a worrying precedent for future games, especially as the hockey season begins in earnest."
 RUS.2.a: "Well, at least it's better than shooting each other."

 RUS.3.t: "Caffeine Flow"
 RUS.3.desc: "Luxuries such as tea and coffee were once rare commodities during the chaos of the late 50s and early 60s. Only available to those with both money and connections and utterly out of reach for most of the population.\n\nHowever, as Russia stabilized, access to the global economy has drastically improved, and now once rare commodities are being imported in increasingly large amounts. Chocolate, fruits, foreign wines, and of course, coffee and tea. Now, access to caffeinated beverages is no longer a luxury restricted to the privileged few, but an increasingly common (if still pricey) drink of choice for many of our citizens."
 RUS.3.a: "A toast to our future success!"

 RUS.4.t: "The People's Apocalypse"
 RUS.4.desc: "A nation of writers, poets, and scholars, the universities of Tomsk produce more manuscripts and manifestoes than most people care to count. Yet one piece, published anonymously, has begun to spread controversy far and wide throughout Siberia. 'The People's Apocalypse' tells the story of a faceless scholar's journey throughout the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, progressively encountering those who the author identifies as the four horsemen of the apocalypse: Ivan Zavoloko, Genrikh Yagoda, Alexander Pokryshkin and Nikolai Andreev.\n\nAwaking in Oyrotia after falling ill, the scholar finds the people reduced to babbling madmen, clawing out their own eyes and pulling apart their scalps from a pestilence brought to the land from Zavoloko, poisoning his people with an elixir named faith and weakening the body of the Republic. Chased away by the blind and corrupted, the scholar soon finds himself witness to the lands being set ablaze and the free thinkers abducted and persecuted by Yagoda as blue faced demons wage war against the people. Fleeing the slaughter they come upon endless roads buried under living skeletons, famine consuming the land from Pokryshkin's terrible betrayal, before finally witnessing Andreev's betrayal at Krasnoyarsk, piercing the heart of a nameless soldier embodying the noble Republic.\n\nCondemning the four men as bringing about the end of the promised People's Realm, the story ends with the land destroyed and all four being consumed by madness under the weight of their own evil, turning to stone as hideous reminders of their deeds, though it is left unanswered whether anyone will survive this end of days to remember what has been lost."

 ### Wandering Dog chain - West Russia ###
 RUS.8.t: "Separated from the Family"
 RUS.8.desc: "Sitting beside the ruins of the hut, Sasha struggled in an attempt to hear her companions. She had lost an ear to the shrapnel of the bomb that had destroyed the structure, and with only one remaining she was having difficulty determining exactly where sounds were coming from.\n\nScared and alone, she wanted nothing more than to once again hear the laughter and banter that had so often occupied both the structure and the firepit outside it. The laughter that would always follow a long day of hunting and tracking, when she would be congratulated by the hunters for expertly leading them through the dense brush.\n\nSasha waited there all day, confident that the hunters would, must, return. She had always been faithful to them, and could not fathom the idea that they would not show faith in return. Evening came, and she remained, curling as much as possible for warmth. Night fell, and she remained, watching the curious eyes of the many other predators inspect her from the treeline.\n\nWhen morning arrived on the second day, hunger came with it, and Sasha knew that her friends were not coming back. That there was no reason to stay here any longer, and she needed to hunt besides. But she had not forgotten her friends, and she knew that, wherever they were, they could not have forgotten her.\n\nSasha knew she had to go find them. And so she stood on all fours, and began walking towards the treeline."
 RUS.8.a: "A day in a dog's life."

 RUS.9.t: "Through the Countryside"
 RUS.9.desc: "Like he had thousands of times before, Vladimir lit a cigarette, placed it in his mouth, and inhaled. For a moment he felt relief, before the cigarette, rolled incorrectly by a no-doubt over-worked and under-skilled factory worker, crumbled between his fingers.\n\nSwearing, he crushed the embers and shivered. He had only been inducted into the Order a month before, and had not yet gotten used to the chill of dawn patrols.\n\nHearing a twig snap behind him, Vladimir whirled around, readying his rifle as he did so. Expecting a person, he was surprised to find a dog, missing one ear, and looking back at him with head cocked to one side. Letting out a nervous laugh, he re-shouldered his rifle and took a step forward.\n\n"Hello," he began, "you look lost. Are you lost?" The dog didn't make a sound or move to retreat as Vladimir knelt beside it and stroked its surprisingly coarse coat, feeling for a moment that rarest of emotions in the Russia: peace.\n\nAfter a short while the dog whined and pulled away, and Vladimir watched it until it disappeared beyond the horizon. He sat down on a stump, lit another cigarette, taking care to hold it tighter, and sighed.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, in a way everyone in Russia was a dog. Just as this dog had lost an ear, everyone in Russia be they raiders, civilians, workers, guards, or something else, had lost something. Russia was not a hospitable place. All that Russia offered to most of its people was hardship.\n\nBut maybe someday, like that dog, he and everyone else would find a simple kindness in their fellow man. Finishing his cigarette, Vladimir sat, and watched the sun rise in front of him."

She was still having some difficulty hearing from her one remaining ear, and they were still severe enough that she had not yet caught any prey. Hunger was building.\n\nLooking for a safe place to rest for a moment, Sasha found it under the arms of a pine tree. It was only once there that she realized she was not alone. Across from her she could see two men crouched over a deer trail.\n\n"We won't find anything to eat if this keeps up, you know," she heard one of them, an older man with a deep voice, say.\n\n"Shut up!" the other, younger one, replied. "I told you, I'm no tracker. I'm a farm-" He suddenly stopped speaking as he saw Sasha out of the corner of his eye and suddenly stood.\n\nShe met his eyes, and saw no malice in them. After a long moment, the young man reached into his pocket, withdrawing several strips of cured meat which he threw in front of her. Feeling her hunger, Sasha moved to devour them, before years of rigid training stopped her in her tracks.\n\n"Look at that, Pavel!" the older man said. "A trained dog!" He laughed as he approached her, the sound reminding her of better times. Caressing her neck, he directed her towards the trail, picking up and offering the jerky to her as he did. She quickly ate what was offered, and knew what to do next, sniffing the deer trail and looking in the direction of the smell.\n\n"See, Pavel!" the older man exclaimed. "A tracking dog. Lead on!"\n\nAt the command, Sasha cantered into the forest, the humans following behind. She might not have found her old friends, but she had at least found new ones.\n\nAnd that was enough to make her happy again."

It had been three days since he had last eaten, and he was desperate.\n\nHe had tried hunting rabbits, but he was not a very good shot. And he was far too much of a coward to try for anything bigger - and potentially more dangerous.\n\nLowering the rifle in frustration, he heard a noise from one side, and turned to find a one-eared dog standing there, watching him quizzically. Quickly overcoming his sudden surprise, and realizing the opportunity, Sergei stood very slowly and began approaching it.\n\nHe moved the muzzle of the rifle closer to it with each step, but after only two such steps he realized his mistake. The dog knew well what the rifle met, and only a moment after their eyes met the dog quickly turned and began to run.\n\nSwearing, Sergei took a knee and fired a single shot, striking the dog in its hind leg. Bounding over to it, Sergei found it still alive, though unable to move. It whined at him as he knew what he had to do, raising the rifle and firing a second shot. Kneeling down beside it, he withdrew his knife and began butchering it.\n\nHe did not know how the dog had gotten there, what had happened to drive a clearly trained dog into the wilds, and in truth he did not care.\n\nWhatever else the dog had once been, it was now food."

 RUS.12.t: "The Modern Bogatyr"
 RUS.12.desc: "Of all the tales of the Russian Anarchy, there stands but one that has spread from the frozen lands of the Far East to the city of Kostroma in the west, and even deep into the lands of the Nazi empire. The story of a wanderer from parts unknown, who brings justice with them as they walk the desolate roads of old Russia. This wanderer has come to be one of the greatest enigmas in all of Russia.\n\nLittle is known about this enigma. Some report they are a former Ranger of the Ural Guard, a man who left his home to bring justice to the worst of Russia. Others tell tales of a former Wehrmacht soldier, consumed by guilt and under a self-imposed exile, as a penance to the people he wronged. A few scant reports tell of a widow from a destroyed village, seeking to bring to others the justice she was denied. Whispers in the East speak of an American volunteer from the West Russian War, stuck in a land not his own but still doing good where he wandered. And in the bars of Siberian cities, one can always find strange and likely drug-induced tales of a man from the future, come back to save the world.\n\nWhatever their true identity and whatever their purpose in the corpse of the Soviet Union might be, all that is truly known is the kindness they have shown to a people so used to violence and death. Tales are told of the wanderer holding off entire bandit raiding parties single-handedly, liberated slaves from Perm tell of an angel of light freeing them from their shackles before disappearing into the night, and rumors have come even from Moskow of one-man raids on Nazi strongholds.\n\nIn the end, while many of these deeds are undoubtedly fictitious, the actions of this hero, this modern-day Bogatyr, have lit a fire of hope in the hearts of even the most trampled upon in Russia."

 RUS.13.desc: "Vasily sat in his guard post, rifle cradled under his shoulder. He gazed into the wilderness that separated the Front from those lands under the control of the Vorkuta Gulag. He had been on the border for the last week, one of a few small regiments that guarded the flanks of the Front. It would only be a few hours until he would be relieved by his replacement.\n\nLooking back out over the Arctic lands, he could vaguely make out something in the distance. A grey speck moving over the tundra. Lifting his binoculars, he focused on his target. It was a person, dressed in what looked like an old uniform of some kind. They were well dressed for the weather, a heavy jacket, gloves, and other winter gear. Their face was covered by a balaclava and a type of helmet he could not recognize. Slung across the man's chest was a rifle, one well-taken care of, likely a model fresh from Zlatoust.\n\nVasily watched the man as he got nearer, gripping his rifle tight. Finally, the man was within speaking distance, his hands held out to the side away from his weapons. "Halt, what are you doing here?"\n\nThe mysterious man spoke then in broken, halting Russian. "I come with to warn. Bandits come, from east. Many bandits, plan attack tonight." Vasily could hardly understand the man, his accent was atrocious, but he understood enough.\n\n"What? Damn. Alright, come up here, but don't do anything stupid," the man walked up the steps and walking into the guardhouse with his hands up.\n\n"Alert men, many bandits." The stranger said. Vasily was quick to get on the horn to the garrison, but they would be unable to send help until the next day. Vasily and the stranger readied the guardhouse as well as they could, and could do no more than wait.\n\nWhen the garrison sent reinforcements the next day, what they found shocked them. Vasily sat, smoking, on a stump outside, bodies piled high in the field and around the building. The stranger was nowhere to be found."

He had set himself up on the roof of a building across from the Komi legislature hall and was prepared to execute his part of the plan.\n\nSergei and his men had been hired to assassinate a group of Komi politicians. They were proving to be significant obstacles to their employer's plans. The first part of the plan involved the release of a small amount of tear gas from the Syktyvkar arsenal into the hall- how they had managed to get a hold of it he had no idea. After the hall was evacuated, he would make his move. He would take the first shot from that position and flee. His co-conspirators had set up in other buildings and would finish off the targets as he distracted the guards.\n\nSergei made for his radio, hoping to get a final check-in before things began, but was interrupted by Yuri's voice briefly cutting in. It lasted only a moment, and nothing was said, but he could swear he could hear a scream in the distance. "Yuri, come in, what's going on?" he demanded. All he got in return was silence. Something was wrong. Looking through his scope, he could tell that security had not been tipped off, they were far too relaxed.\n\nAcross the street, on the roof of the legislature, he could see Andrei with the canister. All seemed to be going fine on his end, but he knew things were falling apart. Once again he looked across at Andrei, but this time he noticed something. In the shadow of the roof access door, a figure looked over Andrei's shoulder. The person was tall, dressed in an old uniform and winter clothes. The figure pulled a knife out of his belt and plunged it into his partner's throat.\n\nBefore he could react, the figure was gone. He got up to abandon his post, collected his things and made for the door. However, before he got far, he began to choke. The gas from the arsenal flooded the room. As he coughed and tried to cover his eyes he felt the kiss of cold steel in his back."

 RUS.15.desc: "The stranger came with the sunrise. He limped into town, blood trailing him from the forests around the village. Sofia had been walking to the market at the time, and she was the first to see him as he stumbled into town. Before he got far, he had slumped to the ground with a deep sigh.\n\nAs she approached the man, she could see his uniform was stained with blood. His breathing was shallow and his eyes had glazed over. In a near panic, she called for the village doctor. The young widow brought the man into her home and set him on the couch. The doctor was able to bind the man's wounds, but it would take some weeks yet for him to recover.\n\nSofia volunteered to care for the man as he recovered. For the first two days, the stranger remained unconscious only occasionally calling out in a foreign tongue. Sofia knew what it was at once, the tongue of the German was unmistakable. Despite the hatred she felt in her heart for the Germans, she continued to care for him. On the third day, he finally awoke. He had awoken in a panic, though it only lasted a moment. The man looked into her eyes and spoke in broken Russian his thanks.\n\nOver the next week, he recovered enough to help her around the house. Each day he would greet her with a smile on his face before beginning the day's chores. Every evening, after dinner, she would change his bandages and they would talk long into the night.\n\nEventually, he had recovered and made known his intent to continue his trek east into Siberia. On the morning that he was to leave, she met him outside the spare bedroom. For the longest moment, neither said a word. Finally, he leaned in and a kiss was shared between the two lost souls. The moment passed all too quickly, and he left the small house in her nameless village.\n\nHowever, unlike so many other times in his life, the stranger left with a promise. That he would return someday, at the next sunrise."

 RUS.16.t: "The Light of Hope"
 RUS.16.desc: "Andrei could hardly remember his life outside of the camp, it had been so long. Once, he knew, he had been of some import among his peers. He had been a leader in his community, with a wife and children. But his community had long since been profaned by the Nazi bastards that held him in thrall, its people murdered or enslaved. His sweet Alexandria had been worked to death only months into their imprisonment. Their children, proud Yuri and shy Anna, had been murdered only weeks into their stay in this hell.\n\nSomehow, he had survived the backbreaking labor, the starvation, the near-constant beatings, and humiliation. On some days it seemed as though God himself had picked him to suffer as Job had. However, he had no delusions that his story would end on as positive a note as Job's. Andrei dragged himself from the rack and trudged out of the slave barracks. It would be another long few days in the mine, and he felt that they would be his last.\n\nAs Andrei hefted his pick he heard a commotion from the direction of the guard's barracks. Suddenly, an explosion rang out. A fireball rose from the administration building. In the aftermath of the explosion, a shot rang out and the camp commandant's head exploded. Finally, the guards around the mine entrance started to rally themselves but, before they could get far, a group of slaves, armed with mining equipment, had descended upon them. Andrei had not even realized he had joined them until he felt the pick pierce the nearest guard's skull.\n\nThen, a voice pierced through the fog of war, "Come on you dogs, death to the fascists!" A group of partisans approached the mine, a man with the build of a woodsman at their head, and a strange man in a tattered uniform stood at his side, silent. "Well, glad to see you poor slobs join in on the fun. Come, we're getting you out of here, all of you." With those words, some small hope returned to Andrei's heart."

The people of Samara knew him well and in the district he called home he could name almost every resident. It was rare indeed that strangers found their way to his district, it was far enough away from anything merchants were interested in.\n\nSo it surprised him when he entered the local soup kitchen for his lunch and saw a strange man dressed in a tattered military uniform. He sat at his table, sipping at the soup in front of him as if it was an afterthought. After he had gathered his bowl, Leonid joined the stranger. "Hello there stranger, a fine day, yes?" The stranger glanced at him before replying.\n\n"Hello. Yes, fine day. Soup is good," the stranger's accent was muddled and foreign, and his grasp on the language was rather poor. Leonid could swear he had heard that accent before but, for the life of him, he could not place it.\n\n"That it is, Daria makes a good soup. You have the look of a wanderer about you, where ya heading?" Leonid had met many of this type before, folk who couldn't stay in one place for one reason or another.\n\n"East," was the man's reply. His shoulders slumped before he continued. "Have... business in the East. To atone," his voice was resigned, tired. The stranger could not understand why he had elaborated, it served little purpose, and yet he had.\n\nLeonid simply nodded. "I understand, more than you know, I suspect. I was something of a hellion in my youth, you know? Did a lot I wasn't proud of. I can be a good pair of ears if you would like to share. I find that talking helps, even if only for a time."\n\nThe stranger looked at him fully for the first time, his eyes filled with the weight of his regrets, and began to tell his tale. It was a long tale of strife and horror. By the end of it, Leonid truly understood. His accent was German, after all."

 RUS.18.t: "Simple Kindness"
 RUS.18.desc: "In the heart of Sverdlovsk, a stranger walked without purpose, thankfully the day was overcast enough to ground the German bombers. The man had come into town the previous night, to turn in a bounty on a group of bandits, and had taken residence in the local flophouse. As he walked through the streets of Sverdlovsk he passed by a small park. To call it a park was, perhaps, too generous a statement. It was just the largest patch of unblemished parkland left in the city. Still, he strolled through the area and observed those around him.\n\nOn days like this, without the risk of German bombs, families could be seen enjoying a rare day of peace. To be sure there were not many of them but those that were there filled the stranger's heart with a strange warmth. It had been so long since he had seen such peace among any of the people of Russia.\n\nHe came to a stop at the top of a small hill, scarred by bombs and scorned by the people of Sverdlovsk. He sat on the lip of a small crater, looking out at the people he had passed by. Before he could get too far into his reminiscing, he heard a small sneeze behind him. Turning, he saw the source. At the bottom of the crater sat a small girl, no older than six years old. She looked up at him in shock, eyes wide. Looking around for the girl's parents he motioned for her to join him. "Come here, little one. Where are your parents?" he asked, still searching.\n\n"I... I don't know. I can't find them!" she spoke, her voice quivering on the edge of tears. Before she could break down in hysterics, the stranger held up his hand.\n\n"Come along, we will find them," the man took her hand in his and brought her down the hill. They spent almost an hour searching for her parents, but in the end, they found them. The two looked like they had been run ragged, their faces were twisted in panic. The little girl rushed from his side to her parents as they sagged in relief. Before they could thank him, he had melted into the crowd and disappeared."

He struggled to breathe as the particulates that the rock gave out seemed to collect in his throat, and he could feel his muscles weakening. It wouldn't be long now, he knew, until he would collapse and have to be dragged out of the dark tunnels and into the infirmary.\n\nHe also knew that he would be replaced in an instant, and some other poor slob from the work camp would be forced down into the darkness to dig the tunnels until they collapsed. Lev had been at this labor camp for almost two years. He had run afoul of some party bylaw or another and had been exiled to this hell. His breath was coming in shallow gulps at this point, he knew he was nearing the end. He might even be left to rot by the guards if he was especially unlucky.\n\nBefore he could make his next move he was stopped. In shock, he looked at the man who grabbed his shoulder. It was one of the guards, one of the mercenaries that were paid to supplement the garrison. Gently, the man took his pickaxe in one hand, with the other he pushed a canteen into his hands before motioning him behind the crew. The stranger then took his place on the line, swinging Lev's pick with a vigor that shocked him.\n\nLev sat behind the line and drank greedily from the canteen. His breathing returned to normal and the aches in his body seemed to lessen. After ten minutes, he returned to the line. The strange guard took the opportunity to take over for the worker next to him. The guard kept an almost supernatural pace, even as he slowly cycled through every member of the work detail he never seemed to tire. When the commandant called an end to the work for that day, Lev's crew walked out of the tunnels with smiles on their faces.\n\nThey would never see the strange mercenary again, he had collected his pay and left the next day, but they would always remember him for taking up their burden."

They had recognized his worn uniform on sight. A German dog, of the Wehrmacht no less, had dared to pollute Russia's soil with his filth. The most frustrating and infuriating thing of all, in Viktor's mind, was the man's actions. Unlike the filth who bombed the countryside, he was helping people. He defended families from bandits and slavers, and he aided farmers for only a pittance of food. The bastard thought he could be redeemed, but Viktor knew that the only redemption the pig would have is death.\n\nViktor and his men caught up with the man the next day and immediately began their attack. Despite having the element of surprise, Viktor found that the stranger was quickly turning the tables on them. Already, three of his men were dead and another two were wounded. He would not give up, however, until the bastard was dead. Viktor threw himself at the man, wrestling him to the ground and stabbing at him with his knife. However, before he could gut the pig, he felt a burning in his stomach. Viktor looked down at the cold steel embedded in his gut and slumped over.\n\nThe German got to his feet and approached him as he bled out into the snow. He reached down and dragged him to a tree. Viktor tried to fight back but he could hardly move. Then, the man began tending to his wound, cleaning it and applying bandages. When he finished, he stood and began to walk away. Viktor gathered himself enough to force out his words. "This changes nothing, German pig! You deserve death for your crimes! All of you bastards do!""

Even the near dissolution of the Republic had left the library untouched. Its walls housed the knowledge of all Russia. The caretakers of the library had done all they could, with the generous help of the Salons, to keep its grand archives in shape. Indeed, the library was one of the few places in all of Russia that could maintain and preserve the manuscripts of Russia's past.\n\nVadim Pevtsov had watched over the library since his youth before the fall of the old Union. Soon, it would be time for him to retire and allow his successors to take over. However, before he could, he had one last contribution to make. He sat nervously in his office, practically vibrating in his seat, as he awaited news from the man he had hired. It had been almost a month since he had sent the wanderer on a mission beyond the Urals. The man was to infiltrate Perm and return with the greatest bounty in all of Russia, the original Ostromir Gospel manuscript. The text was held hostage in Perm, a sign of legitimacy for the "Aryan" regime.\n\nAs the day turned to night, Vadim began to give up hope that the manuscript would be recovered. However, before despair could grip his heart the door opened. The stranger strode into the room, with a slight limp he noticed, with a duffle bag carefully cradled in his arms. Without a word, the man set the bag down onto his desk and opened it. He took the medieval text from the bag and gently placed it in front of him.\n\nVadim was frozen in shock and excitement. He had doubted the stranger's abilities and yet here he was, manuscript in hand. Vadim examined it closely, seeing for himself the damages wrought by the Nazi's neglect. It would be a long process, but the manuscript could be saved and restored. He moved to thank the man but saw he had slumped down in the chair, asleep."

As his fire crackled in the night he looked up into the sky. It was awash with stars, more than he had ever seen before his exile. Soon, the sound of the fire lulled him to sleep. The memories came then, twisted by his mind, and laid bare before him. He saw flashes of his life under the "glorious" reign of the Nazi Party. The comradery and nationalistic fervor that became a fact of life for the Reich's citizens.\n\nHe saw his mother, proud and beautiful, laid low by an illness that poisoned her blood. He remembered the doctor's face, sneering about her impure ancestry. It was the last he saw of her, before his conscription. "Serve the Fatherland in its army or die like the mutt you are, boy." The words of the Gestapo agent echoed in his mind.\n\nHis father, a proud soldier of the Reich, was arrested for polluting the Aryan gene pool and his wife's Jewish ancestry. He got the news of his execution on the front of the West Russian War.\n\nFinally it came to his victims. The brutality of the fighting in West Russia would stay with him for the rest of his life, he knew that, but it was the reprisal operations that truly haunted him. Villages depopulated by his unit. The men rounded up and shot, begging that their families be spared. The women and children were locked in their homes, in their churches, and burned.

In emulation of the traditions of the old Rus, they had taken over a local watering hole in Kemerovo to celebrate.\n\nBandits were a constant plague within the corpse of the Soviet Union and, on any other day, the death of another barely coherent rabble would be of little concern to the Kingsguard. This time though, the bandits had fought more akin to a Soviet Guards regiment than any bandit lord's troops. The battle had been fierce, and many brave souls had fallen, but the tenacity of the Guard could not be denied.\n\nAmid this raucous celebration, an anomaly could be seen. In a quiet corner of the bar, seated with some of the more grizzled veterans of the guard, was a stranger. The man looked almost painfully average. His eyes were a simple brown, and his hair was of a similar shade. Of his features beyond that none could remember, the vodka had flown liberally and left holes in their memories.\n\nThis stranger was an honored guest of the Kingsguard, as he had been integral to the Guards success in that fateful battle. Every once in a while, one of the younger men would break off and offer a drink to the man, and every time he would politely decline. Instead, he would buy the man who offered a drink and send them on their way. He spent the night in quiet conversation with the veterans. None knew what words they exchanged, though the one thing everyone present would remember was the melancholy smile that left the stranger's face only when he set out into the wilderness the next morning."

The man was a stranger, certainly from the west, and had paid well to join him in his small fishing boat. Pavel watched him from the corner of his eye. The stranger had cast his rod and was now leaning back into his chair, a cold local ale in his hand. "What's ya name, kid?" he asked to break up the silence. The stranger seemed startled and hesitant to reply.\n\nAfter a minute, he replied with a quiet "Alexander" before going back to nursing his ale. Pavel simply nodded." A good name, Alexander. A strong name. Where are you from? I don't recognize your accent," Pavel was interested. He rarely had company on his fishing trips and wanted to make the most of it. Again, Alexander seemed surprised. With even more hesitation than last time he spoke.\n\n"I'm from the west. Far to the west. Past Moskow." Something strange passed in his eyes as he looked out over the waters. Pavel was curious, he had grown up in West Russia under the Tsar, and yet he could not for the life of him place Alexander's accent, as faint as it may have been. "Well, you've certainly come a long way. Let me be the first to welcome you to Baikalia. It is a beautiful place, if you can ignore the tyrant... never mind." Pavel was quick to change the subject, in case the man was one of Yagoda's dogs. "Have any family?" Alexander looked pensive and a great sadness could be seen in his eyes for a moment. "I did. They are gone now. It has been ten years." He seemed surprised at his reply. As though he could not believe it could have been so long ago. "My father used to take me fishing when I was a boy.

Where much of the people of Russia had become jaded and disillusioned with life in the anarchy, the people of Sablin's state were idealistic in the extreme. Perhaps even more surprisingly was the fact that their idealism was not blind to the realities of the world. They knew how unfair the world was, but they fought against the darkness regardless.\n\nAs the stranger walked through the streets, observing the excitement and happiness that surrounded him, he could not help but be caught up in it himself. He was no socialist, but at the same time he could not help but understand the appeal. As he walked, a man in the uniform of Sablin's Red Army approached him, hands well away from his weapon. "Greetings Comrade! What brings you to our fair city?" he questioned with a smile. The stranger was struck by just how genuine it seemed to be. "I am simply passing through. I will be seeking lodgings for the night before moving on. I am heading east," he replied. He saw no reason to lie to the man, unlike in Yagoda's territories he was unlikely to be murdered for saying the wrong thing.\n\n"Very well, Comrade. I would recommend you go down Main Street for three blocks, on the left side of the street is a small hotel. Perfect for travelers like yourself. Uhm. If you do not mind my asking, what brings you to the Far East?"\n\n"In truth, I do not know. Not really. I have wandered Russia for years. It is just another trek for me."

The White Army soldiers who stopped him at the border were more interested about news from the west than they were his identity. From there he found himself following the road for a short time before entering the city of Chita. As he entered the city he could sense the tension building around him. Groups of soldiers glared at one another across the streets. Men loyal to the Tsar were outnumbered by men loyal to the old White Army generals who ran the Principality. Yet he could tell that these divisions were fresh, exceptionally so. This is something that could take years to boil over.\n\nDeciding to put the tension out of his mind, the stranger walked down the streets until he came to a small hotel. Entering the lobby, he could see other road weary travelers sitting around the fireplace. Walking to the front desk, he ordered a room for the night and went to lay down. He took off his bulkier outer layers and laid down on the bed. As he lay there, his hand wandered to his left side where burn scars could be seen dominating his flesh. The man thought back to the night he got them, when he tried to play hero and finally follow his conscience for the first time in that damn war. It had ended with his body burnt and the people who he had tried to save dead.\n\nHe was broken from his reminiscence by a scream coming from the room next door. Without hesitation he had sprung from his bed, old service pistol in hand, and bashed in the door to his neighbor's room. Inside, a man in a White Army uniform had pressed a young woman to the wall, his pants already around his ankles and a knife against her throat. He was barely able to turn before three shots rang out. The rapist fell to the floor without a sound, the girl ran out of the room and downstairs, and he sprinted back into his room. He gathered his gear, opened the window and jumped. He would have to find another place to sleep."

 RUS.27.t: "Death in the Family"
 RUS.27.desc: "Vitaliy Grinin was a simple man. A farmer in the rather barren lands of the Russian Far East, a loving father, dutiful husband, loyal soldier of the Red Army, and one of the few Jewish men in the Far East. Vitaliy Grinin was dead, cancer had claimed him in the night. His family, lucky enough so far as to avoid the attention of the mad Vozhd in Zeya, could now only mourn him. It was dangerous to be seen as a Jew in this land. The Amur regime would soon have them all in camps if they were not careful.\n\nVitaliy's oldest son, Benjamin, had put out a discreet call for volunteers to aid in the Taharah. Slowly, they came from outlying villages. Ben recognized all but one of those who came. A man who had the look of a wanderer about him. As they began the cleansing of Vitaliy's body, it was clear that the man was not of the faith, yet he was determined to see the rituals through. Eulogies were made in memory of their fallen father. Finally, the body was wrapped in his prayer shawl and sheet. As his body was lowered into the grave, the Psalms were read.\n\nWhen the time came for Shiva, Ben and his family retreated to their home and the visitors slowly left. The stranger did not leave, however. He stayed silent as he sat with them in their home. Finally, Ben spoke up and asked a simple question. "Why?" The stranger looked intently at him, a light of embarrassment seemed to pass in his eyes before he spoke.\n\n"He saved my life. In the war. I did not deserve it, and yet he saved me," his reply was met with confusion at first. What could he mean? Was he a soldier of the Red Army? A deserter perhaps? Then, with the force of a train it hit Ben. Vitaliy had told them a story years ago, of a young German soldier who disobeyed orders and was shot by his comrades for trying to save Russian civilians. He looked at the man in a whole new light, and as the night fell he stayed. He stayed until the Shiva was over. The week passed and he left on the eighth day."
 RUS.27.a: "Protect me, Eternal One, for I seek refuge in You."

 RUS.28.t: "Death of Hope"
 RUS.28.desc: "Vasily had lived in Magadan for his entire life. In the time since the fall of the old Union, the town had seen many highs and many more lows. The lack of trade practically erased the local economy and the pirates and smugglers out of Kamchatka were the only freight leaving the city these days. Vasily had been the head of the dockworkers' union before the RFP took over, and he was only narrowly spared the noose by denigrating himself and denouncing the union in front of his former friends. Now, he sat outside a local bar puking his guts out after another long day of drinking.\n\nWhen it seemed that he could stand on his own, he tried to rise but only managed to puke on a stranger's boots. He coughed out an apology and readied himself for a beating that never came. The stranger helped him up and steadied him before he could tip over. "Here, drink." he heard before a canteen of water was thrust into his hands.\n\n"Thans, sorry bout th'boots. I'd offer to gett'em replaced but, well. I spent my last ruble on the booze I jus' spat out," the stranger flinched back as his breath hit him. The man took his canteen back before escorting Vasily back home, if one could call his shack on the outskirts of the city home. Sitting on his rusted bed he saw the stranger sit on an old barstool he had lying around. The man peered at him a moment before showing him an old and worn photo.\n\n"Do you recognize them?" Vasily looked closely and realized he could.\n\n"Yeah, that's old Aaron and his family. Look kid, if you're looking for them, ain't no point. They were purged before the RFP split. All of 'em are dead now. I'm sorry."\n\n"I see, thank you." The stranger stood suddenly and turned to leave, though not before dropping a stack of rubles on the stool."
 RUS.28.a: "A final hope, dashed."

 RUS.29.t: "A Sermon at the Edge of Civilization"
 RUS.29.desc: "Alexander sat in the rear of the church, listening enthralled as the Priest gave his sermon. It had been years since he had attended a service. Before the West Russian War he had been an avid attendee, but the war had tainted him. In his mind he no longer deserved the peace he had felt among the pews. He had no plan, not anymore. The only thing keeping him from sitting down in the snow and letting himself die was the promise he made all those months ago in Vyatka.\n\nHis wanderings had finally led him to the isolated village of Omolon. He had heard rumors of a preacher in the far north, an inspiration to the downtrodden in the region. Now, he sat and listened to the "Father" preach from his podium a message of peace and tolerance. His oratory was enthralling and his message was one he could support, for the most part. Alexander could definitely see just why the man was so popular.\n\nWhen the service came to its end, Alexander approached Father Men. He asked for an audience to hear his confessions and joined him in an office at the rear of the building. When they arrived, he sat, and for the first time in so many years he gave confession. He spoke long of his crimes, of his compliance with orders most foul, and of all the people he had murdered in the service of Nazis and their evil. At the end of it all, Father Men spoke.\n\n"You have seen and done things few can understand, and I can see how they weigh on your soul. Yet, you have done the utmost to atone for those past actions. I have heard stories from the west of your actions. Your past is overshadowed by the evil of the Nazis, yes. Yet your future can be one of peace and love, if only if you allow yourself to move on. Remember the dark times but do not be consumed by them."\n\nAlexander felt the weight on his soul lessen ever so slightly, though he knew it would take more than a single conversation to heal his wounds. Alexander allowed himself a moment to pray before leaving the priest to more important business."
 RUS.29.a: "On the road to inner peace."

 RUS.30.t: "Corporate Warfare"
 RUS.30.desc: "In the city of Novosibirsk, a group of men in corporate uniforms marched in the streets. They had been sent by Sibir HQ to intimidate the owners of a small steel mill in the industrial district. At their head was a young officer by the name of Andrei Ugolev, a rising star in the corporate security world. They approached the mill from the south, truncheons in hand. From the north; however, came another group of corporate guards. These men, from Feniks by the looks of them, were armed with rifles and the occasional shotgun.\n\nAs the two groups came nearer to one another a third faction made themselves known. Around the entryway to the mill, a small group of workers led by a strange mercenary sat behind makeshift barricades. Armed with an assortment of old Soviet era rifles and pistols, they were led by a well armed stranger clad in an old uniform.\n\nWhen the two corporate teams caught sight of one another, all hell broke loose. The more heavily armed group opened fire, killing and wounding most of Ugolev's men. As he huddled behind a low wall around the mill he attempted to rally them, only to find they had either died or fled.\n\nThe workers let their displeasure be known then, as the stranger leading them shouted an order and opened fire on the corporate goons. The mill worker's sudden intervention came as a shock to the Feniks force, who were just able to secure cover after half of their number were killed. The stranger then pulled a small object from a pouch on his belt before throwing it in the middle of the remaining Feniks forces. An ear splitting bang and a shower of shrapnel was the last thing they knew before they were ripped apart.\n\nAndrei looked around at the dead men all around him, his friends and enemies, and could only feel a sort of numb acceptance. When he awoke this morning, he had been somebody, a rising star. After today, he would be lucky to beg for scraps at Corporate HQ."
 RUS.30.a: "The rising star must fall in the end."

 RUS.31.t: "Skirmish in the Mountains"
 RUS.31.desc: "In the borderlands of Mongolia, men of the Red Army and their allies under the command of Lieutenant Leonid Morozov investigated rumors of incursions by Mengjiang. The soldiers were joined by a stranger from the west, a mercenary who tipped them off about an incursion by Mengjiang scouts.\n\nLeonid had been hesitant to trust the man, but the potential impact of a surprise attack from the fascists in Mongolia could not be understated. As they passed through the mountain passes into Mongolia, he could tell something was wrong. Leonid ordered his men to come to a stop, the winds had shifted and the air was heavy with a tense air. He saw the glint of the scope a second too late, he was thrown off of his feet as the bullet pierced his side. Leonid fell to the ground as his men scrambled for cover among the rocks of the pass. A hand gripped him by his uniform and pulled him behind a large boulder. It was the mercenary.\n\nThe stranger bound his side and returned fire against the enemy troops pouring into the pass. Dimly, he could see his men struggling to lay down fire against their foes. A small group had made it back to the supply truck, securing anti-tank weapons and ammunition. The man who had saved him barked orders to those around him, rallying his troops to better mount a defense. Thankfully, his men had taken surprisingly few losses, and had begun to slowly push their attackers back.\n\nLeonid glanced back at the mercenary, only to see that he had disappeared. Ahead of the Red Army line, the mercenary ran into enemy fire with an RPG slung over his shoulder. The madman leapt into a ditch before aiming his commendered weapon at the mountainside above the enemy line. With a whoosh, the warhead flew into the mountainside and exploded. The cliff face crackled and began to fall into the valley on top of the enemy. As they scrambled to retreat from the landslide, a cheer rang out from his surviving men."
 RUS.31.a: ""Three cheers for the mad mercenary!""

 RUS.32.t: "Sunrise"
 RUS.32.desc: "It was a foggy morning in the lands of Vyatka when Alexander arrived in the village. His first stop was the doctor's house. When he had last been in the area, he had taken hits while hunting a raiding band from the Aryan Brotherhood and the doctor had saved his life after he stumbled into town. The door opened before he made it there and he almost bumped right into the man. He recognized Alexander right away and was surprised when he placed a bag into his hands with a quiet thank you.\n\nBefore the doctor was able to say anything he was already down the street and nearing his true goal. With a feeling of trepidation, he knocked on Sofia's door and waited patiently for her to answer. From within he heard the sound of muffled cursing before the door was pulled open. She was disheveled in the extreme, as she always was in the mornings, and did not register who was at the door for a long moment.\n\n"Hello Sofia, it has been far too long," he said. At once, her eyes opened wide and she let out a gasp. Suddenly he was pulled into a tight hug, his back popping as she gripped him like a lifeline. He was quick to return the hug, though not nearly as tightly, and kissed her on the top of her head. "It is good to see you again, Sofia."\n\nWithout preamble she pulled him into the house and into a deep kiss before dragging him into the kitchen. As he watched her dart around the kitchen and heard her voice chatter away about the news out of Vyatka he felt a smile stretch across his face. He was almost surprised when he felt a sense of true happiness flow into him for the first time in years.\n\nThat night with Sofia in his arms he slept soundly for the first time since the West Russian War, the nightmares refused to come and he felt closer to peace."
 RUS.32.a: "Perhaps happiness was attainable."

 RUS.33.desc: "Our geologists have presented us with an interesting proposal. Within the archives of Irkutsk old plans for a survey of the northern parts of Sakha have been collecting dust. They were expecting to find diamonds and other valuable minerals there, but like so many other great and ambitious projects that were supposed to be part of the Siberian Plan, this one too fell apart after the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Now we have a chance to turn these plans into reality. While it will likely be a long and costly endeavor, the mere prospect of finding a diamond deposit on the scale of Yakutsk's is too tantalizing of an opportunity to miss out on. Whenever the state is ready to allocate resources towards this project, the army's engineer corps stands ready to put their shovels into the hard, inhospitable ground."

A schoolteacher reached for a pad of paper to take notes before realizing that she had none. "...that under the Law on Land and Property Restitution as passed by the Veche of the Russian Republic on 18 December, 1973..." An aging, stolid Bavarian launched into a blistering political tirade, spittle flying in the air, as Vasily nervously eyed the rifle mounted on the wall. "...your residence has been classified as Schedule I Expropriated Land Belonging to the Russian People." A quailing Dutch housewife asked what it all meant in the broken German her husband had taught her.\n\n"Accordingly, in thirty days legal ownership of your house and land will be transferred to its original, prewar owner..." A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background. "...and it is advised that you leave the property with all of your possessions by that time." An aging veteran said nothing, but gave Vasily a look of almost-sympathy, as if he somehow understood.\n\n"Please refrain from damaging the property. You will be charged for any damage you do the land prior to your departure." A sobbing construction worker was no longer listening. "The Russian state regrets that this action has to be taken, but believes it to be necessary in order to ensure the just compensation of those who lost property due to the German occupation. An elderly woman stared back at the newest ideologue on her doorstep with blank, almost lifeless eyes."\n\n"Do you have any questions?""

It is a new day for Russia, and begets the first time in over two decades that the scarred region seems to stand united in any real purpose, and behind any real cause.\n\nThe reaction from international onlookers to the cheering crowds is mixed, in Europe, many fear the Slavic revenge and the sudden possibility of retribution for their failures in the World War, while in America, many celebrate, leftists heralding this as the pendulum swinging back against the Nazis and Japan.\n\nIn Russia, however, the people are united. Even those who decry the Soviets and Communism can not deny the fact that a united Russia is the only hope the region has had in seemingly a lifetime, and already, many debate what, exactly, the nation shall do now."

Cheering crowds and marching soldiers can be seen in every major population center, with every village at least having one or two drunken militiamen waving the flag of this new union stumbling through its streets.\n\nIt is a new day for Russia, a new regime. The nation has experimented with monarchy, Communism and now, after its greatest defeat, ironically, fascism. Many look in surprise as the Russians seem to have adopted the same ideology as their most hated enemies, but at the same time many others see this as the natural reaction.\n\nTo fight your enemies, they say, you must become the enemy."

While many welcome an end to the cruelty and banditry that has been endemic to the nation's warlord era for long, behind a single autocratic military leader and his inner circle, Russia is now also a beast to be feared.

Allegedly, should the Reich decline enough, the Brotherhood's leadership may claim that the mantle of True Aryanhood will pass on their shoulders, and Germany must be brought to heel as a result.\n\nRegardless of the Brotherhood's intentions, most observers have reacted with shock and horror when analyzing the new Russia, and can only pray that it either becomes more benevolent or collapses soon..."

An entire generation of government, whatever the ideology, has struggled with establishing infrastructure or an industrial base of any kind, and what little is built is often promptly destroyed.\n\nBut not anymore. Millions of Russians have not had to make desperate runs to safety for days. Repairs to civilian and military infrastructure have progressed, and not been destroyed in turn. New constructions still stand. And a realization has dawned.\n\nThe bombers have stopped.\n\nTo those with access to information from the outside, it is believed that the civil chaos now engulfing the hated Reich and its colonial extensions in the Reichskommissariats has rendered it impossible for their aerial efforts to continue. To those without, it is believed by many to be a gift from God.\n\nEven as ordinary Russians celebrate with something approaching delirium, however, others speak of dark clouds on the horizon. The many Russian statelets, no longer suffering paralysis at the bombs of the Germans, are now free to look outwards. Only time will tell how they choose to proceed."
 RUS.999.a: "Clear skies. Dark clouds."
 
 RUS.100.t: "Another Day in Siberia"
 RUS.100.desc: "It was a cold, cold day in Siberia, as it always was. Snow covered the ground, hiding dirt that had never seen the sun deep below, and never would. As Artyom marched through it in boots and furs, a bundle of birds in one hand and his rifle in the other, he looked at the clouds above. They looked darker than normal, a sure sign of a storm.\n\nShrugging off the snow from his furs and leathers, he approached his ramshackle hut and slowly opened the door, carefully placing his items down on a table nearby.\n\nAfter a quiet moment of contemplation as he remarked over his quiet abode and lit his lamp, he scratched his dog, Sasha, behind the ear and turned on the radio as he did everyday, and frowned as he got nothing besides static.\n\nArtyom quickly started surfing through the few stations he reached, and found nothing but static, static, and more static. After some time, he shrugged, he had expected the old tilting radio tower near the equally dilapidated village to collapse for days now, nothing could be done. The outside world, and all of its wonders, were nothing but a distant thought for Artyom, and after a sigh, he turned off the radio for the last time."
 RUS.100.a: "Life goes on..."
 
 RUS.5000.t: "Another Day in Siberia"
 RUS.5000.desc: "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you fucking kulak?

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire USSR armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target.\n\nI will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.\n\nYou think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet you ass munching fascist? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, whitey.\n\nThe storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.\n\nYou're fucking dead, kulak. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred thousand ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Soviet Navy and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the earth, you little shit eating fascist insect. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

The rise in tension after the end of the German terror bombing resulted in conflicts that have led to the region's current power structure.\n\nThe Urals present both an opportunity as well as a threat to our nation. Seizing the area's resources and population would be a great boon to our cause. However, on the far side of the Urals another unifier state claims its legitimacy as the true Russian government. Were this opponent to capture the Urals, they would be able to station troops on our side of the mountain range, threatening our eastern provinces. We must thus assert our prominence in the region through any way necessary!\n\nOur diplomats and generals have prepared an array of tools to bring the Urals into our sphere of interest. It is projected that the side with the best combination of prestige, diplomatic success and military intimidation will be able to be the first to tip over local elites into accepting unification.

On the best of days, the communes would bluster and glare at each other from across the frontier and across the council chambers. Today, however, many in the Council of Orenburg realized that they had become practically obsolete. More and more the liaisons to the council by the resurgent Russian powers have become the real driving force in Orenburgian politics.\n\nThe rising powers in Western Russia and Siberia have exerted an overwhelming amount of influence on the once fractious council, that they have become an extension to the wills of the Russian powers. The last few remaining independent councilmen have been drowned out by some of the first unified voices the Communes have ever seen.\n\nThe free-thinking and independent people of Orenburg would grumble and complain, but compared to the might of the resurgent Russian powers a few irate farmers were a paltry concern.\n\nAt the end of the day, the councilmen would return home and grumble and the world would move on without them."

Orders had come down from the higher-ups that the Black Mountain was looking to take control of the region, and that he should expect to repel an assault from the Mountain. That was two months ago, and he had heard not so much as a peep from the Mountain in all that time.\n\nAfter another hour of waiting, the sound of trucks and men came down the road from the direction of the local rail depot. The depot and the trucks had been gifts from their new benefactor, along with directives on what to do with them. Konstantin had been hearing more and more rumors filter down from above, liaisons dictating more and more of what the League does. Even this posting had come down from the liaison's office.\n\nKonstantin has been a part of the League since its beginnings in the flight from Vorkuta, he led men in the war against Dirliwanger, and he had been instrumental in the training of Orenburg's militia. Yet, despite all that, he couldn't help but be worried. The more he heard about the new direction the League was headed, the more he couldn't help but worry."

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.15.d: "Under the shadow of the Black Mountain, Sergeant Andrei Konolev patrolled the villages of the Urals. He cringed inwardly as children shrank in fright as he passed, their mother's ushering them inside their homes. The things he and his comrades had done haunted his nightmares every night. He could only be thankful that his orders had changed recently.\n\nThe rising powers of Russia had turned hungry eyes towards the Southern Urals. Economic aid flooded the region, new roads and rail lines were built for the first time in decades, new factories were opened, and the lives of those under the gaze of the Mountain knew a markedly better existence than that of before.\n\nOf course, with these economic incentives came political meddling. At first the influence was minor, a change of policy here and there, but now it was clear that the Black Mountain was shackled to their benefactors. More often than not, Andrei got his orders from men outside his chain of command. Even this patrol, as minor as it was, came down to outside influence.\n\nAs he walked past another shuttered house, Andrei could not help but be thankful. With things as they were, it would not have been long before he was liquidated for his doubts and regrets. Now, the simple mundanity of patrolling the Urals calmed him.\n\nAndrei finally looked to his partner, Alexander. He was a better man than most, though not a good man - none of them could lie and call themselves good men. They had stopped at the edge of the village, away from fearful eyes and judging glares. Finally, he worked up the courage to speak, "Alexander?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"Do you ever wonder why we're here?""

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.16.d: "The Council of the Communes of Orenburg were in uproar. What differed from a normal day in the Council was the topic of discussion. The morning had started simple enough, until a messenger was admitted into the council chambers. He was a dower looking man, sent to Orenburg from the rising power of the Russian anarchy.\n\nThe news he brought came as a shock to them all. It was a demand that went against everything the people of the Communes believed in, and yet there was real debate on the Chamber floor about which way to go. For once, the council members were united into only three factions. There were those who wished to give in, to accept the - admittedly tempting - benefits and abandon the status quo, and there were also those who would not settle for simple bribes to abandon their hard fought freedoms.\n\nThe third faction, those that sat on the fence, would be the deciding factor in the overall decision of the Council. After many hours of shouting, and more than one attempt for either parties to get violent, the third party made their declaration.\n\nAs the representative from the third faction stood up the Council hall fell silent, the man stood at the head of his group and spoke: "We have decided that the Communes of Orenburg should...""

The days seemed to stretch ever longer for the priest, as more and more of his men, good men all of them, were taken in by the promises of the rising power of Russia. The League was at the precipice, a message had come in from the League's new benefactor and it demanded nothing short of total subordination of the Ural League under their rule.\n\nHe could see the benefits to joining with them clear as day, more food, medicine, and luxuries for the people under League protection, more men to defend the region, and yet the downsides were just as stark. He remembered the old days, the days when the hammer and sickle flew proudly in every city in the Union. He remembered the oppression, the brutality, and the death. He remembered being carted to Vorkuta along with hundreds of others to be worked until they froze. He remembered... and he hesitated.\n\nAs he had done innumerable times throughout his life, he prayed to God for his guidance. Though he had long been deaf to the guidance of the Lord, still he prayed that the choice he made today would bring his charges to a better life, a safer life.\n\nFinally, he made his decision.

Currently, he was mopping the remains of some NKVD soldier's lunch off the mess hall floors. As low on the totem pole as he was, Pavel was almost invisible to the soldiers and scientists of the Black Mountain. Around him, their tongues wagged freely, and he soaked up the gossip like a sponge.\n\n"I hear the bosses are in talks with the fascists. They have demanded our subjugation, or so I hear. The bastards," came the voice of one man.\n\n"Yeah? I heard it was the Revolutionary Front, or those Black League maniacs," came the voice of another.\n\n"And I heard it was the ghost of Comrade Bukharin, risen again to wreak havoc against the Germans," came Dimitri's voice. Pavel liked Dimitri, he slid him extra rations every once in a while. "The point is, we shouldn't put much stock into rumors. Whatever the truth, we will follow our orders in the end."\n\nIt was true, of course, the NKVD troops would follow the orders that filtered down from higher up, no matter how heinous. Pavel remembered the screams and the bodies of those in the labs. He disliked when he had to clean those places. He could almost hear the damned souls in torment whenever he did."

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.19.d: "The Communes of Orenburg have sent out a request for our aid. Our rivals for the control of Western Russia and Siberia have been putting immense pressure on the Communes. They have promised riches in exchange for their fealty and the Communes have no intention of bending.\n\nThe Council of Orenburg is prepared to make certain concessions for our support. Similarly, the clout we would gain in the political arena within Orenburg cannot be understated. If we can keep Orenburg independent, for the time being, we will deprive our enemy of important resources and ensure that the Communes are more willing to integrate in the future.\n\nWith that said, it is a risky proposition. If they do not back down, we could easily be drawn into a war we are not for. Similarly, the Communes are not likely to be any help of note in any potential fighting, as their small size ensures. Ultimately, the balance of power in the region is in the balance, and whether or not we act will decide the fate of Orenburg and potentially of Russia itself."

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.20.d: "Konstantin Koryavov watched the border to the lands controlled by the Ural League with trepidation. He and his men had been given orders to form up along the border in preparation to cross it. That had been three weeks ago, and he and his men were beginning to tire of the waiting. From what he had been told by Colonel Oborin, the bastards on the other side of the Urals were preparing to invade League territory.\n\nHe had known men from the Ural Guard, strong men and brave, every last one of them. The thought of abandoning them to their fate turned his stomach, and yet if that was the order he would have to go through with it.\n\nKonstantin turned from his position overlooking the border and walked back to his command tent. The only thing he knew for certain right now was that a request for assistance had been sent to the capitol and there was much debate among the higher ups on what to do. With a final sigh, he walked into the slightly warmer air of the tent.\n\nBefore he could do much, he adjutant had handed him a message, one marked for his eyes only.

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.21.d: "Deep in the Ural wilderness, Sergeant Nikolai Petrovich lay on his belly overlooking the border with Magnitogorsk. His unit was currently stationed to act as recon for regular divisions stationed in the interior. His men were a motley bunch, made mostly of old backwoodsman and survivalists who had joined up for a steadier ration count. Despite their ragtag nature, they were loyal and very well disciplined.\n\nAt the moment, Nikolai's men watched as an NKVD man from the Black Mountain patrolled the village below. Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region - even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\nThe subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started. He could see men in a different uniform, a very familiar uniform, moving in on the village from the South. The NKVD forces within the village were bloodying their attackers, but were slowly being pushed back for their trouble.\n\nBreaking radio silence for the first time in almost three weeks, Nikolai contacted his commander. After explaining the situation he awaited his orders."

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.22.d: "Terrible news! Orenburg has rejected our request for annexation. Their council has rejected our demand after hours of fruitless debate. There were some who wished to unite with us, but the opposing group in the end won out. It seems the only way we will get Orenburg into our nation is through bloodshed.\n\nEven worse, the power on the other side of the mountains has sent word to Orenburg that they can count on their support if they stand for their independence. This means a war with Orenburg will almost certainly lead to them invading us in response. A war that we expect, but aren't quite prepared for.\n\nWe are limited to two options. Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We do not bother with endless debate like the communes. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough... would it be wise to wait? A war will probably happen regardless. And it makes no difference if we delay our actions a bit to get in a more prepared position. We could simply take this setback and put our efforts into gaining an advantage."

And exceedingly so if they apparently have a great power backing them up.\n\nToday, Janis Mendriks rejected our proposal for integration of his League. The deal we gave him was not good enough, and his guard is prepared to resist us at all costs. It seems the Ural Guard does not fear us, and is prepared to try and fight us like they have against so many others. And, ordinarily, we would be happily obligated to challenge them.\n\nBut there is a complication. On the other side of the mountains, another power will back the Ural League up. They have forces that can match us, and they have the equipment to back the League up. It will mean a massive war with another major power, at an inopportune time.\n\nWe have two choices. Either we get involved with a massive war which will only end when the other power is defeated, or we slink off back to the shadows after being confronted by another claimant to Russia. It's really a matter of if we think we can win. Is a fight right now advantageous or not?"

But fewer expect the right for it to make its own decisions to be respected by anyone. Much less a nation that seeks to become the rightful government of Russia.\n\nMagnitorsk has not responded to our proposal at all. But we have gotten a message from the other side of the Urals. It states, quite plainly, they will declare war on us if we attempt to enforce our demand in any way. This is, quite obviously, a big problem. Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

In recent days more and more units have arrived at our borders and are stationing themselves in what seem to be predetermined positions. At this point it seems certain that one of our neighbors has given up on diplomacy and is preparing to invade! We must mobilize the NKVD regiments and ready the fortifications.

At this point it seems certain that one of our neighbors has given up on diplomacy and is preparing to invade! Without a leader or government to organize a response, the communities of the region will be left to fend for themselves. Time is short and we have no chance of mounting an organized defence.

 RUS_tourist.1.t: "Casting Off"
 RUS_tourist.1.d: "With a compass in hand and butterflies in stomach, he gazed off towards the visage of Anchorage, rapidly shrinking away into the horizon. A game of cards, and a hearty serving of alcohol had certainly done wonders to feed his excitement and wanderlust while they were docked in port, but he had to admit, it was hard to get the yesterday's goodbyes out of his mind.\n\nHis mother's reaction had not surprised him, a quiet bout of sobbing and a laundry list of demands as they stood before the front door. She had been nervous for weeks, and in all that time he had done his best to reassure her. This was something he needed to do, he would take all available precautions, he would have all the necessary documents. It was a conversation that seemed to never end. No, he had resolved any lingering strife with mom. It wasn't her that was spawning such remorse in his sea-bound heart. Surprisingly, it was Dad.\n\nTo say his father was an enigma would be an understatement. Childhood memories existed beyond count; missed baseball games, absent birthday parties, one word responses to kindergarten art pieces.\n\nIt was not that dad didn't care at all, per say. From time to time, he would show his affection, teach his sons to replace a flat tire or two. The problem was consistency, or lack thereof. At any moment, Dad might disappear into the basement again, or a car would pull out of the driveway and return hours after family dinner had ended. He never knew what to make of it. Perhaps the war had simply taken too large a toll, created a man who could only function on whiskey and lonesome hours.\n\nSo when Dad burst into tears in front of the taxi, launched into a bear hug, and handed his son a compass and pistol subtly before the car door closed, he couldn't help but feel shaken. Was he really making the right decision, if it could affect a man such as that so greatly?\n\nUltimately, he brushed the thought away and returned below deck. There was no turning back now, and he had a great and exciting adventure laid out before him. He would return alive, and ultimately, changed for the better."
 RUS_tourist.1.a: "Time to find what's out there..."
 
 RUS_tourist.2.t: "An Unexpected Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.2.d: "At the docks of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a boat has arrived from the city of Anchorage in the American state of Alaska. The only passenger is a young American man named Steve Smith who claims to be a tourist traveling alone, and has the documents to prove it. Determined but fresh-faced, it is hard to know if he will survive for long in the anarchy that Russia finds itself in, and up to us if he gets the chance to.\n\nLicking his lips, Ivan Yumashev's eyes skimmed the report once more, before he set it aside. Picking up a cigarette- a luxury these days, looted from a passing Japanese ship, he had heard- he proceeded to light it with his free hand. An American tourist, eh? That sure wasn't something you saw everyday. It might be worthwhile to come meet this American personally before he leaves, and give him a tour of the fleet. It might, for once, take his mind off of the sorry state of shameful piracy the Pacific Fleet had been reduced to."
 RUS_tourist.2.a: "If nothing else, it'd impress the men."

 RUS_tourist.3.t: "Entry 1: The Pacific Fleet"
 RUS_tourist.3.d: "Visiting Kamchatka was more eventful than I'd thought it would be. Sailors on military ships and on the docks alike stared at my boat as it came to a stop. When I told them I came from America, the sailors all seemed really excited for some reason, and a bunch of them wanted to shake my hand. I felt like a celebrity, almost. That feeling only increased when Admiral Yumashev, the leader of this 'Pacific Fleet' that controls Kamchatka, came to meet me in person. He said the city we were in was called Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and gave me a tour of his fleet. The admiral was really nice and patient, although his English wasn't great; he said he learned it back during the war, the big one, so he must be a couple decades out of practice. Still, it was better than nothing.\n\nSomething was off about the fleet though. The ships are outdated, but they must still need fuel and parts, which I didn't see any industry for, and I didn't see any trading vessels at the docks. I'd heard that the economy of Kamchatka depended on piracy, but I didn't think good men like the admiral and those sailors would resort to it. Still, I guess everyone needs to eat, and if half the things I've heard about the state of Russia are true I guess I can't blame them too much. At least Admiral Yumashev arranged for another boat to take me to Magadan."
 RUS_tourist.3.a: "Land ho!"

 RUS_tourist.4.t: "An American Visit"
 RUS_tourist.4.d: "A boat has arrived from Kamchatka carrying an interesting passenger - an American tourist. People do not usually come to visit Russia from the outside, especially Americans. After all, no one likes visiting war-torn wastelands, especially the spread out and frigid Far East. He probably won't even last a week without freezing to death unless we help him out somehow. We cannot let a naive American die in the wilderness, the least we can do is provide shelter for a few days.\n\nPerhaps Matkovsky could even meet with him! Being an American, he could be useful for reaching the leadership of the United States. We have always wanted a closer relationship with the Americans, so why not start now, when we have one right here! Matkovsky even believes he has connections to the CIA. What fortune!\n\nBesides, it would be a good way to show hospitality. The American ought to be impressed when he meets the true Vozhd of the Russians! No matter what, it would make a good impression will help us stand out besides all the other warlords surrounding us.\n\nHowever, maybe it could be a better and safer idea just to give him a general tour around Magadan. Letting him see the town will show him the true way of life in Russia better than any meeting with Matkovsky. Besides, the Vozhd is a busy man, and he may not enjoy wasting his time with a potentially worthless American. So, should we give him a tour of the town, or should Matkovsky invite him to a drink?"
 RUS_tourist.4.a: "Send him to Matkovsky and find the best vodka we have!"
 RUS_tourist.4.b: "Give him a tour!"

 RUS_tourist.5.t: "Entry 2: Meeting with Matkovsky"
 RUS_tourist.5.d: "I had a meeting with Magadan's "Vozhd" today, Mikhail Matkovsky. He seemed pretty fun and offered me some almost not awful vodka, but overall the experience was rather strange. He kept asking me about my connections to President Nixon and the CIA, weirdly enough. Maybe it's my hair?\n\nAfter I told him I was just an average American he seemed a bit disappointed. Then he asked about how life was in America and what I was doing in Russia. I told him I was a university student back home and I had come to visit so I could explore Russia and maybe have a little bit of fun and adventure instead of my boring life back home. I don't know what he said after that but I think it was something along the lines of how I'll be shot by the first bandit that gets anywhere near me, so oh well. Then I had a few more drinks and proceeded to tell him my dad was an astronaut in a secret mission to Venus as well as back in the war he had killed one hundred Japs with only a pistol. In reality, he's a mechanic and always has been. Matkovsky seemed to enjoy the story, however, although I don't know how much of it he understood. My Russian isn't the best.\n\nAfter our meeting he gifted me this enormous bearskin. I guess I should wear it? I already think I'm fine without it as I have my own fur coat but I accepted it anyway. It is very warm.\n\nNext I'll be heading up Yakutsk to see what is going on there."
 RUS_tourist.5.a: "At least he had fun?"

 RUS_tourist.6.t: "Entry 2: Touring Magadan"
 RUS_tourist.6.d: "I was given a tour around Magadan today. It's a fun town with lots of bars. They only serve vodka though, and to be honest, it's pretty terrible. The seaport is probably only big thing around. Still, there is a very cozy feeling about the place. A weird sort of cozy, because you can walk past a family enjoying a quaint meal and then look across the street and see a blackshirt officer beating up a hobo. Still cozy though.\n\nIt feels like Magadan is the only place around, even though I'm told there are a few more villages nearby. Still, it is certainly isolated, so I hope I can find my way to where I'm going next. There aren't many roads in Russia either.\n\nWhile we were touring I'm pretty certain I also saw a labor camp. Not sure if that was what it was but from the way my tour guide tried to keep me away from it, I'm pretty sure Magadan has a few populated labor camps. Hopefully, those will be the worst thing I see in Russia. From what I expect, however, some places may be far worse.\n\nOverall Magadan isn't all that bad. I do sure hope not all places are like this though. It seems the people have adjusted to the harsh life here. Some in different ways than others, but I'm glad I came. It's time to continue my trip, and I have a long way to go."
 RUS_tourist.6.a: "Still better than Amur!"

 RUS_tourist.7.t: "A Yankee Tourist?"
 RUS_tourist.7.d: "One of our borders posts along the Aldan river has reported an unusual visitor from Magadan.\n\nInitially, we expected him to be a spy from Matkovsky's band of fascists, but upon closer inspection, it appears he is nothing of the sort. The man explained to us that he is an Ameican tourist visiting Russia, and presented proof to support his wild claim.\n\nWhile we have no idea what would possess a person, let alone a well-off American to do such a thing, he appeared to pose little threat and was sent on his way to Yakutsk. We don't expect him to live for very long given his inexperience, but the least we can do is show him around our humble republic."
 RUS_tourist.7.a: "Who in their right mind would think Russia is a good place for a tourist?"

 RUS_tourist.8.t: "Entry 3: Yakutia"
 RUS_tourist.8.d: "Crossing the river into Yakutia was less eventful then I expected. The border guards were initially suspicious before I told them of my intentions. I don't think they believed me at first but, after showing them my passport and the ticket I purchased to Magadan, they sent me on my way to the capital.\n\nYakutsk was peaceful if not densely populated. The people were friendly, but not particularly fond of their government. From what I gather, Yakutia is dominated by mining interests who have mostly bought out the politicians and who commonly mistreat their workers. The miners I met spoke of harsh working conditions and poor wages.\n\nAfter purchasing some supplies and gathering my notes, I said my goodbyes and left the capital. Beyond Yakutsk, I saw little beyond the odd village or quarry and mostly followed the Lena River to the "Partisan Republic" of Aldan.\n\nGiven what I've been hearing about Russia, perhaps hiring a guide or bodyguard would be a wise move. Most of those I talked to seemed skeptical of my ability to tour the entire country and make back to the States in one piece. So, I hired a guide, a former partisan sniper by the name of Zoya Vasilevna Fedorovna (I think I spelled that right). She apparently arrived in the Far East when the Soviet government relocated, and has fought against the Germans. She isn't the friendliest, but she's experienced, and has traveled across much of Russia herself, so she seemed like the best choice for a guide. Since I've heard from the Yakutians how dangerous Irkutsk is, I've decided to go across Amur instead! Zoya seemed much less eager than me, but surely it isn't that bad, right?"
 RUS_tourist.8.a: "They were peaceful at the very least."


 RUS_tourist.11.t: "An American on the Border?"
 RUS_tourist.11.d: "Our men on the northwestern border, tasked with watching the mongrels in Aldan, have reported new arrivals.\n\nApparently a small party, counting among its number a Russian woman as well as a man claiming to be an American, has requested entry into our territory. The man claims that he is planning to travel across all of Russia, and would thus like to visit Zeya.\n\nOur men claim not to have found any reason to doubt him or his apparently legitimate travel documents. We must, however, be cautious. Although difficult and, thus, unlikely, it would not be impossible for a party of infiltrators from the renegades in Magadan or the relics in Chita to approach from the direction of Aldan in an attempt to find a border zone with weaker security.\n\nBoth groups would like nothing more than to see the Vozhd brought low, and put in chains. Or worse. If he truly is who he says, however, he offers a golden opportunity. Proving the strength and legitimacy of our government could potentially allow for us to gain more influence in the region, and would assist considerably in advancing our goals of regional, and eventually national, supremacy.\n\nThey do not seem to be planning insurrection against the Vozhd, but of course one can rarely tell the intentions of parasites, even if they were to make themselves known. What should we do with them?"
 RUS_tourist.11.a: "They are no threat. Let them continue to Zeya."
 RUS_tourist.11.b: "Arrest them. They are to be interrogated."
 
 RUS_tourist.12.t: "Entry 5: The All-Russian Government of Amur"
 RUS_tourist.12.d: "Although I am still working to improve my Russian, I am able enough to understand a tense situation. The kind of which we had while trying to cross into Amur.\n\nStopped by a border patrol of very rough-looking men, I found myself giving thanks to my earlier decision to employ Zoya's services. Through a combination of her rapid-fire Russian and my own documents we were allowed to proceed to Zeya, the territory's capital and the seat of the RFP's other Vozhd.\n\nI must say, when I was told in Magadan about how depressing a place Zeya in particular and Amur in general was, I was skeptical. But I am no longer. There is a pall of barely restrained violence hanging over everything, a feeling that, if one places their foot wrongly there will be immediate and severe consequences. I now well understand why Matkovsky's faction split from the one here.\n\nZoya and I have quickly established a beneficial working arrangement, even as we improve each other's language skills, and she has told me she feels the same. Neither of us particularly wish to remain here for any length of time, and so once able we will continue westwards, towards a land I am told maintains a pocket of old monarchism.\n\nAnd that has its own quarrels with Amur. I cannot imagine why.\n\nThat was a joke, Steve. Get better at writing sarcasm."
 RUS_tourist.12.a: "Leaving this place behind will be a blessing."

 RUS_tourist.13.t: "An American-Matkovskyite Agent?"
 RUS_tourist.13.d: "We made the right decision regarding the entrants from Aldan. The moment our men tried to arrest them, the woman, followed by the 'American' began resisting.\n\nAnd were, accordingly, immediately dealt with.\n\nOnce the bodies were disposed of, our men began investigating their belongings more closely. The woman had little of interest besides some Yakut trinkets and an ancient rifle from the western regions, but in the jacket of the false American a journal was found. And inside it was revelation.\n\nTrue to his words, the man did indeed appear to be from America, having entered through Petropavlovsk. His next stop after that, however? Magadan. Where he was not only welcomed within the city, but also had a personal meeting with the arch-traitor Matkovsky. We cannot know what they talked about, but given his subsequent journey, it no doubt involved us.\n\nThere have long been rumors of American support for Matkovsky and his faction, and the sudden appearance of this man has only strengthened them. Regardless, however, though we do not know what the American's ultimate goal was, we know he will not be completing it.\n\nWe can therefore take pride in our vigilance, knowing that another plot against the Vozhd's great mission has been foiled."
 RUS_tourist.13.a: "None will stop the Vozhd. Not even the Americans."

 RUS_tourist.14.t: "The Tourist"
 RUS_tourist.14.d: "There has been quite a stir in the city of Chita today, as a most unexpected kind of visitor has arrived in our territories from the East. Our border guards detained a young man who was initially thought to have been a spy from Rodzaevsky's gang, but as it turns out, he was actually a young American college student harmlessly touring the embattled wastes of Russia. Tourists are quite a rare sight indeed these days, but the potential dangers of Russia do not seem to have dissuaded him.\n\nAfter he was cleared and released, he eventually made his way to Chita, and began interviewing several of the locals. It didn't take long for news of this strange visitor's arrival to reach the higher rungs of the government, and now Tsar Mikhail II himself has expressed an interest in meeting this American. While we certainly wouldn't want to defy our divinely ordained sovereign's wishes, perhaps it would be for the best if he didn't speak to this outsider..."
 RUS_tourist.14.a: "We can schedule a meet, as long it is closely supervised..."
 RUS_tourist.14.b: "He can speak to the army instead."

 RUS_tourist.15.t: "Entry 6: The Man Who Would Be Tsar"
 RUS_tourist.15.d: "When I arrived in Chita, it was very obvious that this was a different environment to the one in Zeya. Although there were still soldiers on the streets, the people didn't seem nearly as afraid to go about their business in broad daylight. I thought I'd try and interview a few of these folks myself to try and get a feel for this place, but fate had something else in store for me entirely. One day, I was pulled aside by military guards on the street. I had first assumed that I was in some sort of trouble, but instead, they brought me to an opulent mansion not far from the city. As it turns out, the Tsar who supposedly rules this place wanted to see me personally.\n\nThe Tsar, Mikhail II, was not at all what I imagined. Firstly, he spoke fluent English with a distinctively British sort of accent. When I asked, he told me that it was actually his first language, and he was still learning Russian. Imagine that: the man who is supposed to be the emperor of Russia can't even speak Russian! He was quite humble as well, and seemed genuinely fascinated with my journeys, as well as the fact that I came here from America.\n\nHe became rather distant after I continued to talk about what it was like in America, and proposed instead to show me around the city of Chita. We had a lot of fun, but I couldn't help but notice some army types were following us at every turn. Come to think of it, the entire visit felt rather... off. Mikhail himself always sounded very nervous, and was constantly looking over his shoulder. Security at the mansion seemed way over the top for me. Were they trying to stop people from entering, or someone from leaving?"
 RUS_tourist.15.a: "Nosy Americans..."

 RUS_tourist.16.t: "Entry 6: Siberian Hospitality"
 RUS_tourist.16.d: "Chita was, by any stretch of the imagination, a breath of fresh air after the dreadful place I had come from. The people seemed relatively unafraid of the authorities and carried on without fear for their lives. At least at first glance, this so-called empire seems more civilized than those Nazi bastards back East. After a good night's rest in an unassuming hotel near the main street, I began interviewing some of the locals to get their perspective.\n\nMost were not very talkative, and pretty soon I had attracted unwanted attention from the soldiers keeping watch on the street. Looking back, I don't think I saw a single actual police officer during my time there. I was taken in for questioning by these troops, and was interviewed by what appeared to be some very high-ranking general types.\n\nThey were very rude, and did not seem too impressed with my story. The questions they asked were strange indeed: ranging from where I had stayed the night before to whether or not I had ever come into contact with their Tsar. I don't even know the guy, so I have no idea why they would think that!\n\nOnce the questioning was done, the guy in charge arranged for a truck to take me away from Chita and out of their territory. He finished off by saying he didn't want "nosy Americans snooping around where they don't belong." Certainly not the warmest of receptions, but I suppose it could've been a lot worse..."
 RUS_tourist.16.a: "One less problem to deal with."

 RUS_tourist.17.t: "An Opportunity from America?"
 RUS_tourist.17.d: "Our men along the border with the Whites have informed us that, minutes ago, a small party crossed into Buryatia, having departed from Chita.\n\nAmazingly, it is being led by an American, the very same one who, our propagandists inform us, is starting to gain a reputation. Apparently this man is intending to cross the whole of Russia, east to west, and stopping in as many states as possible, legitimate or otherwise. Though he poses no threat, he does offer an opportunity.\n\nOur struggle against the tyrants in Irkutsk is not well known outside of our lands, and support, diplomatic, financial, or otherwise, could be of significant assistance. If we can prove to this American that our cause is just, we could benefit. A longshot, to be sure, but many said that about our endeavor as a whole, and yet here we are.\n\nInvestment would be minimal. At the very least, the American is likely to be exposed to the revolutionary spirit of our people as he traverses our lands, and it has been suggested that a brief meeting with Sablin himself could compound this. Our leader's natural charisma is well-known, and with only a few minutes of his time it is possible, however unlikely, that should this American complete his journey a favorable portrait of us could be painted.\n\nSome claim that to even entertain such a notion is foolish, and beneath our notice, but many others urge us to seize the chance offered. What should we do?"
 RUS_tourist.17.a: "Invite him to meet with Sablin. We cannot pass up this chance."
 RUS_tourist.17.b: "A meaningless distraction. Let him sightsee."

 RUS_tourist.18.t: "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.18.d: "When we entered Buryatia, crossing the border from Chita, we, or rather I, certainly did not expect an invitation from its leader for a meeting. But that is exactly what we received.\n\nThe border guards had been suspicious, but not overly so, and allowed us to continue on to their capital at Verkhneudinsk without much trouble. Once we arrived, however, we were met with some very sharply-dressed officers, who informed us that Sablin himself wanted to speak to us. Or, rather, to me. What was more, I actually felt that the request was exactly that.\n\nSo, after of course accepting, Zoya and the others were well taken care of while I was shuttled ahead to his office. And, I must say, he seems a most impressive man. Almost impossibly young, with an easy smile, immense personal charisma, and an affable demeanor, I liked him from the start.\n\nI confessed to him that I knew little of the struggle he spoke about, the doctrinal split with the so-called 'tyrannical and bloodthirsty' regime in Irkutsk, but he seemed not to mind, saying only that he hoped, one day, that his state could open relations with America. Perhaps, he joked, with me as the Ambassador.\n\nI and we were shuffled out shortly after, but I found the whole experience most enjoyable. In addition, his men had given us several trinkets to carry with us, and Zoya had purchased several more from a small market besides.\n\nTomorrow we will depart for Irkutsk itself. I am curious to see if Sablin's characterization of it is accurate."
 RUS_tourist.18.a: "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.19.t: "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.19.d: "I was not sure what to expect when we first entered Buryatia. Those in Chita, government-affiliated or otherwise, had said nothing positive about it. A state in rebellion, yes, but also a state of communists.\n\nI feared the worst but, I am happy to say, have been pleasantly surprised. There is a certain energy about these lands that I have not yet found in Russia. A certainty that, whatever the future may bring, those here are fighting for something worthwhile, something better. A 'revolutionary spirit,' to hear them describe it themselves.\n\nI cannot say for sure if such is an actual thing, but the people here very much believe it to be so, and that seems to be enough for them. Zoya herself is very skeptical that any such enthusiasm could carry them to victory over a superior foe, saying that she knows 'very well' how much spirit counts for, but I can't share her pessimism.\n\nAs an aside, I have also noticed that people are treating me, treating us, differently. With more attention, deference, and approval. Apparently word of my journey has spread somewhat, reaching ahead of our travels, and is being received, by some at least, as a topic of great interest. The feeling is, to me, very strange.\n\nWe are soon to depart for Irkutsk itself, where we will no doubt see if the ones who control it are as tyrannical as those here claim them to be. I am curious to find out, in any case."
 RUS_tourist.19.a: "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.20.t: "An American Sablinite?"
 RUS_tourist.20.d: "A message has been received from our agents in Sablinite lands, regarding the departure of individuals from Verkhneudinsk on a course towards Irkutsk.\n\nApparently an American, reported as having originally arrived in the Far East at Petropavlovsk via chartered vessel is, along with several others, now proceeding towards our territory following reception in those of the rebels. While we cannot be sure of his or his party's intentions, we can be sure that there will soon be a situation requiring attention.\n\nAccording to the NKVD, the American in question was received by Sablin himself, and though whatever messages or words may have been exchanged are currently unknown, such contact is inherently suspicious. We also cannot, at this time, confirm the political orientation of his companions in general, and in particular that of one woman who has been identified as possessing considerable geographical knowledge and combat ability.\n\nIt has been recommended by several officers that we treat the group in its entirety as having been suborned by Sablinite practices, and thus move aggressively to capture and deal with them as such. Others, however, have urged restraint given the presence of a known American who has achieved some notability - and thus position in the public consciousness.\n\nWhat order should be given to our agents?"
 RUS_tourist.20.a: "Arrest them, but be careful. We don't want an incident."
 RUS_tourist.20.b: "Arrest them, but be vigilant. Open fire if necessary."

 RUS_tourist.21.t: "Entry 8: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet"
 RUS_tourist.21.d: "Sablin and his people had been very clear that Irkutsk and the 'tyrants' that controlled it would not receive us warmly, unlike himself. And they were right.\n\nThe moment we reached the frontier we were intercepted, as if they had known where we would be. Zoya told me that that was, most likely, exactly the case, our movements reported upon by NKVD agents. Every time she speaks the acronym I can hear the venom in her voice, though I can tell that, as much as she hates them, she also fears them, and that alone is enough to make me do the same.\n\nI soon understood the effect they had on people. The agents were men, yes, but their eyes were cold and hard as they searched our belongings and, after flat orders, our persons, in the most invasive way possible. They accused us of being Sablinites, our denials to which were flatly ignored. Then they asked more questions, and I could tell Zoya was growing uneasy.\n\nA potential disaster was averted, however, when they began asking me questions about my travels so far, and I realized that, regardless of their words, they were treating us with more care than they would have otherwise, for I, we, are becoming known. Indeed, shortly after they denied us entry and ordered us to depart to the south-west.\n\nOur group has not seen the Presidium's lands, and it seems as if we never will. If they are represented by the attitudes of the men who detained us, this is a state of affairs with which I am content.\n\nWe continue onwards, in any case. Not that we have any choice."
 RUS_tourist.21.a: "A tense situation."
 
 RUS_tourist.22.t: "One More Grave"
 RUS_tourist.22.d: "Another message has been received by our agents stationed along the border, and it is not positive news for the Presidium.\n\nApparently, shortly after intercepting and detaining the American and his party, they began displaying extreme agitation to both the questions presented and the searches demanded. This agitation, especially from the still-unknown woman earlier identified by our agents in Verkhneudinsk, eventually led to disaster.\n\nClearly convinced, correctly or otherwise, that they were about to be imminently executed, the woman reportedly killed one of the agents, seized his weapon, and attempted escape. The fight was brief but violent, and the woman killed several more agents before being shot down herself.\n\nAssuming that such action proved the party's identity as Sablinite infiltrators, the agents proceeded to liquidate the rest of the party, including the American. The bodies and identifying materials were quickly disposed of.\n\nWhile we will need to take action so as to ensure that the final fate of the American cannot be attributed to ourselves, we can be confident that, once again, the NKVD has acted as the sword and shield of the Party and the state as a whole."
 RUS_tourist.22.a: "Vigilance cannot be neglected."

 RUS_tourist.23.t: "A Memorable Border Encounter"
 RUS_tourist.23.d: "Always vigilant for potential NKVD infiltrators, the border guards of the People's Revolutionary Council, themselves long-serving Red Army men, quickly spotted the small party approaching from the direction of Irkutsk.\n\nQuickly moving to detain the party, the soldiers quickly found themselves quite astonished at the story communicated to them, first in broken and strangely-accented Russian from the man, and then with more expertise from the woman. Investigating further, their astonishment only grew as the man's travel documents were inspected, and the group's luggage searched.\n\nEventually accepting the story given, and listening with amusement at the 'reception' the man and woman spoke of by the authorities in Irkutsk, the guards permitted them entry into the PRC, directing them towards Organ. They also informed them, right before sending a radio message, that if they were not observed there in short order, the consequences could be severe, indeed.\n\nAs the party disappeared over the horizon and along the road, the soldiers completed their patrol, returning to their barracks shortly thereafter. That evening, over army stew and cards, they spoke with wonder at just what could have possessed an American to go trekking across all of Russia, and what the odds of his survival were.\n\nTheir sergeant won, giving him no better than one chance in ten."
 RUS_tourist.23.a: "But still, a chance."

 RUS_tourist.24.t: "Entry 9: The People's Revolutionary Council"
 RUS_tourist.24.d: "After our most unpleasant experience with the Soviet authorities in the lands around Irkutsk, we continued southwards, entering the lands of the People's Revolutionary Council.\n\nApparently a 'state' created in Mongolian lands by Red Army remnants, its capital, such as it could be called, had all the character of a military camp. And just about the equivalent friendliness of one. We spent some time securing small trinkets and stories from the local citizenry, but beyond that there is, sadly, little of note to write about.\n\nOne thing it did offer, however, was the opportunity to dispatch a letter back to America. For a very reasonable fee, a trader who was soon to cross through Mengjiang and towards the port at Dairen agreed to carry some mail. I hope it is received reasonably soon.\n\nCompared to my interactions with the locals, the experiences I shared with Zoya in these lands were far more interesting. She is a most remarkable woman, capable of easily inserting herself into the cultures of the states that we visit, and navigating complex internal politics with seemingly little effort. She is also, as I have discovered several times now, excellent at sensing dangerous situations and working to either avoid them completely or defuse them before they turn violent. I am again thankful that I secured her services.\n\nWe are proceeding onwards, intending to cross the internal demarcation line between the Far East and Central Siberia. I am curious to see what states exist. We have already seen such a variance in government here, and I wonder if this experience will continue.\n\nI hope it does."
 RUS_tourist.24.a: "A valued companion."

 RUS_tourist.25.t: "A Chronicle from the East"
 RUS_tourist.25.d: "Dear Mom and Dad,\n\nI'm alive! Or at least I was when I wrote this letter and in good shape. We're currently camped out in Tuva, and I guess that means I've successfully trekked through the Russian Far East. While I'd love to tell you about it in person, a letter will have to suffice for now.\n\nKamchatka turned out to be run by the remnants of the Red Navy. Its sailors were quite friendly, and their leader was even kind enough to grant me a boat to Magadan. Unfortunately, they've been forced to resort to piracy to make ends meet, given the region's desolate conditions. Magadan in comparison was fairly well off, its people look adjusted to their harsh conditions, and their leader Matkovsky seemed like a nice fellow.\n\nAcross the border, the Yakutsk Republic was dominated by mining companies, and while peaceful it was sparsely populated. It was here where I hired Zoya, an experienced sniper, as a guide to help me on my journey.\n\nCrossing into Amur, I entered into a territory ruled by thugs and murderers, where violence and brutality were common and unrestrained. Counting myself lucky to avoid injury, we crossed into Chita, a territory ruled by forces that seem to think the Russian Civil War still isn't over, with a Tsar from Australia at its head.\n\nFinally, we crossed into Buryatia, a land of idealistic revolutionaries fighting against the last tyrannical remnants of the Soviet Union in Irkutsk, a paranoid state which deported me into Tuva, now run by the remnants of the Red Army.\n\nWhile I still have a ways to go before I can get back home, Russia is a fascinating land, and I only hope that with Zoya by my side, I can traverse it all. Wish me luck, guys and I'll hopefully see you soon,"
 RUS_tourist.25.a: "Love Steve."

 RUS_tourist.26.t: "A Fresh Face in the Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.26.d: ""An imperialist spy," muttered Pyotr, "has to be". The ideologue of the Siberian Black Army had been pacing up and down his room, flicking through the pages of reports that had been trickling in from the border communes. An American, they claimed, had penetrated the border with a Russian guide (most likely a Reactionary collaborator) and had been visiting the communes. Pyotr studied the papers again, his eyes skimming over the Cyrillic type. This stranger was spinning an outrageous story about being a 'tourist', which was likely simply a thin cover for a CIA operative.\n\n"Maybe," interjected Stepanov, "he's just a tourist. Honestly, Pyotr, I respect your spirit but I doubt the CIA would send a college student who clearly hasn't seen a day of war or labor as a spy." Siuda's eyes narrowed at his military counterpart's words.\n\n"Perhaps he's here to spread authoritarian propaganda about how wonderful his capitalist hellhole 'democracy' is." Pyotr's reply seemed far less fiery than his initial words, Stepanov's assessment cooling his choler. The ideologue's face softened, "No, Comrade Ivan, you are probably right. Still, it could be beneficial to detain him and ascertain his true reasons for being here." He smiled slightly, "perhaps even arrange to have this tourist given a tour of our way of life, ignite the fire of anarchism within him that he might carry it back to America?"\n\nStepanov nodded, the idea had merit, but it wasn't up to either of them to decide, such was the way of anarchy."
 RUS_tourist.26.a: "Give him free rein."
 RUS_tourist.26.b: "Let the Black Army keep an eye on him."

 RUS_tourist.27.t: "Entry 10: The Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.27.d: "Me and Zoya have been in the Siberian Free Territory for about a week now, lots to write down. In the states, I was always taught that 'anarchy' was a bad word, like total chaos. This anarchy isn't what I expected and I'm having a hard time sorting it all out. Everyone lives in communes and are led by councils, which are elected by the locals. I made the mistake of asking if that made the Free Territory a democracy and some young guy in a black and red hat started yelling at me in Russian! Zoya translated for me, and this dude was going off on me about how democracy was just a 'veiled authoritarian mechanism', whatever that means.\n\nTo their credit, people seem generally content with the way things are, but their reactions to me have been pretty mixed. I've been stopped a couple times by excited villagers who smile and take pictures with me, but just as many times I've been jeered at, spit on, and I swear that I've seen uniformed men following me! I don't know what to make of this place. The people are definitely free, but the way they define freedom isn't something I'm used to. They share everything with each other, have total gender and sexual equality, but also live under a military junta. I came here not really knowing what anarchism was, and I don't think I understand it any more now."
 RUS_tourist.27.a: "They have the freedom to be free, but not much else."

 RUS_tourist.28.t: "Entry 10: The "Free" Territory"
 RUS_tourist.28.d: "What a horrible day. I was out in town, just seeing the sights when a group of black-uniformed goons grabbed me and dragged me away through an alley! Zoya was busy with negotiating a ride to the next commune on our list and must not have seen me getting snatched. The thugs took me to a shack on the outskirts of town and interrogated me in a mix of broken English and Russian. I didn't understand much, but I think they were accusing me of being a CIA spy! They didn't torture me or anything, just roughed me up a bit, so I guess that's the silver lining. I was there for a couple hours, I don't know how long, but eventually I heard Zoya shouting at the guards in Russian. They started shouting back, but eventually, Zoya got them to let me go. She escorted me out, and I swore she was going to burst a goddamn blood-vessel, she looked like a giant cherry in a shirt. Would have been funny if I wasn't scared shitless.\n\nAfter that shitshow, she took me aside and told me that I should just avoid talking to the locals altogether. Apparently, I had used some 'imperialist language' and a paranoid anarchist fanatic ratted me out to the Black Army. They put two and two together and came to the conclusion that I was a spy. Apparently, freedom here doesn't extend to thinking big bad imperialist thoughts or using words that are 'un-anarchist'. Man, screw this place."
 RUS_tourist.28.a: "Why does a free society have fucking thought police?"

 RUS_tourist.29.t: "An Interesting Opportunity"
 RUS_tourist.29.d: "Frontier guardsmen, stationed along the border with the Black Army, have reported the detainment of an unusual group of entrants.\n\nThe entrants, initially observed rapidly exiting the Black Army's territory and entering our own, were immediately detained on suspicion of their origins. They were then searched and interrogated for evidence of anarchist literature or leanings.\n\nHowever, it soon became evident that they were not anarchists at all, but rather the entourage of a singular American tourist, himself also detained, who is attempting to cross Russia from east to west while compiling a log of all the states visited. It was immediately suggested that this offered considerable opportunity.\n\nIf the American is invited to Krasnoyarsk, if he can be shown the dedication of the Provisional Government to democratic ideals, and our intent to spread them over all of Russia, we could potentially win a very significant diplomatic victory. Gifts will of course be arranged.\n\nWe will therefore escort him to Krasnoyarsk, as well as arrange both a tour of the city and an audience with General Andreev. We will show him why our state is superior to those around us, and in so doing, prove that the lands of both the anarchists to the east and the madman to the west would be far better served under our control.\n\nIt is most pleasing when such a possibility presents itself."
 RUS_tourist.29.a: "One must not waste such chances."

 RUS_tourist.30.t: "Entry 11: The Provisional Government of Krasnoyarsk"
 RUS_tourist.30.d: "After that unpleasantness in the lands of the Black Army, for which I will always give thanks to both Zoya and my earlier decision to contract her services, we crossed the Yenisei as rapidly as possible and were immediately detained.\n\nThe soldiers, claiming to represent the government in Krasnoyarsk, heard our story and contacted their commanders. Shortly thereafter, and to our surprise they told us we were to be escorted to Krasnoyarsk proper. Zoya was uneasy at the prospect, but clearly not having a choice in the matter, we conceded.\n\nI am happy to say, however, that her unease was unjustified. Krasnoyarsk is a most pleasant city, and as we were escorted through it towards what I now know to be the central government building, all I could see were clean streets, industrious people, and the largest railway junction I have ever seen.\n\nArriving at the government building we were met in person by, and I do not exaggerate, the territory's ruler, General-President Andreev. As one could be forgiven for assuming, I had thought a military-dominated government would be unpleasant, but speaking to the man about my journey and his own goals, I was surprised how dedicated he seems to be to the ideals of democracy, free trade, and more besides. I hope he is successful in his eventual reforms - liberty is of course deserved by all.\n\nWe make next for Kemerovo, to the west and across the Tom. Those here in Krasnoyarsk are quick to speak negatively of the city, the state it resides in, and its ruler, but I have learned by now that what people say is often not entirely representative.\n\nIn any case, we shall certainly see."
 RUS_tourist.30.a: "A surprising government, indeed."

 RUS_tourist.31.t: "A Strange Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.31.d: "An odd occurrence has been reported to us from our security forces arranged along the border with Krasnoyarsk. Apparently an American, of all people, appeared and subsequently requested entry into the Principality!\n\nAlthough initially detained on suspicion of being an infiltrator from Andreev's traitorous regime, the man provided ample proof of both his American citizenship as well as his continued journey across Siberia, from Petropavlovsk to, so far, Krasnoyarsk. He further explained that he is on a journey across Russia from East to West, visiting as many nations as possible and investigating their cultures.\n\nWith no reason to detain the American further, and no instructions from the central government to reject entry, he was permitted to continue through the border region. He is expected to arrive in Kemerovo itself in short order."
 RUS_tourist.31.a: "How curious."
 
 RUS_tourist.32.t: "Entry 12: The Principality of Kemerovo"
 RUS_tourist.32.d: "When I first crossed into Kemerovo, I thought that everything I had been told in Krasnoyarsk was true - the border guards were most unfriendly until I proved who I was. But having now been in Kemerovo for a few days, I see that things are not as I thought they would be.\n\nThe city is clean and orderly, as long as you ignore all the coal dust from the Kuznetsk basin, the people seem relatively friendly, and I'm certainly not seeing all the unpleasantness I did in Zeya, Irkutsk, or in the territory of the Black Army. Zoya certainly seems to enjoy it, at the very least.\n\nFar stranger than the city, however, is the government. As far as I can tell their ruler is a Red Army general who had a breakdown and began calling himself 'Emperor' Rurik II, and it doesn't seem like anyone can really explain to me what his actual goals are. The ones they can tell me about, however and very loudly, are his children - 'Prince' Yuriy and 'Princess' Lydia.\n\nYuriy seems to have some ideas similar to Valery regarding unions and the like, and wants to move towards a democratic system. His sister seems much harsher, wanting to continue absolutism and claiming it a simple necessity towards keeping order in a place as lawless as Siberia. It shook me a little how much sense that made to me - before I set sail I would have supported Yuriy absolutely, but after what I've seen so far in Siberia I can't discount Lydia's opinion so easily anymore.\n\nIn any case, I've spoken with Zoya and tomorrow we'll be heading south, towards Biysk, apparently the capital of a small nation of Orthodox Old Believers. I wonder what that will be like."
 RUS_tourist.32.a: "I wonder which sibling will win?"

 RUS_tourist.33.t: "The Land of Two People"
 RUS_tourist.33.d: "The strange group reached Gorno-Altaysk in the early morning. Local militias were confused about the newcomers. Couldn't be merchants from beyond the frontier; they had no wares. Neither could they be locals heading either to church or to the day's festival. In front of the group was a woman, clinging to her rifle. Next to her was a foreigner with a dreadful Russian, claiming over and over to be an American.\n\nAs often was the case, President Zavoloko was the one to break the deadlock. He asked for fresh clothes to be provided to the group. The foreigner would stand out much less in traditional Altay clothes. From there Zavoloko had the American shown to a local church. In late afternoon he would be free to attend a local Burkhanist festival, where songs would shared under Oyrotia's endless sky.\n\nThe bodyguard was welcomed in for questioning. After assessing that the group really were just travellers, and had no tie to any Central Siberian factions, Zavoloko politely requested from the woman as much information as possible on Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk and the Siberian Black Army. The region was waking, and dark clouds were on the horizon. Any information as to developments in Central Siberia was welcome in the isolated republic."
 RUS_tourist.33.a: "Is it true, then, that General Krylov has gone mad?"

 RUS_tourist.34.t: "Entry 13: The Republic of Oyrotia"
 RUS_tourist.34.d: "It seems I was ill informed. While everyone in Central Siberia has referred to Oyrotia as a nation of Old Believers ( the Russian Orthodox Schismatics exiled from Western Russia to this remote place), in fact the Oyrotian Republic is home to a large amount of Altaic people. I was invited to a festival, where songs and burning of sacred plants were carried on. I didn't understand much of the rituals, but there did not seem to be any shaman leading proceedings. It was a more communal sort of ceremony. The locals seemed indifferent to my presence.\n\nThe capital of the republic is not too different from any provincial town I've seen so far. Unlike Kemerovo or Krasnoyarsk, it seems this region has merely been forgotten by events. Isolated here in the mountains, it seems the two peoples of the republic want nothing more than peace and quiet. The lack of border guards and military checkpoints was commented on by Zoya. Hopefully peace continues to safeguard these people.\n\nWe've been sold horses! At a good price, too, it seems. It will help us make good time as we go down the mountains and head toward Novosibirsk. A merchant travelling in the direction will make the trip with us. It will be interesting to return to civilization, I hear Novosibirsk is one of the last big industrial cities in Russia."
 RUS_tourist.34.a: "The journey continues."

 RUS_tourist.35.t: "The Mile High Tour"
 RUS_tourist.35.d: "This morning, a bunch of horsemen in a caravan from Oyrotia stopped by while doing some trade outside of Iskitim. While the supplies they brought over were well needed, the Oyrotians brought a peculiarity with them. That is, one horseman was carrying an American flag. The traveler looked both incredibly like he belonged with the caravan, and yet incredibly out of place due to his body language and general appearance. Regardless, he was trading alongside our citizens and seemingly happy.\n\nAnd then he ran into some soldiers. Soldiers who he did not stop talking to.\n\n"My name is Steve, and I'm a tourist from America! I've heard of the aircraft plant here, and have seen your planes soar all throughout this part of Siberia! They're absolutely fascinating to me."\n\nWhile his Russian was rather broken and he could barely hold a coherent conversation, he was traveling with a native who explained his situation. Zoya, as she was called, gave context to Steve's story and explained his desire to travel the Russian warlord states in order to document his experiences. Of course, the soldiers wouldn't pass on an opportunity for some entertainment. They offered to take him to the capital, where they would "commandeer" an aircraft.\n\nSteve and Zoya generously accepted, and the soldiers decided to drive them to the capital. While on the way, Steve was spinning eccentric, heartfelt tales about his previous travels from Eastern Siberia. This enchanted most of the soldiers, yet two of the most serious of the bunch, Evgeny and Anatoly, were infighting about which plane to take the young American up in.\n\n"I'm telling you, Anatoly! He would love the old Soviet Il-10. Americans eat up that historical stuff."\n\n"Nah, nah! Amerikanskiy love fast and dangerous! We should take out the jet plane that Aleksandr was working on."\n\nAfter much debate, the two come to a consensus with the other soldiers alongside Steve, and decided that..."
 RUS_tourist.35.a: "The American would love a vintage Soviet plane."
 RUS_tourist.35.b: "We'll impress him with the experimental jet!"

 RUS_tourist.36.t: "Entry 14: Taking to the Skies"
 RUS_tourist.36.d: "Russia is truly a sight to behold from her skies.\n\nWhile I have come to the Anarchy by sea and have traveled it by land, to soar among the clouds before the Urals is a lovely sight to behold. The soldiers of Novosibirsk were enamored by my tales, and decided to bring out an old piece of history from the German conflict; an old Soviet Il-10 from the late 40s.\n\nShe served a bit in the West Russian War; engaging a few overconfident ME-262s and providing ground support when she was able. Almost shot down in a fierce dogfight over Moscow, she was valiantly spared... or so my pilot Evgeny told me. Whether this was true or not, I did not mind. The only thing that mattered was my head among the literal clouds and his comfort in this old piece of history.\n\nWhile we stayed within the borders of Novosibirsk and mostly along the Ob River, the sights and sounds of the serene Siberian countryside are absolutely breathtaking to behold from the sky, and it is surely something I will never forget, nor can do justice in this entry. When we landed, Evgeny gave me a brotherly hug goodbye, and gave me instructions to safely head to Tomsk.\n\n"Travel safe, Tovarish. May your journey be marked with heartfelt success." Those words will echo in my head for a very, very long time, and the appreciation deep in my heart can never be expressed fondly enough."
 RUS_tourist.36.a: ""To slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance amid the soaring birds...""

 RUS_tourist.37.t: "An Unfortunate Aviation Accident"
 RUS_tourist.37.d: "The air above Kuybyshev was crisp and bright. Sparse clouds made way for the shining sun to lay on the village grounds, with nature following the sun in suit. Despite the occasional threat by warlord raiders, it was a surprisingly normal day in the average Novosibirsk town.\n\nUntil, that is, a jet fighter slammed into the farmland of Mr. Kravchenko and subsequently burst into flames on impact. Some may have thought it to be a lone, lost German bomber which had wandered way too far and was shot down by the Free Aviators, while others thought it was a simple air training exercise gone wrong. On closer inspection, the aircraft was either an experimental Soviet jet which never got off the ground, or a makeshift science experiment by one of the warlords in their vain attempt at air supremacy. Regardless, the smouldering wreck of what is left makes it impossible to discern.\n\nAfter an examination, the village constabulary has determined that three bodies were on the plane, all of which perished during the crash or the subsequent engine explosion. One of the corpses, although brutally disfigured, was an interesting case. The diary he was clutching to his chest was badly burned, yet contained stories of other warlord states throughout Russia in a language which the village intellectuals determine to be English.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the loss of most of the pages to fire and the overall integrity of his diary, it seems his story will be lost to the very flames which burned his mark on this world away."
 RUS_tourist.37.a: "What remains will be buried in an unmarked grave."

 RUS_tourist.38.t: "An American in Tomsk?"
 RUS_tourist.38.d: "Sightings of a strange group entering Tomsk have perplexed many recently. Riding horses and dressed in Altaic outfits while carrying the American flag, we have knowledge that this is actually an American who has been traveling all across Russia and has now entered our city of Tomsk.\n\nWhile Tomsk already invites many strange people for its promises of freedom and liberty, this entourage is especially interesting. It's been years since an American has traveled so far into Siberia! Almost everyone in the city has a desire to meet him, and he has gained a fair bit of fame. We have even set up plans for him to view a debate in the salons as well as showing him into the insights of our unique government. As an American, he will surely be impressed with Russia's most powerful democracy, won't he?\n\nNevertheless, we must commend him on his willingness to learn. Traveling across all of Russia is not for the faint of heart! There are even rumors that he is a university student back home in America. He must be a great scholar!"
 RUS_tourist.38.a: "He will be safe here!"

 RUS_tourist.39.t: "Entry 15: The City of Artists"
 RUS_tourist.39.d: "Tomsk is very different from every other place I have visited so far. To be fair, however, almost every place in Russia is different from the next. It only gets stranger the deeper into Russia I get.\n\nI was welcomed with open arms into Tomsk, and the people here seem to be very friendly for the most part. Almost everyone wanted to meet me and have a discussion. I don't think I have been anywhere else that spoke more about politics, science, and art than here in Tomsk.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I even got a little insight into how Tomsk operates myself. I was invited to view a salon, and to be honest, it was entirely baffling. I had no idea what was going on. It was all just a bunch of intellectual conversation and scholarly arguing. I couldn't even figure out what they were talking about, and my Russian has gotten far better than when I arrived here in Russia! While I may not really understand this place, but it's good to know there are democracies in Russia and not just warlord dictatorships ruling over the people. Maybe Russia does have hope...\n\nStill, I don't know how they all agree on anything. It's much more enjoyable outside in the city of Tomsk than in the salons. The politics here are like if every nerd back in university decided to make a country. Who knows, maybe they know something I don't.\n\nNext, I'll be heading to Omsk. And even though people have said I should avoid that hell if I like to have my life, I'll keep an open mind. It can't be that bad, can it?"
 RUS_tourist.39.a: "Does he really have to go there?"

 RUS_tourist.40.t: "Caravans from the East"
 RUS_tourist.40.d: "A refugee convoy has rolled in from Eastern Siberia sometime this afternoon, and with it came potential new members of the Black League. Destitute men looking for safety, security, brotherhood, purpose... Perfect men to support our journey to the Great Trial.\n\nAnd then there was the American.\n\nWhile his name is unknown to the many around him, and his Russian dialect is just as much as a mystery, he is carrying an American flag and traveling with another companion. The companion, while not a local to the Western Siberia area, is clearly a native Russian. Cadre 120996, assigned to protection and border security duty, raised a complaint to their local officer in the League about this strange traveler. The commanding officer of the Cadre expressed caution, but out of sheer curiosity allowed passive interrogation and conversation with the traveler. He revealed himself to be a man called Steve, traveling the Russian anarchy with a guide who refers to herself as Zoya. Steve is documenting his experiences and the individual stories of the entire span of the country, of which his current stop is the great city of Omsk.\n\nWhile we are indeed overly cautious about visitors; especially ones as eccentric as an American tourist mad enough to traverse the warlord states, the commanding officer of Cadre 120996 has instructed his men to give the tourist some "friendly advice", and to show him around the city a bit. The only problem is that Steve seems dead set on some advice Zoya has told him; advice which goes directly against our own. After a long conversation and our friendly offer, the tourist makes his decision."
 RUS_tourist.40.a: "He approves of our guidance."
 RUS_tourist.40.b: "That blasted American tells us off!"

 RUS_tourist.41.t: "Entry 16: The Wonderful City of Omsk"
 RUS_tourist.41.d: "Omsk is perhaps one of the safest and cleanest cities in Russia as of yet. While I am not one to take a side on politics, their governance allows extreme order, yet compassion to everyday citizens.\n\nMembers of the "Black League", which is both the leading authority and armed paramilitary force of the nation, offered very generously to safely and courteously show us around! Despite the protests of Zoya (she refers to me as a "Mudak" in private later amid other chastising), the Black League shows us important cultural sights, an insight into how their society works, let us watch a military drill, and took us to a lovely local stew shop run by an old man called Pyetr. After this, the Black League hurried us to a local Hostel underground as to not be accosted by the Luftwaffe nor be out and about in the city late at night. The beds we slept in were sturdy and comfy, and despite the fact that we were essentially sleeping in concrete subway tubes, everything felt homey and warm.\n\nThis morning, we are to travel toward the Urals the way of Tyumen alongside a military caravan. Zoya tells me that it's essentially a glorified raid. While cautious, I severely doubt that the Black League would send a traveler they have treated so warmly into live combat. Nevertheless, I am departing in a few hours, and will be writing a letter back home to share my story thus far."
 RUS_tourist.41.a: ""Strange, but safe. That's how I like it.""
 
 RUS_tourist.42.t: "The Horrors of The Black League"
 RUS_tourist.42.d: "Such a foolish tourist. The foreign madman had the audacity to reject the advice of our glorious League, instead trusting in the local Zoya to serve as his compass. It is clear that this "Steve" is nothing but another obstacle; a test to the people of Omsk sent by the corrupt Western superpower to stop our soul-wrenching progress toward the Great Trial. His recorded observations are nothing more than petty espionage, espionage which will be sold to an American-backed warlord and used to crush us. Every notation that he makes rolls our clock forward, and our League cannot afford that.\n\nFortunately, "Steve" has reinforced his lack of intelligence and overconfidence during his fleeting few minutes here. About a half hour after the confrontation with Cadre 120996, "Steve" wanders into Bunker 2938 in order to find some information and a potential place to spend the night. Cadre 482315 has reserved most of that bunker for interrogation of individuals who have sought harm to the Russian nation. One such wastrel, an intellectual by the name of Yusef, happened to barely make a futile attempt at freedom. Escaping from his binds, the now half-blinded scoundrel could not see "Steve", yet still called out to him. His fingers individually broke and his spirit broken, Yusef would stumble into a horrified "Steve" as he collapsed to the ground and expired from shock. A few moments later, League members from Cadre 482315 would shoot two bullets from a TT-33 pistol into the back of "Steve's" skull.\n\nHis companion, Zoya, was found fleeing from Cadre 384234 after hearing this exchange from outside, and was swiftly executed with eleven PPSH shots. Both of their corpses will be offloaded in tomorrow's excursion into Tyumen, as ordered from Comrade Yazov himself, who was seemingly happy with this unique turn of events. Nobody, not even curious outsiders, will impede our march toward the Great Trial."
 RUS_tourist.42.a: "The rats across the border will find a use for their decaying bodies."

 RUS_tourist.43.t: "Tales from Central Siberia"
 RUS_tourist.43.d: "Dear Mom and Dad,\n\nI am well, as is Zoya, who's been a godsend. I'm in a city called Omsk right now. The guys in charge here are called the Black League and let me tell you they run a tight ship! They're the ones who helped me get this letter to you! And through Kazakhstan, too! Ain't that nuts?\n\nThe farther I travel, the more of Russia there seems to be. The first city I visited was Kansk, run by the "Black Army." (No relation to the Black League, don't get confused!) They didn't like me very much. They stalked us and I got accused of being an "authoritarian," which was just madness. I'm American! We're as free as it gets! The city of Krasnoyarsk was much more pleasant. It wasn't big, but it was clean, industrious. The man in charge, Andreev, was very personable. He wants to set up a democracy, but for now it's a military junta. To the west was Kemerovo. I didn't meet the ruler - some old Red Army general that thinks he's an ancient Russian king, which is weird - but the people were nice. After that I went to Oyrotia, a small nation of Altaic people (one of Russia's ethnicities, like the Indians back home). They were very down to earth and sold me some horses and a beautiful cloak I can't wait to show you. Novosibirsk, on the other hand, is a big city, kinda like Baltimore. They took me up in an old Soviet warplane and Ma, it was breathtaking. The ride of a lifetime. The last place I visited was Tomsk, which is run by a bunch of those intellectual types, but at least it's a democracy.\n\nI'll write again as soon as I can. So far it seems that Russia defies almost all expectations, but with Zoya by my side I'm sure I'll be safe. I'll see you soon!"
 RUS_tourist.43.a: "Love, Steve."

 RUS_tourist.44.t: "Possible Infiltration Detected in Sector 217-B - Instructions Requested"
 RUS_tourist.44.d: "Comrade Major,\n\nA potential threat to the security of the People's Republic has been observed. Unusual particulars have necessitated this message.\n\nObservation units under my command have reported the appearance of a party of individuals attempting to enter the People's Republic from the territory of the Black League. The intruders do not match any known previous classification parameters for infiltrators. Their appearance and attire is unconcerned with camouflage, their mode of transport, that of horseback, is too conspicuous, and their path is exposed, providing no concealment. In addition, the party is carrying a raised American flag, further increasing visibility.\n\nIt has been suggested by subordinates that such a radical change in potential tactics of infiltration is likely an attempt to discover operational practices and procedures, or similarly as an attempt to capture security forces for information extraction. However, previous efforts on the part of the league to do so have focused on covert abduction, and were such to be attempted by the intruders as observed, long-range fire would likely ensure rapid neutralization.\n\nI await orders on how to proceed with interception.\n\nIn defense of the Central Committee,\n\nG.A. Goncharov,\nLieutenant of State Security, Red Banner Eastern District"
 RUS_tourist.44.a: "Reply: Approach prudently."
 RUS_tourist.44.b: "Reply: Intercept aggressively."

 RUS_tourist.45.t: "Entry 17: The West Siberian People's Republic"
 RUS_tourist.45.d: "After departing Omsk, that wonderful city, we headed northwest towards lands that Zoya tells me are controlled, at least ostensibly, by some of the last strict Leninist hardliners still in existence.\n\nI found that most strange, as given the clear failures of Leninism as shown most evidently in the Soviet collapses, one would think it an unattractive ideology to cling to. But, as we soon discovered, and much to our peril, that healthy communist paranoia is still alive and strong.\n\nWhen I saw the border patrol approaching, I naively assumed that they would, like in so many other of the states we have crossed, cautiously advance, ensure we were not hostile, and then check our documents. They completed that first step, but then, and without even so much as speaking to us, proceeded directly to shooting. And if it had not been for Zoya using her practiced eye to read their body language, my story might have ended there.\n\nFortunately for us, she later told me, they had not waited long enough to both ensure accuracy and also prevent escape. We all immediately took off, pushing our horses to their very limits in order to remain ahead of the vehicles driven by the border patrol. Again Zoya proved her considerable skills, quickly identifying terrain that the horses could progress through, but the vehicles themselves could not. After several hours of hard riding, with the horses pushed to utter exhaustion, and using my continued ability to write as evidence, we succeeded in evading our pursuers.\n\nClearly unwelcome in these lands, we progress in the only direction possible - north - skirting the lands of those strange democrats in Tomsk. Zoya tells me that even she is excited by our next destination.\n\nI hope that, once there, I am similarly so."
 RUS_tourist.45.a: "Such a rude way to greet guests."

 RUS_tourist.46.t: "Report: Infiltrators Intercepted"
 RUS_tourist.46.d: "Comrade Major,\n\nThe potential threat to the security of the People's Republic has been addressed as per your instructions.\n\nFollowing receipt of last transmission, advance units under my direction aggressively intercepted the intruders with the support of light armor. Upon approach, the intruders were observed to be momentarily paralyzed with indecision, before one attempted rapid movement in an opposed direction.\n\nUnderstanding this as an attempt at escape, and therefore providing tentative identification of the intruders as Black League infiltrators, I ordered engagement to begin at 14:7:25.\n\nContributory fire from armored units affected rapid neutralization, with responding gunfire only briefly observed from the party's sole female member. Upon ensuring that the intruders were deceased, they and their possessions were briefly searched before said remains and possessions were cremated in order to ensure the failure of subsequent potential active or passive surveillance.\n\nA catalog of items is attached to this message, and attention should be drawn to the presence of extremely convincing forgeries of various American and Siberian travel documents.\n\nIn defense of the Central Committee,\n\nG.A. Goncharov,\nLieutenant of State Security, Red Banner Eastern District"
 RUS_tourist.46.a: "Loyalty to the Central Committee."

 RUS_tourist.47.t: "An Unusual Spotting"
 RUS_tourist.47.d: "One of our scout planes has reported back to command about the sighting of a small party crossing the river separating our territory from that of the People's Republic.\n\nDescending for a more accurate inspection, the pilot reported seeing several figures on horseback with an additional several pack horses laden with baggage. More perplexing was the apparent presence of an American flag amongst the other laden cargo.\n\nAlthough the pilot considered engaging the party using his onboard armament, as is usual with unannounced border crossings, the odd nature of the situation resulted in his communication instead. From their direction of travel, the party appeared to be moving in the direction of the Thief Territory, though this path could carry them within close proximity of our aerodromes near Surgut.\n\nIt has been suggested that, to minimize potential confrontations, we should avoid contact, unless they attempt to directly breach the security perimeter of any of our forward bases. Regardless, we will keep close watch."
 RUS_tourist.47.a: "Keep watch - but do not engage. Yet."

 RUS_tourist.48.t: "Entry 18: The Free Aviators"
 RUS_tourist.48.d: "Ever since entering Western Siberia, fleeing for the cover of forests or, if in a city, the ever-present slit trenches, has been a regular occurrence. Zoya tells me it's because the Germans have been bombing everything they can see for years on end, and from the destruction everywhere I look, I can see the awful effect.\n\nBut whenever I hear anyone talk about the bombers, they also talk, with hushed reverence, about the Aviators. Zoya seems enamored by them, remembering them from her younger days behind the German lines. But though she says we've entered their territory, we haven't seen any of them. At least not on the ground - one small plane keeps us under watch at all times. Zoya says they're being careful, and that German infiltrators have tried to sabotage them before.\n\nThe one thing we have seen, from a distance and through my binoculars, was a group of biplanes performing some exercises in the distance. I must say, I can see where the stories about the Aviators' flying prowess come from - I've never seen planes turn so radically, or fly so low, and come out unscathed. I suppose you would have to be incredibly skilled in order to fly wood and canvas machines powered by tractor engines against the Luftwaffe for years on end.\n\nWithout any contact with the Aviators themselves, we're continuing west, where I've been told there is an entire region under the control of a vicious bandit clan. I'm not yet sure whether to believe it.\n\nZoya tells me we should reach their territory within a few days. We'll see how true the stories were then."
 RUS_tourist.48.a: "Amazing pilots, indeed."

 RUS_tourist.49.t: "Marks on the Horizon"
 RUS_tourist.49.d: "Some of our brothers, watching the frontier near Nyagan, have reported a small party on horseback entering our territory from that claimed by the Aviators.\n\nThey have not spoken to any of us. They have not contacted any of our representatives. They have not offered tribute or trade. They have not followed the correct routes that we have marked for those we have previously granted safe passage. They have not shown us the respect proper to those who are the law.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they appear to have valuables.\n\nMore than one horse laden with goods was observed, along with several unusual or rare curiosities, among them an American flag. These curiosities can be sold, and whatever they have used to purchase them can be distributed among us. Although at least one of them was clearly armed, such is not at all unusual in Yugra, and we know well how to engage outsiders within our territory.\n\nVehicles are already being prepared - both for the engaging party as well as for the spoils to be had. The only question that remains is how large a party to send."
 RUS_tourist.49.a: "How dangerous could they be? A small party should suffice for this."
 RUS_tourist.49.b: "We don't know how capable they are. Send a larger party just in case."

 RUS_tourist.50.t: "Entry 19: The Thief Territory of Yugra"
 RUS_tourist.50.d: "It would appear that those who spoke of Yugra, before we departed to cross the lands of the Aviators, were speaking the truth.\n\nNot long after crossing the border into their territory near Nyagan, we were set upon by men who I first thought of as bandits. Enlisting Zoya was, without a doubt, the best decision I have made so far in Russia, excepting my time spent in Omsk, of course, for it was she who spotted the sunlight reflecting off of one of their scopes.\n\nThough one of our horses was killed, her quick actions got both myself and others out of the initial line of fire and into a defilade. There I witnessed the sight of a master of their craft in action, as she shot down two of them from extreme range. Our other assailants quit the field soon after, clearly not having expected one of such skill among our number.\n\nWhen we investigated the bodies shortly after, Zoya mentioned that they bore the tattoos of men who had long spent time in prison. The 'thieves' of the Thief Territory. Having now killed several of them, and clearly not receiving a warm welcome besides, she recommended we pass through the region quickly, and I had no reason to disagree.\n\nWe now make for the northwest with all haste, and with luck, we will leave this place in the near future."
 RUS_tourist.50.a: "I don't know what I expected in the 'Thief Territory.'"

 RUS_tourist.51.t: "Successful Ambush"
 RUS_tourist.51.d: "The party we dispatched to waylay the unknown intruders entering our territory returned several hours ago, their vehicles full of loot and butchered horse meat.\n\nAccording to the brother in charge of the party, the intruders were engaged upon their entry into a small gully, their horses shot from under them and the members of our party firing from above. They resisted as strongly as they were able, but were killed soon after, their tactical position near-hopeless.\n\nApart from one of their number, a woman with a rifle identified by one brother as bearing the marks of a formerly-active anti-German partisan organization, and who killed two brothers, the intruders proved easy prey. After the fighting had ended, the party stripped the bodies and rolled them into a shallow grave before searching the baggage train and butchering the horses.\n\nUpon inspection, there were a number of items and curiosities of great interest to the brothers, including products from all across Siberia rarely seen anywhere near the Urals. In addition, it would seem that the American flag observed earlier - which was also recovered - belonged to one of the intruders who was, surprisingly, carrying an American passport.\n\nIncredibly, he was also carrying a diary recounting his travels across the vastness of Siberia and Russia proper, crossing the territory of many different states and meeting many different personalities. Quite a fascinating journey to read about.\n\nBut, also, a journey that ends here."
 RUS_tourist.51.a: "I don't know what they expected in the 'Thief Territory.'"
 
 RUS_tourist.52.t: "Unknown Surveillance Detected in Grid DM-73"
 RUS_tourist.52.d: "Comrade Commissioner,\n\nAt approximately 13:10 earlier today, and through long-range imaging apparatus, a small party of unknown individuals was observed summiting part of the Nether-Polar Ural mountain range southwest of Vorkuta.\n\nAlthough having clearly summited from the direction of the Thief Territory, owing to the lack of earlier observation by myself or my detachment, it is not believed at this time that they are members of that territory's governing faction, owing to composition, equipment, attire, and the presence of a subsequently-identified American flag among the party.\n\nAfter inspecting the lands below (although not detecting myself or my officers owing to proper use of concealment) one member of the party was observed indicating a negative to another, before the party as a whole began descent back in the direction of origin. Eight hours of intensive further observation, following distribution of my force over approximately one hundred (100) kilometers in either direction, revealed no attempts of the party to re-attempt further intrusion.\n\nAt this time, I cannot conclude as to the intentions or objectives of said party. I can, however, be confident that they have not entered the territory of the Corrective State through my sector of observation, and that the maintenance of security remains my preeminent concern in all things.\n\nIn defense of the State,\n\nN.N. Lebedev,\nCaptain, 8492nd Observation Company"
 RUS_tourist.52.a: "The State remains secure. Always."

 RUS_tourist.53.t: "Entry 20: The Vorkuta Corrective State"
 RUS_tourist.53.d: "I have, until today, discounted the dangers that I know are present, and even prevalent, throughout Russia. I have passed through many states that I now know oppress and terrorize those living within them, Omsk being a bright and shining exception that I still miss terribly. But today I turned around for the first time.\n\nAfter the ambush in the Thief Territory, we crossed quickly into the northern reaches of the Ural Mountains, summiting them in short order and inspecting the desolate lands beyond. And, as I looked towards them, I somehow felt a coldness not attributable to the weather. A certainty that I have not yet felt. A certainty that to proceed would be the end of me. Of all of us.\n\nThe ambush, and our narrow escape from it, taught me that I can no longer consider only myself. Zoya and the others accompanying me are trusting me with leadership, and I nearly led them to their deaths by not listening to the stories I had heard. None of them have said anything, but I know they have been thinking it. And so, when I turned to Zoya after looking over that cold land and shook my head I could tell, from her eyes alone, that I had made the right choice.\n\nWe are therefore returning south, moving towards Sverdlovsk. We shall have to cross the Thief Territory once again, but we will be fast and vigilant this time. Zoya is confident we will not be ambushed a second time if we do so."
 RUS_tourist.53.a: "A feeling of certainty, at the edge of the world."

 RUS_tourist.54.t: "An Irregular Occurrence"
 RUS_tourist.54.d: "A most curious incident has occurred along our northern borders. A detachment from the 364th Rifle Regiment intercepted a significant force of bandits from Yugra who were in pursuit of a peculiar group waving the American flag.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Lieutenant Romanov, the group appears to be mostly composed of deserters from Yagoda's Far Eastern Soviet, but most curiously seems to be headed by an American of all people. The American, who goes by "Steve," told Romanov that he was a tourist who was exploring Russia and presented proof to support his wild claim, including a genuine American passport and a ticket to Magadan.\n\nWhile some in the group appeared to seasoned veterans and may have posed a threat, Romanov deemed "Steve" to pose little risk to the District and escorted the group to Sverdlovsk."
 RUS_tourist.54.a: "An American? Well, it won't hurt to show him around."

 RUS_tourist.55.t: "Entry 21: Sverdlovsk"
 RUS_tourist.55.d: "Zoya had told me that Sverdlovsk had broken away from the West Siberian Republic under the rule of Marshal Rokossovsky, the so-called "Lion of Siberia." While she knew little of their rule, she had heard that Rokossovsky governed with a much lighter hand compared to the Leninists in Tyumen. Considering their patrols haven't fired at us on sight, I'd say she heard correctly.\n\nAfter a short interrogation during which I recounted my tale of being a Yankee tourist and presented some documents prove it, I, along with the rest of the group, was escorted to Sverdlovsk proper albeit under armed guard.\n\nWhile our group was under constant watch, life in Sverdlovsk seemed quite tolerable. The soldiers were friendly, and the people seemed content under the rule of the Marshal. We were provided with adequate accommodations in a local barracks and treated to a passable meal. Not as good as what we were given in Omsk but a definite step up from eating canned food while freezing in the Urals.\n\nThe next morning, we were treated to a parade by a rifle division. It was quite a sight, rows upon rows of well-disciplined soldiers marching in near lockstep, punctuated by a 21 gun salute from an artillery battery. For sure, it's a damn sight better than what the Minnesota National Guard regularly shows off. I think Zoya and the others thought so too - she said that the last time she saw a parade like this was years ago, right before the Siberian War between the Far Eastern Soviet and the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nAfter spending a bit more time in the city and purchasing additional provisions, we said our goodbyes to Sverdlovsk. Our next destination is Zlatoust, who I've been told are arms dealers of some repute, Zoya says we shouldn't expect any trouble, and I am quite eager to see what a country run by gun-runners looks like."
 RUS_tourist.55.a: "Not bad, but Omsk was better."

 RUS_tourist.56.t: "An American, Westward Bound"
 RUS_tourist.56.d: "While it would be a lie to say that tensions between Zlatoust and Sverdlovsk didn't exist, the borders are open for trade, travel, and tourism. The city of Sverdlovsk proper is rather close to our own Novouralsk, which has become a hub for caravans, travelers, businesses, and refugees to set up along or travel on; as long as they pay, of course. Late last night, however, two people on foot were traveling to Novouralsk, with one carrying an American flag behind him. Marching stalwartly toward our border, it attracted curious looks from some of our guards, and chuckles from most of the others.\n\n"Hello there! My name is Steve! I would like to travel through the Zlatoust Republic to experience the unique situation it is in and the many attractions it offers to its citizens!" Most of the guards were smiling, and a few chuckles managed to escape them, yet they remained professional and composed.\n\n"Da, Americansky. But you two must, er, how do you say... pay toll." Perhaps the news would be more bearable to Steve in English. No matter who the traveler is, no matter how noble their goals, no matter how interesting they are, we simply cannot uphold our quality of life without money. This strange and seemingly daring tourist was no exception.\n\n"I do not think we have the Zlatoust currency..." The young man seemed to embarrassingly stumble on his English, yet his companion, a hardened and clearly Russian woman traveling alongside him, offered the border guards some of the currency, barter goods, and a basic sweet talk to get the pair rolling along. While it certainly wasn't anywhere close to what our guards usually charge, they don't seem to harbor any malicious intent and they were allowed to past shortly after, seeking to get on a bus to the city of Zlatoust itself."
 RUS_tourist.56.a: "As long as he doesn't cause trouble..."

 RUS_tourist.57.t: "Ehntry 21: ZLAtsttust!"
 RUS_tourist.57.d: "zlATOUST is grrreta! GreAT! G R E A T! afyR we fuound a place to park, Zoya n i went to see much of theccituy. Lot sf of culture and fun tims n all, suprr fun.

Zoya woke me up by splashing water on my face, and retelling the events of last night. Apparently, after I started a bar fight among SOLDIERS in one of the most prestigious bars in Zlatoust, I made a dumb drunken advance on Mikhail Kalishnakov's daughter, Nelli.\n\nI threw up right after. Zoya practically had to intimidate the entire bar just to carry my now passed out ass out of there, and she drove us toward the border with the Ural League. We're heading there tomorrow, hopefully without an angry mob of merchant soldiers behind us..."
 RUS_tourist.57.a: "Quite a blur, but I certainly won't forget it."

 RUS_tourist.58.t: "Strangers Out of the Cold"
 RUS_tourist.58.d: "The Guards stared at the gawky man and his female guide, not entirely sure what to make of them. The pair were bundled in thick winter coats, the hard-faced woman carrying a scoped rifle, the glasses of the man fogged beyond sight. "We seek entry to your lands," said the woman in clipped Russian. "My name is Zoya and this man is Steve." Upon hearing his name, the man waved at the Guards, who then exchanged looks.\n\nThe Guards eyed the strange pair warrily, sure the man posed no threat but the woman radiated deadly poise. Finally, one of the Guards spoke up, "are you refugees? We have plenty of warm food and-"\n\n"No," said the woman, "we're not refugees." A look of confusion passed between the sentinels and the second Guard replied.\n\n"Then what are you? Are you looking for employment? Mercenaries?"\n\nThe woman, Zoya, smiled, her lips twisting her wind-burnt face, "We're not refugees or mercenaries, comrades, we're tourists."\n\nThe Guards didn't know what to make of this, but waved the pair to follow them back towards Sibay. Tourists? Who the hell would be crazy enough to tour the Southern Urals?"
 RUS_tourist.58.a: "Wait until Starinov hears about this!"

 RUS_tourist.59.t: "Entry 22: Snug in a Bunker"
 RUS_tourist.59.d: "When I went behind the walls of Sibay, the last thing I expected out of this bunker-city was coziness. I'm pleased to report that my quarters are clean and comfortable and they even have heating! I was told by Russians in other communities that the Southern Urals were a hellhole, but honestly, I can't see it. Everyone is so friendly, the food is good, and some of the Guards even know some English! Even Zoya is loosening up a little. She's been spending a lot of time with this Zaitsev guy, I think he used to be a sniper too. I've managed to find myself a friend too, his name is Pavel. Good guy, around my age, smokes a pack a day and has a surprisingly soft singing voice in spite of it.\n\nMe and him were talking the other night about the Southern Urals and I got to asking him why it had such a bad reputation. "Steve," he said to me in his broken, thickly accented English, "Ural League keeps people safe behind walls and with guns. Outside walls, there is cold, many bandit." I asked him how the other communities in the Urals managed and if he would recommend where I should go next and he said, "no place, get out of Ural. Orsk is bandit country run by King Rapist. Magnitogorsk even worse, crazy scientist in charge there, no one ever leave. Orenburg full of stupid, waste of time." I guess if the other territories are as bad as Pavel says, no wonder Sibay is a bunker-city! I should ask Zoya about it, she seems to know a little bit about everything."
 RUS_tourist.59.a: "Is his name actually King Rapist?"

 RUS_tourist.60.t: "Fascist Minion at the Gates!"
 RUS_tourist.60.d: "The Communes are in a tizzy today as reports of an American and what is likely an ROA stooge entering our borders have reached the council. We cannot stand idly by and allow a fascist toady to sully our free socialist soil! Thus, the council was convened to determine a solution to deal with this insidious invader. After twenty-six hours of debate and an impassioned fist-fight, an agreement was reached. The council has concluded that using force to apprehend the fascist American spy and his Hitlerite goon would itself be a fascist action. Was not our commune founded on the principles of self-determination? We may hate him, but it is his right to be a fascist puppet of the American Reich and we cannot infringe upon it. If we imprison or attack this man for being a Nazi scoundrel, are we not also fascists?"
 RUS_tourist.60.a: "At least our morals remain pure."
 
 RUS_tourist.61.t: "Entry 23: Like a Car Crash by Committee"
 RUS_tourist.61.d: "I've heard the term 'anarchy' thrown around a lot in Orenburg. I think what the meant was 'total clusterfuck'. I was invited to a council meeting so that I, as an American Nazi-Tsarist-Bandit, might be 'enlightened by anarchism in action'. I don't really know what this was meant to accomplish because I've never seen anything so messy and dysfunctional! I know we Americans joke about the convoluted heap that is the NPP and RDC, but our politics have nothing on Orenburg.\n\nThe meeting started out with the speaker, some little guy with glasses, being shouted down by half of the room, who I guess didn't like him very much. My Russian isn't great, but it isn't hard to figure out what 'fashisty' means. I have no idea what the meeting was even supposed to be about, and I'm pretty sure the council didn't either. At some point, fully three different speakers attempted to hold their speeches over one another, shouting louder and louder to be heard. I tried to say something to Zoya a couple times, but she never heard me over the noise. I won't even get started on the brawl that started in the middle of the room or the shoe that almost beaned me right in the head.\n\nWhen I was a little kid, my teacher used a talking stick to make sure only one person was speaking at a time so we wouldn't shout over each other. I'm sure Orenburg could really benefit from something like that, but I bet they would just decry a talking stick as an 'instrument of Hitlerite oppression'. Orenburg kind of sucks and I'm looking forward to getting the hell out of here."
 RUS_tourist.61.a: ""I'm so tired.""

 RUS_tourist.62.t: "Hello Mother, Hello Father"
 RUS_tourist.62.d: "Hi, mom and dad! I'm writing to you from Siberia just to tell you that I'm okay and not to worry. The Urals and Western Siberia have been quite the adventure. The sheer number of warlords out here is crazy, and in Western Siberia alone you can find every ideology under the sun. Nazis, commies, anarchists, and even liberals are out here, each with their own vision of how to save the Russian people. It's crazy to think that just thirty years ago (or so) this used to be one big country. For all the desolation and the ruins, there's a kind of beauty here that I didn't expect. I remember waking up one morning in Sibay and watching the rising sun stretch over the Urals. Never in my life have I wished I was an artist more. I wish you could see what I'm seeing, the good parts, I mean.\n\nI'm eating well, and my guide, Zoya, is keeping me safe. She used to be a partisan sniper back in the day so I'm never too worried when she's around. I think cousin Henry might like her, you know how he has a thing for strong ladies. She's been teaching me Russian and I think I'm really getting the hang of it. I have lots of questions for the locals and it feels awkward having Zoya do most of the translating, so I'm glad how well my lessons are going.\n\nHow are the neighbors? Did grandma's cough pass? Who won the Little League championship this year? Miss you, and I'll write again as soon as I can!\n\nP.S. I had to trade an automatic rifle to a smuggler to get this letter to you, so it's worth one AK-47. It's a bit more than a stamp, that's for sure."
 RUS_tourist.62.a: "Love, your son, Steve."

 RUS_tourist.63.t: "An Arrival from Orenburg"
 RUS_tourist.63.d: "A strange party recently entered the Republic's lands from the territory administered by Orenburg. The party, consisting of several Russians and an extensive baggage train was, remarkably, led by an American, and requested passage to Ufa.\n\nAlthough our frontier detachments were initially suspicious of their motives, prolonged questioning of the party, as well as close examination of their belongings, convinced them of the party's lack of hostile intent. Indeed, this American appears to be travelling across Russia, visiting as many states as possible and compiling a log of them, and this fact has not gone unnoticed by several members of our government.\n\nThey have raised the fact that international recognition of the Republic was and is critical to the maintenance of our sovereignty in the face of numerous regional and other threats. Therefore, increasing awareness of our Republic, our culture, and our challenges within America, and thus by extension the OFN, cannot but be beneficial.\n\nIt has been suggested that we chaperone the tourist and his entourage around Ufa, expose him to our cultural and religious practices, and allow him to see the regular devastation wrought by the German bombers. Surely if we do so he cannot but speak of the plight of our Republic, standing strong for our people in a time of great danger. And against great threats, besides.\n\nIf it will draw any attention at all, it will be worth it. We must only decide how insistent to be."
 RUS_tourist.63.a: "Strongly. We must not waste this opportunity."
 RUS_tourist.63.b: "Less strongly. We must not appear demanding."

 RUS_tourist.64.t: "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.64.d: "Russia has been, for me and so far, a land of firsts. And Bashkiria, an officially Islamic state created by and for the Bashkir minority, is certainly that.\n\nCrossing from, and thankfully leaving behind, the chaos of Orenburg, we were allowed over the border with only several hours interrogation - very quickly by our standards so far. What's more, soon after we were approached by a small governmental delegation that offered to show us around. Zoya was wary about any 'minders,' but I saw an opportunity to gain access to experiences we might not have otherwise, in fear of offense. And that opportunity soon paid off.\n\nThe representative invited us to attend a service at Ufa's central mosque, as long as we were properly quiet and respectful, and though I have been a Christian all my life I must say it was most beautiful. The muezzin's call radiating from the mosque's minaret was oddly soothing, and the practiced ritual within, though far different from any church I have been in, possessed a serenity and sense of religious unity that I do not think I can accurately describe.\n\nLater, we toured the market where Zoya explained to me, as best she could, about the persecution these Bashkirs have traditionally faced. About how this state was their attempt to carve out a true homeland for themselves amid a war between parties that both despised them.\n\nBut, alas, it is time to move on, and so in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."
 RUS_tourist.64.a: "A homeland for one's people is a noble goal indeed."

 RUS_tourist.65.t: "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.65.d: "Over the last short while, I have grown to respect the Bashkir people tremendously. And I do not say such lightly.\n\nSo many of the states we have passed through have existed for no other reason than because some tyrant wanted them to. Because that tyrant wanted to control the lives of thousands or millions absolutely, and woe to those who crossed them. But here there is a national identity. A national culture. A national religion. All things that the Bashkirs fight for despite nearly everyone trying to take them away.\n\nToday, as we were touring the city's downtown, attending the Turkic monuments that still stood, we saw evidence of that. One of the ever-present German bombing raids shattered some buildings in Ufa, and we were nearby. Immediately we saw people, not just soldiers and police, but ordinary people from all places and classes rush forward to assist those trapped under the rubble. And, being close by, we could not but do the same ourselves.\n\nAs we helped, I could feel the spirit of community around me, a spirit, and feeling, that has been in very short supply in many of the places we have been so far. When I return home I hope that my journey to Bashkiria, together with what I have seen and felt while here, inspires others to keep this tiny nation in their thoughts and minds. It would be well-deserved by these people.\n\nBut, alas, our time here has necessarily come to an end, and in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."
 RUS_tourist.65.a: "A homeland for one's people is a noble goal indeed."

 RUS_tourist.66.t: "An Aryan Arrival?"
 RUS_tourist.66.d: "Our brothers watching over the Belaya for any intrusion by the filthy Bashkirs have reported to their commanders in Permhaym of a very strange encounter.\n\nA party, flying an American flag, recently crossed the river and was composed not of Bashkirs, but of Slavs led by a man they believed potentially Aryan. When the brothers moved to arrest him, he showed recognition of their uniforms, and began speaking German. They are therefore not sure what to make of the party.\n\nThe man claims to be American, journeying across Russia to observe the states and societies that occupy it, and though we know well how much corrupting subhuman influence exists in America, we cannot deny the basic possibility for Aryanism to exist there. If we were to welcome him, and showcase the superiority of our culture and race, of our purpose to bring strength and purity to the entire nation, it could do much for the Fyurer's cause.\n\nAt the same time, however, there is a party of Slavs with him, who in addition to possessing weapons do not seem as subservient as non-Aryans should be. He has additionally displayed some unease at the sight of the border guards' slave detachment. Some brothers have raised the concern that the entire construction of this 'American' could therefore be a trick, an attempt to insert a spy in our lands.\n\nA decision must be made. What do we do with this supposed 'Aryan?'"
 RUS_tourist.66.a: "An Aryan from abroad? We must receive him!"
 RUS_tourist.66.b: "Look closer. The trickery of the Slav knows no bounds."

 RUS_tourist.67.t: "Entry 25: The Aryan Brotherhood"
 RUS_tourist.67.d: "The so-called Brotherhood is nothing like what I had imagined. It is worse. It is so much worse, that in truth I have trouble finding the words to properly describe my horror.\n\nCrossing the Belaya from Ufa, we were nearly immediately set upon by brutish soldiers in German-looking uniforms, but once I began speaking to them in that language their demeanour shifted entirely, and a short while later we found ourselves escorted to their capital in Perm, or Permhaym as they call it. It was there that I discovered the monstrosity of a state we have found ourselves in.\n\nThe city is a nightmare, with vast processions of slaves shifted between worksites for forced labor. The slightest hesitation or defiance is met with brutal violence or summary execution, the choice of which seems to depend entirely on the whims of the specific oppressor. The 'brothers' call them subhumans and both themselves, and me, Aryan, which I have realized is the only reason we have not joined the unfortunates before us.\n\nIndeed, it has taken all my efforts to keep Zoya and the others together and under my supervision, and I do not know if I can do so much longer. I feel sick every time I speak to one of these monsters, and I fear it will not be long before they discover my true feelings.\n\nI have therefore spoken to Zoya, and she agrees that we must act before we are separated or our hosts change their opinion of me. Tonight we will wait for darkness and then make for the Kama, on the other side of which rests safety.\n\nI only hope we will make it. We should not have come."
 RUS_tourist.67.a: "Utterly horrifying."

 RUS_tourist.68.t: "No True Aryan"
 RUS_tourist.68.d: "Our prudence in receiving this new arrival was well-placed. For he was no true Aryan.\n\nAlthough he recognized the superiority of our equipment design, although he spoke German, although his honeyed words claimed friendship and discovery, his actions proved otherwise. And our brothers were vigilant enough to observe them. Vigilant enough to protect the purity of spirit, purity of form, and purity of essence that the Aryan embodies. Purity that this arrival clearly did not possess.\n\nFor what true Aryan would travel willingly with armed Slavs without careful overwatch? What true Aryan would treat them as his equals? What true Aryan would concern themselves with the 'plight' of the subhumans? No true Aryan, indeed.\n\nAnd so both he and they were therefore treated as any other suspect non-Aryans. Disarmed, placed in chains, and marched towards Permhaym. All except one - a Slav woman who attempted resistance, and found what was left of her dumped in the forest in response.\n\nThe brothers overseeing the factories around our capital have been informed of the imminent arrivals, and will soon find places where they can work to support their betters. In so doing, they can serve the purpose deserved to them.\n\nAnd if they show themselves unwilling to do so, well, the brothers are most skilled at applying proper discipline."
 RUS_tourist.68.a: "The Slav within will always make themselves known."

 RUS_tourist.69.t: "A Riverine Skirmish"
 RUS_tourist.69.d: "Earlier today, a skirmish near the Kama river was reported. Elements of the Imperial Army, stationed nearby to keep watch on the territory of the fanatics in Perm, reported seeing a small party fleeing Brotherhood militias and attempting to cross the river.\n\nUpon observing that one of the party was carrying a large American flag, and additionally understanding the brutality of those living within Brotherhood territory, they moved to engage. As Brotherhood fighters began firing upon the party, itself struggling to cross the river, our forces engaged them, killing or wounding several before the fighters retreated.\n\nUpon rescue and interrogation, the leader of the party provided evidence identifying himself as an American and requested entry for himself and his companions into the Principality. He further explained that he was travelling across Russia on a journey of exploration, and that he was most grateful for their rescue from Brotherhood forces.\n\nFollowing confirmation that none of the American's companions were wanted by the Tsar's government, they were permitted entry and proceeded in the direction of Izhvesk.\n\nSecurity forces will maintain surveillance until their departure."
 RUS_tourist.69.a: "An American, here? From the East?"

 RUS_tourist.70.t: "Entry 26: The Principality of Vyatka"
 RUS_tourist.70.d: "Thank God for those soldiers saving us as we crossed the river from those psychopaths in Perm. I never want to go back there ever again. I also hope someone stamps them out for good. Zoya agrees.\n\nThis new nation we find ourselves in, Vyatka, seems much more stable than the last few. It's apparently ruled by a Tsar, who I thought was dead. At least that's what Mikhail told me, all the way back in Chita. Perhaps they're related? In any case we're here now, and not surrounded by black-clad murderers or literal slaves, so I'll give thanks regardless.\n\nWe've headed south, to the city of Izhvesk, which Zoya says she passed through years ago on her journey eastwards. It's certainly one of the more developed cities we've seen so far, with enormous industrial plants and factories producing equipment of all kinds. Even so, there seems to be a general malaise, as if everything has faded slightly. I'm not exactly sure how to properly describe it.\n\nThe one thing I have taken from this city, however, is a replacement for our horses now that we're in a part of Russia that actually has an extensive road network, as damaged as it may be. Using some of my remaining funds, I have purchased a reasonably new truck, which we shall use as we continue south-east, towards Tatarstan.\n\nIt should help accelerate this final leg of our journey considerably, and provide a better means of escape should we encounter future problems."
 RUS_tourist.70.a: "A faded city. But safety, nonetheless."

 RUS_tourist.71.t: "Entrants from Vyatka"
 RUS_tourist.71.d: "A group has entered the Republic from Vyatka, crossing the river of the same name earlier this afternoon and presenting their travel documents. Consisting primarily of Russians, the one extraordinary exception is that of an American claiming to be on a journey across the whole of Russia, and this claim is supported by a dizzying array of artifacts originating from as far east as Petropavlovsk.\n\nAfter so proving their identity, they were allowed to proceed and departed, travelling in the direction of Kazan by way of Arsk in a Vyatkan-built truck. A truck that was observed to be flying a large American flag from its exhaust stack, and thus drawing the attention of many nearby.\n\nWe do not quite know what to make of this event. The party and its composition, especially the American with evidence of travel, is far too ostentatious and elaborate to be a reasonable attempt at cover from infiltrators from nearby states. However, when regarding the Tatar people, 'reasonable' has not historically been a word that can be applied to the Russians. We must be careful.\n\nThe party will not be harmed, lest there be an attempt being made to provoke the displeasure of the Americans or, by extension, the OFN. It will be allowed to proceed and interact, assuming the members of it do not attempt to break our laws.\n\nBut it will be watched. Carefully. The security of our people demands constant vigilance, even in situations where it may appear absurd."
 RUS_tourist.71.a: "One must always remain attentive."
 
 RUS_tourist.72.t: "Entry 27: The Republic of Tatarstan"
 RUS_tourist.72.d: "Entering Tatarstan, another state founded on the basis of the identity of an ethnic minority, I think I could be forgiven for assuming it would be similar to neighboring Bashkiria. How wrong I was.\n\nThough they were not instantly hostile, the border guards looked long and hard at Zoya and the other Russians, and only seemed to relax - and display genuine interest besides - when they realized I was American, something I have grown to half-expect. As we began the journey to Kazan through the region's dense forests, this interest was displayed by nearly all that we passed, encouraged no doubt by my flag, which we have now attached to the exhaust stack and which waves proudly in the wind wherever we drive.\n\nExpecting to arrive at the city quite late, we together worried about finding accommodations, but this turned out not to be an issue, for as the city came into sight we were greeted with a sight both inspiring and terrifying. A German bomber raid had arrived over the city, and Kazan's air defense network, which Zoya had earlier told me was among the densest in Russia, and captured by the Tatars nearly wholescale when they seized the city, sprang into action.\n\nI cannot adequately describe the noises or colours that faced us over the next while, except as a thunderous kaleidoscope, with booming reds, reverberating yellows, and meteoric greens rising into the sky at small objects far overhead.\n\nBy the time the raid ended darkness had fallen, and so we decided to find an area to make camp, rather than risk entering a city on alert in the dead of night. In the morning, we will visit the city and then continue onwards to our next destination, heading south towards Samara. Even so, I do not think I will soon forget this experience.\n\nIndeed, I expect I will see it in my dreams."
 RUS_tourist.72.a: "A thunderous kaleidoscope."

 RUS_tourist.73.t: "In the Land of Treason"
 RUS_tourist.73.d: "As the Committee's border guards watched the truck approach that morning, they were not sure what to make of it. A Vyatkan truck, flying an American flag proudly from its exhaust stack, approaching from Tatarstan? Absurd, indeed.\n\nThey were only more confused when the window rolled down to reveal, among the Russians inside, an American. And their confusion reached its height when, in response to their interrogation, he told them he was travelling across the country. Inspecting his cargo and documents, which bore stamps from places as far away as Chita, Krasnoyarsk, and Sverdlovsk, they could not but believe him. And once a solicited bribe was paid, the way opened quickly.\n\nThe unpleasant experience at the border, however, foreshadowed nearly every subsequent encounter. Soldiers stared at them with suspicion and, often, barely-contained greed. People avoided them, having long learned that to involve oneself with the unusual was to court disaster. The American's companion, herself a former fighter against the Germans, seethed with, when out of sight of any soldiers, barely-contained rage.\n\nThe 'Vlasovites' were traitors, animals, little more than dogs, she said. There was no discovery to be had here, only hostility and depressing visages. Though she was usually content to allow the American to direct their course, here she offered advice - divert, and leave this blighted 'country' far behind.\n\nThe American pondered. He had long grown to trust the opinions and instincts of his compatriot, and yet the entire reason he had come to Russia was to observe the states and societies that comprised it.\n\nDid he divert course? Or did he tell her they were continuing?"
 RUS_tourist.73.a: "They continue on, towards Stavropol-na-Volga."
 RUS_tourist.73.b: "They divert away from this bleak land."

 RUS_tourist.74.t: "Entry 28: The Lands of the ROA"
 RUS_tourist.74.d: "Zoya warned me that the lands of the 'Vlasovites' were likely to be a depressing and hostile place, and I am sad to say she was right.\n\nThe atmosphere was immediately evident as soon as we crossed the border, south of Kazan. The soldiers, some of them wearing German-dervied equipment, were uniformly surly and unpleasant, and many of those encountered all but demanded bribes for passage. Not wanting them to investigate ourselves - and especially Zoya - any closer, we complied.\n\nThe lands and people we passed while heading southwards were as the sky itself was - gray, dreary, and decrepit, as if the life had been sucked out of them. The first major city we reached after passing through Simbirsk, Stavropol-na-Volga was, if it could be considered possible, even worse.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk grasped by some unseen malaise, but Stavropol seemed a city permanently braced for misery. The people looked at us with fear, and the demands for bribes only increased. Resources were scarce, with nearly everything appropriated by the military, and I was told that families hide their sons in attempts to avoid conscription. Indeed, it was so depressing that all I can remember, even now, is gray. Gray skies, gray roads, gray buildings, and gray food.\n\nZoya and the others expressed similar opinions, and so after a brief discussion, we decided to cut short our time in this horrible land. We will be making the next turn northwest, towards Gorky, reportedly the territory of an ex-Soviet tank brigade that has taken to raiding the German territories to the west for supplies.\n\nI confess to being slightly wary at the prospect, after our experiences in the Thief Territory, but these thoughts are tempered by the certainty that those lands must at least be better than the ones here."

 RUS_tourist.75.t: "Entry 28: The Lands of the ROA"
 RUS_tourist.75.d: "Zoya warned me that the lands of the 'Vlasovites' were likely to be a depressing and hostile place, and I am sad to say she was right.\n\nThe atmosphere was immediately evident as soon as we crossed the border, south of Kazan. The soldiers, some of them wearing German-dervied equipment, were uniformly surly and unpleasant, and many of those encountered all but demanded bribes for passage. Not wanting them to investigate ourselves - and especially Zoya - any closer, we complied.\n\nIt was after the third such checkpoint that I made the decision. Zoya had been right. This land was depressing and hostile, and I found myself remembering the pledge I had made far to the north, outside Vorkuta. Pressing ahead did nothing but put us all in danger for the certainty of little reward. And that I will no longer accept.\n\nWe are instead diverting directly westwards, towards Gorky, reportedly the territory of an ex-Soviet tank brigade that has taken to raiding the German territories to the west for supplies. I confess to being slightly wary at the prospect, after our experiences in the Thief Territory, but these thoughts are tempered by the certainty that those lands must at least be better than the ones here.\n\nIn further attempts to avoid unwanted attention, we are progressing through more rural areas, and remaining off of the major roads. I suspect that Zoya may be using passages and shortcuts familiar to her from many years past, but I know better than to ask.\n\nIf she wants to tell me, she will. Otherwise I will leave us in her capable hands."
 RUS_tourist.75.a: "What a thoroughly depressing place."

 RUS_tourist.76.t: "Unauthorized Entry"
 RUS_tourist.76.d: "One of our light-armored detachments south of Kstovo has reported the unauthorized crossing of the Brigade-Committee border by a single truck, itself apparently of Vyatkan origin.\n\nAlthough the traitors in Samara have attempted incursions into our territory before, it has never been in such a fashion. In addition, the unit's commander has reported that the truck is prominently flying an American flag. Before committing the Brigade's forces to action, he has petitioned command for instructions. Central Staff is unsure of how to proceed.\n\nLaunching a full counterattack, in anticipation of the truck acting as a scout for a Committee-led raid, would consume considerable quantities of fuel, likely requiring an additional raid of the Reich's holdings to the west to replenish. However, sending a small party to meet the truck could leave said party vulnerable to ambush or capture. If we were to do so, the commander appointed would be critical, as they would have to act immediately based on the information at hand and their own personality.\n\nEither way, however, we must respond, and quickly. What command should be given?"
 RUS_tourist.76.a: "A small party, but appoint an aggressive commander."
 RUS_tourist.76.b: "A small party, but appoint a more diplomatic commander."

 RUS_tourist.77.t: "Entry 27: The Gorky Tank Brigade"
 RUS_tourist.77.d: "Following Zoya's advice, which I have grown to respect and trust tremendously over our long journey together, our party turned northwest from Stavropol-na-Volga and proceeded towards the territory of the so-called Gorky Tank Brigade.\n\nAlthough, as previously written, I was wary after hearing of their reputation as raiders, after explaining ourselves to the small party of tanks and armored vehicles that intercepted us after crossing the border we were permitted to proceed towards Gorky itself. And what a sight it was.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk a grand example of industrial activity in Western Russia, but Gorky puts it to shame, with enormous factories turning out tank after tank, armored car after armored car. And unlike the ones we have seen otherwise on our travels, the Brigade actually decorates them with more than just a sigil.\n\nPassing through the city square, we saw a company of tanks pass through in formation, each painted iridescently in the image of a type of panther. The unit was, unsurprisingly, referred to as the 'Panther' company. I preferred the look of the lion 'model,' but Zoya preferred the look of the snow leopard, I assume from her previous time spent travelling across southern Siberia.\n\nAfter a short stay, during which I saw several members of the Brigade look longingly at our truck, we decided to again move on, this time heading north over the Volga towards Vologdan territory. Everyone says they are 'neutral,' and I am very curious to see what that word actually means in the chaos that is Russia."
 RUS_tourist.77.a: "Perhaps I should learn to paint?"

 RUS_tourist.78.t: "The 'American'"
 RUS_tourist.78.d: "Our light-armoured unit south of Kstrovo has reported further developments surrounding the solitary truck earlier reported entering the Brigade's territory from that of the Committee.\n\nOrdering a small detachment to intercept it, upon doing so those occupying the truck proved hesitant to immediately abandon it when commanded to do so. The unit's commander, recently returned from a western raid, was apparently so stunned by this hesitation that he immediately ordered the parties within to be forcibly extracted and immediately shot.\n\nThis order was subsequently carried out, despite attempted resistance, and the bodies of the occupants were cremated soon after.\n\nFurthermore, the commander, taking note of a design quirk of the Vyatkan truck, had it moved to a local workshop where it was modified with armor plating, several light cannon off of disused armored vehicles, and significantly wider tires. He then personally drove it back to Gorky, with the American flag still flying from its exhaust stack.\n\nAlthough crude, the value of the vehicle was immediately seen. Armoured sufficiently to resist small arms fire from German settlers, but with sufficiently strong armament to defeat the same, along with significantly better fuel economy, carrying capacity, and navigatory ability, it is expected to perform well on raids into German territory.\n\nWhile the identity of the parties occupying it were not ascertained, the presence of the flag on the truck has led to the vehicle itself colloquially becoming known as 'an American.'\n\nConsequent demand has led to the retooling of a production line in Gorky in order to convert civilian trucks into 'Americans' for future use by the Brigade."
 RUS_tourist.78.a: "Thanks for the idea, whoever you were."

 RUS_tourist.79.t: "A Neutral Curiosity"
 RUS_tourist.79.d: "When the truck first arrived on the bridge over the Volga, the Vologdan border guards were unsure of what to make of it. A Vyatkan truck, proudly flying an American flag, and carrying an actual American applied for entry to the Neutral State at a place of entry that rarely, if ever, saw either. Let alone both together.\n\nBereft of reason to deny entry, however, the guards eventually allowed passage, after considerable interrogation, of course. As the truck crossed the river and turned onto the main roadway towards Vologda proper, its passengers were most perplexed.\n\nThey had been to so many places where the people were fearful of outsiders, careful to hide themselves away until safety was assured. But here it was very different. Here people peered at and waved to the truck as it passed by, curious about and interested in both the flag and the people who drove under it. And, on one of the vanishingly few occasions to do so that had been made apparent so far, the passengers waved back.\n\nIndeed, as they drew closer they got to the city, and as the habitation became more dense, so too did the amount and degree of attention increase, to the great delight of one of the passengers. By the time the truck reached Vologda, the group riding in it were thoroughly energized, ready to explore a state that had so apparently warmly accepted them.\n\nSuch was quite a rarity in Russia indeed, and the passengers intended to make the most of it."
 RUS_tourist.79.a: "Neutrality has its benefits."

 RUS_tourist.80.t: "Entry 30: The Neutral State of Vologda"
 RUS_tourist.80.d: "Having now reached the city proper, I can confidently say that Vologda is a most serene place.\n\nThe people are committed to stability, both internal and without, and unlike in so many other places, and as I have written before, the soldiers and police appear to act to protect the people and prevent violence. While this should be the natural order of things, it is, as I am distressed to have personally experienced, quite an oddity in Russia. Truly an enviable city, indeed.\n\nIt is, however, no Omsk. While the people here are certainly peaceful, and committed to their ideals of armed neutrality, they do not have the drive, the passion, the total commitment to that peace that I observed in that great city. There I remember being struck by the wild-eyed passion for peace, for the drive towards the final victory of it, and for the absolute certainty possessed by so many, especially the officials, that they would achieve such, They knew that there would be challenges, or 'Trials' as they had seemingly taken to calling them, but they were not afraid, and some even looked forward to them.\n\nNo, Vologda is no Omsk, but it is close as I think I have yet found, and that must be enough. Regardless, we must move on. Zoya is directing us northeast, towards an apparently fractious democratic republic, and I am cautiously optimistic that it may display some of the fundamentally beneficial and stabilizing qualities we have seen in the depressingly few democracies we have so far encountered.\n\nIf not, I am sure it will at least be interesting to observe."
 RUS_tourist.80.a: "The Omsk of the West?"

 RUS_tourist.81.t: "From One Democracy to Another"
 RUS_tourist.81.d: "The border with Vologda had always been a quiet and uneventful place, quite the rarity in Western Russia. For many soldiers it was the perfect station; no raids, few smugglers, just a place where you could sit back and not have to constantly worry about getting shot. It was much better than Syktyvkar at the very least. But every now and then, oddities would crop up from the Neutral State.\n\nOne such oddity arrived early that morning in Veliky Ustyug, when a truck bearing an American flag pulled up at a local checkpoint. When questioned, the driver was discovered to be an American himself, having come a long way from the east all the way here to Komi on a tour through Russia.\n\nPerplexed, the guards immediately began debating with each other on what to do. Their own political biases quickly arose, with accusations being thrown around of him being a CIA agent, or a hired spy from Moskowien, or even an infiltrator from the Revolutionary Front, as absurd as it sounded. It was rare to see such a foreign face, and with political divisions at an all time high in the republic, so were suspicions. Ultimately though, it was up to their commander.\n\nAfter some deliberation, the guards were ordered to let the truck pass. Reluctantly they waved the American and his entourage through the checkpoint, and into the most unstable democracy in Russia. They made their way towards Syktyvkar, and when they arrived would visit..."
 RUS_tourist.81.a: "...the heart of the city."
 RUS_tourist.81.b: "...the Kuratov District."
 RUS_tourist.81.c: "...Internatsionalskaya Street."
 
 RUS_tourist.82.t: "Entry 31: The Assembly"
 RUS_tourist.82.d: "It seems like I arrived at quite an interesting time in Syktyvkar, and Komi as a whole. Entering the city, I quickly heard news about a session of the 'National Assembly', a government body not too dissimilar to Congress, occurring later that day. This, of course, was something I simply couldn't miss.\n\nIn short, it was chaotic. And yet it wasn't the anarchic mess that was Orenburg's council meeting; there was an order to it, in a weird way. The moment the President finished his opening speech, everyone was out shouting for their own agenda; and lord, were there a lot of agendas. I'll be frank when I say this; Komi is probably the most politically diverse nation I have ever seen in my life. Deputies of all stripes and beliefs debated long through the hours. Communists, monarchists, socialists and conservatives and liberals and so many others struggled to force their agenda through a myriad of bills and proposals and amendments.\n\nIn a strange way, it was... exhilarating? I never thought I'd be so invested into a bunch of old men and women bickering over tax rates, but there I was. It was like a movie, and the cast was the most colorful I've seen; there was a Ms. Stalina standing firm against the extremists, there was Mr. Gumilyov and Zhdanov, both boisterous and jovial, Mr. Taboritsky, who reminded me way too much of my Uncle Elmer, the creep, then there was the President and vice President. They both looked absolutely miserable.\n\nAnother figure of note wasn't actually in the assembly chamber, they were sitting right next to me in the gallery. Even at the most heated points in the assembly debate, this man never jeered or shouted or, well, showed much emotion at all, really. At the end of the session, he offered a handshake and we exchanged names. Something Suslov, I think he was. Nice fellow, but quite odd.\n\nKomi was a bizarre yet fascinating place. In a strange way, I wish I could've stayed a little while longer. But my journey continues north."
 RUS_tourist.82.a: "Home is where the heart is."

 RUS_tourist.83.t: "Entry 31: Syktyvkar & the Kuratov District"
 RUS_tourist.83.d: "Komi is best described as a "Place for Everyone". Even the criminals, it seems.\n\nThe Kuratov District of Syktyvkar is essentially a huge racket. Many of the locals here resort to radical leftism amidst the "failures of the Voronetsky government" as they say. Regular Luftwaffe bombings destroy morale, infastructure, and livelihoods, and it seems sometimes to the people of Komi that this radicalism will solve their problems. Among these problems, crime is a bit too high around these parts. As Zoya and I walked into the district, we were immediately almost pickpocketed by a group of children. A small gunfight between fascist partisans and communists barely drove them away. Zoya dragged me into an alleyway, where we stayed for a few minutes until the action died down. Of course, like sharks to blood, it seems desperate schemers can claw their way into "helping" the desperate.\n\nWhen I was trying to interview the average citizens of Syktyvkar, a socialist paramilitary group walked into the apartment building. Of course, seeing outsiders, they were more than happy to accost us.\n\n"Hey, look at this poor Yankee!" Some of them yelled. "You look like you've had a rough time in the Kuratov District, Tovarish. Why not pay us for some protection?"\n\nZoya was very apprehensive as was I, yet we had no chance to defend ourselves against armed and opportunistic partisans. After we failed to talk our way out of this situation, we were essentially forced to pay up as they "escorted" us around the district. As such, it was rather hard to interview non-socialists as we had guns and knives to our back, encouraging us to talk to more... favorable citizens. Nevertheless, they left us at the end of the day, and we quickly fled the District."
 RUS_tourist.83.a: "A way of life around here, I suppose."

 RUS_tourist.84.t: "Entry 31: Radio Free Syktyvkar"
 RUS_tourist.84.d: "Komi is best described as a "Place for Everyone", but I truly did not realize it until I ran into a certain someone on Internatsionalskaya Street. While looking for a place to spend the night, I ran into a radio host of Radio Free Syktyvkar, a man called Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov. Zoya and I have heard his voice and other broadcasts from RFS throughout our trek through Western Russia. Ivan was a short and stout but lively middle-aged man. We bumped into each other by accident while he was out shopping for vodka, of which I caught a falling bottle of his. While that in itself was an icebreaker, I told him a bit about my story and mission, of which Ivan excitedly invited me to star with him live on the air the following night. Zoya and I graciously accepted.\n\nAlthough the studio was small and certainly dated, Ivan's liveliness and the chemistry that we had together on the air was something I will always be able to visualize. It started off simple enough; a basic introduction, followed by my backstory, and finally how I came to Russia. Zoya decided to stay out of it, but she sat in the room with us to translate. After reading and discussing some diary entries for what felt like hours, we ended the show at the crack of dawn. Ivan wished us well, and I promised to write back to him when I return home. He was kind enough to leave an excerpt from the show, of which I will copy here.\n\n"So, Steve Smith. The legendary American from across the sea... Do you have anything to say to Komi? To Russia?"\n\n"Well, Ivan, truth be told, nothing can tell my story better than the heart can. Every word in this diary right here has come from it, and the stories of the wonderful people of Russia will never be forgotten. Despite the Union no longer existing, Russia is certainly far from lost, and the spirit of her people will never be erased. I promise that her stories will live on in this book. Especially this story.""
 RUS_tourist.84.a: ""I never fancied myself as a Radio co-host until now, Ivan!""

 RUS_tourist.85.t: "A Lone Vehicle"
 RUS_tourist.85.d: "The border between the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the Komi Republic was fairly militarized, considering the hostilities between the two factions in the past. Red Army soldiers patrolled its length, ensuring that no raiding occurred along the border, and that the situation between the two nations remained stable.\n\nAs such, it came as a mild shock to some Red Army soldiers to see a solitary civilian vehicle crossing the Kotlas Bridge, intent on crossing the border.\n\n"Outpost KB, this is Commander Dezhnyov. Reporting one civilian truck approaching the border, currently crossing the Kotlas Bridge. Multiple occupants, over," reported the unit's commander, as the rest of his troops entered defensive positions in case the situation escalated.\n\nBefore Dezhnyov could get a response, one of his soldiers asked, "Commander, does that look like the Komi flag to you?" Curious, Dezhnyov grabbed his binoculars and took a closer look. The flag the truck carried certainly wasn't the Komi Republic's flag. This flag had red and white stripes... lots of stars... It couldn't be, but Dezhnyov was sure of it. There was only one nation with a flag like that. Dezhnyov quickly grabbed the radio and began to speak.\n\n"This is Dezhnyov reporting an update regarding the situation at Kotlas Bridge. The vehicle's flying an American flag, over.""
 RUS_tourist.85.a: "Inform Arkhangelsk immediately."
 RUS_tourist.85.b: "Detain them, and call for backup."

 RUS_tourist.86.t: "Entry 32: The West Russian Revolutionary Front"
 RUS_tourist.86.d: "Today we've arrived in Arkhangelsk, home to the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Remnants of the Soviet Union's Red Army, they used to control all of Western Russia, but shattered after the West Russian War. Despite the chilly temperature, Arkhangelsk seems like a pretty decent city. Lots of blackout curtains, military curfews, and underground shelters, but the soldiers are nice and the government seems stable. That's pretty good considering what I've seen and experienced elsewhere in Russia. The government assigned some soldiers to follow us around and ensure we didn't get into trouble, but that didn't stop our escorts from joining in on the fun every once in a while.\n\nMy entourage and I went out drinking with some Red Army soldiers. It was fun, and Zoya especially seemed to be enjoying herself during our stay in Arkhangelsk. The soldiers swapped some fun stories with us, although many of the jokes didn't survive translation. Occasionally the room would shake violently, but by the end of the night I couldn't tell if it was the alcohol or the anti-air defenses causing it.\n\nThe West Russian Revolutionary Front was a nice conclusion to my journey across Russia, although I still have one more stop to make. I write this entry as we drive towards the border with the Anti-Communist Guard in Onega. By tonight, I shall be in Helsinki."
 RUS_tourist.86.a: "Then, onwards to America."

 RUS_tourist.87.t: "Entry 32: The West Russian Revolutionary Front"
 RUS_tourist.87.d: "Today I arrived at the border with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Remnants of the Soviet Red Army, they are a highly-militarized faction that used to control all of Western Russia before the West Russian War. Unless I want to try and convince the Germans to let me through, this was the only way to get to Finland. Unfortunately, it appears my growing reputation in Russia is not as helpful as I had hoped.\n\nUpon reaching the border, several Red Army soldiers stopped our vehicle, and nationalized it in the name of Marshal Tukhachevsky. I was just getting attached to that thing too. At least their superiors were nice enough to give us some kind of compensation, giving us a few horses to carry our belongings for the rest of our journey, although we can't bring them into Onega. Clearly the Grand Marshal doesn't want us wandering off without supervision, and they've assigned a small convoy to escort us to Arkhangelsk where we will stay the night before immediately exiting the Front's territory. I would argue about the poor hospitality, but they've at least not attempted to shoot us yet.\n\nRegardless of how I feel about the loss of our truck, the Grand Marshal has guaranteed our safe transfer across the Onegan border, and the end of my journey is in sight. I won't let a disappointing finale ruin my adventure yet."
 RUS_tourist.87.a: "Then, onwards to America."

 RUS_tourist.88.t: "Crossing the Border"
 RUS_tourist.88.d: "Early in the morning, a convoy from the West Russian Revolutionary Front arrived at a heavily-staffed point along the Onegan border. A message from the Grand Marshal had ensured the meeting would take place, although the reason for the meeting was somewhat disappointing for the Anti-Communist Guard's command.\n\nThe highest-ranking officer present issued a command, and the American tourist, Steven Smith, and his entourage approached the Onegan troops unarmed. They were patted down and their belongings searched, and once satisfied they were permitted to cross the border. The American, his entourage, and their belongings were placed in a large armored vehicle, which exited the scene.\n\nAn uneasy silence held in the air for a few seconds after the American's new transport departed, broken as the majority of the Front's troops began to leave for Arkhangelsk. Within a few minutes, the border was the same as it always was, two sides entrenched in their positions, prepared for a sudden attack at any moment."
 RUS_tourist.88.a: "Some things never change."

 RUS_tourist.89.t: "Entry 33: Final Days in Onega"
 RUS_tourist.89.d: "It did not truly hit me until we crossed the border into the Volunteer Guard's territory and were allowed into Onega. I actually did it. We actually did it.\n\nWe crossed the entirety of Russia, through lands both impressive and terrifying, encountering people of both empathy and cruelty. I have seen sights I never knew existed, and learned more about myself than I ever thought possible.\n\nEven more astounding is the vast array of items we have collected. When I arrived, I had little more than my clothes, my journal, a small amount of money, and my flag. And now? Now we have coins and souvenirs from dozens of statelets. We have clothing from Oyrotia. We have ammunition from Zlatoust. We have a Tsarist tea set from Vyatka. And much more besides.\n\nTruly, this has been the journey of a lifetime, and even I am not sure how we managed to pull it off. Upon reflection, I can see so many times where things could have gone so badly. With the communists in Irkutsk and Tyumen. With our horrible trip through the Thief Territory to the border of Vorkuta. In our sojourn to the camps around Gorky, or the lands of that horrifying 'Brotherhood' in Perm. But we, together, surpassed all challenge, and I will never forget it.\n\nTomorrow we make for the Finnish border, where I will finally leave Russia and begin my long journey home. I know I should be elated, but I fear for when I shall have to leave them behind. Their friendship has grown to mean more to me than just about any item, and though I know I will always possess it, that will be cold comfort when I am a world away.\n\nEspecially Zoya, who has done so much to keep us, keep me, safe. I still do not know how I will react when we must separate.\n\nTonight, however, we will celebrate. I owe them that much."
 RUS_tourist.89.a: "One final night."

 RUS_tourist.90.t: "The Long Goodbye"
 RUS_tourist.90.d: "The group had crossed many, many borders during their long journey, but this one was different. This one was final. This one would be crossed alone.\n\nAs they approached the checkpoint, with its Finnish flag flying high and the soldiers manning it watching them for any signs of trouble, the man turned to those following him, tears flowing freely. Together they had marched across possibly the most dangerous and conflicted territory on the planet. They had ascended mountains at the edge of the world. And now they were parting.\n\nOne by one, he embraced each of them in turn, dispensing with most of the currency and valuables that had been accumulated over their journey. Thanking them, with both hug and handshake, he gave thanks for their loyalty, confidence, and assistance in all things, even when it should likely not have been so given.\n\nOnce he had done so, he stood in front of the woman. The woman who had followed him, guided him, and in some cases, saved him, from Siberia to the place where they now stood. The woman who would not be crossing the border. He found himself speechless, unable to think of words that could ever truly express what he felt.\n\nShe too, understood. A lifelong friendship, the kind of which could never have existed outside of shared adversity and which most people would never know, had been formed, and no matter where they were that would never change. Taking the initiative, she herself moved to draw the man into a tight embrace, concealing some small tears of her own. Thanks was not needed. It had always been given.\n\nAfter a long moment, the man stepped back, turning away from them all, and knowing he would never be able to take the steps needed otherwise. Then, ever so slowly, he picked up his remaining bags, and placed one foot in front of the other until he reached the checkpoint.\n\nHe continued through, and though he couldn't see it, his friends, the woman included, watched him until he passed over the horizon."
 RUS_tourist.90.a: "Every great journey must end."

 RUS_tourist.91.t: "An Astounding Story"
 RUS_tourist.91.d: "Our government has today been informed of a most unusual occurrence.\n\nAccording to our forces in Karelia, a solitary American has entered the Republic from the territory of the Volunteer Guard in Onega, having claimed to have traversed nearly the entirety of Russia, from Petropavlovsk to Arkhangelsk. He further claims to have spent time in nearly all of the extant warlord statelets, compiling his observations and experiences in an extensive travel log.\n\nSkeptical of his claims, and ever-wary for potential communist infiltrators, the border officials were reportedly stunned when examining both his passport as well as various travel documents from nations all over Russia, which appear to corroborate his story. If true, this is no doubt a remarkable achievement.\n\nBut it is an achievement that does not involve us.\n\nWhat does involve us is the presence of an individual who, by action and admission, has crossed the territory of multiple communist states including, most recently, the West Russian Revolutionary Front. As such, the man presents a security risk, and must be removed. Presently.\n\nHe will be escorted to Helsinki and deported, via Iceland as per previous agreement, back to America. In this way a threat will be removed while diplomatic relations with America and the OFN are respected.\n\nTruly, the man has a fascinating and astounding story that we are sure he will tell. Just not in Finland."
 RUS_tourist.91.a: "Send him home."
 
 RUS_tourist.92.t: "Finnair Flight 192"
 RUS_tourist.92.d: "Jon Erlingsson, a longtime employee of the Reykjavík International Airport, never thought he would do anything unique in his lifetime, or meet anyone particularly special. He was proven wrong today; and not for a reason he expected.\n\nSometime before noon, a Finnish airlines flight landed in Reykjavík International. While usually nothing out of the ordinary for planes from the east to be stopping here for refueling, Finnair Flight 192 was carrying a celebrity on board. Steve Smith, although just an average college student from the Midwest United States, was recently mad enough to travel the entirety of the Russian anarchy and live to tell the tale. A few days ago, he was detained by Finnish border patrol for trespassing into Finnish territory from Onega, and is now being deported back to the USA. Naturally, Steve's story has created a bit of a buzz around spheres aligned with the United States.\n\nJon was assigned to baggage handling today, and a distinctly unique suitcase rolled his way off the conveyor belt. The luggage itself was clearly vintage, probably something from the times of the Soviet Union, yet had a uniquely American flair to it. Despite all of the scratches and rust, stickers, souvenirs, and photographs adorned the luggage both inside and out. Jon would be holding a piece of history.\n\n"Excuse me, I think you have my luggage, sir." Jon met eyes with Steve, and in a panic, Jon extended his hand out for a handshake. Steve, with a smile, shook Jon's hand and nodded.\n\nJon wasn't the most familiar with English, but he knew he had to try. "If you don't mind, can I get a picture? For my kids. They're fascinated by adventure stories."\n\n"Oh, I can do more than that. When I get back to the States and publish my book, give them a call. I'll have them send your family one for free."\n\n"Gunnar! Get over here with the camera, we have a celebrity in our midst!""
 RUS_tourist.92.a: "Quite an adventure indeed."

 RUS_tourist.93.t: "Homecoming"
 RUS_tourist.93.d: "Steve was startled awake as the plane's front wheel struck the ground, causing him to lurch forward into his seatbelt. Unsuccessfully wiping sleep from his bleary eyes, Steve peered out the window as the plane slowed to a crawl. He watched the airport workers going about their business soundlessly as the sun's cold glare broke out over the Minneapolis skyline.\n\nSteve was still half asleep as he unbuckled his seatbelt and staggered to his feet at the Captain's garbled command. Crouching down, he retrieved his bag and followed the other excited yet dreary red-eye passengers out of the plane. He wondered where the others had come from. Had they been visiting friends and family? On vacation to somewhere familiar yet far away? He grinned as he reminded himself he had been somewhere very few people of his background had been. Russia.\n\nFinally, after shuffling with the other travelers for what felt like hours, his boots struck American soil. Well, American carpet that covered the short jet bridge separating him from home, from his family. For all the bravery and guts that carried him through wartorn Russia, the homesickness he had pushed away as long as possible finally came pouring through the floodgates in the form of bittersweet tears as he neared the gate.\n\nEmerging into the airport, he immediately spotted his family waiting with grinning faces and minds abuzz with questions. Wordlessly, Steve embraced every family member who had come to meet him there. His mother teared up with joy that her son had made it home in one piece, which shouldn't have been a surprise considering he'd called her in Iceland. His father patted him on the back as they embraced, whispering heartfelt affirmations of his pride. Even a few cousins and his uncle were there, as well as a mass of people he didn't know. Surely, they'd been attracted to tales of his exploits, and Steve assured them wearily that their questions would be answered soon as he walked to his father's truck, stumbled into the backseat, and fell asleep before the car had even started."

 RUS_tourist.94.d: "After so many months of hard camping, often in the pitch-black wilderness and under the starry Russian sky, Steve Smith's family home felt almost alien.\n\nThe sky was different. The air was different. The people were different. And, more than anything else, the feeling was different. In Russia, as he had learned many times to his peril, danger was ever present, and the safety that he knew here, whenever it could be found, was inevitably fleeting.\n\nHe realized, with both a start and a sudden rush of guilt, that it wasn't fair. People had greeted him when he had returned. They had called him a brave explorer. The papers had done a couple small stories on him. In his hometown, he was now something of a celebrity.\n\nBut what about Zoya? About the others? The ones who had risked just as much as him, every step of the way, in their shattered and war-torn country? Where was their story, their celebrity? It was nowhere, Steve knew, and that he could not allow.\n\nDigging through his bags, he collected the voluminous journals he had filled out, the stacks of photographs he had taken, and the trinkets that he had kept that day at the Finnish border. He also collected his father's old typewriter. Arranging them all on his desk, he sat down and withdrew a stack of paper.\n\nHe could tell their story. He could recount the journey they had all taken together. He did not know how long it would take to write, edit, and publish, but he did know he would not rest until it was done.\n\nHe owed them that much."

 RUS_tourist.95.d: "The publication of a travelogue by American Steven Smith has drawn considerable interest both domestically as well as worldwide, with demand outpacing supply by a wide margin. Smith's book, 'Across the Tundra,' consists of a curated collection of journal writings, narrations, and photographs of the people, experiences, and locations encountered during his long journey across the entirety of Russia, from the Far East to Finland.\n\nProviding what more than one reviewer has called 'a fascinating window' into the tumultuous political situation of modern Russia, its publication has resulted in considerable public interest regarding humanitarian conditions and efforts within many of the less-fortunate Russian successor states, with officials in multiple countries calling for more attention to be dedicated to the provisions of such humanitarian aid."

 RUS_tourist.96.t: "They Shall Not Grow Old"
 RUS_tourist.96.d: "Martha Smith had been counting the days since her son had gone off to Russia, that land so wild and untamed, brimming with its slobbering tyrants and bloodthirsty bandits. She had not heard a word from him in months since his last letter. Even as the great land was being brought to heel by a half dozen or so such tyrants now left, their states establishing bonds with the land of the free, she still didn't get so much as a word of news on the state of her boy. Now, as she marked off another tally in the secret journal under her bed that she was sure Earnest didn't know about, she placed her head in her hands and began her tearless sobbing. She had simply run out by the first month after she began this nightly routine.\n\nGulping down the glass of water on her nightstand, she slid the journal back under the bed. Earnest was working late, or so she had been told, and so she had dedicated the hours between his call from work at 7:00 AM to his return home to her grief. Her suffering is cyclical as she awaits closure that simply never will come.\n\nEarnest was not working late. Clearing trash off the dashboard of his old beat up truck, he searched for the letter he had recovered last time he was 'working late', scouring the old main for any kind of news from Russia about his son. He had found only one scrap of closure after endless nights searching for something to placate his suffering wife, a communique from a Russian citizen from a city called Harbin writing to an American cousin of his about how he had seen an American pass through. That was it. Apart from the few letters he had gotten, this was all that was left of his son in paper. The famously stoic, hardworking man cast the letter aside as it was stained with tears, and laid his head on the steering wheel to cry."

 RUS_news.1.desc: "For the first time since the war in the 1950s, West Russia is united under one banner. Unfortunately for the country and the world, that banner is the swastika. The first transmissions and declarations coming from the region talk about the cryptic Aryan Brotherhood, a society of Russians who believe that being Aryan is not based on race, but is a state the Slavic race can achieve, thus becoming equal to their conquerors.\n\nAs insane and unlikely as this sounds, the Brotherhood under the rule of one Gutrum Vagner is now in control of West Russia. They have announced their success and their equality to the "Reykh". The world looks silently in awe and confusion, as they wait for what happens next. What will be the future moves of this new Russian warlord state, and what will be the reaction of the mighty Reich to this absurd entity?\n"

Grandmaster Mikhail Antipin, the leader of the warlord state that expanded outwards from the town of Gayny, has made announcements regarding their recent success.\n\nSpecifically, the group behind the state is the Order of Saint George, a religious institution formed in the wake of the WRRF's collapse. The Order has proven able to enjoy tremendous success in their campaign of unification, despite the odds being heavily stacked against them. According to documents as well as the group's own narrative, they began with fighting bandits north of Perm. Now, people who in the nation's darkest hour turned to religion have the chance to spread their beliefs.\n"

Or at least, formally democratic.\n\nDaughter of an old Bolshevik politician that was eventually ousted in the power struggles of the 1920s, Svetlana Stalina rose through the ranks of the Democratic Coalition ruling the Komi Republic in Syktyvkar. A loyal supporter of the policies of Voznesensky and Morozov, she would eventually have to face the collapse of the coalition she worked hard in, and when that happened, Stalina decided to take control. Temporarily suspending the democratic elections periodically held in the Republic, she has ruled in an authoritarian fashion since then, and managed to unite the entirety of West Russia. However, despite all her promises, no elections seem to be in sight for this West Russian government, and its future remains unclear.\n"

 RUS_news.6.desc: "Nikolai Bukharin may have perished, but his legacy continues to live on, not to a lesser degree because of his offspring. Initially expected to be a mere figurehead for the left intriguers in Komi politics, Svetlana Bukharina, the daughter of the former communist leader, proved herself to be a capable and decisive leader on her own, outmatching her allies and enemies alike, and ascended as a leader of a socialist Komi. With her power assured, Bukharina reunited the rest of West Russia under the red banner once again.\n\nAcknowledging her father's mistakes, Bukharina nevertheless persists on the Communist vision and her hopes for the restoration of the Soviet Union after years of anarchy and decay. Few post-Soviet warlords are willing to pledge their loyalty to the West Russian chairwoman, but Bukharina has not yet run out of her tricks to bring hostile Russian states to her will.\n"

The ensuing takeover brought Komi under the control of the collective leadership between the elders of the Communist Party, but behind the pack of weak-willed bureaucrats, one can recognize a man who directs it behind the scenes - Mikhail Suslov, the eminent Marxist-Leninist theoretician and the ideological guide of the Syktyvkar left.\n\nWith the Soviet power reestablished in Komi and its competitors in the region lying in ruins, the communist leadership of West Russia set its course on the restoration of the Soviet power on orthodox Marxist principles, from which they will no longer drift away.\n"

Andrei Zhdanov appears to be the head of the newly-declared Western Soviet Federation, as made apparent by his address to announce the unification.\n\nAfter usurping power from an old ally of his, former Komi President Nikolai Voznesensky, and defeating rival factions in the left-wing, Zhdanov's dominance is indisputable. A "socialist alternative" has been promised to the Russian people by their new general secretary.

Yesterday, Igor Shafarevich gave a speech as the leader of the new West Russian state, that is not socialist or democratic, but fiercely nationalist. During the speech, he announced his ambitions to reclaim the rest of Russia from tyrants and unite it yet again.\n\nIgor Shafarevich is a member of the Passionariyy organization, a party formed in the fledgling Komi Republic years ago. The mathematician held far-right political views close to those of Lev Gumilyov, an ally of his, and so joined them before becoming the face of the right, a compassionate and allegedly moral human. With the ascension of his faction to power, 'Ust-Sysolsk' quickly expanded, and it seems as if they will not merely stop at the Urals.\n"

Through war and little diplomacy, the Komi Republic has expanded beyond its claimed borders to encompass all of the WRRF's former territory, thus earning a stake in the future of Russia as a whole. However, it is not under the presidency of a democratic statesman or a native leader, but instead it is under Lev Gumilyov. As one of the biggest proponents of Eurasianist ideology and a man fascinated with old civilizations, Gumilyov has become the head of the 'Passionariyy' far-right party, which claims to be a bulwark against communism.

Ivan Serov, the former paramilitary and security officer of the Ust-Sysolsk communists, emerged as the sole leader in the crumbling Republic of Komi, defeating his enemies within and outside of the former democratic Russian state. Rebuilding the country in accordance with the tenets of his ideology of ordosocialism, Serov hailed the return of the Russian national character in Soviet politics while retaining the revolutionary traits of Bolshevism.\n\nThe ascendancy of Serov and his 'ordosocialist' dictatorship caused some curiosity - and more so hatred - from other Russian states, with the communists denouncing Serov's system as nothing short of a fascist deviation. No matter how loathed is the man, it is apparent that the new ideology paved its way for Serov to reign in Russia, which he has yet to fully accomplish.\n"

Scarce information places the smuggler-General Oktan at the heart of the ROA's turnaround in fortune.

The major powers, meanwhile, remain silent on the issue, waiting to see what happens next before making any diplomatic overtures.\n\nDespite its successes, Vyatka's government still only controls roughly a fifth of Russia.

The successor of its founder, Boris Pasternak, is Andrei Sakharov, a scientist and an intellectual at the helm of the 'Modernist' movement. Based on the principles of populism, education and meritocracy, he and a group of other scientists and professors have set to create a nation where science excels and efficiency is key. This plan has only just begun."

Winning in one of the few democratic elections actually held in Russian soil, the Bastillards put their plans for the creation of a state ruled by the elite into motion, and proceeded to reconquer the region in the name of the republic.\n\nThe new President of the Central Siberian Republic, Daniil Kharms - a poet and writer himself - has made clear that this is not the final goal of Tomsk's intellectuals.

The Decembrists rose to power with the election of their leader, Dmitry Likhachev, as Pasternak's successor, and seek to cultivate democratic elitism.

While the idea of Russians embracing fascism may seem bizarre, many analysts point to the RFP's key role in the All-Russian Expeditionary Force as a precedent.\n\nWhat comes next for Rodzaevsky's regime is uncertain. Logically, the RFP will probably begin a push into Siberia proper in an effort to unify Russia. How this so-called Vozhd and his followers will interact with the international system is uncertain. Although the RFP and Rodzaevsky have long enjoyed the patronage of Japanese backers, his vision of a fascist Russia is clearly closer to the German model considering his party's virulent anti-Semitism and his extensive usage of Nazi iconography.

What exactly that means, or indeed, if the SWF will even survive, remains to be seen.\n\nLed by what appears to be a simple foreman, Vitaly Kostin, the SWF is perhaps the most unorthodox nation - if it can even be called a nation - on the map.

 KAZ_WORLD.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Chaos at the 12th Kazakh Party Congress"
 KAZ_WORLD.1.desc: "Historically, Kazakhstan's party congress has been little more than a rubber stamp for bureau policy. Instead, the twelfth party congress saw chaos, as an anti-party faction attempted to unseat the sitting First Secretary - to no avail.\n\nInstead, the party congress saw First Secretary Kunaev consolidate power within his own base. Yet to maintain his position and prevent his removal, Kunaev appears to have relied on the national communists, a group which was isolated and sidelined during his predecessor's administration. Whatever followers for Kazakhstan, it is clear that it will be a marked departure from its Marxist-Leninist past."

 KAZ_WORLD.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Kunaev Deposed as Kazakh Party Chairman"
 KAZ_WORLD.2.desc: "In a surprising turn of events, Dinmukhamed Kunaev has been removed as first secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party, following condemnation from a series of high-ranking officials including his own mentor. After a short farewell speech, the First Secretary resigned unceremoniously, citing his failures in agrarian policy and national security as the prime causes of his exit.\n\nWithout him, it seems the First Secretary position has fallen on Ismail Yusupov, a Uyghur party boss. A fairly unknown individual, many expect his authority to be far inferior to either of his predecessors. Already, he has announced plans to "redesign Kazakhstan's agrarian output" - a policy seemingly riding the line between the Kazakh and Russian communities."
 KAZ_WORLD.2.a: "A man unfit for his chair."
 
 KAZ_WORLD.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]NKVD Overthrows Kazakh Government"
 KAZ_WORLD.3.desc: "In a shocking end to what was supposed to be a routine meeting, the local NKVD has intervened at the 12th Party Congress of the QKP, citing failures from the previous administration to protect against anti-communist banditry. Russian NKVD chief Pavel Fitin, long-time ally of Shayakhmetov, has been forced into the role of First Secretary.\n\nThe unprecedented development has been met with sharp protest across the nation from Kazakh students and intellectuals. However, with the military and police clearly on the side of Fitin, any immediate resistance is unlikely to succeed. For now, Fitin sees fit to focus on his goals for Kazakhstan - peace, national security, and reconnecting with the greater USSR."
 KAZ_WORLD.3.a: "Kazakhstan, a territory once more."

 KAZ_WORLD.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Kunaev Announces Constitutional Reform"
 KAZ_WORLD.4.desc: "It seems that Kazakhstan's new direction is now clear. Despite prior claims to the contrary, First Secretary Kunaev has announced that the party will be deliberating on possible changes to the constitution. The move is unprecedented, as constitutional reforms typically only come as a response to changes in the greater USSR.\n\nThe announcement comes as a major victory for Zhumabek Tashenev and his faction, who have increasingly managed the government over the last two years. Yet Russian communities are already refusing to participate in a changing constitution, citing Soviet precedent. Kunaev himself has been uncharacteristically tight-lipped on the matter, seemingly unwilling - or unable - to more directly place his thumb on the scales."
 KAZ_WORLD.4.a: "Kazakhstan finds its own path."

 KAZ_WORLD.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]First Secretary Yusupov Assassinated!"
 KAZ_WORLD.5.desc: "Since the West Russian War, Central Asia has been seen as an oasis of stability in the chaotic post-Soviet Eurasia. Yet today, as First Secretary Yusupov lies dead, it seems this chaos has at last headed south. And Kazakhstan, perhaps the largest power remaining in the region, may not survive it.\n\nYusupov was unpopular across Kazakhstan, but his death still has sent shockwaves across the nation. Without a clear culprit, both Kazakh and Russian local leadership have blamed the other party for the murder, plunging the Communist Party into outright disorder. With both sides unwilling to accept a leader from the opposing faction, each has had to accept Stanisław Skrzeszewski as a compromise, an important - but politically isolated - leader of the Polish community. Few have high hopes for his government."
 KAZ_WORLD.5.a: "No hope now."
 
 KAZ_WORLD.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Fitin Purges 'Almagambetov Clique'"
 KAZ_WORLD.6.desc: "For years, Pavel Fitin has claimed he is a Soviet first, above cultural bounds. Yet today, Pavel Fitin has begun arresting leading Kazakh, Tatar, and other Muslim officials, citing "nationalist deviations". Notable figures include Ismail Yusupov, Chairman of the Presidium, and Nurulla Almagambetov, Deputy of the NKVD.\n\nWhile few analysts expected this outcome, most agree that the move represents a major movement towards the Russian nationalists within his faction. With Kazakhs now relegated to local parties and the military, many fear this may be one step closer to complete Russian domination in Kazakhstan."
 KAZ_WORLD.6.a: "Kazakhstan, a province once more."
  
 KAZ_WORLD.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Chairman Kunaev Resigns"
 KAZ_WORLD.7.desc: "Kazakhstan is split as its leader, Chairman Dinmukhamed "Dimash" Kunaev, resigned amidst plans for greater Kazakh self-rule. Recognized as pro-Kazakh, his inability to address famine and banditry weakened his image, boosting National Communists who ousted him in today's party meeting.\n\nHis economic minister, Zhumbatek Tashenev, took power to pursue further Kazakhification and market socialist reforms. Viewing it as unlawful independence, Russian leaders in the country's north have outright rejected his government.\n\nAs a result, northern regions have seceded as Russian militias began mobilizing under the leadership of Nikolai Shchelokov, a regional police chief. Localized armed conflicts are now increasingly being reported as the nation descends into civil war."
 KAZ_WORLD.7.a: "The endgame begins for Red Kazakhstan"
 
 KAZ_WORLD.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Kazakh Civil War"
 KAZ_WORLD.8.desc: "Civil war has begun in Kazakhstan, one of the most significant Communist states in the world before its collapse. Due to the failures of the previous leader to improve conditions for Kazakhs, Kazakh leaders seized authority, prompting a Russian walkout.\n\nA collection of local commissars, mostly Russian, are currently organizing their own party meeting, denouncing the Kazakh regime based in Alma-Ata. The country is now divided between a Russian-dominated North and a Kazakh-dominated South.\n\nBoth administrations have factions, all with different stances on distancing from, allying with, or reunifying with Russia. Observers have said this incentivizes Russian unifiers to back sympathetic splinter groups within Kazakhstan that favor closer ties with Russia."
 KAZ_WORLD.8.a: "War has returned to the Land of the Valiant."
 
 KAZ_WORLD.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Soviet Group Ascendant"
 KAZ_WORLD.9.desc: "Official statements from the Kazakhstan government have confirmed the death of Pavel Fitin. A representative of the NKVD, Chairman Fitin's regime was defined by its failure to deal with the ethnic conflict brewing in the country, leaving behind a rising Kazakh resistance. The government now appears to be under the control of the Soviet Group - a pro-Russian faction that pledges allegiance to the Stalinist ideals of Tyumen and the belief that Kazakhstan is an extension of the USSR.\n\nThe government is currently facing opposition from the Kazakh military that has avoided their purges, rebelling in an attempt to preserve their nation's independence. The mutiny's surprise successes in the first weeks of battle have led many international observers to proclaim that the conflict will be a serious threat to the Soviet Group's authority as it appears ready to throw the nation into chaos."
 KAZ_WORLD.9.a: "Is Kazakhstan destined to remain in the shadow of the USSR forever?"
 
 KAZ_WORLD.10.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Tashenev Defeats the Akmola Government"
 KAZ_WORLD.10.desc: "Over the last twenty years, Kazakhstan has increasingly viewed itself as an independent state, separate from the USSR. Today, that separation appears to be complete. Following final skirmishes in the north of the country, it appears that Zhumabek Tashenev's Kazakh-led government has defeated the Astana breakaway.\n\nAt a speech in Almaty, Tashenev pronounced the beginning of a new era for Kazakhstan, and that a new constitution will be completed in the coming months. Along with political reforms, Tashenev is expected to rebuild the economy using Bolshevist principles. The world awaits a reaction from Russia - one must hope that this conflict will not reemerge in the future."
 KAZ_WORLD.10.a: "The Kazakh Dream is complete."
 
 KAZ_WORLD.11.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Nurmagambetov Defeats the Akmola Government"
 KAZ_WORLD.11.desc: "When Sagadat Nurmagambetov began his mutiny, most viewed his army as doomed to fail. Yet as his men march into Astana, it is clear that he should not have been so easily discounted. The Kazakh nationalist leader has used his years of experience in warfare to exploit the disorder of the Russian-led government. The result is clear: a new, Kazakh nation.\n\nYet the ideals of this state remain fuzzy at best. Nurmagambetov has declared a republic, but his government remains largely staffed by military leaders, and he has shown little interest in properly democratizing. For now it seems his main goal is to reform diplomatic ties with the Russians, who he hopes can accept his new independent government. "
 KAZ_WORLD.11.a: "Free, but barely a nation."
 
 KAZ_WORLD.12.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Shchelokov Defeats the Almaty Government"
 KAZ_WORLD.12.desc: "Shchelokov's militias at first seemed defensive and disorganized, unable to combat the veteran Kazakh army. Instead, they have managed a shocking reversal, taking Alma-Ata and soon the entire country. Most credit the victory to Shchelokov's strategy of finding allies in the Russian warlords, as well as to a disorganized defense from a Kazakh government that never expected a full assault.\n\nNow, Shchelokov's government is faced with a victory no one expected. Even internal actions appear to be confused - Shchelokov has unsurprisingly defaulted to a Soviet-style bureaucracy, but without a unified vision it's unclear what will define this state beyond a vague Russian nationalism."
 KAZ_WORLD.12.a: "What is this state?"
 
 KAZ_WORLD.13.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Solomentsev Defeats the Almaty Government"
 KAZ_WORLD.13.desc: "Even with a nation increasingly verging on a Russian majority, a subtle nationalist like Solomentsev was never going to have an easy path to power. Yet after a short but bloody civil war, he has taken Alma-Ata and proclaimed the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic whole one more.\n\nIn a speech shown across the nation, Solomentsev has vowed to dismantle the "regressive, bourgeois institutions of Kazakh chauvinism". He also outlined new cultural autonomies in Kazakhstan, cementing the Polish and Russian communities in law. Kazakhstan is no longer a nation for the Kazakhs, but merely a province in which Kazakhs are just one occupant."
 KAZ_WORLD.13.a: "The Soviet Group wins out."
