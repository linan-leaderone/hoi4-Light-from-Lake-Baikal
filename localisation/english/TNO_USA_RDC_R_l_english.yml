USA_George_Romney: "George Romney"
POLITICS_GEORGE_ROMNEY_DESC:0 "George W. Romney was born to all-American parents in the Mormon colonies of Mexico. From an early age, he interacted with strong themes of religiosity, a factor that would influence him later in life. Eventually due to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, his family fled back to the United States moving from city to city, struggling financially during the Depression years, until ultimately arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAs an adult, he worked in several part-time jobs and attempted to secure a college education several times - failing each round, eventually ending up in Detroit where he worked for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which gained him his claim to fame as the chief spokesman within the automobile industry at the height of World War II. Dejected following America's coerced defeat, he would go on to work in the private sector - first at Nash-Kelvinator in '48 and then as CEO of it's successor, the American Motors Corporation in '54.\n\nBy 1960, Romney tired of the corporate life, inspired by his strong religious convictions he ran for Governor of Michigan in '61 as the candidate for the Republican-Democrats, re-elected multiple times he eventually took the side of the marginalized in the Civil Rights Movement arguing against party dissenters like Goldwater and Dixiecrat opposition figures like Strom Thurmond - even going as far as to condemn the NPP for harboring 'traitorous elements' in response to a speech by the Sovereigntist leader Byers in his home state of Utah.\n\nNow after a tumultuous decade, Romney represents peace, stability, order and good old Christian America, leading the Conservative wing of the RDCs, George W. Romney has ascended to the ranks of the Oval Office intent on building an America for everyone , strengthened by Christ and steadfast in spirit."

USA.1701.d:0 "The familiar tune of Amazing Grace washed over the podium. George Wilcken Romney, American patriot, Christian, father, son and now soon to be President ascended the hallowed steps so many of his forebears had walked before.\n\nThe gleaming incandescent rays of sunlight seemed to sweep over the stadium, melding the cheering masses into one, at his side his colleagues and compatriots of the Republican-Democrats, to his front respectfully seated if neutral looking members of the NPP, Progressive leader Henry Jackson and Nationalist Schlafly - the latter looking slightly more enthusiastic.\n\nDiscordant voices seemed to sound from the side - protestors obviously, a mixed group of disgruntled students, some bearing posters of the fallen leader Bukharin or wrongfully blaming him for what happened to King, thankfully they were a small group and he paid them no heed. With a small smile, he let his eyes grace the crowd one final time before he placed his hand on a copy of the Book of Mormon, grateful to the Lord for this day - before beginning to speak.\n\n"My fellow Americans, today is a day for all of us, which by the Grace of God, I have been granted to serve this great nation, to be a servant-leader to the people of this country, just as Christ served us all."\n\nHis voice was drowned by an enthusiastic roar, and he steeled himself for the challenges to come, for the flood of trials he must face."

rom.1.t:0 "A Big Step"
rom.1.desc:0 "George Romney, feeling all the weight of the world after his victory in the 1972 presidential election, smiled as the family gathered around him. They all knew what he wanted to speak to them about, it had been on their minds since the networks had called the race for Romney. His two daughters, Lynn and Jane, and two sons, George and Willard, looked up at him from the couch. Lenore, his wife, stood behind them, her arms embracing the fours' shoulders.\n\n"I don't think I expected to get to his point, but we did, and this is a big step," George began, "It will be nothing like when I was governor. The step up from the Michigan governor's mansion to the White House is immense and the eyes of the entire nation will be on all of us. We have to live up to those standards." He met the steady eyes of his children. All adults and familiar with political life, they knew the stakes and requirements.\n\n"You have big shoes to fill, George," Lenore said, clearly proud of her husband, "You'll be sitting in the same chair as Washington and Lincoln did, guiding the nation forward and solving problems. Despite the challenge, I know you'll make us all proud." As one, George's family embraced him and for a moment the world seemed a little less heavy.\n\n"Thank you, dear," He said, genuinely grateful to have his wife's support. He could struggle on despite many obstacles, but Lenore's support was foundational to his every effort, "I'm blessed to be surrounded by such a loving family."\n\nEven as the family embraced, solemnity persisted. They all recognized that George had become something more than a man or a father with his election. For now, however, they celebrated their father's victory."

rom.2.t:0 "The Essential Ambassador"
rom.2.desc:0 "George Romney was still settling into the White House, finding it at times historically asphyxiating. How could one think clearly in the presidency with the eyes of Lincoln, Jefferson and Washington watching? It would certainly be an adjustment, but Romney meant to do good work and would not let transition difficulties slow him down. One of the first items on his agenda was a meeting with Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nRumsfeld had had a solid career in the House of Representatives, his keen eye assessing flaws in America's military machine that some would have preferred to stay hidden. More than that, he was a good manager and a good judge of people, someone Romney could rely on. There were certain members of the RD Coalition, such as Goldwater and his allies, who the President knew he could not effectively reach and that was where Rumsfeld came in.\n\n"You want me to be your ambassador to the conservatives, Mr. President?" Rumsfeld looked surprised. While certainly a man of the right, he did not consider himself one of Goldwater's cohorts.\n\n"More than that, Rumsfeld," Romney replied, his keen eyes bright with energy. A manager all his life, he knew exactly what someone like Rumsfeld could do for him, "Conservatives like you a lot more than me so if I need them, you'll be the one making the appeal. I can't be everywhere or know everything," He said, meeting his subordinate's eyes, "And I need men I can trust to be loyal, go where I can't, and figure out problems that I don't have time to get a handle on. That sounds like you."\n\n"You're very kind, Mr. President, and I'll be happy to serve the nation however it needs me.""
rom.2.a:0 "Rumsfeld becomes a known known."

rom.3.t:0 "A New Approach"
rom.3.desc:0 "George P. Schultz entered the Oval Office as if it were any other room. Princeton, the Marines, MIT, Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors, and a Deanship at University of Chicago. Each had left their mark on the man, rendering him a consummate Washington insider and an excellent ally to have.\n\n"Mr. Schultz, thank you for coming," Romney said, shaking the man's hand, "I believe you know why I asked you here. I'd be willing to offer you a position as Secretary of the Treasury, if you'd take it. I think we could do great things for this country together."\n\n"Then I have to ask, Mr. President, what would you have your Treasury Department doing? I'll follow orders to the T, but I like to know what I'm getting into before I agree to jump." This was a negotiation, just like any George had faced in business, and as always, he knew who he was selling to.\n\n"Fiscal responsibility, cost-saving measures..." Romney said, seeing interest grow in Schultz. The man liked to pare budgets down, a passion the President respected and the country needed. Romney's programs would be expensive and he did not want any superfluous or wasteful spending.\n\n"Making sure the taxpayer is getting full bang for his buck," Schultz said, nodding, "That's something the country could benefit from. I'm your man, Mr. President."\n\nSmiling Romney rose and shook the man's hand. Schultz would not be controversial in the Senate, knowing many of its occupants, and could expect to sail to confirmation. Pleased at another small victory for the administration, Romney turned to his next task. He had a long day ahead."
rom.3.a:0 "A man suited to green eyeshades work."

rom.4.t:0 "A Man for All Seasons"
rom.4.desc:0 "One of George Romney's favorite aspects of politics was the people it brought him into contact with. He had learned long ago that he did not have all the answers but by consulting enough of the right people he could get a lot closer to the truth. Edward Brooke, the first Black Governor of Massachusetts, was one such man Romney relied on, which was what had brought the governor to the Oval Office today.\n\n"Edward, I want you to be my Attorney General. I need someone reliable, good-hearted, who will use the powers of the office to make this country better and fairer. I can't think of a better candidate than you given your experience." Hardly given to flattery, Romney spoke from the heart as he had long admired Brooke for his principled approach to politics.\n\n"I appreciate the offer, Mr. President, but I have a duty to my constituents, to the Commonwealth," Governor Brooke seemed pained even as he declined. He was still an ambitious man after all and could have a much more direct effect on the world from the office of the AG than Boston.\n\n"I understand that, Ed, and I appreciate your concern for the people of Massachusetts, they're lucky to have you in office. I just don't think there's anyone else who can do this job like you would, or have your unique perspective." Putting his hands up in surrender, Brooke smiled and chuckled.\n\n"All right Mr. President, enough, enough! You've won me over, sir. If you'll have me, and the Senate approves, it would be my honor to serve in your administration." Their business done, the two men chatted amiably, a warm familiarity between them."
rom.4.a:0 "A new attorney general and friend."

rom.5.t:0 "The Senatorial Roadblock"
rom.5.desc:0 ""President Romney has selected a most concerning candidate for Attorney General," Senator Strom Thurmond said to reporters, surrounded by his allies in the NPP, "Governor Brooke is neither qualified nor temperamentally suited for such a powerful office. His personal conflicts and prioritization of politics over the proper and impartial administration of justice compel a "No" vote from me." In another part of the Senate building, Senator Barry Goldwater was giving a similar statement to reporters.\n\n"I share Governor Brooke's commitments to justice and the law. However I have grave concerns over his views of federal power. The constitution shackles the federal government from overextending its powers, whether that be for good or ill. If I am not convinced that Governor Brooke understands these limitations, I do not believe he is a suitable candidate for the position."\n\nIn the Oval Office, news of senators' opposition to Brooke's nomination rolled in. Some were upset a friend of theirs had not been selected, a few like Goldwater had philosophical concerns, others like Thurmond recognized Brooke as an opponent to their entire program and quite a few would never tolerate a Black Attorney General.\n\nGeorge Romney was a pleasant man, not given to anger or vindictiveness. So, when he began calling senators, and their friends and allies, it was not thunder and lightning he brought but friendliness and persuasion. A life in politics and business had given him innumerable strings to pull and favors to trade. As the calls wore on and the charm offensive continued, Romney could see in his mind the "no" and undecided votes switching over to support Brooke."
rom.5.a:0 "Anything for a friend in need."

rom.6.t:0 "A Necessary Victory"
rom.6.desc:0 ""Congratulations, Attorney-General Brooke," Romney said effusively as he shook his friend's hand. Brooke, a broad smile on his face, was still not quite used to the new title. After the trouble in the Senate, he had half-expected his nomination to stagnate, or perhaps even be withdrawn. A lesser man than George Romney might have backed down from an early fight with the Senate, not wanting to burn bridges he might have to cross over later, but he had stuck by Brooke.\n\n"Now that that bit of trouble has been dealt with," Romney said, spreading a sheaf of proposals across the Resolute Desk in front of his deputy, "I have plenty of work for the Department of Justice to begin taking a look at," He tapped his finger on a folder labelled "Anti-Discrimination Measures", "I think this will be a particularly productive avenue to pursue. What use is a Civil Rights Act if no one is enforcing it?"\n\nBrooke nodded happily. After years in state government, he was eager to get onto the national stage. With the full powers of the United States Department of Justice, he was sure he'd be able to make a major dent in crime, discrimination and prejudice.\n\n"I'd be more than happy to make such issues a priority of my office," Brooke replied, "Civil rights enforcement has been a back-burner issue for far too long and I'm heartened that this administration will be taking it seriously. We'll face blowback and criticism from the right though, even some people within the coalition-"\n\n"You let me worry about them, Ed," Romney replied, "You focus on doing your job and I'll handle the peanut gallery. When people see that our approach is working and healing divisions, only the hard-line bigots will be left opposing us, and I'm comfortable with that.""
rom.6.a:0 ""Then I'll begin my work immediately, Mr. President.""

rom.7.t:0 "Meeting "Mr. Seapower""
rom.7.desc:0 "George Romney frankly felt a little at ease around the hard-eyed military men who made up much of the United States government. His faith encouraged non-violence and he tended to disdain the more conservative politics of America's soldiers. Nevertheless, as part of his eternal quest to soothe his conservative allies within the coalition, today he found himself meeting retired Admiral John McCain Jr, a small, thin man with steely eyes.\n\nThe son of a decorated Admiral, McCain had followed in his father's footsteps, serving in the Pacific Theater as a submarine commander. He had been known as an effective, aggressive commander who pioneered new techniques for submarine warfare that would be crucial in the event of another conflict with the Empire of Japan. While not a politician, conservative hawks recognized in McCain Jr. an ally and kindred spirit. Romney was not so sure until they got onto the topic of family.\n\n"My son is in the navy as well," McCain offered, "Caused some trouble at the Naval Academy like his old man but he straightened up and his superiors tell me he's a credit to the family name." Generations in service to the United States, Romney reflected, a family putting itself at risk for the Republic. A swell of admiration rose within him.\n\n"Would you mind explaining a few more points about our naval positioning within the Pacific, Admiral?" He asked, "It seems to leave us vulnerable in a few places..." His eyes blazing with interest, McCain leapt into a detailed analysis of the United States' position in the Pacific without any notes or preparation. Impressed, Romney was content to sit back and listen. Their meeting concluded, the Admiral prepared to leave but the President had one final question for the old sea-dog."

rom.8.t: "Lodge Cabinet: A Brahmin at State"
rom.8.desc: "Once the shining beacon of New England's republican royalty, spoken of as Presidential timbre at Gridiron dinners and Republican clubs, the sheen has faded from Henry Cabot Lodge's star. His breed of Republican liberalism put firmly on the back foot with the rise of the New Right amidst the party's grassroots.\n\nAt age 70, Lodge is no one's idea of a boy wonder, but his grey hair and slowing step belie the experience of a man who has served from the beaches of England to the halls of Congress and the signing of the San Francisco Charter. If Vice President Rumsfeld is Romney's olive branch to the party's burgeoning right flank, then placing Lodge at the helm of the State Department is a sop to the President's Northeastern backers, who have furnished his candidacy with money and personnel.\n\nAbsent since Lodge's father helmed the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee during the days of Wilson, it seems the Brahmins of Boston have returned to the helm of State."

rom.9.t:0 "The Cooled Firebrand"
rom.9.desc:0 ""It's a pleasure, Mr. Cornuelle," President George Romney said as Richard Cornuelle shook his hand vigorously. The former libertarian, much moderated, seemed to bounce with a nervous energy as he sat in the Oval Office, "I look forward to working with you on the Presidential Council on the Independent Sector."\n\nThe Independent Sector was a lynchpin of Romney's new approach to politics. In George's opinion, America had been built on the back of volunteerism and private organizations. In the modern age, rather than double down on a centralized federal approach to solving America's problems, Romney wanted to try something new based on older principles. A collaboration between nonprofits, volunteer groups and corporate giving programs could have extremely positive far-reaching effects if the right person were in charge.\n\n"Absolutely, Mr. President, "Cornuelle replied, "Granted, I think you're more of an expert on the concept of the Independent Sector, but I'll be the best salesman for the concept that I can be."\n\n"Maybe I do know more about it, for now, than you, Rich, maybe I don't. And I'd love to give it my full attention, but the demands of this office prevent me. A good President, or manager, needs to know when to delegate. I don't need a salesman for this, I need a leader."\n\n"You make a good point there, Mr. President," The ex-libertarian answered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, "I appreciate the focus on problem-solving rather than just repeating stale dogma, and I do think this will do a lot of good for people who need help. Whatever you need me to do, I'm ready for it.""

rom.10.t:0 "The Good News"
rom.10.desc:0 ""Good afternoon, Mr. President!" Richard Cornuelle's cheery voice energized Romney, who knew the man would be bearing some excellent news to be so elated. He leaned back in his chair, giving Cornuelle his full attention.\n\n"After approaching some of America's corporations, Ford, IBM, DuPont, and many others, I think we have our first set of corporate partners for the Independent Sector." A broad smile broke across Romney's face. Getting corporations to buy in had been seen as one of the program's major stumbling blocks, but with the participation of a few, and success, more would be sure to follow.\n\n"That's excellent news, Richard," The President responded, moving to the next step of the program, "Did you have any thoughts about how to encourage more volunteering by citizens? Rates have been stagnant for some time now..."\n\n"Indeed," Cornuelle said, producing a list from his pocket, "The corporate representatives suggested a program where volunteering a certain number of hours leads to paid holidays. There is also the option to publicize the program as much as possible and get America interested."\n\n"Both good ideas," Romney responded, "But there must be a way to get high-earners, movers and shakers in communities invested. Maybe some sort of tax credit or deduction for volunteering work or organization?"\n\nCornuelle nodded, his pen a blur as he noted the idea and began spinning new proposals off it. The office was a blur of activity and conversation as the two men hammered out a few proposals for the Independent Sector before other matters demanded the President's attention."

rom.11.t:0 "The Ex-Libertarian and the President"
rom.11.desc:0 ""Mr. Cornuelle, thank you for coming," George Romney stood from the Resolute Desk and crossed the Oval Office to greet his visitor. Cornuelle's craggy face softened into a smile and they sat down on the nearby couch together. They got down to business immediately.\n\n"I appreciate the invitation, Mr. President," Cornuelle said, remaining perched at the edge of the couch and studying Romney, "The good that volunteerism can do would be much greater with the support of the federal government working hand in hand to alleviate social ills." He was heartened to see Romney nodding along.\n\n"Please, call me George, and I hope I can call you Richard?" Cornuelle nodded and the President relaxed, an easy smile forming, "I couldn't agree more. We've tried governmental alleviation of social problems and, while some gains have been made, other wounds have only deepened with nothing to show for it but spent money. I think a new approach, as you described, could help a great number of Americans trapped in the pit."\n\n"To the specifics then, George," Cornuelle said with a wry grin, "Corporate giving programs, as well as making every effort to encourage volunteering and social engagement are natural first steps. But the establishment of the Independent Sector, to bring non-profits, businesses and community leaders under one collaborative roof should be our highest priority."\n\nThe two spoke for about an hour more as Cornuelle laid out his plans. Romney intervened periodically with insightful questions and occasionally suggestions regarding organizational structures and cost-saving clearly inspired by his time in business. It was a productive encounter, future meetings were scheduled, and Romney had a new partner in politics."

rom.12.desc:0 "The Oval Office was buzzing with voices as several prominent RDC senators, including Hubert Humphrey, and their staff happily conversed. While tensions existed within the coalition the Administration was still enjoying its honeymoon phase and any conflicts were dormant for now.\n\n"Thank you for coming, gentlemen," Romney said, his voice immediately quieting the room, "As you know, I asked you here to discuss civil rights. I want legislation moving through Congress to break through the resistance we're still facing in some quarters." Heads were nodding and Humphrey took the opportunity to speak up.\n\n"I think there's plenty of appetite among more liberal quarters of the Senate for more action on civil rights. We can talk about desegregation efforts and enforcement, further antidiscrimination statutes—"\n\n"What about bussing?" Romney broke in, provoking glances between the audience of senators, "We can desegregate today, it's just a matter of administration and transportation. If we want to set a moral, and efficient, example I think that's the best path forward."\n\nEveryone in the room knew that bussing was politically risky, with parents opposing their children being sent to different schools often on the other side of the city from their home, in addition to racist opposition to school integration. But it was also probably the strongest tool the government had to force progress in the face of Southern non-compliance. His mind made up, Humphrey smiled and extended a hand towards Romney.\n\n"Mr. President, I think we're going to do great things together.""

If they won't obey court orders, maybe more fines and litigation will change their tune."\n\nBrooke nodded, accepting the order even as he had misgivings. He had always believed the Attorney-General had a duty to be impartial and dispassionate, not on an issue 'like a bloodhound'. Slightly troubled, he left the Oval Office to begin his work.\n\nFred Miller, superintendent of Lamar County, Georgia schools, leaned back into his chair. Things in the district were just how his predecessor had left them in 1952. Certainly, the district existed under an official desegregation order, but the federal officials had accepted his stated reasons for delay, seeming to lose interest. Abruptly, as he was beginning to doze off, his secretary barged in.\n\n"Fred? There's a letter from the Department of Justice for you." Curious, he perused it. His eyes widened at the mention of 'contempt of court' and positively popped when he saw what the letter had to say about criminal and financial penalties. He felt light-headed and, with the letter staring at him, reached for the phone."

The school was one of the worst in Maryland with only one in five of its students able to read at a grade level and even fewer proficient in mathematics. The district served a largely poor section of Baltimore and clearly lacked funding.\n\n"Thank you, Principal Morris," George Romney said as the man's prattle came to an end, "You've given me a great deal to think about and I can promise you this administration will work to make your students' futures brighter." A firm handshake terminated his visit.\n\nBack in Washington, Romney and his cabinet immediately began delving into the issue of education reform. Schools' funding was uneven, depending on aid from the state and the property taxes of the surrounding community, leaving richer districts far better off than poor ones. That gap would have to be bridged if any kind of improvement in education was to be made.\n\nThe federal government would pick up the tab, the President and his cabinet decided. Uncle Sam's munificence would brighten the lives and education of innumerable children across the country. In order to track the program's success and make sure money was being spent properly, federal testing and curriculum standards would follow the new federal funds.\n\nThis new policy would be a political winner. Parents and teachers would both appreciate the new funds and resources even if children and the unions grumbled about the new testing and standards. While it would cost a fair amount, Romney knew a good investment when he saw one."

Thus, President Romney is beginning his plans for the Independent Sector—voluntary associations of helpers.\n\nWith the Independent Sector operating, issues like poverty and hunger will be addressed not only by government bureaucrats but dedicated highly experienced individuals from the non-governmental world with different approaches and skill sets.

One particular bright point is his program reinsuring bank loans to students for their education.

############ Bennett Response

POLITICS_WALLACE_F_BENNETT_DESC: "Wallace Foster Bennett: America's best hope for a stable future. Born in Salt Lake City to a pair of devout Mormons, Bennett's upbringing was heavily influenced by the tenets of his parents' faith. After a brief stint in the Army as an instructor, he married the youngest daughter of the Mormon President and began a career in business, eventually owning a successful Ford dealership. Like many ambitious men who had accomplished all their goals, Bennett chose to go into politics, being elected Senator for Utah in 1951, albeit under a cloud of controversy after accusing his opponent of being a closet communist.\n\nQuickly becoming a small-government and pro-business stalwart in the Senate, Bennett was soon entrenched as a major force in Washington pushing for conservative values. As the years wore on and America continued to stagnate, Bennett became convinced of the necessity to restore the nation's vitality, his conviction bolstered by Nixon's disgrace and the subsequent malaise that gripped America. Intent to prevent the NPP from steering America into uncertain waters, Bennett made the decision to throw his hat in the ring for the Presidency, hoping to keep the nation on track to a safe, stable and prosperous future.\n\nAlthough he may not have the charisma or big ideals of some of his opponents, Bennett's gambit paid off, the American public choosing a candidate who promised to hold the ship steady and put to rest their uncertainty for the future. Whether or not he will succeed remains to be seen, but it seems that the American public, like their new President, believe the old proverb: that slow and steady wins the race."

USA_wfb_64_bennett_presidency: "The Bennett Presidency"
USA_wfb_64_bennett_presidency_desc: "Wallace F. Bennett has been elected as the 39th President of the United States. In these tumultuous times, he has promised to be a force of stability and compromise, refusing to take a hard line on most issues. Instead he believes that a nuanced approach, with input from both sides of a debate, is preferable. He has also laid out plans to strengthen America's position both within the OFN and beyond, with a myriad of economic and diplomatic programs aimed at uniting the planet's remaining bastions of democracy. There are some who argue that his policies are weak and that his compromises will ultimately leave nobody happy. However, with his personable nature and his willingness for dialogue with anyone, President Bennett might be just what America needs at this moment in history."

USA_wfb_64_fire_extinguisher_desc: "In this current age, the name "United" States of America is almost a joke. With Americans practically at each other's throats over a myriad of issues, not least the issue of civil rights, we can hardly present a unified front to the fascist powers. If we are to restore peace to America, we have to put the fires out. Let's appeal for calm, bring any radicals in the government to heel, and try to calm down the incendiary mood that has been plaguing America for the last few years."

USA_wfb_64_on_radio_desc: "We need the people to be on our side, but they won't respond well to a plea for unity from a faceless government body. To this end, President Bennett has come up with a splendid idea - he shall speak to the people directly. He is clearly popular enough, given that the people voted for him. We have requested some time slots with national radio stations with which the President may engage in some "fireside chats", where he will present his case for a truly united America in a casual, personable manner. President Bennett will not just be the leader of the American people, but also their good friend."

USA_wfb_64_maintain_status_quo_desc: "Now that we are in power, we must firmly put our foot down against those who would seek radical change in the system. The American government has been a bedrock of stability since 1776; any necessary changes have been made perfectly well with due process and gradualism. The radicals who believe that our system needs to be turned upside down only need to look to Germany and Japan to see the inevitable outcome of such sudden change. We will keep the government going as it always has, and ensure that the moderates of the Republican-Democrats always hold the balance of power."

#New Bennett Foci
USA_wfb_64_propose_the_community_of_free_nations: "Propose the Community of Free Nations"
USA_wfb_64_propose_the_community_of_free_nations_desc: "One of many reasons why the Organization of Free Nations is at its nadir, if not the most seminal, is that it lacks a coherent vision of what it should be. That it stands opposed to Japanese and German encroachment is plain to all and sundry - and for a time, sheer contrast sufficed in keeping its members together. Times change, however, and the titans' threat seem magnitudes less now than in 1945. The choice between freedom and servitude no longer has a self evident answer; in fact, murmur dissidents, there never was a right answer to begin with. Ultimately, they say, our methods and intent are no different in essence from those of the empires we detest.\n\nEnter Wallace F. Bennett with a retort from the steps of Capitol Hill. Far be it from us to question the despondent's motives as they attack our resolve, for they wish the best as much as we - and for they are not entirely wrong. Yet it was through the very same resolve that the OFN was birthed. It was because of the selfsame that freedom yet burns like candlelights around the world: weak alone, but together blazing stronger than any inferno. America's next action is and should be to harness its resolve towards nurturing these candlelights, shielding them from the elements, until they grow intense enough to ward the darkness with us. So do we build an unquenchable torch, guiding mankind's way before the inexorable dawn.\n\nOf course, principle without practice is empty bluster. Thus, President Bennett has unveiled the Community of Free Nations, the more civilian sister to the OFN - and, God willing, the eventual key to its members' prosperity. He has big plans in store for the fledgling young thing."
USA_wfb_64_coordinate_national_security: "Coordinate National Security"
USA_wfb_64_coordinate_national_security_desc: "Principal to the OFN's existence is the principle of mutual defence: an attack on one is an attack on all. The South African War tested whether or not its converse - that is, an attack by one is an attack by all - holds water. While it largely did, its implementation still leaves much to be desired. Deficient planning, dismal coordination and a hodgepodge of regulations withheld supplies and delayed critical offensives by weeks, ultimately prolonging South Africa's suffering. The OFN won't have the excuse of inexperience come the next maladjusted intervention, and if it fails because of mistakes supposedly learned in the Highveld, then its planners have only themselves to blame.\n\nWe preempt that sordid business, first and foremost, by formalizing each member state's military obligations. Who does the planning? How much money should a member spend each year? Should pay scales and ranks be standardized? Calibers and measurements? Agreeing to answers for these questions may take time, but the effort expended will cost us much less down the line than never asking at all."

Like declarations of war, proposals are brought to the floor during either a general or special session and voted upon, with a simple majority enshrining their lawhood.\n\nKeep in mind that each member state has its own wants and needs, and that they may conflict with the suggestions our proposal contains. We should thus approach them with a mindset for compromise and a hand outstreched. While our sheer weight will likely ensure that the original proposal passes with little, if any modification, it wouldn't hurt to eke some semblance of unanimity out of the whole affair."
USA_wfb_64_in_defense_of_democracy: "In Defence of Democracy"
USA_wfb_64_in_defense_of_democracy_desc: "Morning of August 2, 1776. Delegates from across the Thirteen Colonies gather in Philadelphia to ratify their independence from Britain. Their steps are halting and uneasy, heavy with the weight of their consciences; a month prior they swore their lives, treasures, and honor for the cause, and now they return to seal such oaths with ink. War is their answer before the rifles and ships of the world's mightiest power. There is no going back now - for as Benjamin Franklin succinctly put: "We must all hang together, or most assuredly, we will all hang separately."\n\nTheir descendants, in spirit and in blood, find themselves at a similar position nearly two hundred years later. The Reich and the Empire creep unto the Free World like tendrils in the undergrowth, seeping into its sturdy rock until it breaks from within. Their armies march five thousand miles while their navies swim five thousand more. These are dark days for democracy, and only if its ilk come together will they never come apart. As the largest and most powerful, America must take charge so the rest are sure to follow."

USA_wfb_64_not_too_much_desc: "The economy is a fickle thing. Even well-meaning stimulus measures can have unforseen consequences, such as increased inflation. Considering the scale of our reforms, we must take measures to stabilize the economy before we can proceed, lest we trigger a recession.

Handled improperly, the transition will be pockmarked with volatile markets and price shocks as a flux of uncertainty for the economy grips the American people.\n\nPresident Bennett has hence directed the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins with less silver percentage by weight. These "Transition Dimes" will become legal tender immediately upon circulation as the Treasury begins gradually demonetizing all coins minted before 1968."

USA_wfb_64_print_replacement_notes_desc: "As silver certificates are phased out, new notes backed purely by fiat are needed to take their place long before their lack of presence is felt by the economy.\n\nTo ensure the transition is as smooth as possible, the Treasury has begun printing a newly-designed series of paper bills in conjunction with the Transition Dimes, with the 'New Greenbacks' to begin circulation at earliest convenience. Current projections predict New Greenbacks to replace all legal tender in circulation within the next five years."
USA_wfb_64_truly_united_congress: "A Truly United Congress"
USA_wfb_64_truly_united_congress_desc: "It's truly proud for citizens to see both parties come together for financial reform. When both parties work together, our government is more united, our country is unified, and our people and their faith in the United States is made stronger. The United States must be stronger financially to fight the despicable dictatorial regimes of Japan and the German Reich."
USA_wfb_64_silver_act: "The Silver Act"
USA_wfb_64_silver_act_desc: "Flush with gold and silver, our Founders decreed that these two precious metals are the bedrock upon which the value of our dollars are established. The use of either has changed as political winds shift over the course of two hundred years; currently, emergency legislation from the Depression ties the dollar to silver bullion only, rather than silver and gold.\n\nThis, however, leaves the American dollar reliant on a metal whose deposits are increasingly being outpaced by America's economic growth. Eventually, the country will run out of bullion before it runs out of greenbacks. To rectify the looming crisis, President Bennett aims to decouple the dollar from silver in increments - using less silver in coinage, restricting dollar-to-silver conversion, etc. - and eventually abolish the silver standard altogether, transforming the dollar into a fiat currency.\n\nMankind may not want to be crucified upon a cross of gold, says a certain presidential candidate... but neither will it agree, surely, to be crucified had the cross been made of silver instead."

Perfidy and subterfuge are their weapons of choice against democracy -- this must be met with vigilance and awareness both from the American government and the American people.\n\nThe federal government shall spearhead such efforts by implementing heightened surveillance measures nationwide. Domestic security apparatuses will see their budgets increased and their priorities reshuffled towards surveillance in the coming months. Civil rights activists raise concerns over the ordinances' supposed authoritarian bent, but President Bennett assures the public that any infringements on American political and civil liberties done during their implementation will be punished accordingly."

USA_wfb_64_military_keynes_desc: "Because a country's economic output is decided largely by total demand of its goods in domestic and international markets, high consumer spending is necessary in order to maintain a strong and healthy economy. Demand must be kept up across all sectors, with government intervention if necessary -- services, agriculture, electronics... and national defense.\n\nContractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing make much of their revenue from weapons sales to the federal government.

To our east, the German tyrants oppress a whole continent and consign millions to the century-old evils of slavery. To our west, the Rising Sun scorches the backs of a billion laborers in the name of a Sphere whose luxuries they must craft, but can never partake of. Freedom has marched a hasty retreat since the Second World War, and in its exhaustion it has settled upon Lady Liberty's star-spangled crown. Its influence has manifested in the achievements we have since attained in furthering the freedoms of men -- economic, political, social."\n\n"Today we are mired in a war of higher purpose than any war undertaken by any man in human history. It is brinksmanship - not of arms, but of words and deeds. It is won only through exploiting the flaws of lasting ideologies, not the flaws of short-lived men. Thus there is no better time to flaunt the timeless principles which we, the people, have enshrined in our democracy's laws: That all men are created equal, and that we all are bestowed by God the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...""

It rides on the hype in the beginning, cutting a respectable distance from its competition, before collapsing dead long before it's competition become tired; each person on the world has different specialties, and the risk of causing long term damage by meddling with matters we are not perfectly in control over short term gain is unwise.\n\nThe senators may scream ours ear off. The NPP may use this as an opportunity to criticize. The public may have a temporary pain.

Rather, he thinks that the OFN would be better served practicing the democracy it celebrates.\n\nAmong the policies intended to bring such opinion into being include providing all member-states with an equal say in deciding upon the organization's decisions and mandates. In this setup America would, ideally, only be first among equally-sized cogs comprising the great machine of freedom and prosperity.\n\nA loose coalition of Democrats and National Progressives have spoken out against President Bennett's decision, citing the "willful weakening" of America's influence within the OFN.

The wisdom of saints from two thousand years ago rings as strongly now as it had then, even in a context so far detached from the original as international relations. Then again, are not nations themselves persons writ large, with beliefs which they either accept or reject?\n\nFor the matter at hand is thus: the member-states believe that economic assistance from the OFN (or rather, the CFN) is necessary, yet they too believe caution is warranted at any great step towards building such mechanisms. After all, they are largely unproven ground - and who knows if they can withstand the forces which seek to topple them?

Post-war governments understandably tied their legitimacy to economic recovery; when their coffers failed to deliver, their figureheads shared the fate of paupered royals past. The sensible ones turned to credit lines for relief, but after Sealion shattered the international systems London had built, Frankfurt and Tokyo were the only two options for most. The world today needs an alternative more than it ever had before.\n\nThe brightest minds of the Ivy League have rallied around three solutions: easy access to American credit, easy access to American expertise, and institutions which dole the former two out to our allies, friends, and fellow democracies. Prerequisite to their disbursement are assurances that the recipient must enact certain political, economic, and social reforms - a rather nifty concept several have suggested to ensure the CFN is also free in practice. While several member-states are understandably nervous about what such reforms entail, it is our onus to convince them that the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, will become net positives for both the democratic cause and the world's general prosperity."

It should come as no surprise that instability poses the biggest risk to the Free World's prosperity - and nowhere is the current state of affairs more unstable than in the worth of currencies from nation to nation. A pound can be worth as much as a dime one day, half that the month following, and close to a dollar two months later. Movements so drastic turn even the most profitable deals into break-even disappointments; with the razor thin margins international transactions live by, is it really any wonder businesses have grown so sluggishly as of late?\n\nThe Treasury suggests tethering the Free World's currencies to the stolid dollar in response. From now until negotiated otherwise, a pound will go for exactly a certain number of dollars, and not a cent more or less. Knowing that such an equivalence won't budge overmuch for long periods of time will help businesses plan around long-distance, long-term contracts while still feeling confident in expecting returns, in turn encouraging trade across our bloc. This comes at the cost of the level of control national banks currently wield over their currencies - which, incidentally, is why the Australians and Canadians are rather averse to any sort of currency peg at the moment. We owe them assurances and time, if nothing else."

USA_wfb_64_free_access_clause_desc: "Ever since the days of Henry Clay and "internal improvements", goods have historically flowed out of America, not in. Our forefathers saw the wisdom in an economy equally independent from foreign interference as their government, and so they encouraged industries which fulfilled the people's needs first before selling what is left to the wider world. High tariffs preserved the American character of our markets for over a century since. Such policies have doubtless enriched Americans, made America richest besides... but will they enrich the Free World with her? Have they?\n\nCommerce Secretary Fowler emphatically said no. In fact high tariffs, he continued, render our allies into little more than impoverished dependents for American goods, with no means of selling their own. The solution, then, is to willingly curtail the advantages which cement our own goods' predominance, allowing the rest of the Free World to profit off us in turn.\n\nNeedless to say, his proposal has few friends both in Congress and among the public, least of all among the workers whose produce he intends to disadvantage.

As they began from words uttered in one mansion, so would they conclude in another: the Mount Washington Hotel, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.\n\nNations across two oceans gather in the foothills of the Appalachians like the gods of Mount Olympus, and their decrees shall thunder along the valleys below until every ear in every land will have heard them loud and clear. Yet like gods they bicker and spat; they may even leave with nothing to show for. In the coming days the Free World will either come together or come apart like the brittle granite beneath its feet. Which shall its leaders choose?"
USA_wfb_64_bretton_woods: "The Bretton-Woods System"
USA_wfb_64_bretton_woods_desc: "However much or however little that had changed, that a new era has approached the Free World is undeniable.\n\nWhat change that did arrive manifested in its implements. Infused with cash, its sword has sharpened and its aegis fortified. Barriers dismantled, its scale jingles with more coins from afar than ever. Bolstered by agreements, its coffers are made secure from the worst of maladies. And with the OFN's newborn siblings on matters financial, civilian, and economic, its arm extends much farther afield to the Slave World, wielding strength and benevolence in equal parts. Vast reserves of America's potential now entwine the ties that bind one democracy to the rest.\n\nMore work remains to be done before such ties become inseperable. Nevertheless, the adoption of the so-called Bretton Woods system shall become the seminal moment in bringing it about."

USA_wfb_64_political_necessity: "Political Necessity"
USA_wfb_64_political_necessity_desc: "Like it or not, we need to deal with this civil rights issue. It was President Nixon's lack of initiative in carrying out needed reform that led to the current crisis, and while the issue stands, it is unlikely America will be able to focus on anything else. Unlike some, however, we are not so keen to just kick the segregationists to the curb. After all, denying them their say will just transfer the wrath of the debate from one side to the other. We need a solution that pleases both sides - or at least one that doesn't upset either side too much."
USA_wfb_64_token_reform: "Token Reform"
USA_wfb_64_token_reform_desc: "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is a modest program of reform. With some new laws to protect the worst injustices against our African American population, we can prove to them that we are listening. We might have to tick off the segregationists a little bit to achieve this, but as long as we toe the line and water down some of the more radical proposals, we can settle this issue without making too many people unhappy."
USA_wfb_64_codified_protections: "Codified Protections"
USA_wfb_64_codified_protections_desc: "While there have been efforts in the past to grant rights and liberties to African Americans, lawmakers have time and time again manipulated and creatively interpreted the law to deny them these rights. Our efforts should focus on modifying federal law to legally codify the rights, guarantees and protections granted to these American citizens in a clear, well-defined manner. By closing the legal loopholes used to keep them oppressed, we can ensure that racial minorities are granted the fundamental protections needed to bring them on level with the rest of America."
USA_wfb_64_crack_down_on_resistance: "Crack Down on Continued Resistance"
USA_wfb_64_crack_down_on_resistance_desc: "It's time to clear the streets. Protests and riots are still ongoing across the country, and if we are to ensure a civilized debate we must put an end to these constant battlegrounds. We will increase police funding, send them out to round up the worst trouble makers and order the rest of the people home. To avoid accusations of political favouritism, we will crack down on the violence on both sides. If either side wants to be listened to, they need to start acting like adults."
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection: "Voting Station Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection_desc: "Voter suppression is a major issue that has been flagged by the civil rights activists. Minorities are often prevented from voting through a myriad of obscure regulations, a confusing registration process and a lack of non-English language materials. We should send out inspectors to certain problem areas to make sure everyone is being offered their democratic rights. This should also make us more popular amongst the civil rights movement without annoying the segregationists too much - after all, we're just enforcing rights people should already be entitled to."
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push: "One Great Push"
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push_desc: "President Bennett wants the civil rights debate settled as soon as possible. He has gathered the lawmakers together for a marathon session that aims to introduce a rapid fire sequence of laws to vote. He has hopes that if we can get the issue dealt with quickly, we can keep it out of the news cycle for a lengthy period and thus lessen the anger segregationists might feel towards us than if we were to allow the process to drag out. The time for idling is over - let's get this issue sorted once and for all."
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat: "Don't Rock the Boat"
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat_desc: "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is to pursue a cautious policy in dealing with the civil rights issue. The concerns of the segregationists cannot be ignored, and to force them to change their ways would be an act of tyranny. We can still offer some basic reforms that will give protections to minority communities, but they might be left wanting. Still, the segregationists do constitute a significant proportion of our voting base, and the needs of the party must be considered."
USA_wfb_64_check_committees: "Keep the Committees in Check"
USA_wfb_64_check_committees_desc: "Most Americans' experience with legislation as a process begins and ends at the Oval Office, where the President signs Congress-approved bills into law in front of cameras and key allies. What the memoirs and tabloids neglect to mention, perhaps because of their comparative lack of glamor if not scandal, is that these laws have to pass through a whole battery of committees and subcommittees before they even see the light of Capitol Hill. Astute observers would point out this facet of American lawmaking's mind-bogglingly byzantine nature... but for the Beltway's savvy participants, the tedium this presents is a beloved tool to keep the laws they dislike from ever seeing the light of Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Bennett is aware of the many ways his opponents can utilize this fearsome bureaucratic bludgeon to undermine the passage of his own Civil Rights Act, and plans to make appeals of support to his fellow Republican-Democrats in the appropriate committees."
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes: "Rally Congressional Votes"
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes_desc: "If we are to resolve the civil rights matter, we must secure the support of Congress to pass the necessary legislation. Thanks to both the charisma of President Bennett and the party's balanced position on the matter, it may be possible to rally congressmen from the Democrats, the Progressives, and the Nationalists all at once. This will require some deals to be cut with various factions and interest groups within Congress to get some of the more wavering folks on board, but as long as we promise to push a few of their personal causes forwards a bit it shouldn't be difficult to garner their votes. When we have their support, we will be ready to do what is necessary for the future of the nation."
USA_wfb_64_right_to_free_speech: "The Right to Free Speech"
USA_wfb_64_right_to_free_speech_desc: "Freedom of speech is a core pillar of American society. To deny it to anyone, no matter their opinion, is a gross breach of the vision our Founding Fathers had for this country. Both the segregationists and the civil rights activists call each other's words 'reprehensible,' 'disgusting' and 'un-American,' but the truth is that we must allow them both to have a say. We may not like what they have to say, but we shall defend to the death their right to say it - no matter who 'they' are or 'what they have to say' is."
USA_wfb_64_keep_it_vague: "Keep it Vague"
USA_wfb_64_keep_it_vague_desc: "We know the civil rights activists want to be heard, and we hear them. We shall assure them that they are important to us and that we are willing to do what needs to be done. Eventually. We will promise them things, that we will deliver at some point, as-so-when-there-to-for the opportune opportunity arises. What are those things? When will they be delivered? Don't worry, the government knows what it's doing. The people should not worry themselves, they must understand that we are doing what we can. When we can do it. If we can do it. Maybe."
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections: "State Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections_desc: "The Southern States are extremely opposed to any federal oversight in their election process. While it's true that there are aspects of their infrastructure and legislation that are rather unfair to minority communities, we cannot risk looking like federal tyrants and giving more legitimacy to the Far-Right NPP. What we can do is simply encourage the states themselves to examine their own systems, and form investigations on the state level to root out discriminatory practices. Many will argue that this will lead to inevitable bias on the part of the states and nothing will actually change. On the other hand, if any true change is to happen, it must come from below as well as from above."
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step: "Step by Step, Bit by Bit"
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step_desc: "It is as the old saying goes - 'slow and steady wins the race.' History has shown us that the most successful changes don't happen overnight, but take steady reform over many years to take their desired effect. We can make some progress to make the civil rights people happy while still keeping the segregationists on side. Rather than introducing reforms all at once, we will implement them gradually - this way, conservatives are not shocked by a rapid paradigm shift in our culture, and progressives can rest assured that change is coming, albeit slowly."
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution: "An Acceptable Solution"
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution_desc: "It has taken a lot of careful balancing, but we have devised a strategy which might be palatable to both sides of the civil rights issue. We've taken on board criticism and concerns from both sides of the debate - we may have leaned slightly one way or the other, but it matters not. The point is, we have several bills lined up that should hopefully get most of America on the same page. This includes a range of civil rights legislation that has taken on board both the desires of the civil rights movement as well as the concerns of the segregationists. We can prove that the art of compromise is key in solving America's issues."
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people: "The Voices of the People"
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people_desc: "We can argue about the specifics of what civil rights actually mean all day, but nobody understands what they mean better than those directly affected. All across the country, millions of African Americans and other minorities languish, disenfranchised from the political system. Many of them simply do not bother to engage in politics as a result. If we are to unite America, we should reach out to their communities and get them directly involved in both local and national politics. We can make their voices heard, and allow them to join the conversation."
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts: "Leave it to the Experts"
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts_desc: "State governors and other local politicians are far more suited to deciding policy on the matter of civil rights than federal politicians in Washington. While we can still encourage them to take a more progressive tone on the issue, they should ultimately have the final say on what exact reforms take place. After all, they were voted for by the people of their respective states, so they are clearly qualified to make the important decisions on what is best for their local communities."
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees: "Subcommittees upon Subcommittees"
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees_desc: "American history is replete with instances where laws are applied such that they are not applied at all, yet seem to be applied if observed at a glance. One need look no further than the Reconstruction-era amendments for glaring examples of such -- and painfully relevant ones at that, considering what the President is planning to add to the long and hefty list thereof.\n\nAfter consulting with his advisors and party members in Congress, he has accepted that pursuing civil rights any further will invite more paralysis than the American political system can afford. Capital and goodwill wasted on exchanging old allies for new and controversial stances is capital and goodwill not spent on curtailing America's rampant inflation, or on containing fascism's metastasis in the world's last unblemished patches.\n\nBut neither can he afford to be seen by the public as ignoring the issue wholesale. With this in mind, he turns to the Congressman's second truest friend next to the filibuster: Red tape. If you want the right thing done after trying everything else, to modify a saying..."
USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open: "Leave the Door Open"
USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open_desc: "While we have taken a more conservative path on the issue of civil rights than the activists might like, there is no reason why we cannot have more change in the future. As President Bennett has insisted in the past, real change does not happen overnight. Though the government needs to get on to other things, we can keep the discussion going, and encourage those who believe in the cause of civil rights to direct their efforts towards future reforms. This way, we can keep the civil rights movement reasonably content and also prevent the segregationists from feeling alienated."
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key: "Under Lock and Key"
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key_desc: "We should make it clear that, for the foreseeable future at least, the issue of civil rights is settled. We have already devoted far too much time to the issue, and it is time we get on to other more pressing matters of government. The civil rights movement will probably be somewhat upset, but they should at least acknowledge that they are in a better position than they were before. Putting our foot down should also reassure the Dixiecrats that we aren't abandoning them or our own values."
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats: "Empower the Republicans"
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats_desc: "With government policy taking a distinctly conservative turn, President Bennett is now presented with a unique opportunity. Many people are finding their faith in the Republicans - once shattered after the loss of the war - suddenly revived. We have the chance to present ourselves as the new face of the status quo, and finally restore our party to dominance in the American political theatre. We will always be grateful to our Democrat partners for ensuring our survival these past two decades, of course. But now it is time for us to return to our place in the sun."
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms: "Clarify Certain Terms"
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms_desc: "The acts we have passed so far, on top of a myriad of other regulations and laws established by previous governments, has left the legislation on the matter of civil rights a confusing mess. This ambiguity has left both segregationists and civil rights activists uncertain of where exactly they stand. Now that we have put the foot down on any further legislation, we should focus our efforts on clarifying the laws that already exist, ensuring all terms are clearly defined and that there is no more room for 'creative interpretations'. All Americans must be able to clearly understand the laws they live under."
USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans: "Sideline the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans_desc: "Some of our Democrat partners are reportedly distraught at the path our government is taking, feeling that their liberal values are being ignored. We should gently remind them that it was the corruption and abject failure of the previous administrations that saw them swept from power, and saw us swept into it. They should understand that the people do not want them anymore, so they should step back and let us give America the leadership it deserves. Perhaps, one day, we shall have a Republican-Democratic Coalition once again..."
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability: "Through Guidance, Stability"
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability_desc: "President Bennett has proven that the Republicans can take the lead in national politics through their calm, conservative manner of governance. While many may clamor for true progress, it is in the interests of all that the stability of the nation be considered first and foremost. The fires of progress must be kept controlled by the guiding hand of tradition, lest the fire set our society aflame. To the good people of the civil rights movement; we know you are not satisfied, but you must be patient, for our society is not quite ready to accept your view just yet. Your time will come, but for the time being, we must keep America steady as she goes."
USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories: "Listen to Their Stories"
USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories_desc: "It is a sad reality that segregationists view African Americans as less than people, a concept they have been taught all their lives. While it is unlikely we could convince the most staunch racists of the error of their ways, we could still change the minds of some of the more moderate people. We should encourage the civil rights supporters, especially the African Americans themselves, to speak up about their experiences and how segregation has affected them. By giving them a voice to speak directly to the segregationists, we might be able to change some minds and get most people on board with the reforms we need."
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor: "Take the Floor"
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor_desc: "With our policy direction mostly decided upon, it is time for us to convince the party to support our policy. While we are unlikely to change the minds of those staunchly against us, we can still win over those wavering in the middle who remain ambivalent. By taking the lead in the debates on the Senate floor, we can gain the necessary support we need to see our course through to its conclusion. All we need to do to get people on our side is talk to them."
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress: "Symbols of Progress"
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress_desc: "We have made significant concessions to the civil rights movement and made efforts to engage minority communities. However, our conservative voter base is beginning to voice unease, feeling that we are beginning to turn away from them. We have done much good, but it is time to put the civil rights issue to bed. We have done more than enough to benefit people, and if we stop now we can avoid upsetting the segregationists any more than they already are."
USA_wfb_64_fine_line: "A Fine Line"
USA_wfb_64_fine_line_desc: "Our careful balance of both liberal and conservative values has earned us at least muted approval from both sides of the spectrum. True to his word, President Bennett has gone to great lengths to bring all of America under one banner, favoring neither side above the other, while ensuring everyone walks away reasonably happy. Nobody can say they got everything they wanted, but that is the nature of compromise. With our government policy taking a reasonable middle ground, it is highly likely that for the most part, the status quo will be maintained within the halls of power."
USA_wfb_64_real_change: "Real Change"
USA_wfb_64_real_change_desc: "The fight for a Civil Rights bill has been unceasing in Congress ever since Dewey's election in 1948, only to be foiled time and time again, whether through the conservative coalition of Dixiecrats and right-wing Republicans, a tepid Eisenhower administration, or Nixonian ambivalence.\n\nDespite lingering concerns over states' rights and Federal overreach, President Bennett, however, has a changed tune. Under significant pressure by Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson and liberals within the RDC, the 39th President of the United States has announced his intention to sign a civil rights bill if passed by Congress."
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans: "Empower the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans_desc: "The strength of the Democrats in Congress has been a defining feature of American politics ever since the post-war backlash swept out a generation of Depression-era Republicans from office.\n\nTheir failure in the war devastated their party and plunged the nation into the political chaos that birthed the RDC and the NPP. But now the Democrats are supreme. No longer will conservative Republicans be able to stall America's progress. The emphasis of the RDC will now be on the D."
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken: "A Perfectly Broken System"
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken_desc: "In the past, some have called the union of the Democratic and the Republican parties a Frankenstein, an abomination - a traditionally liberal and traditionally conservative party joined at the hip, a coalition too broad and diametrically opposed to work. As President Bennett proves, a consideration of the values of both parties is actually far more beneficial to our nation than simply considering each set of values in isolation. Besides, we've made broad-spectrum politics work far better than the NPP and their constant bickering amongst themselves. In all, the Bennett presidency has made the bond between the Republicans and Democrats stronger than ever; even if we have our ups and downs with each other, we have shown we can work together for the betterment of all."
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity: "Through Fellowship, Unity"
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity_desc: "The one thing President Bennett has not compromised on is his willingness to compromise. Never once doubting that meaningful change can be achieved while still respecting those who value tradition, he has ensured that all aspects of our society are represented, proving himself the true master of compromise. There is always more room for changes and alterations in the future, but with all parties reasonably satisfied, we can save those future discussions for another day. Segregationists, civil rights activists, people and politicians - we are all Americans, and now we can step forwards to face the issues of the day together."
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats: "Sideline the Republicans"
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats_desc: "Lyndon Johnson is the master of the Senate. With over three decades in Congress and nearly a decade as the majority leader of the greatest deliberative body, Johnson is no stranger to political fights.\n\nWhile Westerners could be bought off with dams and water projects, the Plains with subsidies and block grants, Johnson knows there is no swaying the South on the issue of Segregation. Neither pork nor influence nor bribery will sway the men of Southland to come around on Civil Rights, and Johnson won't even bother.\n\nAnd he'll make sure the Republicans know that too."
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act: "A Voting Rights Act"
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act_desc: "Lyndon B. Johnson, senate leader for the Democrats, has taken the floor with the support of various figures from his party faction to propose a Voting Rights Act. This act would go a step further than the protections we have implemented thus far, and guarantee the political and voting rights of African Americans and other minorities on the federal level. With progressive values beginning to win out across both the Republicans and the Democrats, it would make little sense to oppose this new bill, which would cement our support with the civil rights movement. However, many within our party fear this would be seen as a grave transgression by the segregationists, and that we will likely lose a lot of support in the south for allowing this to go through."
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress: "Through Change, Progress"
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress_desc: "We are conservatives; that much has not changed, but to fail to let other ideas be heard and take root when the nation so clearly needs them is the height of bullheadedness. We understand that our traditional voters may not agree, but it is our duty to represent all Americans, not just those who tick our box at the polls. By guaranteeing true unalienable rights for everyone, we ensure that the nation can truly work together as one entity. To the segregationists; we understand we have disappointed you, but know that we will continue to represent you in all other aspects. Even the seasons change, and for the sake of our country, so too must America."
USA_wfb_64_for_all_the_struggle: "For All the Struggle..."
USA_wfb_64_for_all_the_struggle_desc: "For over a decade, the issue of civil rights has hung over America like a looming storm cloud, bringing discord and upheaval in its wake. Nary a year ago streets all across our nation echoed with the yells of progressives and segregationists crying fury in each other's faces, seeing each other not as fellow Americans but as enemies. The issue threatened to tear apart the very fabric of America. Now, the streets are mostly quiet. Those once bellicose protesters and furious statesmen have either celebrated the dawn of a new day, or accepted that the world has moved past their squabbles. Even if some are still upset, President Bennett has successfully secured the continued stability of American society."
USA_wfb_64_we_are_stronger: "We are All the Stronger"
USA_wfb_64_we_are_stronger_desc: "We can call the issue of civil rights resolved, at least for now. Any further legislation on the matter can be handled in a calm, rational manner over time, as our great political system always allowed for. With the main source of consternation in our nation quelled, we can finally present ourselves as a strong, united force against all the darkness of the world. Unlike in Japan or Germany, we Americans handle our issues with dignity, lawfulness and common ground, not jackboots and suppression. By setting this example for not only our country, but for all the remaining free nations of the world, we can let humanity know that democracy is still kicking!"
USA_wfb_64_torch_burns_bright: "The Torch Burns Bright"
USA_wfb_64_torch_burns_bright_desc: "In his wisdom, President Jefferson once said that the tree of liberty must be watered every so often by the blood of patriots. President Bennett was not one for violence -- but he does believe that the torch of human freedom must likewise be fed with kindling and tinder. The intensity of its flames proportions itself accordingly to the quality of its tendered fuel; stronger commitments to like-minded causes create brighter, more beautiful flames.\n\nEight years of hindsight has led the President to appreciate how far it has grown: Once sputtered licks of ember after Watergate, now a blazing inferno after the many reforms of his two terms. At home, the American people now exercise their freedoms under a safe and stable system managed by capable men. Abroad, America's own league of free nations grow by leaps and bounds, bringing life and vigor to ideals besieged by fascist empires..."
USA_wfb_64_lady_liberty_fights_on: "Lady Liberty Fights On"
USA_wfb_64_lady_liberty_fights_on_desc: "...This state of affairs cannot last, of course. Systems are wont to be upended by their own weight in time, and a large enough crisis can knock one over to make room for another, better suited to tackle the present and its issues than the past's. But the weary Utahn allowed himself some satisfaction for making the most out of his Presidency, and thus in bringing about the feats his country can achieve at its greatest.\n\nWallace F. Bennett let out a chuckle as he leaned back against the most prestigious office chair in Washington, D.C. His feet laid atop the Resolute Desk, legs now free to shuffle about a desk void of drafts and memos for the first time in eight years. America can fight its causes without him... but with him, he can deservedly say, it has gained the disposition and the means to fight on for many decades yet.\n\nNot bad for a Mormon office clerk, all things considered."

WFB.2.t: "Appointment of Edmund Muskie"
WFB.2.desc: "If one were to think of an ideal candidate for Secretary of State, Edmund Muskie... wouldn't be it. He's reserved, blunt, and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs. But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him. If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats. As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century. Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland. As one editor wryly put it: "Sending Muskie against the Germans would be like sending a three-toed sloth out to seize turf from a wolverine.""
WFB.2.a: "I guess we'll just have to see."

WFB.3.t: "Appointment of Absalom Robertson"
WFB.3.desc: ""Absalom, Absalom!" reads more than one witty editorial headline. With the nomination of Absalom Robertson to the post of Treasury Secretary, the reference to Dixie literature is adroit, but Robertson himself is a serious man. A scion of Virginia's powerful Byrd Organization, Robertson belongs firmly in the camp of conservative Southern Democrats, adamantly opposed to any sort of integration. His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress. But it also has many in the opposition worried. The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits. What might it do to those who come out against Bennett's agenda, especially with an arch-conservative in the driver's seat? And then there's that new production company that his son, Pat, is setting up..."
WFB.3.a: "Deo vindice"

WFB.4.t: "Appointment of Robert McNamara"
WFB.4.desc: "It would be unfair to call Robert Strange McNamara a man of numbers, and numbers alone. Sure, he made his name as Harvard's youngest professor, and helped save Ford from its postwar fiscal chaos. But McNamara has his fair share of ideology. In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach. Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence. Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency. To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict. The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?"
WFB.4.a: "Let's hope that he isn't derelict in his duty."

WFB.51.t: "Stopgap Measures"
WFB.51.desc: "With silver reserves at all-time lows, the metallic backing system that supports America's currency is in crisis. While the Bennett White House begins to push their legislative reform plan, Treasury Secretary Robertson has already directed the U.S. Mint to take a variety of stopgap measures. By halting the production of a number of denominations, the hope is that the decline in silver reserves will begin to stabilize. After all, we can't afford to be profligate at times like this!"
WFB.51.a: "Won't somebody think of the commemorative dollar coins?"

WFB.52.t: "Emergency Price Increases"
WFB.52.desc: "Glasses clinked throughout the restaurant, sealing deals and friendships. David had tried to figure out what brand of vermouth they used here, but it was apparently a trade secret. No matter; the martinis were dry as a bone, and the conversations were juicy, by the standards of commodities bankers. More and more, those conversations were turning to one thing: silver.\n\n"-the guys in Toronto were practically banging on my door, trying to figure out the right spot price-"\n\n"-new Peruvian projects are gonna get murdered on opex, I don't care what the department is saying-"\n\n"-goddamn disgraceful, interfering like this-"\n\nDavid bit his lip, thinking about all the deals and projects and fortunes tied up in this business, all being thrown into disarray by the Bennett White House's great silver buy-up. Supply was getting tighter, and prices were growing higher. "Stabilizing reserves, my ass," he thought."
WFB.52.a: "Simply assume and refill."

WFB.53.t: "Replacement Printing Begins"
WFB.53.desc: "Clank, clank, whoosh, whoosh, clank clank, whoosh, whoosh.\n\nWillis Robertson watched the presses of the Philadelphia Mint do their endless work. The first new American dollars, free of backing from the silver markets, were coming off the presses today. As Treasury Secretary, he was obligated to attend. It made for some nice photos. First, he had been shown some of the hard-working men and women (well, one woman, anyway) who designed anti-counterfeiting markers. His bureaucrat guides then showed off the vast quantities of ink, paper, and machinery that, when combined, created one of the world's most important currencies. One of the guides brought out a new five-dollar bill, and offered it to Robertson. He obligingly held it up for the UPI cameraman, smiling as the paper Abe Lincoln grimaced."
WFB.53.a: "Money never sleeps."

WFB.54.t: "Passage of the Silver Purchase Act of [GetYear]"
WFB.54.desc: "Today, the Silver Act passed both houses of Congress with moderate fanfare. In spite of some reservations about the economic impact of the act, it passed with a significant majority. This act is merely part of a larger initiative on the part of President Bennett to abandon a metallic standard altogether, to be replaced with a fiat currency backed only by the word of the Treasury Department.\n\nMore a removal of past legislation than anything, the act includes multiple provisions geared toward a decrease in silver backing. The most major among these directives is the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which effectively subsidized and encouraged silver mining to unnatural levels. The act also allowed for the production of $1 and $2 Federal Reserve notes to keep up with a changing economy.\n\nLawmakers hope the act will prove successful. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act will prevent rampant overspending on silver by the Treasury, and hopefully increase fiscal responsibility in general. Concerns over the passage have been minimal, and many are greatly relieved by the move toward a more simplified and robust currency."
WFB.54.a: "Our currency is no longer pegged to silver."

WFB.55.t: "The American Greenback"
WFB.55.desc: "Washington (AP): In a move that rattled currency markets, President Bennett has directed Treasury Secretary Robertson to officially suspend the convertibility of the US dollar into silver or other reserve assets. The closure of the silver window is the final step in transforming the dollar into a fiat currency, one of the President's signature election promises. The President stated:\n\n"With the end of the silver standard, the American economy enters a new era of stability. Our allies and partners abroad join us to create a stable financial order that all may benefit from. I'm confident that across continents and oceans, prosperity and trade will spread like they never have before.""
WFB.55.a: "Wasn't there a movie about this, with a witch and a scarecrow?"

WFB.57.t: "For the Benefit of All Mankind"
WFB.57.desc: ""Few remember the beginning of peace in 1919. It was a time when a new relationship between the nations, the colonized and the colonizers, seemed inevitable. It was a time when Americans, who had won their independence from a colonial power nearly two hundred years earlier, responded sympathetically to the struggle for independence and freedom, and self-respect. It was a time when we thought we could see the end of Empires, the beginning of a new, more just, more equal global order."\n\n"We should not have been surprised when that promise failed to materialize, and we should not have been surprised that a fragile peace held up by a force of arms did not make easy the task of building the world anew."\n\n"As that promise died in the jaws of totalitarianism, America was diverted by her own troubles, struggling to emerge from the Depression. Our attention divided as we fumbled into war, unprepared and unready. Dealt a defeat not soon forgotten, a lesson not easy to ignore."\n\n"Yet, the problems in our own country, in our cities and towns are enormous. They demand and deserve a far greater share of our attention and our resources than we have given them in many years. Nevertheless, we do have concerns and responsibilities in the rest of the world. Out of our experience in the Second World War, we have sought, and are seeking wiser ways to play our proper role in the affairs of mankind. I believe we can do more than we have been doing. I believe we can do so together with those who seek understanding, respect, and friendship. I think the American people have a desire to do so."\n\n"This is not merely because of any direct security interest we may have or because we should wish to compete for favors with other great powers. It is because we cannot be faithful to fundamental American values unless we show our concern for the human condition wherever men and women live."\n\n"We should, all of us, realize by now that the problems of mankind and the promise of mankind are two sides of the same coin."" 
WFB.57.a: ""What, then, should America do? First...""

WFB.58.t: "On Money and Power"
WFB.58.desc: "The fact that Bennett was supposed to be allied with Stuart Symington provided no comfort to the President. Especially not in the face of the Missouri Senator's cold prickly glare. The President resisted the temptation to reach for coffee, choosing to nurse at his temples instead.\n\n"Senator, I sympathize with your concerns over the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to raise its rates, but I do not see any possible recourse I could pursue even if I wished to," Bennett stated evenly.\n\nSymington's expression was unmoved. "I find it hard to believe, Mr. President. A man who has the power of the Presidency yet is unable to adjust our monetary policy."\n\nBennett grimaced, feeling the beginnings of a headache. "Senator, that may have been the case when Nixon was President, but I cannot unduly pressure an independent Federal body to reverse course merely because it is pursuing an unpopular policy." Bennett reached for the coffee, "Senator, we have to respect the independence and expertise of the Federal Reserve and its chair. Might I add, a chair who is now confirmed by the Senate."\n\n"Mr. President, I did not vote for your nominee without reservations. Those reservations include not being asked to accept the so-called expertise of the Federal Reserve when it is actively pursuing policies that will harm our economy and the American taxpayer." Symington's mouth curled into a sneer, "Especially not policies that will adversely affect the disadvantaged, the colored, and the farmers, none of whom have gotten a fair shake this century."\n\nBennett took another sip of coffee, "Senator, I respect your expertise and your console, but I cannot and will not countenance a reversal of our present stance merely because of the Fed's methods. I wish you well on the drive back to Congress."\n\nSymington wordlessly took his absence. Leaving Bennett to turn to his chief of staff. "Who's next?"\n\n"Congressman Powell, New York's 18th, Sir.""
WFB.58.a: ""It's going to be a long night.""

### CFN in memoriam tex ###
WFB.60.t: "The Announcement of the CFN"
WFB.60.desc: "At last, after countless meetings, memoranda, and conferences, President Wallace F. Bennett felt confident enough about the state of his masterwork to unveil it to the public. So he read out an address in front of a joint session of Congress in the Capitol, as befit the gravity of the situation.\n\n"My fellow Americans, my fellow citizens of the Free World, and all those who may listen. I am honored to inform you all of a new, innovative, democratic program to promote the welfare and stability of our great nations. The Community of Free Nations."\n\nIn Chile, Hugo Zepeda watched the speech on TV and nodded with approval. This was an initiative he could support.\n\n"The Community - or CFN for short - will tightly integrate the economic, military, and diplomatic power of the Free World. Unifying our disparate strengths to combat the insanity, bigotry, and expansionism of the twin Yamato and Hitlerite tyrannies."\n\nIn Nanjing, the reformist firebrand Tao Xisheng read a briefing on Bennett's announcement and wondered whether it might be a good idea to work with this Xi-ai-fu-ai-na thing of theirs when they got the Japanese out of China.\n\n"It is our earnest hope that this Community will be able to bring about a new, better era for this world of ours. That it will incentivize people of goodwill the world over to unite with each other to secure a better future. Thank you, and may God bless America and the Free World."\n\nAs President Bennett finished his address, the host of journalists and politicians - not least among them Carlos Lacerda - rose in enthusiastic applause.\n\n"Not a bad welcome," Bennett thought."
WFB.60.a: "An auspicious beginning."

WFB.61.t: "The Issue of Logistics"
WFB.61.desc: "Today, Wallace F. Bennett, President of the United States, found himself visited by the former Secretary of the Treasury, Clark Clifford, who had an idea for the implementation of the Community of Free Nations. As always, Clifford's face was flat, not betraying overmuch emotion, but Bennett could tell from his eyes that he was fairly eager to see this idea of his through.\n\nClifford weaved a long argument, filled to the brim with numbers and statistics, to convince Bennett to support his plan to consolidate the military logistics of the United States and other members of the CFN. He even brought up examples and data that he had discovered in his time working as a member of the Ford Motor Company to prove that combining logistics in a single organization would make things easier for everyone.\n\nAfter Clifford finished his presentation, Bennett nodded in approval. "You're sure all this will work, Mr. Clifford?"\n\nClifford smiled slightly, "Oh, for certain. I've looked into everything, sir. Hammered it out with our allies as well; they seem receptive from what I can tell, though I can't be certain quite yet."\n\nBennett nodded. "I understand.""
WFB.61.a: ""Let's give it a whirl.""

WFB.62.t: "Why we Must"
WFB.62.desc: ""Mr. President," acknowledged the Secretary of State.\n\n"What do you have for me today?"\n\n"It's about the proposed 'League of Free Nations' that we've been discussing. Symington is ready to publicize, but Scott wants to be sure of your support."\n\n"My support?" Bennett raised an eyebrow, "Scott has known me long enough to know that I won't reject the plan if it comes to my desk. Why does he want it?"\n\n"Mr. President, several senators, conservative senators, are skeptical. Having one of their own speak up in support would go a long way in easing their fears."\n\n"And if I share their concerns?"\n\nMuskie glanced at the portrait of Washington hanging above the fireplace, wondering what he would think about a Secretary of State imploring his President to seek out 'foreign entanglements.'\n\n"Mr. President, I was five when the Senate failed to ratify American entry into the League of Nations. You had just turned 21. Would you say knowing what you know now that the Senate made the correct choice?"\n\nBennett's expression shifted ever so slightly, "No, I would not."\n\n"Would you say America made a mistake in rejecting Wendell Wilkie's interventionism in late 1940?"\n\n"Knowing we know now, yes."\n\n"Mr. President, Washington may have said to avoid foreign entanglements when our Republic was a small nation hugging the Atlantic, but times have changed. Every time in this century, when America has rejected embracing the world we have paid for it. We can't keep making the same mistake. The proposed bill will tie the OFN closer together and further unite the Free World under our banner, we can't afford not to."\n\nBennett sighed. "You're dismissed Muskie, I think Senator Scott and I have much to discuss."\n\nAs Muskie turned to leave, he heard the President offer a few parting words."
WFB.62.a: ""Drop 'League' from the proposal. I don't want any bad omens.""

WFB.63.t: "The International Money Fund Proposal"
WFB.63.desc: "A. Willis Robertson had a proposal to make, and he was very eager that President Bennett should see it through.\n\n"Mr. President, you know how I've always been an advocate of keeping spending down, and as an official of the Banking and Currency Committee I've done my level best to make sure that spending is kept reasonable and doesn't hold our economy hostage. You also know that I've always advocated foreign aid to the rest of the Free World."\n\nBennett nodded. He had to resist the urge to bring up the fact that Robertson, like his colleague Harry F. Byrd, was also known for, well, being a bigot that thought most foreigners - even OFN-aligned foreigners - beneath him.\n\nRobertson continued: "Let's start up an International Money Fund. It'll allow us to formalize the process of foreign aid to the rest of the world and incentivize our allies to pursue good, robust American-style fiscal discipline."\n\nBennett's curiosity was piqued. "There might be something to this, Mr. Robertson.""
WFB.63.a: ""I'll consider it.""

WFB.64.t: "What Could Have Been"
WFB.64.desc: ""Mr. President, so glad you could make it," greeted Marriner Stoddard Eccles, one-time chair of the Federal Reserve and current Utah retiree, as he threw his fishing line into the nearby river.\n\n"The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Eccles. It's always a joy to be back in Utah," Bennett replied, taking a nearby seat, and discreetly adjusting his fishing cap.\n\n"Ah, is the Washington summer finally getting to you? Never took you for one who disliked the heat, Mr. President," Eccles quipped.\n\n"No, no," Bennett chuckled, "it's the OFN. Getting the entire organization to sign off for greater integration is like pulling teeth. Clifford and Muskie are doing all they can, but..."\n\n"But you're having trouble getting everyone to see the bigger picture," Eccles finished, eyes wistfully gazing at the mountains above. "I was around when Thomas Dewey bumbled his way into the Second World War. I was also around for when he managed to irk just about every ally we had." Eccles chuckled, "It was astonishing, like watching a slow-motion trainwreck while you could do nothing about it."\n\n"And when he got re-elected in 1944?" Bennett asked, quietly sipping on a glass of water.\n\n"He was still stuck holding the ball. It's a shame too. I think we could have made something out of the world, currency integration, trade, peace, and prosperity for all."\n\n"And then Sealion happened."\n\n"Indeed it did. Poor Dewey, after Akagi, we spent the rest of his term trying to just keep the economy above water, 48' wiped us out just about everywhere, 52' wasn't much better."\n\n"It was certainly a bad time to be a Republican."\n\n"Bad times it was." Eccles sighed. "What I'm saying, Mr. President is that we had our chance, and we squandered it. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistakes we did. Work with our allies, don't bully them, find common ground, not common grudges.""
WFB.64.a: ""And this we will do, if God permits.""

WFB.65.t: "On Trade"
WFB.65.desc: "It was a cloudy day in Washington, and President Wallace F. Bennett found himself none too impressed with the arguments Henry H. Fowler and Christian Herter were presenting.\n\nFowler stepped forward to make the argument, saying, "Mr. President, if we have the Community of Free Nations include trade negotiations that favor our allies - particularly if we slash tariffs across the board and promote democratic cooperation between Community members - it will create growth across the whole country and make our job of resisting the twin Nazi-Yamato menace all the easier. To us, sir, it's really a no-brainer."\n\nBennett shook his head. "You say that, but what about all the damage this quixotic tariff-slashing plan of yours will do? Don't you realize that a lot of these corporations of ours will start outsourcing to other CFN members in search of cheaper labor? The net effect of your proposition, Mr. Fowler, Mr. Herter, will be damaging American industry and putting the jobs of good, regular American workers at risk!"\n\nHerter sighed. "Mr. President, you don't need to worry. First, our negotiators are more than capable of making sure that provisions that protect American industry are agreed upon by the whole of the Community. Second, even without that, it's better with them than with, say, the Caucasus or Canton."\n\nBennett nodded slowly. His doubts remained, but he suspected that they may be on to something. In the end, he concluded:"
WFB.65.a: ""No, gentlemen, it can't be done. I won't risk it.""
WFB.65.b: ""Alright, gentlemen, I'll give it a chance.""

WFB.66.t: "The Trade Expansion Act"
WFB.66.desc: ""...now, Senator Humphrey, a question hot off the press: what do you think about the newly-introduced, and quite controversial, Trade Expansion Act?"\n\n"Well, Johnny, I have to say I've had my fair share of disputes with President Bennett, but I didn't think it would ever come to something this egregious: soon we're gonna be so different, people will wonder if we're even both politicians!" the Senator said, eliciting laughter from the audience.\n\n"I suppose that means you're not a fan, then." quipped Carson, somewhat sardonically.\n\n"Oh, I am most definitely not a fan, no. It's a thinly-veiled attempt by industrial barons to outsource to the other half of the world jobs occupied by good American workers, under the false pretense of supporting the OFN, and so I'm definitely against it. In fact, it would be more accurate to call it the Jobs Destruction Act!"\n\n"But don't you think it's important to be able to trade with the nations of the Free World?" the host asked.\n\n"Of course it is important, but we can't sacrifice American jobs under the guise of OFN unity; slashing tariffs at home can be a very dangerous move, and the whole act just seems like a very unwise gamble. I've talked with the unions about it, actually, and they'll tell you the same thing as I: the act is just a disaster-in-waiting, and the result of airy-headed economists who think jobs are numbers rather than people."\n\n"Well, that's certainly a fiery answer alright! Let's hope the President heard it, from wherever he is currently. Now, we'll be right back with Senator Humphrey after the commercial break, so stay tuned!""
WFB.66.a: "Against the Act, resentment grows."

WFB.67.t: "The Freer the Markets?"
WFB.67.desc: ""Hello? Mr. President?" Johnson's Texan drawl was distinctive enough, even through a telephone.\n\n"Yes, Lyndon," Bennett answered, "I trust you're the bearer of more bad news?"\n\n"Sorry to say, Mr. President. I've spoken with ah, Mike Mansfield, Carl, and Thruston regarding the trade bill. The uh, the votes just aren't there for us. The AFL-CIO, the UAW, you know Meany and Reuther are already lining up the ad men, and we have too many of our people who don't-"\n\n"Lyndon, I understand," Bennett cut in. "Fowler knew this was going to be a longshot, and so did I. Tell Carl that he can let Wilbur kill the bill. I'll get our people to withdraw it from the Senate."\n\n"Thank you, Mr. President. It's a shame, we couldn't do more for you." Johnson almost sounded sorry, Bennett noted.\n\n"I appreciate that Lyndon, I really do. I'll call you later."\n\n"You too, Mr. President. Goodbye."\n\nBennett heard the line go dead. Damnit, he didn't like the idea of loosening trade barriers any more than those Union men terrified for their jobs did, but he'd let Fowler and Robertson talk him into it. For all the good it had done him.\n\nHe glanced at the newspaper laid out on his desk, A New York Times piece, "Administration Trade Bill At Risk!" Bennett scoffed, loosening his tie. It might not have been his idea, but he'd take the fall for it anyway."
WFB.67.a: "The buck stops here."

WFB.68.t: "Bold Stripes, Bright Stars, Brave Hearts"
WFB.68.desc: ""You know, Frank, I've been feeling a bit weird recently." The theater clerk lit up a cigarette, as the busy day came to a close.\n\n"What do you mean?" answered his colleague.\n\n"Well, I don't know, it's just that... you've seen the movies we're showing, lately? They're all varied shades of patriotism, like standing up against fascism, and all that... It kinda feels like we're just showing propaganda, you know? It pays the bills, yes, but still..."\n\n"My congratulations for realizing it, Harry, very observant of you." Frank sardonically replied.\n\n"To be honest, it's gotten particularly noticeable lately, even more so than before. There's posters on the streets, and the TV's being even more jingoistic than usual. I guess Bennett really wants his 'Community of Nations', huh?"\n\nHarry didn't answer, as silence came back around the dimly-lit theater. He couldn't really answer, actually. Was it all for this that he had applied here? It paid the bills, so he couldn't complain too much, but...\n\n"Hey, son, don't beat yourself up too much." Frank said, interrupting his train of thought. "At least, it's for a good cause. You've seen what the Nazis and the Japanese are up to? Frankly, I'd take the OFN over them any day, and I'm not a jingo, I can tell you that. And besides, it'll pass soon, don't worry. Once Bennett finishes his pet project, then this red, white and blue wave will suddenly die down, mark my words. Now, I've gotta get back in, so I'll catch you later. Just don't worry too much, alright?""
WFB.68.a: "Sometimes, there may be a thing as too much freedom."

WFB.69.t: "An Arsenal of Democracy?"
WFB.69.desc: ""To put it simply, the entirety of the Free World is an anarchic mess, militarily speaking." Military advisors did not make a career out of pessimism, so when this was the summary that was read by the commission before Congress, it created something of a stir. "From its greatest to its least member states, the Organization of Free Nations has absolutely no shared doctrines. Every nation has a full and independently devised set of doctrines and theories that are simply not compatible with one another. Should war ever come to the Free World, it will be every nation for itself for no other reason than simple inertia."\n\nThe implications were clear. A ground-up rethinking and restructuring of the entire military apparatus of the OFN, and not to mention much diplomatic and political wrangling of their allies and neighbors in order to get them to adjust their own military conduct and supply to match up with American supply.\n\n"While we appreciate your concerns, one should note that it is not an unassailable problem. And certainly not one that we need to fix right away." A member of the budget committee was the next to speak, his concerns were pretty clear from the outset. "To get our entire alliance on board with a ground-up complete overhaul of the OFN's operations, we would need to bankroll the effort. Simply put, this is not only an unnecessary expenditure, it's an unfeasible one. No, it is simply best to make this adjustment slowly, over time, so as not to overburden any one nation with the changes- or our treasury with the expense."\n\nThe lines in the sand were drawn, and though arguments between the commission and the committees would go on long into the night, eventually, it all came down to what would be included in next year's budget. Was it time to fund the immediate restructuring of the collective OFN's armed forces in order to standardize military doctrine and equipment? Or does America trust its allies enough to let them adjust to their unified strategy over time, and at their own pace?"
WFB.69.a: "We are the shield of democracy, we cannot afford to be anything less than our strongest, and most united."
WFB.69.b: "The burdens would be too much, we must put our faith in our allies instead of dictating terms to them."

WFB.71.t: "The Start of the Conference"
WFB.71.desc: "It was a sight that would make any journalist giddy; the entire OFN gathered in a single hotel room, in picturesque New Hampshire. Today, they would make history, and Bennett was absolutely certain of that. Today, all members would vote on the reforms that would shape the OFN into something finally concrete, a lasting force for peace, economic stability, and justice in the world.\n\nSitting on Bennett's left-hand side was Robertson, and on his right-hand side, Ford. Muskie sat next to Robertson, and Clifford sat next to Ford. Bennett looked around. Here was the Canadian Prime Minister and his cabinet. The Australian Prime Minister and his cabinet. The New Zealand Prime Minister and his cabinet. The South African Prime Minister and his cabinet. The remnants of the Commonwealth. If this conference succeeded, they would no longer be left economically adrift by London.\n\nThen he cast his gaze to the new members who had joined them, and their leaders and their cabinets. The OFN had welcomed them into the fold wholeheartedly. Most importantly, the new members had tremendous confidence in Washington, and looked up to the United States, true believers of the shining city on a hill. They had fought long and hard battles to get here, and Bennett refused to let himself disappoint them.\nHe sat up straight and stopped his train of thought. Time to get the ball rolling."
WFB.71.a: ""Welcome to the Bretton-Woods Conference, gentlemen...""

WFB.72.t: "First Reform - Military Integration"
WFB.72.desc: "To the average Joe, to most people around the world, the OFN was a military alliance led by the United States meant to oppose its enemies.\n\nThe men sitting in that room in New Hampshire understood that as well, and Bennett thought it was a good idea to start the conference with a familiar subject; the military integration bill.\n\nThe terms were mere logistics. All OFN member nations would share standardized rifles, munitions, tanks, and trucks for joint military operations. Standard practice for military alliances. But as always, free and democratic nations did it better than the fascists. Unlike the Pakt, unlike the Sphere, the bill included a provision to massively increase spending on American military production. The US would foot the bill for all member nations, allowing them to convert to the new logistical standards without breaking the bank.\n\nOf course, the immediate reaction was skepticism. Most of the member nations had built their own military industries, and understandably were hesitant about letting the US dictate the terms for them.\n\nBut one voice stood in instant agreement - the Australians. Almost alone in the Pacific, first line of defense against the hyper-industrialized Japanese titan, they knew more than anyone else how beneficial the logistical arrangement would be for them.\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister was especially enthusiastic, and as he and his cabinet began to push for it, Bennett was pleased to see some heads nodding in assent."
WFB.72.a: "In the end, logistics is the heart of all military matters."

WFB.73.t: "Military Integration - Passed!"
WFB.73.desc: "As the Australians grew more enthusiastic about it, the mood spread. Hesitation gave way to first resignation, then agreement. Putting their own doubts behind them for the sake of mutual trust and cooperation, the member nations signed the bill.\n\nOf course, the Australians were overjoyed, but everyone else was getting excited. Joint exercises would be much easier, defense spending would not be such a hurdle, and their own militaries would be very happy indeed.\n\nAs for Bennett, all he knew was that McNamara would be very pleased."
WFB.73.a: "Good job, whiz kid."

WFB.74.t: "Military Integration - Vetoed!"
WFB.74.desc: "Even as the Australians' enthusiasm shone light throughout the room, darkness continued to loom. The doubt was too much - the worry over one's own logistical concerns, the fear of giving up one's defense industry that one had built, the simple hesitancy of committing to such a scale of operations.\n\nIn the end, the bill was vetoed, with the futile, sputtering protests of the Australians going unheard.\n\nBennett felt sorry for McNamara, who'd been so enthusiastic about it all, only for the bill to die in committee."
WFB.74.a: "Sorry, whiz kid."

WFB.75.t: "Second Reform - International Monetary Fund"
WFB.75.desc: "The second reform in the view of the people was incredibly controversial. From the moment of its announcement and introduction, it had sparked heated debates all across the kitchen table to the halls of academia.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund. Officially, it was an organization to maintain pan-national economic stability, and not just the OFN either. It was a fund for all nations to contribute towards, creating a financial pool of resources that would provide partial economic stability to any country facing a financial crisis.\n\nThe problem was, this aid took place in the form of generous loans with strings attached. To the OFN's enemies, this was just another way of forcing nations to bend to their whims. To the OFN's supporters, they worried that this would pressure poor nations into prioritizing fiscal discipline over actual economic growth. And to certain folks, this was just another way of forcing smaller, poorer nations into adopting America's cutthroat capitalism instead of helping them fight fascism or strengthening their institutions.\n\nBut as leaders, as politicians, they could worry about their electorates later. Bennett repeatedly emphasized that this would benefit the OFN and the Free World as a whole, even if he had his own doubts.\n\nCanada in particular was surprisingly supportive, with the Prime Minister and his cabinet even giving their explicit support. And the room proved more enthusiastic about it than the military integration bill."
WFB.75.a: "If we can understand that it'll benefit our common cause, surely our people can too. Surely."

WFB.76.t: "IMF - Passed!"
WFB.76.desc: "It did take some deliberation, but to Bennett's relief, the bill passed.\n\nWhatever problems and discourse the IMF would cause, they would deal with it at a much later time. For now, the mood was a sort of relieved satisfaction, with every economic minister in the room merrily chatting. Some, like the Canadians, were happy and enthusiastic about the whole deal. Others were more cautious, talking about how to suit the needs and demands about the countries the IMF would help, and trying to prevent overreliance on the loans.\n\nAs for the leaders themselves, they just hoped that it wouldn't cause too much controversy among the electorates, the people.\n\nBennett didn't know how the ordinary Joe would react, but he did know that with the big grin on his face, Robertson was very happy."
WFB.76.a: "We've shown that this organization is necessary."

WFB.77.t: "IMF - Vetoed!"
WFB.77.desc: "While the Americans were all for it, and the Canadians too, the rest of the room proved less receptive.\n\nThey worried about their electorates, how it would reflect badly on them, and might embolden those who were more opposed to OFN membership to secure the votes needed to take it away. Others were understandably hesitant to embrace a policy, frightened that it might reflect badly on them by hurting poor and needy countries more than it aided them. A few suggested that the policy was simply too exploitative even if they could make attempts to change the language.\n\nMost saddened of all were Bennett and Robertson. The latter was slouched in his chair, shoulders slumped, and head bowed. After a while, he morosely turned around and asked an aide to get him strong coffee.\n\nBennett on his part mourned the IMF's demise. He could definitely understand all the reasons why people would oppose it, why the members were so hesitant. But he felt that the OFN was missing out on the chance to bail each other out, help each other out - the way friends should be."
WFB.77.a: "We have to listen to our voters even if we disagree. It's our duty..."

WFB.78.t: "All Must Heed the Call"
WFB.78.desc: "How could the Organisation of Free Nations ever claim to be united as one in the face of fascism and imperialism if they do not even share a consistent and reliable foreign policy? President Bennett had found himself pondering this very question a multitude of times past, and his advisors comforted him with what may just be the most optimum solution; the Forum on OFN Diplomacy.\n\nThe Forum on OFN Diplomacy, as it is called, will be established as a vehicle to organise and deliberate on a combined foreign policy for all the nations of the OFN-no matter their size, the wealth of their lands or the strength of their soldiers. This would allow the OFN to act more efficiently in response to global incidents or to cooperate in the face of a looming threat that seeks to undermine the precious sovereignty of one of its members.\n\nThe bill's arrival at the conference floor has thus far been greeted with a warm embrace rather than cries, with the delegates seeming to, at the very least, sympathise with the ideals of the proposal-even if there are some who baselessly mumble to themselves that the Forum could prove a disastrous and unjust loss of their control over their own diplomatic dealings. President Bennett is rather hopeful of the coming vote himself."
WFB.78.a: "We can only wait."

WFB.79.t: "To New Horizons"
WFB.79.desc: "The passing of the vote on the proposed Forum on OFN diplomacy is marked by the conference hall erupting into cheers.\n\nNo longer will the OFN depend on an incoherent, inconsistent and disunited mess of a foreign policy, nor will it be a concealed arm of American dominance, acting as a way to project their own policy goals on their spherelings. Instead, the Forum on OFN Diplomacy will function as a democratic and pluralist institution that investigates the worries and threats to its member states before deliberating on a unified diplomatic response to the said issues. The Forum will be based on egalitarian principles and will turn into a hand of tyranny that subverts the needs of lesser states in favour of bigger players, quite the opposite, the Forum will be a place where all members of the OFN will dance harmonically together to the symphony of liberty.\n\nTo the relief of many, the Forum has alleviated many worries that were strung up by the advent of the quagmire that was known as the South African War, and will help keep all those who partake in it on the same page towards the matter of foreign intervention and civil conflict.\n\nAll over the Free World, people can finally sleep soundly at night knowing that they have the combined diplomatic might of the OFN on guard duty and ready to protect them at a moment's notice. One can only rejoice at this development."
WFB.79.a: "And President Bennett has done just that."
 
WFB.80.t: "Another Dream Down the Drain"
WFB.80.desc: "President Bennett sat accompanied by Marriner S Eccles, whose brainchild the Forum on OFN Diplomacy was, both visibly distraught and brought down by the disaster that had struck a myriad of hours before.\n\nThe Forum was genius, the masterstroke of decades of OFN diplomatic procedure, yet it all burnt down in that conference's voting hall before it could all begin. One could not even begin to understand how this could have happened; was there a miscounting of votes? Did some of the elements who were dismayed by the proposal somehow manage to defraud it? How could any of our children ever forgive us for this catastrophic mishap? One that could prove to even have apocalyptical consequences?\n\nBennett brushed those conspiratorial and quite obviously ridiculous theories off his brain, yet he still found it incredibly challenging to stop himself from preventing the onslaught of curses that the foolish and bizarre actions of the delegates had struck into him, despite his Christian own dismay at such profanities.\n\nTo the cheers of Germania and Tokyo, and the cries of any freedom-loving citizen of the constituencies of the OFN, the OFN was now disunited and bickering in the face of its imperialist and fascist adversaries. Our hopes of a united front have been strangled in the cradle, and those crushed under Germany's Iron boot and suffocated under the weight of the rising Japanese sun, will look at us with contempt and scorn us for the day we have failed them; the day they awaited the coming liberation we promised so long ago."
WFB.80.a: "One can only hope the next reform will see the light of day."

WFB.81.t: "As Good as Gold?"
WFB.81.desc: "Bennett studied the various economic reports and information about the proposed monetary system for the OFN on his hotel desk. It was an unprecedented proposal that would set fixed exchange rates within the OFN, and to say it was controversial was an understatement. When he introduced the proposal earlier that day to the OFN, it caused an uproar amongst the representatives of each member state.\n\nHe sighed, and picked up the telephone on the desk. "Hello, operator? Could you connect me to Room 110? Thank you."\n\nThe line buzzed for a brief moment until his call was connected to Henry Fowler. "Yes, sir? What is it?"\n\n"This whole monetary system thing... Do you really think it could pass? If our dollar suffers, so does everyone else's, but if it grows then so does the rest of the OFN's economy. It just seems like such a radical and risky gamble for economic growth."\n\nThe line went silent for what felt like an eternity to Wallace, before being broken by some grumblings. "Well, uh, sir. It certainly is risky and a gamble, but I believe it is one that is worth it. If we're going to bring each other closer against the Japs and Germans, then we ought to make it so that if we win, so does everyone else. No man left behind, and I certainly hope the rest of the OFN sees that."\n\nBennett sighed and rubbed his face. It's going to take a hell of a lot of convincing to get the rest of the OFN to see things the way Fowler does. "I hope so too, Henry. I understand their concern about this whole thing, but this potentially means a lot of good things for our economy. Not only as a nation, but as an alliance. I just wish they'd see it that way."\n\n"Then we should give them a piece of our minds later, and get this through. I'll prepare some more reports and analyses regarding this, I'm sure it'll make them see things our way." Fowler confidently quipped. Bennett thought he sounded too arrogant, but he felt convinced with Fowler's promises.\n\n"I'm looking forward to it, Henry." Bennett replied, hanging up the phone. Those reports better change the OFN's mind."
WFB.81.a: "A fixed convincing rate."

WFB.82.t: "What a Bill Might Mean"
WFB.82.desc: "The OFN Monetary System was passed. For the first time in history, America and its partners would have fixed exchange rates. So why wasn't Bennett as pleased as he expected?\n\nCertainly, Bennett had just done a lot of good for the OFN. This bill would essentially eliminate the possibility of some insipid currency war from breaking out among the equal parties of the OFN. For the average American - for the average citizen of the OFN, really, trade would be easier - no more fears about sudden depreciation wiping their investments away. This would bring the OFN one step closer to an efficient, integrated market.\n\nBut... it wasn't perfect. Of all the bills that Bennett had put in front of the OFN's high command, this was the first to give him a moment of pause. America's currency now guided an entire continent. If America used its monetary system to its greatest extent - say if some great crisis required it to lower its interest rates - it could cause a cascading harm to every member of the OFN. Even more so than usual, American money would be static. And if it ever failed to be that static, it could crash this entire system to the ground.\n\nRegardless, it was a good sign for his own authority at least. The rest of the OFN was committing to something of a trust fall, allowing themselves to feel protected in the arms of the Federal Reserve. That meant something was working. Even if this tower might someday fall down, he'd certainly have the time to build it up."
WFB.82.a: "To a brand new future!"

WFB.83.t: "Money Problems"
WFB.83.desc: "Even in the most esteemed office in the nation, there was still a faint buzz from the ceiling fan, something which President Bennett only noticed moments like this. For an hour or so, Bennett had been held up in his office, flipping through the papers his secretary had sent over. It wasn't seething, or stewing. Contemplating, that was the word for it. He was contemplating his next move.\n\nThe jargon was as complex as always, but the news was simple: the OFN Monetary System had failed. In all honesty, it wasn't the greatest surprise. The plan he had imagined necessitated a deep trust in the American monetary system, as well as with the representative currency to which Bennett had defined his career. This plan was a radical step for the OFN, and clearly, his partners did not feel comfortable making it with him.\n\nThere'd be tomorrow, Bennett reminded himself. Another day for another plan. If Bennett had found himself with a lack of trust among his fellow members of the OFN, that could easily change in time, as their internal politics changed or as other reforms proved successful. There would be time to build up the OFN, make certain it was ready and able to accept future reforms.\n\nStill, it never felt fantastic to see a project of yours rejected. But what else was there to do but continue? Tomorrow, he'd be back in his office, draft up something new, and work from there. Today, and only today, Bennett would mourn an idea that never got off the ground."
WFB.83.a: "What could have been..."

WFB.84.t: "On Trade and Tariffs"
WFB.84.desc: "In the Senate, Bennett mused, he had always thought of Tariff Reform as a White Whale whenever it was brought up in the Finance Committee. A magic bullet to American trade woes. Now here he was, having been sold on it, or more accurately, being harangued on it, by his gaggle of advisors.\n\nFowler, Roberston, Muskie, and just about every free-trade advocate in Congress had come into his office, argued, or lectured, with him on the specifics and then left. Nevermind the fact that the Unions, the bald, scowling eminence of George Meany, and Walt Reuther's smug smiling mug were already lining up attack ads and pamphlets. Ready to inform every Union household on just how their Congressman had voted to send their jobs overseas.\n\n"Mr. President?"\n\n"Yes, son?"\n\n"The delegates are ready for you, sir."\n\n"Let them know I'll be right there," Bennett motioned, looking over the draft of his speech once more. He'd be extolling the virtues of free trade, reduced tariffs and silently thanking the lord he'd be retiring once he left the White House."
WFB.84.a: "Should've stayed in the Senate."

WFB.85.t: "Late Night GATT"
WFB.85.desc: "Bennett paced back and forth in his hotel room. The fifth day of the Bretton Woods conference had concluded just earlier and he was exhausted, but he just couldn't sleep. To his surprise, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had passed with the OFN after much political wrangling on his part. Fowler's wild promises had convinced him and the rest of the OFN to go through with it.\n\nHe stopped pacing at the center of his room, and looked around. It was a nice room he thought, his eyes moving to the television that was provided for him. He picked up the remote and sat on his bed, browsing through the various nightly news channels.\n\n"Moving on to other news: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been passed in a surprising turn of events. Here, we have economist John Aznable for comment."\n\n"Thank you Walt, well I certainly think that this is a good m-"\n\n"Worker strikes over the passing of the GATT have already broken out in the Steel Belt, while members of the NP-"\n\n"Hubert Humphrey and other high profile members of the NPP have condemned the Agreem-"\n\nBennett turned off the TV, took off his glasses and sighed. Was it really the best thing to do? Even though he got the rest of the OFN to agree with it, he still felt as if it was a mistake. Maybe Fowler was wrong, his promises too good to be true? But would Fowler have pushed for it in the first place if he wasn't absolutely sure it would be beneficial to the OFN and bring it together even more? Bennett wasn't sure, but he was too tired to think anymore.\n\nHe laid down on his bed and pulled over the blankets. A good night's sleep should make up his mind."
WFB.85.a: "A GATT Night's Sleep"

WFB.86.t: "A GATT deferred"
WFB.86.desc: "Bennett made his way through the empty hotel halls, tired and sleepy from the fifth day of the Bretton Woods conference that had concluded earlier that day. He couldn't sleep, but there was little could do except pay a visit to a certain someone. He stopped, and knocked on the door of a hotel room at the very end of the hall.\n\n"It's open. Come in." A jaded voice replied.\n\nBennett entered the hotel room of Henry Fowler, the sound of news channels being changed and TV static filled the room as he closed the door.\n\n"Keeping up with the news of the Bretton Woods Conference, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been rejected by-"\n\n"Union celebrations in the Steel Belt over the rejection of the GA-"\n\n"In my opinion, President Bennett should have strong-armed the-"\n\n"Why did he let the GATT be rejected?

"You know, this could have been the biggest thing to bring the OFN together as a community of nations. It could have made us even stronger against the Pakt and Japs."\n\nBennett took a seat and looked at Fowler. "Look, we have to face it, Henry. There was no way they would accept it. It was too radical, and even I didn't like it. I don't think the promises you made could have been achieved, it would have just left us all disappointed."\n\nFowler sneered and stood up from his bed. "I don't make empty promises, Wallace. The GATT would have been exactly what I said it would be. Yes it's radical and yes, it would have hurt us in the short term, but it would have brought the OFN closer than it ever could be. We should have bit the bullet now, and enjoy the long-term prosperity it would have brought us."\n\nBennett stood up and walked towards the door, turning around before opening it. "We're supposed to keep a steady and stable ship, not a radical change of course. Who knows what the GATT would have actually brought, but I don't think it would have brought anything good. Now, have a good night and get some rest for tomorrow. That's all."\n\nBennett opened the door and left before Fowler could respond, but he felt as if there was nothing he could say to change the President's mind."
WFB.86.a: "A true what-if."

WFB.87.t: "On Papers and Trade"
WFB.87.desc: "Bennett glanced at the opinion piece. He had the New York Times delivered to Oval Office every week, its editorials and opinions usually critical, and the latest issue was no exception. "Lack of Trade Reform Threatens OFN Unity."\n\nIt was ironic, truly, one of the few issues where he had found common ground with George Meany and Walter Reuther was being used as a cudgel. Men who he'd otherwise have very little in common. Bennett's rejection of the Trade Expansion Act introduced in the house symbolized, depending on who you asked, the Administration's dangerous isolationist leanings, its hidebound conservative tendencies, or proof of its association with corrupt unions.\n\nBennett checked his watch, resisting coffee's temptation before his 6 o'clock meeting, lest further rumour of that leak out to Utah. Oh sure, Robertson and Fowler had tried their damndest to sway to their views. Of increased growth and further prosperity from American goods, and they did nearly convince him, but his principles had trumped his pragmatism.\n\nForeign goods could still come to American shores, of course, but not at the cost to the worker, or farmer, or rancher. Now that had got him the first good press in the Steel Belt he'd had in months.\n\nThe Steel Belt. That reminded him. George Romney was going to be running for something, or other soon enough once tenure as Governor ran out, and Bob couldn't exactly work at the White House. George was a friend, perhaps something could be worked out. Bennett glanced at the editorial again, and threw it in waste paper basket."
WFB.87.a: "Get me the Washington Post next week."

WFB.88.t: "Weathering with the OFN"
WFB.88.desc: "Bennett entered the conference room with his cabinet, the once bustling and cramped room now empty for themselves as most of the OFN representatives had gone home. He took his seat, as did the members of his cabinet.\n\n"Alright. That was an exhausting week but I'm glad we got it done. What do you all think of the things we've achieved?"\n\nDefense Secretary Clark Clifford snapped before the rest of the cabinet could speak. "Well sir, I think we did a fantastic job of getting the OFN closer together than it already is. If we continue on this steady course and not rock the boat too much, so to speak, then I can easily see us being able to further develop our joint military capabilities and the military-industrial complex to counter the Pakt and the Sphere."\n\nThe cabinet chuckled, but Bennett found himself irritated at the boat comment. "That's certainly true, Cliff. This should act as a way for us to be able to develop the alliance further. Is that all?"\n\n"I think it'll also-" Clifford's reply was cut off by Vice President Gerald Ford. "It's all great, sir. This whole thing only benefits us, the OFN and the broader world. While we've got some grumbling from the unions and the progressives, I think we should be able to convince them of its benefits. It's up to us to implement what we've agreed on as a community." Ford remarked, sneering at Clifford.\n\nForeign Secretary Edmund Muskie interjected, gesturing at a map of the OFN and the rest of the world. "Now, if I may, sir, Clifford's right, this'll enable us to further develop our relations with the rest of OFN as we now come closer as a community of nations. It'll also present other nations with a much more appealing bloc to align themselves with, a bulwark against the Germans and Japs."\n\nBennett paused to think. They're all right. While they might not have gotten all of what they wanted from the conference, it certainly brought them closer and promoted cooperation amongst nations. Politics aside, he wondered about the economics of it all.\n\n"So, uh, Robertson. Your thoughts?"\n\n"I agree with them all, sir. This will bring us closer as an alliance. Though I don't personally agree with some of the things we've agreed upon, I think it should be just fine in the end.""
WFB.88.a: "No matter the weather, we stick together."

WFB.89.t: "Join the International Monetary Fund?"
WFB.89.desc: "Following the Bretton-Woods Conference, the Community of Free Nations has decided to form the International Monetary Fund to improve the economies of member nations. While this would improve our credit rating, it could make us subservient to the United States and OFN, along with the bureaucrats of the IMF through debt."
WFB.89a: "We will join"
WFB.89b: "We will not become debtors!"

WFB.100.t: "Division"
WFB.100.desc: ""For all that some speak of America as hopelessly divided, I know that we are stronger than ever. Let other nations wage endless wars of mindless annihilation. We have the industry, the knowledge, and the moral strength to make the world safe for liberty."\n\n"Unity" is the word on President Wallace F. Bennett's lips, as he speaks before a vast crowd. The sky is gray, having let loose an anemic inch's worth of snow over Washington D.C. last night. It looks lovely on the trees, perhaps, but everyone can see the grimy slush on the ground. For all of Bennett's rhetoric, protesters rally for segregation in Birmingham, and for liberation in Little Rock. Against all of this, what can new monetary policy and "sensible" civil rights efforts do? The early 1960s brought disenchantment on unprecedented levels. Bennett might want to turn the page, but the United States of America might not be finished with the story.\n\n"
WFB.100.a: ""I, Wallace Foster Bennett, do solemnly swear...""

WFB.101.t: "Dixiecrats Complain"
WFB.101.desc: "To say that President Bennett's move towards Civil Rights has been unpopular is quite the understatement, and exemplified perfectly in the tantrums of the Dixiecrats. The generally old, white Southern Democrat caucus has existed in some form since before the Civil War, though now most vote NPP. They are notoriously stubborn, and now that particular characteristic is shining through. Several Dixiecrat senators have threatened to filibuster the upcoming bill pushed by the Bennett administration, egged on by Strom Thurmond, NPP senator from South Carolina, generally considered to be the current head of the Southern Caucus. One thing is certain: as long as the Dixiecrats are up in arms, the Civil Rights Bill has no chance."
WFB.101.a: "Another temper tantrum. Typical"

WFB.102.t: "Dixiecrats Cool Off"
WFB.102.desc: "After several weeks of what is ostensibly a temper tantrum from the Dixiecrats, things have finally calmed down enough such that the Civil Rights bill can move forward. Strom Thurmond now claims that the Southern Democrat Caucus will attempt to kill the bill through a vote, not through a filibuster. This comes as welcome news to the largely RDC Congress, who are confident that any attempt that the Anti-Civil Rights movement makes to stop the bill from passing will fail. President Bennett gave a short comment today in a press conference, saying that he was "happy that the democratic process is now being respected.""
WFB.102.a: "Democracy prevails... finally..."

WFB.103.t: "South Disenfranchises Blacks!"
WFB.103.desc: "In the past few weeks, thousands of Southern polling stations have been shown to have intentionally prevented African Americans from voting, in violation of the 15th Amendment. A formal federal inquiry into long standing complaints found literacy tests that were functionally impossible to pass and the widespread use of poll taxes. These tests were disproportionately given to African American voters, and had an astronomical failure rate.\n\nConsequently, an official investigation into Southern voting stations and practices, as well as into what voter verification measures are and are not permitted, is beginning to take shape. President Bennett has called the measures 'diabolical' and 'antithetical to democracy', and the support for anti-Civil Rights politicians has dropped slightly, but notably."
WFB.103.a: "Democracy is non-negotiable."

WFB.104.t: "A Panic Over Votes"
WFB.104.desc: "President Wallace F. Bennett and the Republican-Democratic Coalition are now in a slight panic, having realized that the Dixiecrats and their allies in Congress are a larger group than previously expected. Many Southern congressmen, regardless of prior affiliation, seem to be voting as one with the Dixiecrats on Civil Rights issues. As things stand currently, Bennett's Civil Rights bill would be narrowly defeated in Congress.\n\nConsequently, both the RDC House and Senate whips have been working round the clock to bribe, bully, blackmail, or otherwise coerce the more conservative elements of the party into voting for Bennett's bill. This situation is particularly worrying, as it is becoming more and more apparent that some compromises may need to be made with the Dixiecrats if any Civil Rights legislation is to be passed."
WFB.104.a: "This is gonna be tight."

WFB.105.t: "A Better Tomorrow, Today"
WFB.105.desc: ""Friends, Americans, since the Union's inception, our people have set themselves apart. In our subduing and settling of a continent, in our unbridled invention and industry, and in free-spirited nature. Most of all, we have set ourselves apart in the pursuit of the inalienable rights of mankind: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\n"Today, our beloved homeland stands at an impasse. We must determine whether our forefathers were truthful in saying that 'all men are created equal.' We are one of the most democratic and free nations on this small Earth, and we must choose whether we will extend those liberties to everyone in our society. We are asked whether we will use our wisdom to build a country where progress is the servant of our needs, a society in which the old, restrictive, and oppressive values of the past make way for the unbridled march of liberty."\n\n"So, I ask you, the people of America, to make the right choice. To continue to let our nation be a beacon of freedom and progress. Let the United States be the city upon the hill once more. I ask you, America, to pass the Civil Rights bill. I ask you to build a better tomorrow, today."\n\nThe crowd was silent for a moment, taking in the President's words, before breaking out into a furious applause. From his podium, overseeing the masses, Wallace F. Bennett smiled warmly. The public seemed to be on his side."
WFB.105.a: "Strong words from President Bennett."

WFB.106.t: "In Dixie Land..."
WFB.106.desc: "Today, in what is now being called the Columbia Conference, leaders of both the RDC and the largely-NPP Dixiecrats met in Columbia, South Carolina, to hammer out a Civil Rights bill that both parties find tolerable. Attendees include President Wallace F. Bennett, Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Senator Strom Thurmond. This comes as welcome news to many, as it gives hope that some form of Civil Rights legislation may be passed. To some others, however, this is dreadful news, as they fear that the Dixiecrats will stymie any real change.\n\nPresident Bennett and Strom Thurmond were seen shaking hands in front of the South Carolina State House, surrounded by dozens of politicians, reporters, and security guards. The two men and their respective parties appear to be willing to make a deal, but only time will tell."
WFB.106.a: "...I'll take my stand"

WFB.107.t: "Good Compromise"
WFB.107.desc: "Today, in an announcement that came as a welcome surprise to millions across the nation, Strom Thurmond and President Wallace F. Bennett came to an amicable agreement, with the Dixiecrats making great concessions to the RDC and their Civil Rights bill. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that a good agreement was reached with Senator Thurmond and his voting bloc."\n\nIn the coming weeks, the amended Civil Rights bill is expected to sweep both houses of Congress without much issue. Some of the more hardline Dixiecrats are up in arms over the unexpected amount of concessions that were made, but overall, both parties came out of the Columbia Conference in high spirits."
WFB.107.a: "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

WFB.108.t: "Okay Compromise"
WFB.108.desc: "Today, in an unsurprising turn of events, Strom Thurmond and President Wallace F. Bennett came to a rough and grudging agreement, with the Dixiecrats only willing to make minor concessions to the RDC and their Civil Rights bill. More than half of the Dixiecrats at the Columbia Conference simply walked out, refusing to concede at all. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that an agreement was reached that will allow the bill to go forward."\n\nTo the dismay of many, the new Civil Rights bill is far weaker than before, as the RDC made sacrifices to gain the paltry support of only a few Southerners. In the coming weeks, the greatly amended bill is expected to barely struggle through Congress, with just enough votes to be passed. Overall, the new bill is proving to be a very divisive issue, with both parties coming out of the affair somewhat displeased."
WFB.108.a: "One step forward, two steps back"

WFB.109.t: "Columbia Conference Fails!"
WFB.109.desc: "America is gripped by uncertainty, as news from Columbia spreads across the nation like a shadow; the Columbia Conference has failed. Over the past week, politicians from across the nation debated in the South Carolina State House over compromises on President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Unfortunately, the Dixiecrats could not come to terms with the RDC and the President, and thus, the bill has not been amended and is unlikely to receive the required votes to be passed into law.\n\nPresident Bennett, leaving the Columbia Conference, said that he was disappointed that agreement could not be found, but was confident that the bill would pass regardless.\n\nThe failure of the Columbia Conference has come as a shock to some, and an unfortunate inevitability to others. The future of President Bennett's Civil Rights bill is now in question, and with it, America's future."
WFB.109.a: "What will Bennett do now?"

WFB.110.t: "Dixiecrats Refuse Compromise!"
WFB.110.desc: "After President Bennett's speech in Washington, D.C., in which he publicly requested to meet with Dixiecrat leaders to hammer out a compromise, many expected the Dixiecrats to at least make a show of being cooperative. Unfortunately, it appears their stubborn nature knows no bounds, as Strom Thurmond, with his voting caucus firmly behind him, have unequivocally refused to meet with the President. "No Civil Rights," said Senator Thurmond, "not today, nor tomorrow, nor in a century."\n\nAs the country once again holds its breath over the incredibly divisive upcoming vote on the bill, President Bennett has yet to comment on this unfortunate turn of events. Rather than create a more tense situation by berating the Dixiecrats, the President seems content to hold his breath and seek greener pastures."
WFB.110.a: "Let's hope that he can pull it off without them."

WFB.111.t: "New Allies"
WFB.111.desc: "As the Dixiecrats refused to cooperate, President Bennett has been forced to find another way to pass his Civil Rights bill. Currently, the President and his RDC allies are looking for friends among the leftist and Progressive leaning NPP congressmen. In addition, some of the fence-sitting Democrats in the RDC are likely candidates for recruitment into Bennett's new voting group. Today, President Bennett and Senator Lyndon Johnson are meeting with several members of these groups, most notably the Progressives' [GetRFKOrJackson], attempting to swing them over to the side of Civil Rights. As of right now, however, these alliances are just beginning to take shape, and whether or not they will actually be able to pass the bill remains to be seen. With the day Congress votes on the bill growing closer, one wonders if the President will be able to form these alliances in time."
WFB.111.a: "Who needs the Dixiecrats anyway?"

WFB.112.t: "Alliances to Ashes"
WFB.112.desc: "After meeting with several influential Progressive congressmen, as well as a few Democrats, President Bennett and his pro-Civil Rights Caucus have come up empty handed. While somewhat expected, considering the rushed nature of the alliances in question, it is still another setback for the President. With no potential new proponents of his bill, Bennett is left in an awkward position; he must put forth a bill he knows will fail.\n\nPresident Bennett has yet to comment on these failed compromises and failed alliances, only responding that "We'll get the bill passed, don't you worry about that.""
WFB.112.a: "Will he now?"

WFB.113.t: "New Friends in Old Places"
WFB.113.desc: "Everything is complete: the alliances have been made. After some debate and deliberation, the majority of the Progressives and RDC fence sitters have joined the voting caucus for President Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Assuming everything goes to plan, the bill should be able to sweep both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was no simple matter to convince some left-leaning members of the Progressives to vote for the bill. Influential figures in the party, such as Michael Harrington, found the bill fell short of true social equality, and believed that, were it passed, there would be no more political will for further Civil Rights legislation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many fence-sitting, old-fashioned Democrats feared that the bill was perhaps too ambitious. Balancing these two groups proved to be an immense challenge; the bill would not pass without their support. Despite some setbacks, the President and Senator Lyndon Johnson were able to convince them to throw their lot in with the bill.\n\nNo official announcement regarding the alliance has been made, and likely never will. Word spreads fast of changing loyalties, however, and the lips of politics are the loosest in existence. No doubt Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrat caucus already know of the success of Bennett's gamble, and it no doubt terrifies them."
WFB.113.a: "So much for working with Thurmond..."

WFB.114.t: "The Comprehensive Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.114.desc: "Today, in a surprising announcement, President Bennett's liberal Civil Rights bill has been passed, with possibly the most significant legal protection for non-whites since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. It includes comprehensive protections for voting rights, forbidding state-mandated "literacy tests" targeted at African Americans. It also includes timetables for the total desegregation of American society, demanding that all Jim Crow laws and other race-based legislation be repealed within four months. Most importantly, however, it forbids the discrimination of employment on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nMany are surprised that such an all-encompassing, liberal Civil Rights bill was even passed in the first place. In the weeks leading up to the voting on the bill, there was quite a scramble in the RDC, as President Bennett and his allies struggled to gather the votes. In the end, however, it appears the President was able to get the bill passed, with no compromises on the rights and freedoms of minorities."
WFB.114.a: "Impressive."

WFB.115.t: "The Moderate Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.115.desc: "Today, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill successfully achieved a majority of votes in both the House and the Senate, with the President soon to sign it into law. The bill, while less comprehensive than some might have hoped, is still one of the largest steps towards total equality between Americans since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. The bill includes federal protections for voting rights, prohibiting "literacy tests" and other such fraudulent measures at the state level intended to disenfranchise minorities from voting. It also includes the prohibition of discriminatory employment based on race, color, religion, etc.\n\nMany more liberal-minded citizens are dissatisfied with how the bill has turned out, however. The bill was originally much more liberal and comprehensive, with far greater protection of the rights of minorities. Due to the need to compromise with Conservative politicians in Washington, several of these protections were loosened or simply removed entirely. Despite this, the majority of people across the nation are simply pleased that any Civil Rights legislation was passed at all."
WFB.115.a: "Not quite as good as was hoped for, but still good."

WFB.116.t: "The Conservative Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.116.desc: "After months of deliberation, compromise, and voting, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill has finally been passed by both houses of Congress and is likely to be signed into law in the coming weeks. The once highly liberal Civil Rights Act has now been effectively neutered by the more conservative elements in Washington. All provisions for voting protection against minority disenfranchisement have been removed, and only moderate prohibition of discriminatory employment practices. In addition, greatly encompassing exceptions have been added to the bill, dictating that in certain circumstances, minority protections need not be enforced.\n\nOverall, the bill has drawn a vast amount of criticism from the more liberal-minded politicians in Washington, with many deeming it ineffectual. While conservatives across the country are pleased with the outcome, Bennett's Civil Rights legislation is quickly proving unpopular with the general public."
WFB.116.a: "Disappointing, though not unexpected."

WFB.117.t: "Dixiecrats Pleased"
WFB.117.desc: "After President Bennett's recent passing of an unexpectedly conservative Civil Rights bill, the Dixiecrats are unsurprisingly pleased. In a recent televised statement, Strom Thurmond, Senator from South Carolina and avid Civil Rights opponent, expressed his "gratitude" that "clear heads prevailed in the Capitol."\n\nOverall, however, this is simply a bad look for the President and the RDC. The overt support of the Dixiecrats means the Civil Rights bill appears less genuine to the public, and thus Bennett appears less concerned with the people, and more with getting what he wants.\n\nIn a recent press conference, when questioned over this turn of events and whether or not his administration is becoming more conservative, the President had this to say:\n\n"I am still the man I am when I took office. My opinions are my own and have not changed. The Southern voting caucus being pleased with my actions is not a consequence of changing allegiance on my part. Rather, it is a consequence of certain agreements between us, which, I assure you, have always existed.""
WFB.117.a: "People are upset because others are happy. Outstanding."

WFB.118.t: "Liberals Wary"
WFB.118.desc: "In recent weeks, following President Wallace F. Bennett's passing of a surprisingly conservative Civil Rights bill, the liberals in Congress, represented by the Democrats and some of the Progressives, have found themselves in an uncomfortable spot. Many voters back in their home states, who elected them for liberal policies, are quite dissatisfied with their acceptance and support of such a conservative piece of legislation. Consequently, should even more conservative action be taken in the future, the liberals face a serious threat of losing re-election.\n\nUnderstandably, many liberal congressmen are afraid that they may be replaced. In response, they have begun to rally and take a larger role in legislating. In addition, they are quite upset with President Bennett for threatening the fabric of the RDC as a whole. Should they be faced with voting for another conservative bill, it is unlikely that they will follow the President's lead, instead doing everything in their power to halt its passing."
WFB.118.a: "Not good."

WFB.119.t: "Voting Investigations Come Up Empty-Handed"
WFB.119.desc: "Federal investigations into alleged discriminatory voting practices in the Deep South have come up empty-handed, in contrast to several independent claims that 'literacy tests' and 'poll taxes' prevent minorities from voting. Investigations by the FBI and other agencies have determined that these claims are false and that no violations of the 15th Amendment have occurred.\n\nAlready, these investigations have drawn massive criticism from liberal and progressive elements across the country. The groups claim that these inquiries are fraudulent, corrupt, or insufficient. As far as the federal government is concerned, however, these claims are unsubstantiated, and no legislation prohibiting state-level voting regulations is likely to be passed."
WFB.119.a: "Could the investigators be wrong?"

WFB.120.t: "Progressives Upset"
WFB.120.desc: "After federal investigations into voting disenfranchisement in the Deep South recently came up empty-handed, progressive elements across the nation have raised an uproar, calling the investigations fraudulent, corrupt, and biased. Already, mere weeks after the conclusion of the inquiries, groups in the Marxist and Progressive caucuses are demanding that new investigators and investigations be brought in.\n\nMichael Harrington, a political leader of the Progressives, has called the Southern voting process "despicable, discriminatory, and undemocratic," and demanded new federal inquiries. President Bennett, along with a large chunk of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, are dismissing all claims of corruption or another manner of manipulation, and no plans for new investigations are being made."
WFB.120.a: "Calm down, Mike."

WFB.121.t: "Dear America"
WFB.121.desc: ""My dear America, of all our nation's distinguishing characteristics, perhaps none are so powerful as our brotherhood. Our ability to accept the faults in our fellow man, and acknowledge our unity as a single people. However, following recent investigations into the practices of our Southern brothers, no fault has been found. Despite this, many still believe our Southern brothers to be liars; that they are corrupt and dishonest to our government."\n\n"These accusations tear at the fabric of our nation. They tear away at the core of our national fraternity and weaken us as a whole. If our great land is to follow her trend of unending progress, I say that these false allegations must first be overcome. We must trust in our brothers, as we trust our closest kin, in the absence of clear evidence."\n\nPresident Wallace F. Bennett looks up from his notes to the camera. "My dear America, I ask you: trust in your brothers, as I trust in you.""
WFB.121.a: "Keep calm and compromise."

WFB.122.t: "Progressives Relent!"
WFB.122.desc: "In the past few weeks, following President Bennett's National Brotherhood speech, the left of the National Progressive Pact and other progressives in Congress took a more positive stance on the conservative civil rights bill. Today, Senator [GetRFKOrJackson] met with Bennett at the White House, planning to come to terms with the rightist shift in national policy. This lukewarm approval was also communicated by Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, leader of the Democrats, who said that his party will continue to work with the Republicans in their coalition. Overall, this has had a positive effect on the prospective bill, and things are looking up for Bennett and the RDC in their pursuit of Civil Rights.\n\nThis turn of events was rather unexpected by many third-party observers, as the President's speech, while well worded, did nothing to alleviate the complaints and fears of the Progressives in Congress regarding the Civil Rights bill. This may hint that Kennedy and his voting bloc are less united than previously understood. In any case, they are now behind the bill, if only just. Now, all that is left is the vote: one to decide the future of America."
WFB.122.a: "Excellent."

WFB.123.t: "Progressives Refuse to Relent!"
WFB.123.desc: "Following President Wallace F. Bennett's National Brotherhood speech, many expected congressional progressives to fold and get behind the President's conservative Civil Rights bill. However, the left has refused to relent on civil rights, denying the Republicans and the rightist faction of the National Progressive Pact the votes needed to pass the bill. The President continues to call for the progressives to 'restore national brotherhood' and 'follow a path that is acceptable to all Americans.'\n\nSenator [GetRFKOrJackson], leader of the NPP's social democrats, says that his camp is standing firm. Almost all the Progressives have turned down Bennett's call for 'unity'. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, arguably the most influential Democrat in congress, followed Kennedy's lead, stating that the bill was an "afront to foundations of the Republican-Democratic Coalition". Rallying behind Kennedy and Johnson, many progressives believe that the bill will simply dampen support for Civil Rights legislation among the general public, while doing the bare minimum in actually achieving racial equality. Without their help, the RDC will likely be forced to return to the drawing board to create legislation that the progressives find more amicable."
WFB.123.a: "Damn you, Kennedy!"

WFB.124.t: "Our Way or the Highway"
WFB.124.desc: "Since [GetRFKOrJackson] and his Progressive Caucus decided not to support President Bennett's conservative Civil Rights bill, the RDC has been in a frenzy to gather the required votes to pass it. The party's Senate and House whips have been working around the clock to bully, bribe, or otherwise coerce fence-sitters into throwing in their hat with Bennett's Civil Rights bill. As of this moment, the votes are close, and it appears that when voting day comes, a select few congressmen will decide the bill's future.\n\nShould the RDC fail to gather sufficient support, it is likely that they will be forced to cancel the vote and re-draft the bill to be more left-leaning. If this occurs, it is possible that they will be caught in a catch-22; if they change the bill to be more liberal, they will lose conservatives, but if they don't, they'll lose the progressives."
WFB.124.a: "Who needs the NPP, anyway?"

WFB.125.t: "We Don't Have the Votes"
WFB.125.desc: "With mere days left before the House begins voting on President Bennett's Civil Rights bill, the RDC has called the vote off. This news comes less than a week after Senator [GetRFKOrJackson], Progressive leader and opponent to the bill, met with the President in Washington. While no transcript of the meeting has been released, it is more than likely that its purpose was to discuss possible progressive support for the Civil Rights bill.\n\nAlready suspecting that their compromises with the RDC will be violated in favor of the progressives, the conservatives advocating the bill are beginning to withdraw their support. It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before. Only time will tell if this new draft will succeed."
WFB.125.a: "Back to the drawing board"

WFB.126.t: "The Dixiecrats Complain... Again"
WFB.126.desc: "In their most recent temper tantrum, the Dixiecrats are now complaining that President Bennett's surprisingly-liberal Civil Rights bill infringes upon 'states' rights.' In particular, they complain about one of the bill's central clauses: that states cannot administer tests to determine voter eligibility. This clause was specifically targeted at Southern States who administered 'literacy' tests that were nigh-impossible to pass for African-Americans, voiding their right to vote.\n\nObviously, these state-sponsored tests were in violation of the 15th Amendment, and thus illegal under federal law. Despite this, the Dixiecrats under Strom Thurmond believe that the tests were fair, simple, and non-discriminatory. The tests are now illegal, but the Dixiecrats will whine and complain until history passes them by."
WFB.126.a: "Disgraceful."

WFB.127.t: "Civil Rights in Charlotte"
WFB.127.desc: "Despite the ongoing tension occurring just past the curtains President Bennett sat behind, the President could still pick up on the whispered voices of the thousands which had gathered to enjoy the speech. Tonight's dinner was watched by all sides, as North Carolina had become a staging ground for a variety of movements, both radical and reactionary.\n\n"And now, we welcome President Wallace F. Bennett!" Charlotte's mayor boomed into the microphone, as a round of applause thundered out. Adjusting the microphone, Bennett spoke. "Good evening to those attending tonight's event, as well as any who may be watching from across our country. Tonight, I stand alongside my fellow Republicans to turn yet another page in the whirling twists and turns of the history of the United States. For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder."\n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall. Was the President about to defend the segregationists, or punch them in the gut? "Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society. While my fellow Republicans and I adhere to tradition and conservatism, this is by no means justification, or approval of, the prejudices faced by African-American citizens today. It is shameful that some continue to stand against the average American based on the color of their skin. The administration will work to end these wrongs, once and for all.""
WFB.127.a: "It had to be said."

WFB.128.t: "Old Allies"
WFB.128.desc: ""Senator Barnett, this isn't supposed to be some insult towards you or the party, I understand that the South has always had their quarrels with the Civil Rights Act, and I'm not looking to stretch too far with it, but the fact of the matter is-"\n\n"Now you listen to me, President Bennett. I understand that you've come to hold yourself in a high regard ever since you ascended to the Presidency; however, the facts remain. Now, President Bennett, I happen to consider myself what you'd like to call a 'Southern gentleman,' and it is in that regard that I am, quite frankly, disgusted that you have left our traditions and wills out of the enforcement of the law in this here country. How on Earth would you want me to work with you when you're spitting on all of our customs, Mr. President?"\n\n"Well, you see, Senator Barnett, my administration is working towards a solution that will best fit the needs of all those in the country, and settle this issue for once and for all. If you would like to, we can discuss-"\n\n"No, Mr. President. Frankly, I am sick and tired of discussion. Discussion, discussion, discussion. If you are going to sit here and completely gut the foundations of the South, who we are, and what we believe, then I shall do more than discuss. Good day, Mr. President, and my fellow Southern compatriots shall be hearing of this, Mr. Wallace F. Bennett." And with the "discussion" ended, Senator Barnett slammed the Oval Office door.\n\n"Didn't go as planned, did it, sir?" Ford said, as his arms laid cross against his chest, while looking down.\n\n"You'd be correct, Gerald. But mark me, Gerald, for it doesn't matter." President Bennett said, as Gerald looked up in surprise. "Best estimates figure, we already got the Senate." And, with President Bennett's final statement, the two shared an equal stare, grin, and moved in for a handshake and a laugh."

WFB.301.desc: "After months of deliberation and discussion regarding economic diplomacy and financial connections to other members of the OFN, President Bennett now watches the waves of the English Bay in Vancouver, preparing to face the diplomats awaiting his introduction. Anxieties over the Canadian government's lack of enthusiasm in the OFN have finally been sated with the honor of holding the conference, and now, Bennett's dream of the OFN's economic ascendancy will finally unfold. President Bennett escaped the cold Canadian winds as he stepped inside, as the attendants of the event all rose and applauded the President upon entry.\n\n"Good morning, my fellow representatives. It is with great honor to announce the beginning of the first Financial and Monetary Conference for the OFN. Please, everyone, take a seat." The diplomats lowered themselves into their seats, as the President continued his address. "Opposite the Atlantic, the Third Reich continues to terrorize the peoples of Europe, dominating them both politically and economically, with few rivals. Across the Pacific, the Japanese Empire exploits their Asian subjects, their so-called triumph of coercion going against the foundations of free trade. As the last true proponents of free peoples and markets, it is our duty to stand united against those who seek to undo the freedoms of our people, and to combat Fascist governments' encroachment on the world economy. The Financial and Monetary Conference shall safeguard proper economic ties with the proud members of the OFN, for a free and prosperous world.""
WFB.301.a: "To Liberty, to Justice, to Prosperity."

WFB.302.t: "An Invitation"
WFB.302.desc: "Over the past few months, President Bennett of the United States of America has worked tirelessly to forward his plans of economic unity within the OFN through the Financial and Monetary Conference. Hundreds of diplomats, economic advisors, and analysts have worked tirelessly on policy to allow the promotion and protection of OFN members' economies. Of course, monetary resources have been poured into the project to secure the most reliable and efficient system to aid our alliance members' financial status, with President Bennett declaring that the conference will "secure the world economy against the iron grip of Fascism."\n\nBennett has promised the agreement will promote economic prosperity among the OFN's members, allocating resources among one another rather than reaching out to the more nefarious members of the international market. Whispers of the creation of a World Bank circulate widely among those present, in order safeguard each other from financial failures to ensure that exploitation by rival powers does not occur. With such a system in place, the OFN would create a new means to prospering economically.\n\nHowever, the scope of the agreement has led to some apprehension. National resources would be diverted in order to comply with the terms of the agreement, a pooling of funds to cover the mistakes of other OFN members. Refusing the agreement would not doom us to be exiled from the OFN; rather, it would just mean a restriction on some of Bennett's more extensive plans for the organization."
WFB.302.a: "We stand with Bennett!"

WFB.151.t: "A Difficult Conversation"
WFB.151.desc: ""Mr. President, I know you've seen the polls. You know the public supports this bill. You know the caucus supports the bill. You know Senator Humphrey here, and his caucus supports this bill. Why won't you support this bill?"\n\n"Senator Johnson, I cannot in good conscience, support a civil rights bill of such extent," if looks could kill, the glare from Senator Humphrey would've long had him slain. Bennett paid it no mind. "The plight of the negro is a matter of gravest concern, but we cannot go trampling over the rights of state and local governments."\n\nJohnson maintained his pleasant demeanor. "Mr. President, we can't afford to gut this bill. We've tried talking it through with Thurmond and Russell, and they won't budge an inch."\n\n"Even they did Mr. President," added Senator Humphrey, "what good would another weak bill do? Every single Congress, since Kennedy lost the war, has tried to pass a civil rights bill. The South has killed or neutered every damn one, and the conditions down there have barely improved."\n\n"Gentleman, please," Bennett urged. "I know this is an issue on which you, Senator Humphrey, and many others feel strongly. But tempers need to cool. We won't get anything done by moving out of step with the country."\n\nHumphrey sighed, "Mr. President, we're not the people who are out of step with the country. It's you and everyone who's preventing us from pushing this country forward, and we can't afford to play this game anymore."\n\n"Mr. President," Johnson began. "The Senate will vote on this bill, and Albert will pass it in the House. I think it's important that you remember your principles, Mr. President, but this bill will pass Congress, and I can't tell you how bad it will look when an RDC President tries to veto a civil rights bill passed by his own party."\n\nJohnson and Humphrey stood up, making for the door, "I hope you make the right choice Mr. President.""
WFB.151.a: ""As do I""

WFB.152.t: "Subcommittees"
WFB.152.desc: "Now that the Civil Rights bill has been passed, and the people are content, it's time to wake up and face the reality of the situation: America is not ready for Civil Rights. President Bennett, as much as it pains him, believes that if total desegregation were to occur immediately, it would be an utter disaster. To alleviate this issue while still achieving some civil rights for all, the President has devised a plan: to mire the application of the bill in bureaucracy.\n\nA series of committees and subcommittees will be created nationwide to determine how exactly to apply the new legislation in their assigned communities. Their decision will then be reviewed by a higher authority, and then accepted and implemented.\n\nJust today, the first step towards building these committees and bureaucratic systems was taken, with the swearing-in of the first members of the Federal Committee for Civil Rights Implementation. Headed by a bipartisan group of politicians, it will function as the main oversight board for Civil Rights across the nation. President Bennett has called it "a momentous occasion in the history of our country: the first step towards racial equality.""

WFB.153.t: "President Bennett Sides With Liberals!"
WFB.153.desc: "In his most recent State of the Union address, President Bennett has announced support for the liberal wing of the RDC on the now all-encompassing issue of segregation. Pro-civil rights groups have already come out in celebration, emboldened by the President's support in their efforts to advocate 'freedom for all Americans' while more conservative sects have been quick to denounce these 'tyrannical measures.'\n\nSince its creation in the mid-1800s, the Republican Party has argued for the rights of African-Americans, and the support of the level-headed and pragmatic Bennett has only encouraged them to pursue this agenda. Firmly believing that the time has come for equality before the law in the United States, Republican politicians have now proposed various laws that would extend political and social equality to all Americans. The proposed Voting Rights Act, which would grant universal suffrage to citizens regardless of race, is the first of many measures to achieve these goals. The passage of these acts will be hotly contested but hopefully assured.\n\nThe effects of this decision on the two-party coalition have yet to be seen, but projections do not look good. Many Southern Dixiecrats feel betrayed by this sudden change of course, and, in the confusion, may be swayed to factions that better represent their constituents. The social upheaval of these measures will also surely have long-lasting effects on the nation."
WFB.153.a: "A promising step forward."

WFB.154.t: "President Bennett Sides With Conservatives!"
WFB.154.desc: "In a move that has surprised many, President Bennett has sided with the conservatives in the RDC on the issue of Civil Rights, tipping the uneasy balance between Republican and Democratic parts of Congress and, much to the dismay of pro-civil rights groups, pushing the nation in a firmly pro-segregation direction. The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Republicans and Southern Democrats have taken a mostly conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination. Their newfound dominance in Congress will favor the status quo in segregationist states, leaving voting rights and other hotly contested topics to their discretion. How this will affect any previous civil rights legislation is uncertain.\n\nThe uneasy alliance between the liberal and conservative wings of the coalition is now in doubt, as many Democrats and liberal Republicans have been quick to denounce the party establishment. In the wake of these divisions, the NPP may find support from these politicians as well. Regardless, it seems the segregationist institutions of the South have gotten a new lease on life."
WFB.154.a: "The status quo continues."

WFB.155.t: "Second Among Equals"
WFB.155.desc: "Ever since President Bennett passed his landmark Civil Rights bill, an air of unease has existed in the Republican-Democratic Coalition. The bill was unexpectedly liberal, being penned mainly by Democrats and few Republicans. Consequently, almost 30% of the traditionally conservative Democrats voted against the bill.\n\nWhen the bill was finally passed, however, it proved extremely popular with the non-Southern general public. In the months since then, the Republicans have been rapidly waning in power. The RDC has always been mainly Democrats, but the two groups were generally seen as equals. Now, after months of declining support, the Republicans are the shadow party: they are the second among equals. From this point onward, they, and their viewpoints, are on the way out.\n\nNo official statement has been made regarding this political shift, but its effects are already evident; more than 5 Republican congressmen have announced they are switching to the NPP. In the coming months, it is likely that more will follow, and with them, the Republican Party."
WFB.155.a: "The Shadow Party loses its faith."

WFB.156.t: "Stronger No Longer"
WFB.156.desc: "Since the passing of President Bennett's landmark Civil Rights bill, the Republican-Democratic Coalition has been flipped on its head. The bill, to the dismay of many liberals in the RDC, was very conservative and lacked strong clauses regarding enforcement. Consequently, almost 30% of the traditionally liberal Democrats voted against the bill.\n\nThe general public, however, appears to have sided with the Republicans, as the bill was praised by all but the most fanatic of activists. Over the months since the bill's passing, the Democrats have been waning in power, and lack strong direction. The group is splintering over issues of whether or not to pursue further Civil Rights legislation and whether to continue working with the Republicans. Meanwhile, the Republicans, traditionally playing second-fiddle to the Democrats, have taken charge. They now effectively control the RDC as a whole.\n\nWhile the political shift isn't really official, its effects are already evident; more than 5 Democratic congressmen have switched over to the Progressives, tired of their coalition's lethargy and Republican control. In the coming months, it is likely that more will follow, and with them, the liberal side of the RDC."

WFB.157.t: "President Bennett Addresses the Nation"
WFB.157.desc: "During his most recent address to the United States as a whole, the President has taken up the challenge of addressing both a divided party and a thoroughly divided nation. Clearly visibly distressed by the rampant partisanship within the RDC, Bennett nonetheless maintained an air of determination and sincerity throughout his speech.\n\nThe subject of his address, and the topic on the minds of many voters and politicians, was the raging debate over Civil Rights policy. In a heartfelt plea to members of both wings of the party, Bennett called for 'unity, not division' as they navigate the issue to find an agreeable solution. Also included in his speech was a warning to avoid 'political extremes,' stressing that the best solutions come from discussion, not partisan division. While withholding outright endorsement for either course of action, he has also suggested the possibility for compromise, but the form that would take was left unspecified. "Either way," he said, "we must stay true to our American values, not those of extremists.""

Despite the difficult winter, his administration had managed to put together quite the substantial list of successes, but he couldn't hide a shiver as the door opened.\n\nIn came Willis Robertson, armed with an intimidating set of reports and an armory of pens glittering from his breast pocket. "Well, Secretary Robertson, come in. How's the day been?" Bennett opened.\n\n"You know how it's been: wet, cold, windy, and some hellishly angry governors from the Rust Belt barking about federal funding." Robertson replied, before taking a seat across from the President.\n\n"Well with regards to the federal grants for Wisconsin, I believe that -" Bennett began, before a heaving set of wet coughs derailed the conversation.\n\nRobertson looked nervously at President Bennett as he rocked in his chair, the President's face darkening as the violent coughing spell continued. After what seemed like an eternity, President Bennett managed to regain his composure, even as the world spun gently. His mind raced; he had never dealt with such a coughing fit before. Robertson, for his part, looked worryingly at the President, having received no answer to his question."

WFB.Chains.24.desc: "President Bennett, rather than committing himself to his usual diligence, decided to take a rare break to instead look out the windows, in a rare moment of appreciation - if only his sight could undo the chill he felt. It felt abnormally cold, colder than any winter had he known. Ever since the coughing fit he experienced during that meeting with Secretary Robertson, Bennett had anxiously wrestled with the question of his age and health, no small matter for the leader of the Free World.\n\nPresident Bennett walked down the halls, figuring that talking to his loyal staff might clear his mind. But he could not escape the fact, were he to expire in office, his staff needed to know what to do. America was a constantly changing and shifting country, and strong leadership would be needed to keep it grounded in safety, security, and just sanity.\n\nAfter a long walk which had, frankly, failed to clear the President's mind, the sight of Frances Bennett, First Lady of the United States, was a welcome sight. "Well, it's a rare sight to see you out of the office! How are you doing?" Frances Bennett said, offering her husband a kiss.\n\n"Well, I wanted to - well, I -" the President said, before a thunderous set of coughs wracked his pale frame, leaving him in his wife's embrace as she called for the staff, with Vice President Ford rushing from his office to support the faltering President."

Despite his pious devotion, President Bennett found his mind wandering from the prayer, with persistent worries regarding the outside world. And here he was, lying in bed as sick as a dog, praying to God to grant him strength.\n\nVice President Gerald Ford walked in, after attending Bennett's morning meetings. "It's good to hear that you're going to be alright, Mr. President," he said respectfully.\n\nBennett raised his head as best as he could to hear what his Vice President had to say about the world beyond the White House. "So, what's it like out there?"\n\n"Well, it's not the prettiest sight. And about your condition, some of the staff gave out too much information before we could stop them. None of them delved into the specifics of the pneumonia, but..." Ford laid the morning's paper on Bennett's chest.\n\nThe President fumblingly gripped the newspaper Ford had brought in, looking at the headline: "PRESIDENT BENNETT BEDRIDDEN!"\n\nIt was crushing, humiliating. Bennett had sacrificed much for the betterment of the country, and now some nasty pneumonia was trying to do him in."

WFB.Chains.26.t: "And on that day, He rested"
WFB.Chains.26.desc: "To imagine, amidst the growing chaos demanding his attention, President Wallace F. Bennett was forced to retire to Camp David, far removed from the White House. It was a bitter pill that he, the American public, and the federal government all had to swallow together, along with the several other dosages of medicine that Bennett had to periodically take. All that mattered now was recovering - a weekend with the Bennetts.\n\nEvery morning, the family prayed before breakfast; every afternoon, the family prayed before lunch. And every evening, the family prayed before dinner. It was the only respite between the paperwork and phone calls that the President still handled, despite explicit orders to rest.\n\n"Yes, Ford, exactly, we need to stick Muskie and Robertson together to deal with the Australian work." The President exploded into a fit of wheezing, clutching himself, as he listened to the questions of the Vice President. "The South? Robertson ought to have everything together for that, I've told him to -"\n\nPresident Bennett halted once more, as Frances came over, pleading with her husband to get off the phone. "Wallace, listen to yourself. You're getting better but you still sound awful. You need rest."\n\nBennett took a few minutes to process everything, to think of everything going on between him, his family, and his country."

Nevertheless, his wife decided to let the President have his television; after all, it wasn't like everything could come crashing down over a short few weeks of vacation, right?\n\nThe family surrounded the President's bedside, working on a puzzle together, when the jingle of a breaking news segment came over the television: Vice President Ford's 'speech regarding Civil Rights during these trying times.'\n\n"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us all at this moment of difficulty for us all. First and foremost, the Bennett administration wants to make one thing clear: we have not abandoned you. We know that many of you have worries and woes that must be addressed. In particular, the African-Americans of this country have known ongoing difficulty for decades. President Bennett and myself have heard you, and we intend to make it well-known that we seek to do everything we can for you, and that we stand with you."\n\nDespite the applause coming from the television, the President recognized the danger of Ford's promises. He knew he had a wide range of backers from the Far-Right NPP, and that all had relied on Bennett. But now, political support could be at risk the single moment that Ford decided to speak on television."

Whereas some might see a vacation as a gift, for Bennett, sitting on the phone with Vice President Ford after the speech that gutted the administration's support from the Nationalists, it was turning into a disaster.\n\n"Secretary Robertson did what?" asked the President.\n\nHesitant to respond to his sickly superior, Ford finally let out the truth. "Robertson figured he understood the situation with the budget and found the best solution with the expenses of the South: a flat cut for agricultural development and pre-established agricultural production zones."\n\nBennett was stunned. A complete slash, across the board, of funding for the self-owned farmers in the South, some of the most loyal Democrats in the nation? Some of whom were already considering backing away from the Democrats after seeing what Ford had to say on national television?\n\n"Ford, why was this allowed to go through? Robertson could completely ruin our support from Southern congressmen, and worse still if the economy slows down and unrest gets out of control! Cut Robertson's program, for God's sakes!" Bennett slammed down the phone, praying that this nightmare would be over soon."

Nevertheless, between the coughing, the breathlessness, and the fatigue, pneumonia was a special kind of hell for Bennett.\n\nVice President Ford entered unannounced, startling Bennett. "Wallace, I was knocking at the door for a minute or two there, you didn't hear me?" Bennett blinked, confused, before nodding once apologetically and motioning for Ford to continue.\n\n"The Australian diplomats are coming to iron out some of the details within the OFN's military arrangements..." Ford trailed off upon seeing the President's attention wavering. "Wallace?"\n\n"Yes, um, the Australians. Can we postpone the meeting and arrange dinner with them next week? That'll make them happy." Bennett responded.\n\nFord eyes' narrowed. "The Australians have been asking for a meeting for months-"\n\n"Just do it! I already have enough on my plate!"

No one could precisely pin down what the President was going to say, or how he was going to address the uncertainty of the future; but all agreed that President Bennett did not look healthy in the slightest.\n\n"Good morning," Bennett said, before briefly pulling away from the microphone to avoid his coughing spurts echoing nationwide. "I am a God-fearing man, I was raised under his gospel, and now, I administer as President in service to him. I must say we are in a - a chaotic state of this country's history."\n\nBennett coughed messily once more before proceeding. "It is the duty of the President of the United States that the laws be - be - faithfully executed. In this, it is my duty to exercise my powers into legislating a Civil Rights Act. However, I intend to - make sure that we Americans remember our traditions and culture-"\n\nThe audience, both on the lawn and in their living rooms, whisper as 'this damned Pneumonia' is caught by the microphone, before Bennett made a quick close to his speech.

Meeting agendas, intelligence briefings, dossiers on visiting dignitaries, economic statistics; no matter how much Bennett polished off each day, the stack was always replenished the following morning, demanding the President's attention.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Bennett found the last folder from the previous day, pulling out the previous day's stack of files. As he did so, an old folder dropped out from the bottom, kicking up a puff of dust as it landed: the proposals for a Civil Rights Bill, still unfinished after all these months.\n\nBennett put the mountain of files aside, flipping through the yellowing pages. It had all seemed too ambitious; better to reach for the low hanging fruit, to build a track record of stability. But with the chaos of the Nixon years fading, old wounds were being reopened: activists in the North planned new demonstrations, while Jim Crow surged back to life in the South. And in Washington, the old partisan divides were reasserting themselves: the Republicans were starting to make tentative overtures to the Progressives, and the Southern Democrats grew more confident by the day."

WFB.310.t: "Easy Pickings"
WFB.310.desc: "While there was no shortage of issues for the Bennett Administration to tackle - Civil Rights, stabilizing the RDC, the Japanese and the NPP's braying for war - everyone in Washington was sick and tired of the post-war economic malaise.\n\nWith over a decade of analysis by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, the problem was well understood by both the RDC and the NPP - the depletion of America's silver reserves was pushing America inexorably towards a currency crisis, even as economic recovery in America and the OFN depended on an ever-increasing supply of dollars.\n\nTreasury Secretary A. Willis Robertson walked President Bennett through their best option. "It all comes down to the Silver Act, Mr. President. It's a stopgap measure, asking the Treasury to prohibit further sales of silver and to repeal silver-related legislation, stabilizing silver outflows until we can introduce a new commodity to back the dollar."\n\nPresident Bennett nodded approvingly. "Nobody wants to take the responsibility for hurting the economy."\n\n"We might even be able to get part of the NPP on board on this," Robertson added. "We just need to find the right person to approach, in either the Nationalists or Progressives."\n\nBennett leaned back, considering his options."

Bennett smiled, putting on a show of warmth. "Put our differences aside for a second. Anything that leaves the American citizen better off tomorrow than they are today is something we all should be on board with."\n\nSenator Barron restrained himself from rolling his eyes or otherwise showing his open impatience with the President. "I've told you again and again, Mr. President. After the mess Nixon made of civil rights, it's all the NPP base can talk about."\n\nPresident Bennett's brow furrowed. "This isn't about party or creed, it's about what's in every American's pocketbook. That's not an impossible message to put out, is it?"\n\n"I'm sorry, Mr. President. I don't think our base is interested in helping you on this." Senator Barron stood up to leave. "I really must be going.""

Oh, it'd been a near-run thing; the NPP were hardly inclined to work closely with the RDC at the best of times, and the Far-Right in particular were always smelling blood in the water, ever since Nixon had split the country over civil rights.\n\n"How'd you get them to agree to support us?" Treasury Secretary Robertson asked the obvious question. "They'll be coming back to ask for favors later -"\n\n"Oh, there were no favors, just a healthy dose of reality!"

So I'm proposing we fix that." President Bennett laid out his argument matter-of-factly for Senator Henry 'Scoop' Jackson of Washington, a leading light of the Center faction of the NPP.\n\n"And what about the inflationary impact of all this?" Jackson countered. "You know as well as I do that we're not going to sign onto anything that's going to pad people's wallets, only to burn it away with inflation in a year."\n\n"Of course, but we're only proposing to prevent the further depletion of the money supply. And any introduction of an expanded monetary base will be gradual, so the populace has plenty of time to adjust." Bennett had his answer ready. If this was the best argument the Center had, this would be an easy conversation.\n\n"I'm trying to bring you on board so that we can all go home to our districts and say we've done something for the average American, Scoop." Bennett leaned in for the kill. "And if you'll do this for me, I know that we can review a few of your state's and Boeing's proposals for defense procurements...""

This bill is all about putting more on the table for the average American - I thought the Center would be all over this kind of legislation." President Bennett exclaimed. "I know you, Scoop. You'd support me on this on any other day, so why're you backing out now?"\n\nSenator Jackson winced. "Mr. President, I would. But we've all got to stand for something. I wouldn't have left the RDC otherwise, and right now, the NPP is still hopping mad about Nixon and his moves on civil rights. I can't give you cover for this, I'm sorry."\n\n"What, with the next elections around the corner?" Bennett stated. "What a shame it's come to this, Scoop. Is this what Congress is coming to?"\n\nJackson's eyes widened angrily. "Don't blame me for your mess, Wallace! Nixon sicced the FBI on us, so you'll excuse me if the party's not in a particularly forgiving mood.""

President Bennett asked the usual question, to which he received the usual answer.\n\n"Still bleeding out, Mr. President. And there's worse news; the Silver Bill won't be enough." Secretary Robertson breathed in, after Bennett shot him a quizzical glance. "We're going to need more silver to tide us over while the monetary reforms are ongoing."\n\n"Alright, well - where are we going to get this silver from?" Bennett leaned back in his chair. "American silver mines are tapped out, so presumably we'll have to import the stuff."\n\n"Right, well." Robertson looked down at his clipboard. "Mexico's an option, but the private sector's buying as much as they can carry. Russia has reserves - but it's a godawful mess. And China's in Japan's backyard..."\n\nBennett motioned for Robertson to get to the point.\n\n"Australia, Mr. President.

"The Aussies have just signed off on the silver deal."\n\nThat woke Bennett up. "That's fantastic! What are they giving us?"\n\n"Well, there's this mine - Broken Hill - that the Australians are willing to divert silver production from. As much as the Treasury needs on an emergency basis." An excited Robertson rushed through his words. "And they're offering favorable pricing. Much better than we can get on the markets. From one friend to another, or that's how they put it."\n\n"From one friend, to another." Bennett digested the words. "I guess they'll be asking for more defense commitments next year?"\n\n"It's not anything we don't give the Australians anyway," Robertson said. "I'd say it's a no-brainer.""

President Bennett said quietly. "None of this comes cheap, I hear."\n\n"You're bloody right it's not cheap," the PM said, prompting a few reporters to glance towards the two. "But if America catches a cold, Australia comes down with the flu. If you need the silver so badly, I'm guessing Australia's going to see the benefits."\n\nBennett smiled. "Our men at the Pentagon are already working out the details. Australia won't have to pay a penny."\n\nBoth men were all smiles as a soldier walked up to the PM with a silver ingot in hand.

Bennett scratched his head, trying to figure out the Prime Minister's problem.\n\n"Well, it's the damned polls. The miners are, ah, a little upset by the commercial aspect of the silver trade, and they're not exactly convinced that the new weapons are helping them," the PM said. "Labor's started to pick up on the issue, saying that Australia's getting shortchanged, and my backbenchers are getting nervous. They want market pricing."\n\n"So let's say I did you a favor and gave you market price. The whole point of this was to build up the reserves so we can lend more money to the OFN. This isn't going to help either of us!" Bennett stated.\n\nOn the other end of the line, Bennett could imagine [AST.GetLeader] pinching the bridge of his nose, caught between his word and his electorate.

Something about there not being enough money, which sounded ridiculous. How could Uncle Sam not have two nickels to rub together? The loan officer would always shrug apologetically. What could he or Horton do, if there wasn't enough silver in Washington?\n\nAnd so each week, Horton would walk into the bank branch with fading hope, and walk out with dying dreams.

Hell, every Kennedy has had to dodge accusations of being a puppet of Rome, and I'm no different, even if I'm a lapsed Catholic!" Harrington stabbed his pencil at the camera. "So why does the Mormon church in Salt Lake City have a direct line to the President of the United States? It'd be embarrassing, if it weren't downright dangerous, especially given Elder Monson's words about the recent Civil Rights Act..."\n\nFord pulled Bennett aside. "I'm not going to question your right to talk to your priest, but I need you to be straight with me now. Did Thomas Monson influence your decisions on the Civil Rights Act, and should we say anything about it?""
WFB.Chains.20.a: ""I told Monson no; Harrington doesn't have the full story!""
WFB.Chains.20.b: ""Yes, but what's the big deal? We all talk to our priests.""

WFB.Chains.21.t: "Shooting Straight"
WFB.Chains.21.desc: "A few days after Harrington's interview with Walter Cronkite, President Bennett stepped out of the White House, where a waiting throng of journalists fished for comments.\n\n"Mr. President! Regarding Mr. Harrington's statement earlier this week, is it true you've been speaking with the elders of the Mormon church about policy?"\n\n"On the question of whether I've been in contact with Mr. Monson: yes, I have." Bennett's frank admission stunned the crowd into silence. "But no, if you're wondering whether Mr. Monson has been an undue influence on the policies of my Administration, he has not."\n\n"But what about the Civil Rights Act?" A reporter, having recovered from the initial shock, blurted out the obvious question.\n\nBennett shrugged. "Well, if you actually read the text, there are many points on which Mr. Monson and I disagree. Mr. Monson's opinions are well known, but we don't see eye to eye on everything just because we share the same faith."\n\nBennett chuckled, as the reporters' pens scribbled furiously. "I don't know where Mr. Harrington got the idea that a man's faith is his policy, but it's a remarkably sloppy one.""
WFB.Chains.21.a: "You come at the king, you best not miss!"

WFB.Chains.22.t: "In God We Trust"
WFB.Chains.22.desc: "President Bennett had taken an extra thirty minutes during the most recent Sunday prayer to sit before the altar, before returning to the Oval Office for another day's work.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act had passed - a conservative one. Already, the North was raising a ruckus about 'Bennett's Jim Crow,' as Michael Harrington had argued a few days earlier. But much of the rest of the country seemed at peace - though he imagined that there would be some restiveness in the South once the Department of Justice sent its people to hold its non-binding consultations with state authorities. America, exhausted after years of turmoil, had seemed ready to put the matter to sleep.\n\n'What does our soothed conscience in Washington mean for the African-American?' President Bennett recalled Robert Kennedy's scathing words in the press, following the Senate vote. He was troubled, of course. In the face of America's most trying political crisis since the Civil War, who wouldn't be afraid that they hadn't done enough?\n\nHe looked at the image of Jesus on the cross. Bennett was a faithful man, and this - this Act was what he could be comfortable with. Never mind Thomas Monson; this was a matter for Bennett alone, a dilemma shared by any man of faith in office. Bennett had been true to himself, and that would have to be enough for America."

WFB.556.t: "The Working Man Fights On!"
WFB.556.desc: ""Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in Progressive territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Republicans couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the Progressives," one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Republicans and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the RDC to open up greater communication to the Progressives." The leader of the Progressive tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

WFB.557.t: "That Fighting Little Governor!"
WFB.557.desc: "They said this job was going to be fuckin' easy.\n\nAfter a long night on the Congressional floor, President Bennett assembled us in the Oval Office itself the next morning. Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. "Good morning, gentlemen." He said. "Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned. "So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the Nationalists' support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Republicans. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

President Bennett has organized a celebratory lunch to praise key members of his Administration, along with some special guests from high society, people of honor, and foreign governments. The mood is high as President Bennett prepares to take to the podium and make a speech.\n\n"My fellow Americans, honored guests, members of my Administration. Today, we stand as one America. One Organization of Free Nations. One world. Over the past few years, we have achieved the greatest accomplishments, soared to the highest heights, and have healed the wounds left from this decade's past. The economy is booming, our people enjoy rights like no other, democracies all across the globe know that their way of life is no longer at stake. The Nazi scourge in Germany, and the Imperialist menace in Japan are beginning to know their place. While their empires of dirt and toil collapse, our nations grow and prosper. We stand united! The torch of freedom burns bright!"\n\nRabid applause erupts from the Rose Garden. The jubilant crowd, fired up from words of passion and wisdom, has hope in their eyes. The future to them does not seem so bleak anymore. Thirty years from now, when their generations ask what they did during the great cold war, everyone in attendance can simply and confidently say that "they won.""

For the first time since years of economic downturn, people are buying stocks again. President Bennett has restored the public's confidence in such an investment. With low interest rates, adjusted oversight, and more provisions, a lucrative section of the finance industry has just exploded. New applicants fresh out of college walk through the office doors seemingly every day. And on the other line of their phones and meeting with people who want to invest, business confidence is being revitalized.\n\nDevin hangs up. He never thought after barely getting his degree, he'd be working in a practically brand new industry. He resigned to a middle management position, but was now making his own money and helping other Americans make it too. To his side, a new arrival sits down, carrying a cardboard box of belongings.\n\n"Hey." The two men exchange an awkward handshake. "You've been here a while, right?" Devin nods. The new arrival stutters a bit, as he moves his chair to face Devin. "Are you sure this whole thing is okay? For something so new, it seems to be doing too well..."\n\nDevin nods, and puts a hand on the new arrival's shoulder. "Look, man. I had the same thoughts when I came in, and some other kind fella did the exact same thing to me. The way I see it, we're helping people make money in ways they could never do before.

They drill our military, they send our boys to die in South Africa, they have massive investment into our economy as investors and trading partners, and our diplomats are forced to play second fiddle to American ones. Michael knows that all too well, being a part of Australia's diplomatic corps. Perhaps, deep down, he was only worried about his 1st son, Gil. If those Yanks send him to die somewhere else, he wouldn't know what to do.\n\nThat is, until the American Ambassador paid a visit to Canberra today. And with him, he brought some very interesting news.\n\n"President Bennett has readjusted his policy dealing with members of the OFN. As of today, we'll be withdrawing some of our own administration and diplomatic staff, and giving more autonomy to the Australian government in terms of who and what they want to proceed with diplomatically."\n\nMichael couldn't believe his ears. After the speech from the ambassador, he turned to the man next to him. "Hey, mate. You really believe what this Yank is saying? They've been up our arse for decades at this point."\n\nThe man nodded. "That Bennett really is doing his best to equalize OFN policy. I may not like the Yanks either, but they're doing their best to finally even the scales. About bloody time, if you ask me."\n\nMichael had a sigh of relief internally. Years of worry, and reform is finally upon us. Even if he still had doubts, the new Administration in Washington was at least trying to not be the hegemon in which the OFN relies on. Much like before, Michael knew with confidence now that his opinion was shared with many Australians."

While others would believe the solution to this pressing issue to be to expand the power of the military, we know for a fact that bringing the OFN closer together will only better ensure the interests of the OFN abroad; namely, in ensuring all OFN nations share rifles, munitions, tanks, and trucks to greatly simplify logistics for military operations within the OFN.\n\nOf course, to make up for providing our allies with sufficient supplies, this bill will also include a provision to massively increase spending on military production to properly ensure that the military production of the USA can cover for converting the nations across the OFN to the new standards set by ourselves.§!"
USA_WFB_CFN_reform_2_tt: "§WDiplomatic Coordination§!\n\n§FWe will begin The Forum on OFN Diplomacy. In order to ensure that the foreign policy across the OFN is consistent, we will decide exactly what the OFN is- not the sphere of influence of America, but a proper bloc against the fascist forces of the world.\n\nIn order to ensure that all within the OFN are taken into account, we will rework our own foreign policy, in order to ensure that even the least noteworthy members of the OFN can properly make an impact on world affairs. As well, to ensure that our nations closely coordinate, we will host a yearly meeting of all members of the OFN to discuss the situation in the world, and how to deal with these challenges.§!"
USA_WFB_CFN_reform_3_tt: "§WIMF and the World Bank§!\n\n§FThe International Monetary Fund has been a subject of heated debate until recent years, thanks to the efforts of President Bennett to ensure pan-national economic stability, and not just within the realm of the OFN. Through establishing a fund for nations across the world to contribute towards, the IMF system would establish a financial pool of resources, which would be used to create string attached loans and provide partial economic stability to a country facing a financial crisis.\n\nWhile this system may initially seem to be a way to lend aid to nations that may be susceptible to the whims of the OFN -which it partially is- the system is also capable of pressuring other nations that would profit from this system to begin adopting capitalism like they never have before and to begin prioritizing fiscal discipline over economic growth. This will only benefit America, the OFN, and the world as a whole.§!"
USA_WFB_CFN_reform_4_tt: "§WFixed Exchange Rates§!\n\n§FThe notion of mending the currencies of the OFN to that of America has been one familiar to the countless avid supporters and fierce opposition to the proposed system of the OFN Monetary System. Consisting of using the various central banks of the OFN nations in question to balance the currencies, this system has gained plenty of support thanks to President Bennett stabilizing the American dollar. By linking the currencies of the OFN to the now stable dollar, we should be able to maintain some modicum of stability and prevent massive fluctuations in the value of other currencies within the OFN.\n\nOf course, the exact value will not always be directly proportional to that of the American dollar, as through the proposed system, the OFN Monetary System will operate off of a band system, maintaining a price floor and ceiling, allowing for acceptable trade prices to be maintained, at least to some degree.§!"
USA_WFB_CFN_reform_5_tt: "§WTariff Reform§!\n\n§FWhile the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may sound mundane, the GATT is perhaps one of the most essential aspects to the economic mending of the OFN. through promoting international trade, the various economies of the OFN will only grow, though this wonderful advancement can only be reached if compromises are struck, and agreements are made.\n\nThrough deciding the place of trade barriers such as tariffs or quotas, as well as eliminating preferences on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis, we will be able to substantially increase trade, stimulate the economies of the OFN, and to closer mend our nations through breaking down the walls of tariffs that hold back economic progress and prosperity. Even still, free trade as an idea is political poison, and the RDC will need to swallow such a tough pill if we hope to bring further prosperity to the OFN.§!"

##GOLDWATER

 POLITICS_GLD_DESC: ""A Christian, a Jew, a pilot and a senator walked into a bar in DC. 'What can I get you, Mr. Goldwater?' asked the tender." Thus goes one of the jokes Barry Morris Goldwater tells about himself, and it reflects the complicated and colorful background of the man dominating the Southern and Western wings of the RDC. Born in the Arizona Territory to a Jewish father and Episcopalian mother who ran a department store together, the young Goldwater lived an unremarkable life until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he would become a reserve officer in the USAAF, and a pilot with the Ferry Command.\n\nMoving supplies around the various war fronts in Asia and Europe, Goldwater would come to develop a great loathing of both his fascist enemies and what he viewed as the failures of the Dewey administration's peace policies. Following the defeat, Goldwater's aggressive rhetoric and unabashed social conservatism propelled him to the Senator's seat for Arizona in 1953, replacing the retiring Democrat MacFarland.\n\nGoldwater rose to become one of the leaders of the Republican faction in the RDC, resisting recruitment attempts by both the Democrats, due to his personal animosity with Eisenhower, and the NPP, which he views as too fixated on Japan alone and dominated by socialist radicals. His charisma and fiery presence soon set him on a path to the White House.\n\nNow, with Goldwater swept into power by a wave of popular support, the world looks across the seas in hope or worry, as the USA takes another step towards full military mobilization against its fascist enemies around the world."


#focuses for Goldwater
 USA_gld_68_goldwater_presidency: "The Goldwater Presidency"
 USA_gld_68_goldwater_presidency_desc: "Barry Goldwater is now in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Senator from Arizona has promised a lot during his election, holding on to his arch conservative base in the South, and the libertarians of the West, while also appealing to the moderates of the Northeast. But his associations with the likes of Donald Regan and his "voodoo economics," and his incendiary anti-fascist views, have made many of those in power uneasy. But it's time to get to work for all of America now. Whether that involves working with those that disagree with him in the party to hammer out compromises, or forging his own path remains to be seen."
 USA_gld_68_bipartisan_cabinet: "A Bipartisan Cabinet"
 USA_gld_68_bipartisan_cabinet_desc: "Abraham Lincoln formed a Team of Rivals when he was elected over a hundred years ago to serve on his cabinet and to unify the Republican Party in the face of the Civil War. In this tradition of unifying the party to face tough challenges, Goldwater has decided to do the same. Liberal and conservative; progressive and libertarian; all will have a seat at the table, and all will have their chance to propose solutions. Let the best ideas win!"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_cabinet: "A Conservative Cabinet"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_cabinet_desc: "The election proved that America was ready to change course from the muddled liberalism of the past twenty years. Instead of pandering to all factions of the RDC, and risking confusion and delay when decisions need to be made, a staunchly conservative cabinet will be named to ensure that Goldwater's policies will get put in place. We will not be held back by those that want to talk, debate and compromise!"
 USA_gld_68_a_speech_to_a_broken_nation: "A Speech to a Broken Nation"
 USA_gld_68_a_speech_to_a_broken_nation_desc: ""America is standing on a precipice..." Umm, no, that's too fancy a word. "America was directionless and..." Eh, that doesn't have the right ring to it. "America is a Broken Nation, and today we begin repairing it." That's it! Let's go with that.\n\nThe President has already asked the major television networks for air time tomorrow evening to give a speech to lay out Goldwater's policies and goals. This speech will also be the perfect opportunity to rally the Republican-Democratic Coalition, the independents that cast their ballot for him, and maybe even strip away some of the Nationalists' support. After all, what better way to get America's attention than through an Oval Office address?"
 USA_gld_68_a_proper_union: "A Proper Union"
 USA_gld_68_a_proper_union_desc: ""Thank you, and God Bless America."\n\nThe TV cameras shut off, and President Goldwater shuffles the speech he just read on his desk. Staffers and cabinet members in the back of the Oval Office were already cheering and applauding, and the Chief of Staff came up to the Resolute desk, a grin on his face. The speech went off without a hitch. Tomorrow the newspapers will talk about it, and the opinion polls in a couple of weeks will show if it actually did resonate with the American people as well as expected. But the time for talking is done. It's time to roll up the sleeves and get to work. We got a union to save."
 USA_gld_68_revitalize_the_economy: "Revitalize The Economy"
 USA_gld_68_revitalize_the_economy_desc: "The economy has been languishing under the worst kinds of abuse for years. With the Oval Office now occupied by a fiscal conservative, things are going to get tighter, perhaps for better, perhaps worse; tight budgeting, tight social programs, tight oversights on federal spending, the full oeuvre of constrained government finance. Taxes will be flattened, as will monopolies from unions to corporations to the Federal government itself. The free market with proper nurturing can finely adjudicate many problems on its own and, as ever, the people most directly concerned are financially capable without Federal interference. And if not, it could be that the government has enculturated them to be slavish and dependent, and deteriorated their self-efficiency. The government has over-sought and overwrought its welcome in the affairs of finance that it is at best ill-equipped to manage without trampling the economic rights of American workers and businessmen."
 USA_gld_68_financial_reform: "Financial Reform"
 USA_gld_68_financial_reform_desc: "Arguably one of the most fervid conservatives in the sitting American government, Goldwater has a tendency to be rather brusque and unflinching in advocating his convictions. As such he will tend to push his party aside if it means they will compromise his aims to back small government conservatism. With this in mind he will meet significant conflict from the liberal wings of his own party (i.e. Nelson Rockefeller) in pushing his ideal of a flattened tax rate, the systematic nullification of LBJ-esque subsidies (agriculture being particularly crucial), defanging overly demanding unions (reexamining the Wagner Act and the like for starters), reinstating voluntarism in union membership, re-delegating the duties of commerce and trade as is fit back to the states, and rifling through all the other laws of finance Congress has made without mind to the 10th Amendment's prohibitions on their doing so."
 USA_gld_68_reganomics: "Reganomics"
 USA_gld_68_reganomics_desc: "A man with a liberalized free market ethos, Don Regan believes heavily in top-down, minimal government (though willing to bend it broader in superficially justifiable cases), supply-side economics with a vocal distaste for the preachments of Keynes and Marx. This entails deregulating boxed in corporations, cutting Federal social spending and other endeavors deemed fruitless or the obligation of states rather than the Washington leviathan, and being so fiscally regimented that it becomes patently difficult to accrue debt in the first place. Though this does not mean Regan is at all averse to padding the budget out ever so slightly in favor of those good ole job creators and our men of arms."
 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan: "Go With Regan"
 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan_desc: "Rebuking the moderates thins the line between Goldwaterian economics and a better cohered market for America. However, with Don Regan at the reigns of the treasury, it's now imperative to remain on the same page with him and tug him along in the right direction. He has a tendency to romanticize supply side policy without clearly following its actual stated objectives if political expediency presents itself more attractively. Optimistically, referring him back to his boss' unwavering, literalist fealty for the Constitution will make him think twice if needed. It will all be easy enough if you can follow the 10th Amendment, kill monopolies, cut government, and emancipate the American economy from the welfare state. Keep the market free, and keep it healthy."
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down: "Tone it Down"
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down_desc: "Statism cannot be cut down in a day, and the Democrats are not all bad; the balance between left and right is what keeps the country afloat and Goldwater knows it. This, of course, means setting Don Regan aside and keeping the incumbent Treasury Secretary in his appointed position. As his dear friend Buckley might advise, if they can simply be persuaded to explore the options with a Goldwater presidency and market, it will be easier to extricate them from thinking government is the soothing balm for all social wounds. Goldwater will make his cuts into welfareism and state apparatuses more gradual in exchange for an easier time pushing his objectives through an already divided Congress. In due time, the reigns will be secure, and America set right."
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression: "Out of Depression"
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression_desc: "Our economy cannot and will not recuperate from the Depression without letting it sort itself into order before applying any government bandaids. To Goldwater, a significant reason for perdurable American economic success in the 19th century was the wisdom against adversely impacting the market with artificial government competition; deviating from which is certainly what wrought the cancer that is corporate monopoly upon the world, and shifty union men along with it. Open competition, free trade, and resisting the urge to make the government's teat a congregation of suckling infants who'll take generations to recover their prosperity, even more so their independency thereby will bear their laborious fruits in due time. The object is a process which respects the rule of law, for which Goldwater has all the patience in this world."
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy: "A Sound, Fiscal Economy"
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy_desc: "Sound and fiscal means, quite frankly no more promiscuous dalliances with experimental social aid, not a bit more of the old, fruitless rigmarole of pumping money into the states until they comply with Federal standards, and not a whisper of mention for subsidizing failure with people's hard earned tax dollars. Industry will be stimulated by more unrestrained trade with America's remaining allies with emphasis placed on hard cash getters like American coal and plant grains for exports, and European luxury goods (in limited quantities), minerals, oil, and dispensable commodities for imports. Broad markets and narrow Federal waste will lead the American economy to stable triumph."
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation: "Program Evaluation"
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation_desc: "The more useless programs, the more the government spends on gratuitous, self-expanding ventures that harm and hamper more than they help. The market becomes plainly impotent when the government subsidizes failure or bails out economic decrepitude, anchoring it to the measly pittances the Federal bodies are actually capable of throwing at the problem. More programs mean more tax money thrown in directions that people could have used to make it out better on their own and of course ever higher taxes to exact the funds needed to support such a bloated apparatus. As such, it's time to cleave welfare and benefits of the like that are better provided by the people most directly involved. From corporate headquarters to country farms, it's high time to bean crippling dependency on government money in the head."
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies: "Reduce Agricultural Subsidies"
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies_desc: "Farms are an irreplaceable component of American infrastructure, but what good are they if they are forced to wastefully produce more than they can realistically distribute? Goldwater submits the only thing worse than the explicit endorsement of perishable excesses, is the implicit funding of non-production to maintain an imaginary placeholder. And since when did the 10th Amendment sanction this sort of foolish meddling in agriculture to begin with? Let the chips fall where they may, let farms and farmers live up to their proper potentials, and good riddance to these cumbersome subsidies, suffocating price supports, and counterintuitive production controls. If farmers cannot cultivate our land without the Federal government mucking up the works, the country will never get around to making a living off of it."
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare: "Cut Wasteful Welfare"
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare_desc: "Within the Goldwater approach, what he and other fiscal rightists call "welfareism" is the scourge of a healthy state, market, and nation. If it suspends the 10th Amendment for any excuse whatsoever in order to permit a government imposition on the country's economy, it is an inherent outgrowth of this affliction. The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations. It becomes the proverbial bull in the China shop, while somehow acquiring proprietary rights to the entire China shop. Anti-welfare propositions intend to consign that chaos to yesterday."
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget: "Balanced Budget"
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget_desc: "With Congressional spending on the path to an equilibrium status, that equilibrium itself will need to be secured. The measures needed to accomplish that lie in pruning yet more spending outgrowths, redundant government offices, even whole departments that are, in accordance with the 10th Amendment as well as a groaning Federal pocketbook, foundationally gratuitous. No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being "workable". The budget should not be a wishlist for fanciful politicians, but rather a well-oiled machine to keep the country running, and that requires a compact unit that meets bare civic necessities instead of drooling over wasteful stimulus packages."
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling: "Cap the Debt Ceiling"
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling_desc: "Inordinate, reckless expenditure has become Congress' default resolution for various national crises. The administration's fiscal conservatism demands this halts immediately so the government can apportion tax dollars more judiciously; as well as explore other solutions to social and infrastructural maladies than vomiting Federal coffers dry into them. To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle. The extraneous buck stops here."
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work: "Working Men Should Work"
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work_desc: "Next year's budget proposals have caused an uproar, as spending on welfare programs like employment insurance and Social Security have been massively cut back, along with a whole series of other programs that conservatives have long claimed only incentivises laziness and freeloading off the government. In a White House Press Conference, President Goldwater himself has stood up for his proposals, saying that these programs have been given too freely in the past to "... those that can, and should be working, but choose not to because they think the government can provide for them." But it's the last line that dominates headlines: "Working men should work!""
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs: "Kill the Tariffs"
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs_desc: "Goldwater has always been a believer that America can, and always will, build anything better than anyone else. However, that can lead to situations where American made products are expensive and out of reach of millions of poorer Americans. Regan has proposed that maybe tariffs should be cut on imported goods from other countries, to allow cheaper products from overseas to provide for these markets that American companies aren't providing for. Plus, since the US isn't spending as much money on welfare anymore, we don't need to collect as much money as before. So why not make the accountants jobs at the Treasury Department a little bit easier?"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget: "Skin the Budget"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget_desc: "The budget is still hinderingly bloated, and Goldwater figures it is high time to simply skin its blubbery carcass alive. Patience with its engorged stature has only led to failure in the limited four year stints of other chief executives, and Goldwater refuses to be another complacent zookeeper that feeds into its bulk. The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in. Cut the fat and produce a smaller budget in proportion to the realistically smaller legitimate duties of the Federal government."
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance: "Conservative Finance"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance_desc: "Government spending is forecasted to be well down from previous years, which makes future tax cuts that much more enticing. With the lazy bums forced to find jobs since their monthly free money has vanished, there are now millions more people looking for work. So what if the bleeding heart liberals are crying at us for pushing poverty levels up? It's only because they aren't working hard enough. With an expanded workforce crying for jobs, we can now encourage companies to invest and build in America, making all the stuff our nation will ever need. They don't need to build their branch plants or invest overseas. We already have the largest single market in the world. America First!"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense: "Austerity in Finance, Abundance in Defense"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense_desc: "War brings arduous necessities, among these is acknowledging when to cut back other public expenses in order to serve the country's ability to wage the wars needed to protect it. The American war machine hasn't thoroughly greased its joints in what seems like ages, and little eases friction in them quite like money for war machines and a place to send them. Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress. The skin is pulled tight to Uncle Sam's face and he's letting the excess come out in munitions and engines to drive them to their scheduled destination."
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan: "Rumsfeld's Plan"
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan_desc: "A vaguely technocratic ideal of the military, Donald Rumsfeld's program is one for endorsing hardware over manpower, while paring down, refining, and reapplying the select droves of men we already have enlisted (usually in more sparing placements and field assaults, but on what are deemed to be more strategic contact points). Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness. Nonetheless, it would prove an immense shift in American war doctrine, and, if the war is lost, we'll lose more money than men."

 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision_desc: "In Washington quite a few of the big wigs in Goldwater's military cabinet, chiefly Robert McNamara, have had a mana from heaven realization; more troops mean we can simply swarm the RK forces with raw numbers. The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once. Those paltry few that could would usually need weapons of mass destruction to definitively repel the pressurized application of so many well-coordinated invaders. Enough men will send the Reich packing, of this McNamara is positive."

 USA_gld_68_a_specialized_defense_desc: "The average grunt, noble though he is, is proving vastly insufficient to cope with the most battle-hardened RK units. In tandem with the adverse, novel climate in which the war is fought, such lack of veteran specialty in jungle combat is becoming disastrous for American forces. As such, the request has been made and granted for trained special forces units for whom underhanded, unorthodox warfare tailored to the difficult African climate is an object rather than an inconvenient resort. In lieu of overwhelming the Germans with old fashioned G.I.'s en masse, a more scalpel-esque approach will be adopted. Saliently, these divisions will engage the enemy in booby trapping, sabotage, guerrilla tactics, deep reconnaissance measures, skirmish and ambush oriented firefights; the genuine article of commando-focal warfare. If all goes swimmingly, the Nazis won't be able to out-adapt this rigorously versatile approach before it is far too late."

 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles_desc: "The country's armored warfare capacity is long overdue to be updated. This means introducing, manufacturing, and developing superior trucks, half-tracks, tank destroyers, and of course, tanks. With a fresh steel bulwark driving at their weary heels, the Krauts scarcely stand a chance. An increase in armored vehicles, particularly tanks will provide a boon, both literal and figurative to the average G.I. who will be able to call a much harder hammer down on skirmish prone swathes of RK-held territory. To boot, modern tanks can aid in the eventual push back to conventional war doctrine as the Germans are compelled to do battle in the open air as well as African villages."

 USA_gld_68_military_is_of_public_interest_desc: "Without our servicemen and their well-worked tools, the country's shores would fall to the jaws of fascism, and as such each sound man alive can see the import behind a well-muscled military. As a matter of national livelihood it should take a role on the center stage of government spending and prioritization. Greater portions of collected taxes will be delegated to the defense budget, and the budget itself will be marginally enlarged. Public support of the armed services will be encouraged, war austerity policies fostered, factory jobs lauded, and domestic morale safeguarded. The land of the free and the home of the brave will live up to its name under Goldwater as it has so many times before."
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration: "Land-Air Integration"
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration_desc: "Aerial warfare is precisely President Goldwater's wheelhouse as a senior USAAF veteran, a period in which he doubtlessly learned a key lesson about air support, which is that it can only reify ground troops' ability to function for so long, and with only so much efficacy in being high flying craft opposed to enemies well-equipped with flak cannons. That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed. Synthesized with hardened infantry, the helicopter and its tactics are a revolution in American war-making ability."

The gargantuan demand for better guns has transformed into an equally exigent insistence for arms with growingly staggering caliber and destructive capacities. Larger artillery pieces, more efficient mortars, and bombs that can level the fortified installations which dapple the enemy's lines; anything with a bang big enough to ensure they think twice about advancing or sticking it out. The guns of Goldwater's service years are no more with modern technology coupled alongside the need to beat down a newer foe."

Great men have to risk their lives for it without fail throughout the annals of history, and that time has come again, both for it and the liberty of our dear friends in Africa. Far from being lethally drastic; minimal conscription measures are what Goldwater has in mind. A selective service and lottery system will be more than apt to bring in the surplus manpower necessary to bow the head of the Reichskommissariats. Every man who gives his life for Africa's liberty will go down as a hero, and those heroes who haven't stepped forward may yet be found."

 USA_gld_68_lessons_from_saf_desc: "It occurs to any forward thinking man of war or the world that one can only wage war as successfully as he knows the grounds where he wages it. It's about time we took measures from the playbook of the local guerrilla fighters and integrated them into our own combat doctrines. As our allies they should be more than willing to aid the force superior in strength to them on their side. That might will only supplement their own so much if it is left to languish confused as it is consistently outwitted by a far more locally acclimated enemy. Spotting unique styles of booby trap, learning what to listen for in the underbrush, and understanding ambush positions in the foliage before they can be sprung among other things will all work towards our boys' favor."

More of the defense budget will be repurposed towards the manufacture of only the finest quality of mass issue small arms, and new designs befitting a jungle soldier's war considered for service. Flame-based and explosive projectile weapons capable of being fielded by small companies, platoons, and squads will also enter development and selection to enable their progress through the sweltering verdure populated with Nazis. There are few things that can overpower a vile jackboot, but a preponderance of arsenal in the hands of hardy G.I.'s is among them."

To put it mildly, this translates to yet another upping for the military's ever flowering new demands, with another matched-ly extensive addition to their coffers. War and its fruits are never costless, such is the eternal burden of free, fiercely principled nations who must resort to it against such tyrannies as the Nazis. Arms and armor manufacturing, conscription, and industrial production orders will all measurably intensify for the war effort's sake, without which victory is forsaken."

 USA_gld_68_more_men_more_munitions_desc: "It's an imperishable fact of armed struggle that you never know the lengths to which your dedication and nation may be tried. The manufacturing foundries which fuel the conflict's success must be tried yet further with an increase in locales, loans, and assembly lines to get more guns, gear, vehicles, and shells to the latest wave of valiant young Americans to stomp the RK's guts out. Regarding those courageous youth; there simply are not enough of them in the service to deploy against the Reich's tides. Conscription will be accelerated to meet the call of duty against the unrelenting Nazi specter. No man can fight forever, which is why fresh faces with fresh reserves of combat vigor must sally forth to crush the fascists head on. With their well-oiled tools, they will end this, for as Goldwater knows, you don't start a fight you have no intention of finishing."
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism: "Military Keynesianism"
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism_desc: "Keynes may have been a fool in most respects, but at least he grasped the needs of wartime production and the benefits it confers for the larger market economy. The debt we owe to our coffers is negligible against the backdrop of the ferocious clash throughout the bottommost ranges of Africa. The prospective boom from cycling against the ravages of war with raw production is tempting to say the least too. Reganist financial doctrines shift to reflect a Keynesian, demand-focused military industrial policy that the administration is convinced can give the desired push that will collapse the enemy's resolve through sheer, brute war production overclocking. The war has to be fought, and political economy cannot stand in the way."

 USA_gld_68_the_best_defense_is_a_funded_military_desc: "A full, Congressionally mandated budget increase for our defense has been called for, and with the raging, pitched inferno covering South Africa, it is inevitably necessary. If the Reich cannot be halted in Africa, Lord knows what they may be bold enough to attempt next, anything on the spectrum from strikes using weapons of mass destruction to another global conquest; the likes of which has not been seen for years. Safety can always be bought in more guns and war supplies, so why not secure oneself in the event of Reich getting any more audacious or threatening they already are? The war's continued frustrations are proof positive that it's a warranted concern, and that decisive victory requires decisive commitment with considerable sums of pure cash."

 USA_gld_68_a_modern_banking_system_desc: "The Interstate Banking Act of [GetYear] is now on President Goldwater's desk, one of his pet projects. For years the various states have put up barriers to the workings of financial institutions, forcing banks to keep their money in their states and not transfer the money where it needs to go. Some of the smaller states are pleading for more money to invest into their economies, but the larger states jealously guard the money, seeking to keep it where it already is. But with regulations slashed and taxes dropped, soon the local and regional banks that were long complacent will have to compete again, which will only help small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the financing they need to get growing."
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan: "Morton's Plan"
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan_desc: "Not everyone is on board with Regan's bold schemes to change the economic future of America. Some oppose it altogether, of course, but they weren't voting for us anyways. More importantly, however, is the opposition to Regan's plan within our party, led by Thurston Ballard Morton. Morton's clique, large and growing, objects to Regan's most outlandish plans and aims to reel his ambitions back in.\n\nTheir ideas heavily lean on massive expansion of trade with OFN allies, as well as using said trade leverage as political power in international politics. By strengthening our trade bonds with our allies, they say, we will both solidify our economy at home and our reputation abroad. It's important to note that these plans do not entirely conflict with Goldwater's own views, and that the President and Morton are quite aligned. Siding with Morton would, if anything, strengthen the President's bonds with the RDC.\n\nOf course, such an alliance would require compromising on some of President Goldwater's deepest-held values, and Regan is staunchly against any infringement on what he sees as both his and the Administration's responsibility. On the other hand, going with Regan would risk the plan failing in Congress - a much less likely outcome with Morton's plans, even if ultra-conservatives rejected the compromise in protest.\n\nPerhaps it's worth listening to what the moderates have to say."

 USA_gld_68_international_trade_desc: "While the US is one of the largest economies in the world, and has virtually every resource within its borders that it could ever need, it can't stand alone. In fact, it is imperative that America should trade with the world, especially with the anti-fascist Free World. The resources of Canada, South Africa, Australia and Latin America is worth a pretty penny, and they in turn can purchase products made in factories in the States, which will only require more resources, which will result in more money for them to spend on goods Made in America, and the cycle will continue, on and on, making everyone richer and happier. President Goldwater will be giving a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce tomorrow to lay out his plans to increase international trade, which should make all the businessmen there very happy."

 USA_gld_68_goldwaters_way_desc: ""Trading with the enemies of freedom and democracy alone should give pause to those seeking 'Free Trade,' as they like to call it. Because it is not 'Free Trade,' it is a bloody, demeaning trade. America, as one of the few homes of freedom and democracy in this world, should not allow our hands to be dirtied by the gold and silver from blood soaked hands of the tyrants."\n\nOpinion polls had long shown that a substantial majority opposes trading with the German Reich, Italy, Iberia, or the Empire of Japan. However, the leaders of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, blindsided by the President's announcement, are horrified. Embargoing the largest markets in the world for being brutal dictatorships could cause a lot of economic chaos since the members of the OFN are a lot smaller economically, as they can't afford to buy all of America's goods. Even if it is popular, this new "Free Trade" policy is a dicey political and economic gamble."

But no longer. We will make the right choice. We must make the right choice!"\n\nThe President has made "The Goldwater Way" position crystal clear: either stand with our allies and our freedoms, or to continue trading with murderers and criminals. For most of America, the choice is obvious. For the rest, they know better than to say so out loud unless they want to be branded a Yockey supporter or a Japanese collaborator."

While businessmen in New York and the politicans in Washington in their pockets will complain, it's a popular idea with everyday Americans. After all, buying products made by slave labor or under oppressive regimes is tantamount to supporting them, and all red-blooded, freedom loving citizens of the US will never stop that low."

Luckily for us, we already know a large number of such nations: our allies in the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nWe will encourage further economic ties between the US and our friends in Canada, Australia and all over the world, rewarding them with lower tariffs and reduced red tape to ship their products to us.

The Capitol switchboard has been overloaded with calls from constituents to express their opinions on the bill, and unofficial tallies by the operators show that those who are opposed to it are outnumbered an outstanding twenty to one. Any economist or business leader who dared to publically state that banning trade with the largest nations on earth could be detreminetal to the American economy have been denounced as "fear mongers" and "Nazi sympathizers."\n\nBut the bill has passed the House in large numbers, and with a healthy majority in the Senate, though some notable RDC members voted against it. Most of them won't be seeing re-election next time, Goldwater is sure. But in a ceremony in the Oval Office recorded on camera, the Free Trade Act is signed, and it's official. Though the results will take time to be felt as there has been a grace period of a year for most industries, Goldwater's approval has skyrocketed, and Americans everywhere are proud of their moral stance."

Big-shot liberals like to talk about their social programs and their massive government expansions, but they never seem to dwell too long on the price tag of their pet projects. Year after year, America has been forced to watch helplessly as their representatives drive their taxes higher and higher, ravaging their wages with inflation and bloating their government into an unrecognizable morass of waste and corruption. President Goldwater has no intentions of standing for this any longer.\n\nOne reason for this glut in spending is the almost comically weak debt ceiling that America has in place today. Weakly enforced and almost powerless in effect, the debt ceiling has been trampled again and again by the big-spending Washingtonians - a useless speed bump instead of a hard guardrail.\n\nBy working within the Senate, President Goldwater will change that. The debt ceiling will no longer be made of paper, but will be instead replaced with a concrete limit, a red line that tells Capitol Hill - and the nation - that reckless spending will not go beyond this point. Then, and only then, will the process of cutting government down to size become a true movement.\n\nAfter all, what good is policy if it gets reversed in four years time?"

Really, all they've done is strangle the life out of those entrepreneurial pioneers who boldly march America forwards, tightening the noose even as hard-working Americans gasp for help. It falls to us to cut that rope, and free the market once again.\n\nIn general, the smaller the government, the better, as Goldwater argues. Getting Washington out of the way of the liberty of the people to do what they'd like with their money and ideas is more difficult than it should be, but it is not impenetrable - soon, business owners will find their hands untied and free to build new prosperity for America to share in, and they'll know to thank the President for it."

Tax-and-spend liberals see no problem with this, of course, but President Goldwater knows better than to shut his eyes to the danger.\n\nThe interest rates that the government pays seem to grow every year, taking more money out of the average American's pocket, and it's past time that that trend was reversed. By contacting the Federal Reserve, the President will lower interest rates on the rapidly expanding debt, stunting its growth in its tracks. Not only will this stuff the growth of the debt, but it will also stimulate economic growth in the private sector. Goldwater wins, business owners win, and Americans win. What's not to like?"

However, it's been left to float free for a while now, which causes rapid rises and falls depending on the markets and politics. This has caused uncertainty and economic issues for years now, but now President Goldwater wants to stabilize the system. A whole suite of executive orders and laws have been proposed to keep the dollar stable. The goals should be to get the value of the dollar compared to the Reichsmark and the Yen, as well as OFN currencies, that should be perfect for businesses who want a lower dollar to encourage exports, and for companies that want a stronger dollar to make importing from other countries less expensive.

But now is the time to reduce all the trade barriers between our nations, implement standardizations in our economies, and bring everyone together in peace and prosperity. It is time to negotiate the North American Trade Cooperation Agreement (NATC). We will provide millions of dollars to help build up industries in both countries to the same standards as ours in interest free loans, and in turn we will make it easier for them to sell their resources, such as oil, food, iron ore, aluminum, and more, to America.

Other bonuses including reducing inflation, keeping government spending under control, and generally making the US a better place to do business with.

Even though Goldwater is a Free Market proponent, he has agreed to help set up a series of part private, part state owned businesses to help keep the economy going.

Some of these methods may not be moral. In the end, however, it will all be worth it. If American democracy is not protected and these traitors win an election, it will spell the doom of our nation!\n\nSome advisors say that we are walking in the same steps as Nixon did on his road to impeachment. These cowards seem to think that we will commit the same mistakes as he did. No doubt they would hand over the White House to Yockey and his gang. Goldwater knows what he is doing, and he will keep the tightest lid on any of the more shady parts of this operation.\n\nAfter all, perhaps Nixon had some good ideas when it came to suppression."

Free healthcare, free houses, free money all in the palm of your grubby hands -- but if and only if you'll tell some others to come work with them too. In such a manner does it get zealous servants while only paying them pennies and a pat on the back for their good work.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their spawn the trade unions emulate its progenitor. America's unions get membership dues and oaths of loyalty out of their peons, and nothing to give them but the euphoria of belonging to some "higher cause". A card of pyramids held together by simple gravity. But with one good kick, believes President Goldwater, it might just come crashing down..."

 USA_gld_68_target_their_leaders_desc: "For all that socialists depict themselves as a formless, inscrutable wave of coalesced anger, the structures of their organizations adhere to physical law better than their rhetoric. A mob, regardless of ideology, will always rally around men of action and results -- men who have proven their worth in the eyes of their lessers, and who have the means to direct their zeal towards their cause's ends. Equally true, then, is its corollary: That a mob scatters like dust before wind without a leader to guide them.\n\nFor a movement that derives its strength from countless many mobs, an equally countless number of leaders is their direst necessity... and their weakest link. The next step forward has thus revealed itself in the eyes of President Goldwater's vengeful government."

 USA_gld_68_investigate_recruitment_methods_desc: "Despite the expectations of our enlightened forefathers, socialism hasn't withered into nothing against the light of church and reason. Instead it has amassed strength with every convert, turning into a beast stained with the crimson of its terrible banners. No force seems enough to banish it fully, as if it were a hydra that gains a hundred heads for each severed neck. Why and how socialism has become so is a query that has driven many conservatives to drink and desperate prayer -- even while a red noose tightens around their own necks.\n\nThe President does not wish to give the socialists any further opportunities to oust him from the White House. To that end, Director Hoover shall task his agents to uncover the nature of America's red hydra, and how it gains such widespread appeal with such a God-fearing people as Americans."

The same can be said of any effort to definitively end the socialist menace; let foster the schemes which breed socialist thought, and there will be no end in sight for the riots and rebels socialism inevitably spawns.\n\nIn any case, President Goldwater already has his hands full dealing with the red bastards who've already organized. Painstaking progress has been made to isolate them from their sources of support -- progress easily undone if newer unions were to spring out like summer pox. He believes that imposing additional restrictions in establishing new trade unions will further weaken the extant unions to a point where he can do away with them in one fell swoop."

 USA_gld_68_from_blacklist_to_whitelist_desc: "In dealing with American society's more seditious elements, the federal government's extensive security and intelligence apparatuses have taken to keeping an equally-extensive register of persons who had been, have been, or are suspected of having engaged themselves in illegal or traitorous activities. The thinking goes that such elements should be isolated away from where they can do the most harm. Spies and smugglers make up a healthy portion of these registers, although criminals and rabble-rousers form their majorities.\n\nThe converse of this "blacklist" is a register of individuals who have demonstrated deep loyalty to America and its laws. Investigating loyal citizens is a fruitless, wasteful endeavor; thus, President Goldwater believes his anti-corruption campaign is best served with a whitelist for the most exceptional members of his party."

Man is easy to tempt away from their duties with money as it is; with the stakes involved in the formulation and implementation of laws, money tends to appear to Beltway officials and employees like oases of manna in the dry desert. Incidentally, America's trade unions happen to be among the largest sources of this sweet, sticky fluid, tempting Senators with an ear for the common man with bribes for "the common good".\n\nThus, the Goldwater administration now sets its sights on Senators and their past and present affiliations. They can take care of snooping around for "conflicts of interest" with trade unions; an incensed public will do the bludgeoning for the President."

 USA_gld_68_observe_union_election_procedures_desc: "Socialists, miscreant hypocrites that they are, would sooner make misguided martyrs out of themselves before they would even consider participating fairly and in good faith in any election. One need only look at the first hundred years since it crawled out of Marx's orifices to make patterns: Agitators, bomb throwers, harassers, vandals, reds and blacks sweeping over paralyzed nations in a tidal wave, causing the fall of empires and the suffering of millions. In democracies, that wave tended to strike on Election Day.\n\nPresident Goldwater knows the unions will do their skulduggery leading up to the elections, and has drawn plans with Director Hoover to nip their rituals before they can unleash October surprises of their own."

 USA_gld_68_deal_with_widespread_corruption_desc: "One of the key pillars of union support, the President long realized, is the Senate itself. To be specific, certain Senators in... "labor-friendly" states, in a manner of speaking. Lamentably, even statesmen of such caliber are not immune to pecuniary concerns -- and it is these concerns which bosses of ill-begotten wealth and renown offer to ameliorate. For a price, of course; after all, it is only fair for a man to ask compensation of equal value to his services.\n\nAnd so, with bare-naked bribes conducted behind doors, the reprehensible are shielded against justice's otherwise terrible reproach by a bulwark of pocket-bulging Congressmen. President Goldwater believes addressing this, with the hammer of public opinion if need be, takes precedence over other concerns."

 USA_gld_68_the_senators_payroll_desc: "No American likes to vote for someone whose actions go against their conscience, else they would not have flocked to those who present themselves as capable whilst without sin. An ideal world might grant their wishful thinking some physical manifestation; alas, no man in this sinful Earth is rid of it, not completely. And politicians, as centuries of human history has demonstrated, tend to bear more sins than any other man, in pursuit of their coveted positions. Senators are no different in this respect.\n\nIn most cases their reputation is their first and only bulwark against the truth, yet one which has proved its resilience time after time. But with the right attack ads -- messy, unglamorous, dishonorable attack ads -- at the right occasion, a skillful man can bypass this bulwark and illuminate these hidden sins for all of America to see."

 USA_gld_68_public_gift_registries_desc: "Nothing angers the American more than knowing that their Congressman-elect has reneged on their promises in pursuit of dirty bribes... So what is there for a faultless man to hide? Surely innate righteousness would compel such a man to set matters straight the moment an avenue to prove his innocence lays open for him. For public officials, a tally of gifts and donations laid bare before their constituents is just that: An avenue to absolve the faultless from blame and sift out the corrupt from their hallowed ranks.\n\nPresident Goldwater believes the idea has merit, and plans to implement it forthwith. That it also impacts labor unions and their allies in Congress is pure coincidence -- a happy coincidence, but coincidence regardless."
 USA_gld_68_corruption_in_congress: "Corruption in Congress"
 USA_gld_68_corruption_in_congress_desc: "President Goldwater's ongoing campaign against the labor unions' influence in Capitol Hill has lit somewhat of a fire within the rank-and-file. Not a day passes without eagle-eyed staffers carefully scouring over documents and testimonies, ensuring every "i" is dotted, every "t" crossed and every check given to and received by every Congresscritter within the capital accounted for. Surprisingly, a good number of the accused don't even have ties to labor unions at all!\n\nThese recent developments indicate a slow, seemingly inevitable shift in scope: From a crusade against union lobbying to a crusade against Congressional avarice itself. Unexpected indeed... but not unwelcome, believes the President. Certain options may have revealed themselves as a result, and it would not do to overlook them simply because they were unaccounted for at first."

Let the Democrats have their reckless progress, and the National Progressives their utter lack of any such principles -- a hundred years ago the Republicans preached the virtue of limited and moral government, and God willing it shall still preach so a hundred years from now. Such is the respect by which virtuous men regard their time-proven principles, and the extent to which their words are fully practiced.\n\nAs a Republican with principle, President Goldwater's noble crusade against base corruption shall not discriminate by party affiliation, nor by any category for that matter. Under the eyes of God and Lady Justice, this he swore, shall all men be equally judged."

By the several dozenth report on an exchange of sums between a defense contractor and a swing district Representative -- a Republican-Democrat, no less! -- the President was further convinced in his belief that his own party is no stranger to the very rot that clings at the underside of Capitol Hill's marble columns.\n\nThe American people deserve an honest government, a trustworthy government, a government that walks its talk no matter what. Not even the desperate pleas of his fellow Republican-Democrats will deter President Goldwater from making the moral choice; after all, is that not what any man who so cherishes his values should do?"

 USA_gld_68_blame_the_republicans_desc: "Were it not for the extenuating circumstances America had found itself in after the Second World War, the Republicans would not have seen any need to caucus with the Democratic Party. In better days, good Republican sons would have thought their Democrat counterparts and the National Progressives one and the same: Profiteering tyrants with a frantic need to spread their perversions of liberty and justice from east to west. Somehow it seemed fitting that these two parties, so alike one another in policy, also share the same visceral need to buy with money what they cannot buy in the ballot box.\n\nAny further moves against half the President's government will certainly make tumultuous ripples in America's already-fragile politics. As ever, the President remains steadfast to the course he has charted."
 USA_gld_68_nationwide_corruption: "Nationwide Corruption"
 USA_gld_68_nationwide_corruption_desc: "America's corruption, President Goldwater believes, is no longer the sole domain of any one party, race, or faith. It has grown with the country and its times, from the stranglehold of old England's noble elites to the stranglehold of the bosses of Tammany Hall; from the humble favor traded between neighbors to the million-dollar briefcases handed from profiteer to politician with the secrecy one would expect from the Manhattan than from anyone else. Corruption has seeped so deeply into America's cultural milieu that all its people, in some way or another, are complicit in its continued survival.\n\nSuch a dismal state of affairs cannot, must not be ignored any longer. To this effect, the President aims to extend his crusade against corruption beyond the Beltway until every government office in America feels its expiatory touch."

 USA_gld_68_its_going_down_desc: "After months of undeterred audits and hearings, contravening both alliances of convenience and pessimistic expectations, the Goldwater administration is finally at the cusp of concluding its great crusade against government corruption. In such a short span of time the country had borne witness to thousands of officials sacked, billions of dollars found missing, and lofty reputations from all colors of the political spectrum dragged ignominiously into the mud. Few were spared justice as the federal government exercised its powers to their uppermost limit in order to accomplish what other administrations could not.\n\nPresident Goldwater now stands atop the rubble he had gouged off America's latest party system, despised and praised in equal measure. Only time will tell if history judges his deeds worthy of proper reward."

 USA_gld_68_this_should_dig_them_down_deep_desc: "Despite the language he employs, President Goldwater takes care not to lose sight of his original goal. Taken to his own rhetoric he may be, but the President's campaign began, first and foremost, to strike against the trade unions and their copper-laden grip over a sizable chunk of Congress. His personal misgivings with the Democratic half of the country's ruling coalition must not interfere with the ultimate goal of striking at the labor unions' greatest ally in the Beltway: The National Progressive Pact.\n\nThe crusade shall continue regardless, but the White House now exerts more effort on denouncing NPP Congressmen than his own party's for their sins. Several voices may cry foul at the barely perceptible shift, but their complaints are meaningless noise compared to the golden chance now before him."

Who, if not its mindless peons, throw themselves unto barricades and innocent masses in the name of these rackets -- treason and sedition all but the handicapped can recognize without conscious thought?\n\nFires cannot be fought if their tinder and kindling are ample in mass. The President believes the NPP, now or never, must be treated for what it truly is: Tinder and kindling for the rampant inferno of trade unionism come to sweep America to a conflagrant fate."

These witch hunts in all but name have supported the President's righteous crusade since its inception... but there have been times where their zeal becomes something of an obstacle for his plans.\n\nTake, for example, the Democrats affiliated with trade unions themselves. While questionable in their preferences, the organizations they endorse are proven clean and above board by the intelligence community; regardless, the American people have been quick to accuse these Congressmen of the same corruption that typifies the NPP. For the good of the coalition and sensibility, the White House shall disabuse the public of their preconceptions before they commit to worse actions."

Never throughout the whole campaign have they once been revealed to have stooped as low as the liberals and progressives in achieving their political ambitions. Whereas the NPP were beaten bloody over their illicit affairs with trade unions, the Republicans and (to a slightly less extent) the Democrats shone like diamond-studded gold, unblemished and untarred.\n\nWhatever the repercussions may arise from the campaign, American conservatism has surely won from it a triumph worth celebrating for a good long time. Three hurrahs for common sense and tradition!"

After all, decisions which change the lives of millions never come without benefits and drawbacks, and not treating them with the gravity reserved for dilemmas enables decisions that can easily undo centuries of sound governance in a fraction of the time. These dilemmas are uncomfortable to face, albeit a necessary discomfort for good policymaking.\n\nAt present, President Goldwater faces one such dilemma in the form of some... unregistered gifts, just uncovered by some curious government auditors. Would if they belonged to the hawks; alas, their receipts bore the names of elephants and donkeys instead. Perhaps hard times call for hard decisions...?"

It is the greatest compromise American politics has witnessed -- for two foes locking horns since before the Civil War to dispense of their enmities and join hands says more than enough of their earnest belief in the country's long-term future. A complement which hardly applies to the Frankenstein of an opposition that seeks to counter their every move in Congress.\n\nValues shine brightest in times of adversity, and through their partnership the Republican-Democrats have demonstrated values worth fostering in the country's otherwise decrepit and lackadaisical politics. President Goldwater sees no need to disturb this relationship by bandying empty accusations over their income."
 USA_gld_68_the_big_bad: "The Big Bad"

The sharp edges of its manyfold jagged teeth glimmer as daggers against pale moonlight, ready to sink deep into fair Columbia's unsuspecting flesh and veins. What sort of beast must it be that it can bear its terrible implements with little in either recognition or repercussion from America's God-fearing folk!\n\nFortunately, this red-tainted beast is not as invulnerable as it is terrifying. The American people united can be fashioned into a sword that strikes true at its heart, made sharper with whetstones of knowledge. President Goldwater plans to seek out notable actors to fashion such whetstones with their wit and charisma -- and as if by Providence's command, one promising Ronald Reagan has immediately answered his call..."
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio: "The AFL-CIO"
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio_desc: "The AFL-CIO has reigned supreme over the quiltwork of American unions ever since their Faustian merger in the mid-fifties. In the frightable perceptions of your lay American, this "national union" controls a nationwide network of bosses, bribes and vassals from their velvet chairs in Washington, like puppet masters toying with the marionette strings of their servile dolls.\n\nThis, of course, cannot be any further from the truth. The union today operates as its constituent parts have always had since the age of letter and telegram: A cartel of organizations that have given the country's labor geographical bounds, organizing them into territories for each to rule as they see fit. With the symbol they present, and the cracks they offer unawares, President Goldwater has made it his ambition to split this beast into pieces before he leaves office."

The President may represent the American people, but his Constitutionally-mandated lawyer represents America as a whole in courtrooms both foreign and domestic. His words carry the weight of a bicentennial superpower, and the targets of his ire become unwilling volunteers for demonstrations of its sheer resources and patience...\n\n...Which is why enlisting his help is crucial for the task at hand. By preparing a scathing report against the AFL-CIO, packed with all the dirt the FBI can get its hands on, President Goldwater will have all the excuse he needs to file a ruinous lawsuit against America's most malignant union."

But it is in such despair where pinpricks of earnest truth shine brightest, giving hearts the strength to lift their burdens one day more.\n\nPresident Goldwater's greatest weapon against the AFL-CIO is just that: Earnest, naked truth. He has faith it will carry him through better than Director Hoover's increasingly hairbrained schemes, at least."

On the contrary, most he thought of had him eating crow as the Supreme Court shoots his case down in front of national television and two hundred million pairs of eyes. This paled, of course, to the worst case scenario: Hoover's boys getting caught where they shouldn't, kicking off yet another political meltdown so soon after the Nixon scandal.\n\nSo in his wisdom, he decided to stick with the arguments he's absolutely certain will make a compelling case. All white collar crimes and old boys' networks, only sparking interest because of a fresh coat of red paint. Much less glamorous than smoking guns, but leagues safer and ironclad regardless."

 USA_gld_68_the_constitution_demands_it_desc: "In his eyes, President Goldwater saw himself as nothing less than a devoted adherent to America's Constitution. And why shouldn't he be? The document is the bedrock atop which the nation is built, the basis of its core essence and distinctive character. The crystallization of the Founders' hopes and dreams, the fruit of their effort, their last gift to their children, that they may live and die free -- to deviate from it is nothing less than heresy against America itself.\n\nWith the rise of socialism, more have strayed away from America and into heresy. Any good American would be incensed at their gall, but only the greatest few would rise above as the Constitution calls loud for aid. Let her government's people be assured: They have placed their trust in one such great few last Election Day, and he shall not shirk from it."

For a feat as big as bringing the AFL-CIO down, nothing's ever enough for him.\n\nFactor in the FBI, however, and... well, he'll have a bigger shot in bringing them down, at least. And wasn't it said that fortune most favored the bold?"

Disposable, nondescript -- no less a John Q. Public than the civilian beside them -- and devoted to the crusade, the Director's pawns will see to it that America will wake up with news of socialist skulduggery conveniently unearthed.\n\nIf nothing else, all good Americans can have a chuckle over seeing 'self-made men' become undone by... self-made evidence, suppose to say."

They carry themselves with the grace and good manners that befit their well-maintained clothing and unblemished countenance; again, unlike the unwashed masses that compose their 'fraternal comrades'.\n\nSuch differences have contributed to an underlying tension among the two, though until now their mutual antipathy against the current state of things has prevented it from becoming an ignorable issue. President Goldwater believes there is merit in exploiting the AFL's hypocrisies in full view of the American people, both to galvanize his cause's support and undermine theirs."

Fueled as they are by base, narrow-minded desire, it is a wonder how they were able to organize at all.\n\nThe President will not offer the CIO the same leniency he does to their 'fraternal comrades'.

 #Left Side Descs.
 USA_gld_68_the_american_nature_desc: "America's lush, fertile lands are blessed by God Himself. From the thunderous roars of Niagara Falls' waters to the Grand Canyon's towering ravines, not one inch of America's three thousand-mile length lacks in the divine beauty envied by men and sung by its poets. Its forests, its waters, its hills and fields and mountains -- our nation's natural plenty is and should be an object of pride for those fortunate to call these their own.\n\nYet men still seek to imperil America's pristine majesties with misdeeds to sate their own greed; much of them, in fact, are companies with the gall to call themselves Americans. President Goldwater may be an ardent believer in free enterprise, but above all he is the democratically elected steward of the Lord's most beautiful creation. No burden is too heavy, nor cost too great, against their defense from the corrupting tendrils of mankind's pollution."
 USA_gld_68_the_yellowstone_speech_desc: "What first comes to mind when President Goldwater thinks of America's natural beauty is the mighty, watery bellows of Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful. The ancient caldera's most famous geyser forcefully ejects jets of superheated water from Earth to Heaven, seeming to all and sundry like a wrathful pillar from the Old Testament. Yet for all its awe-inspiring power, Old Faithful and its adjunct supervolcano is helpless against the clouds of industrial smoke that clog its airs, or against the heaps of scrap metal that defile its lands and waters.\n\nThe President feels it is only fitting to announce his next great effort before such a strong, yet helpless creation -- for is that not what now best describes American nature?"
 USA_gld_68_the_enviromental_protection_agency_desc: "Despite his support for the states' constitutional rights, President Goldwater acknowledges that some responsibilities are too extensive for any one state to handle themselves. Aside from interstate commerce and foreign policy, he also believes environmental protection is a burden only the federal government can guaranteeably shoulder. Thus, a hypothetical "Environmental Protection Agency" will better harness the country's will towards the stewardship of its natural bounty than the quiltwork, often underfunded programs of its individual states.\n\nThe President has directed his staff to draft plans for such an agency, keeping in mind the likelihood that Congress and its lobbyists will approve of it. If they won't, then... well, the White House will cross that bridge in good time."
 USA_gld_68_anti_corruption_measures_desc: "It is said that Congressmen convene in Capitol Hill to vote bills into law, but convene on the backrooms of K Street to draft and plan them. Meanwhile, the big names of the donor circles would hover by Senators and Representatives' shoulders to ensure that these bills satisfy, or at least do not affect overmuch, their paymasters' bottom lines. An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them. He seeks ways to instead sideline them with corruption charges long before they inevitably become obstacles standing between the EPA bill and the Resolute Desk."
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_legal_possibilities_desc: "Good lawmakers know what provisions their bills can cover without running afoul of already established precedents. To the dismay of American environmentalists, we've had nearly two centuries of precedent in allowing our captains of industry to dismantle the country's forests and pollute its waters for the sake of progress. This trend had suffered somewhat in President Roosevelt's heyday, but not to the point where environmental legislation can pass through Congress without heavy opposition.\n\nNevertheless, President Goldwater has begun consulting his most trusted advisors regarding the EPA bill's shape. At this time, Secretary Regan and Vice President Judd hold conflicting opinions over how much power the new agency should have to fulfill its mandate."
 USA_gld_68_expand_the_national_parks_desc: "President Grant had made the prescient decision to set aside a parcel of America's thousands of square miles from civilization in 1872. Since then, the registry of the now-named National Parks have been updated 31 more times. These vast natural preserves are the jewels of our country's natural beauty, filled with flora and fauna only their ecosystems can support... but as it is the law recognizes only 32. We have much more than that.\n\nLet the damn fool Republicans, Democrats, and National Progressives call him a tree-hugging hippie as much as they like, but President Goldwater will gladly draw money from the budget to protect more square miles, enroll more of America's natural wonders into the registry of National Parks."
 USA_gld_68_increase_national_park_funding_desc: "We may pass however many environmental acts we wish, but the trees and fish won't care any less for the borders we set, or for the penalties we enforce. Governments will hence always have a need for people to uphold its ordinances involving its voiceless, unheeding domains.\n\nThe good men and women of the National Park Service are assigned this important task for all laws related to its special preserves. Like all federal agencies, the NPS needs money from Congress to do its job well. The White House feels they need the cash injection more than most, and has drafted this year's budget with the National Parks' proper protection and management well in mind."
 USA_gld_68_the_clean_water_act_desc: "Clean water is more than just water to safely drink. Clean water is water free of metals and plastics, for to water our farms and let breathe our fishes. Clean water is water free of taint, giving whatever landscape it courses a beautiful trail of shimmering blue. Clean water is water unblemished by the hands of men, made closer to Providence for its existence alone. It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully. He will not find many allies in Congress for this purpose -- the left prefer their handouts uncompromised by nature's laments, whereas the right bleat about yet another of a million supposed federal overreaches -- but the President himself remains undeterred over his commitment to walking life's narrow gate."
 USA_gld_68_send_it_through_congress_desc: "After weeks of compromising, appeasing, negotiating and strongarming, the National Environmental Policy Act is finally ready to be voted upon in both houses of Congress. For a bill with just as much bipartisan opposition as bipartisan support, the passage of one of President Goldwater's major pieces of legislation is by no means certain according to observers and insider information.\n\n...When asked about his outlook for the law's fate, the President said that he "will personally see to the enactment of a greener America's herald, no matter the cost...""
 USA_gld_68_a_green_future_desc: "History is wont to write hagiographies of its great men one moment and hurl diatribes of their failings the next. One need look no further than the esteemed line of Presidents to see this phenomenon in question: According to literature, George Washington was both America's beloved pater patriae and a slave owning tyrant. These very same books lift Abraham Lincoln up as a paragon of American virtue, at the same time denouncing his heavy handed suppression of American freedoms under the duress of war.\n\nDecades from now, Barry Goldwater will meet their inevitable judgement like the Presidents before him. What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages. But it was equally likely that the Goldwater they paint will resemble a tree-hugging dictator more than a civilized man.\n\nWith a swig, Barry emptied his mug before forcing his attention towards other Presidential matters. He can mull over his reputation after he gets out of office. For now, America has an infestation of extremists to exterminate."
 USA_gld_68_shady_measures_desc: "One morning, when Regan was exchanging barbs with the Federal Reserve in the Treasury Building, McNamara was crunching his numbers in the Pentagon with Curtis, and Judd was calming long-time Republican donors in some fancy restaurant in downtown DC, Director Hoover made his appearance in the Oval Office with a modest proposal tucked in his underarm. Washington's own kingmaker was straightforward enough: If President Goldwater required the FBI's help in uncovering "compromising information" about America's extremists, then he need only ask.\n\nIn better times, the Director's offer would merit a warning shot for its sheer unconstitutionality. On the other hand, it would sure be nice to see the country's miscreants behind bars before they poison its politics any further. Maybe ratfuckery is slightly more tolerable if it's for a good cause...?"
 USA_gld_68_IRS_audits_desc: "Al Capone's sprawling empire of bootleggers and mafiosos went under not because of his misdeeds as head of the infamous Chicago Outfit, but because of a record of tax evasion sniffed out by none other than the Internal Revenue Service. Say what you will about America's pencil-pushing tax collectors, but they must have done something right if they were able to accomplish what so many commissioners either can't or won't.\n\nPresident Goldwater aims to use the IRS as a weapon like in the Prohibition, but against America's domestic enemies this time around. Targeted investigations over extremists' finances will eventually trip over a case of fraud, evasion or embezzlement, giving us all the excuse we need to shut their gatherings down when we see them."
 USA_gld_68_create_blacklists_desc: ""To curtail the influence of extremism in the United States, the President has approved a confidential record of persons with confirmed or suspected links to extremist groups. The names in this watchlist shall be kept under heightened surveillance by the appropriate law enforcement agencies -- that means us, by the way -- in order to evaluate the risk they pose to the government and the American people at large through their activities."\n\n"All evidence gathered from enforcement of the watchlist are deemed admissible under court. Under threat of expulsion and a minimum sentence of ten years, agents aware of the watchlist are forbidden from confirming its existence to the general public until or unless the President himself deems it necessary...""
 USA_gld_68_suppress_there_votes_arrest_there_leaders_desc: "We've gathered enough material from the first few names in President Goldwater's new watchlist to issue warrants for their arrest with a healthy degree of plausible deniability on our part. Seeing the program's overwhelming success, he has encouraged the FBI to expand the list with the names it's comfortable going after.\n\nIf everything goes as planned, then American extremism will eventually be found only within the grey bar hotel, kept far away from the rest of society."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_socialists_desc: "Fascism may be one of America's most hated enemies, but it is also among its youngest. In due time the inefficiencies of such an embryonic ideology will manifest, and its adherents will be swept like sand onto history's dustbin by waves of either reform or revolution. For the empire of liberty's ancient ideals, fascism is merely a twinkle it is destined to outlast.\n\nThe same cannot be said for its other nemesis. Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American Presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut. President Goldwater sees no reason to abandon this responsibility."
 USA_gld_68_ostracize_the_far_left_desc: "American politics is built from the bottom up in compromise. The system that has supported American politics since independence was thus also built to work only when compromise is observed and good faith assumed by all parties. Conversely, a few bad actors can send the government into a screeching halt with filibusters and quorums.\n\nFor the President, none fit the title of "bad actor" better than the opposition's ardent leftists. No middle ground can be found with men who stubbornly insist on wholesale nationalizations, state-funded bribery, and other such reckless, pie-in-the-sky policies. Nevermind Judd's advice -- America's better off if these men were excluded from its politics altogether!"
 USA_gld_68_infiltrate_the_NPP_leftists_desc: "In their reckless push for relevance, the schizophrenic coalition called the NPP has taken to accepting anyone who at the very least harbors a strong antipathy for the Japanese Empire. Its leftist subfaction appends the party's already loose membership criteria with a pathological love for socialism in any of its shades; so long as one loves Marx and hates Japan, in other words, they are free to wear the gold eagle wherever they go.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for the President to exploit: By sending plainclothes to join their ranks, digging for dirt becomes as easy as attending a rally. The information they extract will have much use in his hands, whether as "informed predictions" or... something markedly less pleasant."
 USA_gld_68_an_anti_socialist_education_desc: "The biases and beliefs we hold to our graves coalesce in the classrooms of our youth, hardening with age. Because a nation has such a narrow window to enculture its children with a shared identity, school curricula emphasize civic education as early as grade school or their equivalent thereof.\n\nSimilar logic applies to reinforcing their worldview from certain ideologies -- a man taught to steer away from socialism's allure in his childhood is less inclined to join protests and vote for socialist-friendly politicians than one whose tryst with it began in college. Consequently, inoculating the nation's youth from socialism entails enforcing anti-socialist curricula in all levels of education. This is a mission the President is all too happy to undertake."
 USA_gld_68_a_media_firestorm_desc: "If rumors are faster than the speed of light, then the only object faster than rumors themselves are rumors fed with kompromat. Additionally, the blazing trail they leave behind is enough to engulf entire worlds with a conflagration that ends only when the last atom of oxygen is fed to the fires.\n\nUp until now, President Goldwater had seen no need to liken himself to a slash-and-burn farmer. But with the overabundance of kudzu threatening to cover all ten million of America's square miles with a thick, suffocating layer of red leaves... well, he imagines Cronkite will spend a whole day thinking of a good lede for some of the scoops Hoover's boys digged up."
 USA_gld_68_conservatism_reigns_supreme_desc: "To the glee of President Goldwater's fellow conservatives, socialism has taken a bloody beating across all fronts of American life since he began his not-so-discreet war. Their reputations tarnished, their bases starved of new blood and their ideas thoroughly discredited, the NPP's leftists and their fellow travellers have either retreated from the public sphere or left our shores for more hospitable climes.\n\nThe President's party members have celebrated his victory with triumphant speeches and extravagant dinners throughout the Beltway. Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently "despite (his) traitorous heritage" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good. The President has merely done his part, and all he can do now is hope the American people will maintain vigilance for its impending return."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_yockeys_desc: "Socialism may be an old enemy of the American way, but even a conservative can admit that both ideologies agree to some extent on the value of freedom and the rights of man. These similarities make socialism familiar -- comforting even -- to many Americans, for all its faults. However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."
 USA_gld_68_wiretap_yockey_desc: "Francis Parker Yockey is, to put mildly, fascism's messiah in the United States. Despite the hate -- in some cases, because of the hate -- that leaves his mouth as spittle, he has garnered himself a steadily-growing base of disaffected Americans from all walks of life, all willing to hear his proffered solutions to their many problems. Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from FBI infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_kkk_desc: "By 1960, the infamous cross-burning lynch mob had dwindled from its peak of six million in the Roaring Twenties to several thousand at best, united only by their opposition to the civil rights movement. Nevertheless, the word of Klansmen have hefty weight still in the sympathetic South, and they continue to terrorize unimpeded the lives of families throughout the Black Belt.\n\nWith rumors saying that the Imperial Wizard had professed his support for Yockey's burgeoning movement, President Goldwater now has an alibi to justify going after them in front of his advisors. All he now needs is a convincing enough excuse to lock them up for life..."
 USA_gld_68_dig_up_evidence_desc: "There must be something inherent to an extremist's mindset, President Goldwater wondered, that not only inclined them towards hypocrisy but also shielded their worldview from the dissonance it causes. The latest dispatch from Hoover's agents only confirmed his suspicions. Why else would a tablecloth parade founded in direct opposition to the evil that is respect for your black compatriots apparently enjoy their ebony as much as any hot-blooded teenager with a roaming imagination?\n\nPersonally, he couldn't care less about the smut some lynching schmuck consumes. The folks around him, on the other hand -- friends, family, Southerners, National Progressives? They probably will."
 USA_gld_68_crack_down_on_fascism_desc: "It was pitch black in the White House when the phone rang. Director Hoover's gravely voice carried through the receiver as pried-awake Barry Goldwater picked it up.\n\nHe reported that he had finished gathering every last speck of dirt on Yockey and his surprisingly wide network of donors, advisors, henchmen and advocates. The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep. The covers felt a touch softer than usual that night."
 USA_gld_68_america_is_no_friend_of_fascism_desc: "Watching America's fascists implode from the distance gave President Goldwater no small helping of satisfaction. How they hobbled into Congress with dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes, making like cornered hyenas whenever their fellow critter passed by; how they delivered yesterday's stump speeches with sore throats and a fraction of the energy; how they sat next to one another as if they were bunkmates with Satan himself... the debacle that had played itself out in the days and weeks after was what he'd asked for and more.\n\nAlmost fittingly, Yockey was nowhere to be found. So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."
 USA_gld_68_an_america_free_of_extremists_desc: "Barry Goldwater knew he had accomplished his mission not through some flashy watershed moment, but through normalcy's gradual return.\n\nTorn off a hefty chunk of their misfits, the NPP had finally stabilized itself into a rock-steady opposition with more in common with each other beyond foreign policy. Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice. With the knowledge that his calls had cured American politics of a potent, fatal poison? Barry slept like a newborn babe."
 #Wallace Response Tree
 USA_gld_68_WAL_Cleaning_Up_Wallaces_Mess_desc: "In his fall from grace, Wallace also brought down a great many others with him to the pits of damnation. America's repute, as dragged along the mud as his shameful, forceful departure from the White House. America's trust, surely shattered like so many windowpanes in Washington after the riots subsided. America's faith in its noble ideals, forever tarnished by the scandals many had thought are beneath the hallowed office of presidency.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] now takes his place, immediately burdened with the ashes Wallace had left behind in his dogged quest to burn America down. Violence soars to a fever pitch, vigilantes run amok unopposed, green numbers turn red and falter and dip. None envy his position, yet everyone hopes against all hope that the last of America's dwindling old guard can bring peace where the Presidents before him cannot."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_The_civil_rights_dilemma_desc: "It has existed since the times of the Founders, lasting centuries of dizzying change without having changed itself. By its name America has seen blood spilled, families torn apart, loyalties and lands rent in twain, grudges etched into aged, unforgiving stone. In or against its pursuit America had been laid to its lowest point a century ago; not a few days ago, America teetered dangerously close to a deeper nadir, stopped only by quick action.\n\nAmerica has had enough. The people have had enough. Blood shall be spilled no longer. Peace shall be restored, ancient enmities resolved, bonds of brotherhood reforged. One way or another, civil rights must be resolved now, lest brother fight brother once more."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_putting_out_the_fire_desc: "Wallace's fiery descent left behind infernos that had quickly taken hold in all parties. Disorganized by the ongoing chaos, America's momentarily paralyzed politics can only try to douse its own fires -- or wait it out -- however it can before resuming normal governance.\n\nAs head of their own party, the President is obliged to take the charge not only in restoring order nationwide, but also in mending the party's burn wounds. Only when recovery has begun will they be able to return in a condition to represent the American people once more."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_calm_the_conservatives_desc: "Now that Wallace is evicted from office, people have taken to blame America's conservatives for his accession. Coupled with the reinvigorated debate on civil rights, and the conservative movement now finds itself both beleaguered from the progressives' renewed attacks and weakened from the infighting that characterized the terminal stage of the Wallace administration.\n\nThe President knows their hearts are in the right place, and that they feel remorse over having enabled such a disastrous presidency. By calming them down with token concessions in civil rights, the President will remove a major source of concern for American conservatives, in turn making them more amenable to cooperation."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_silence_the_progressives_desc: "The American left were more vocal in their opposition to Wallace than its right -- they possessed both the prescience to glimpse the inevitable state of his presidency and the will to defy him at every turn. After having been proven right, they both celebrated his downfall and loudly reminded everyone that they were right.\n\nThe President agrees with them with Wallace and other things besides -- but now is not an appropriate time to act smug. Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow. For the time being, the President will reproach the progressives and their allies in private, and ask them to desist until we get things in better order."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_speak_with_both_sides_desc: "By some miracle, the left and right have finally calmed down. The heavy tension that had undergirded sessions after Wallace's impeachment has faded away, now replaced by the familiar vitriol exchanged by adversaries on a regular basis. Barbs may now flow freely in Capitol Hill, but no longer do Congressmen spend hours worrying over gridlock instead of running the country.\n\nWhile cooler heads prevail, the President seeks to better bring both houses of Congress into order. A few more visits and promises might just be enough to achieve this before the rest of the government falls into similar dysfunction."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_stomp_out_the_remaining_backlash_desc: "One way or another, America must resolve its civil rights dilemma before it can ever move on to verdant pastures. Thus, after months of deliberation, the President has chosen to side with the nation's progressives in their onwards march to a promising future.\n\nNot all musings went to the appeal of righting past injustices, however. Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself. Care must be taken to subdue these voices before they coalesce into a dagger aimed at our throats."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_focus_on_the_true_evils_desc: "Despite our manifold differences, every party in America's political landscape unanimously agrees that the nation's evils pale in comparison to the atrocities orchestrated by Germany and Japan, past and present. It is no exaggeration to attest that hatred of fascism binds the Union together as good as glue to sheets of paper. Which beast to prioritize is a point of contention, but progressive, moderate and conservative alike will shed no tears for either tyrant's inevitable downfall.\n\nReminding all Americans of this shared antipathy may be necessary to reorient the ship of state amidst the stormy waves of today's discordant times."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_new_america_desc: ""America's story has been conceived as a tale of mankind's desire for freedom triumphing against the New World's dangers and the Old World's ancient blood feuds. Our nation, as the poets told it, is shining city atop a hill whose shores teem with men from all walks of life and all corners of the Earth, blessed with the chance to craft new names and lives for them and theirs. Yet as the dark deeds done unto the colored man are brought to light, America stands in shock as they witness how far our beloved myth diverges from stark reality."\n\n"Wallace's ugly downfall must not be wasted, for his ousting unveils a rare opportunity to break from our ugly past and enter the warm light of renewal. I stand before you today with the fullest confidence that a new America, one that shall strive truer to its founding principles than it has ever been, has arrived in earnest...""
 USA_gld_68_WAL_sign_the_civil_rights_act_desc: "It had taken no small amount of goodwill and political capital, but the President has gathered enough support in Congress to finally push the Civil Rights Act through the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nNow this piece of tumultuous legislation lies atop the Resolute Desk, smaller than its many drafts have ever been, and accompanied by somewhat muted jubilation within the Oval Office. All it awaits is a handful of strokes, etched in black fountain ink, by the highest office in the land to become ironclad law."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_addressing_the_situation_at_hand_desc: "Ironically, Wallace did himself and his supporters little favors by attempting to reverse what progress America had made in civil rights. He sought to reignite the American people's passions towards a great crusade against tyrannical government, but in doing so had also inflamed the ire of those who saw past his bluster and civil veneer. He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead became the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights. The task of bringing Congress to accord over this issue will not be easy, but neither will the President shirk from it."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_those_who_live_in_a_glass_house_desc: "Having seen a future of glass houses, the inhabitants of the house that is America were quick to trade old timber with the beauty of glass. Now glass chandeliers dangle from its glass ceilings, glass balustrades flank the sides of glass staircases, glass doors complement glass doorways with engravings etched on glass. Now one misstep can also cause a tragic cascade of shattered crystals, digging deep onto its master's flesh and causing all sorts of other terrible harms. Much as some would like to trade glass for timber, others clamor for the glass to stay.\n\nThe progressives would take care to know that America is now a glass house. They may speak out of a genuine desire to ail the American people's suffering, but they are no less affected than the rest of us if the American house shatters from a misstep."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_should_not_throw_stones_desc: "Having seen a future of glass houses, the inhabitants of the house that is America were quick to trade old timber with the beauty of glass. Now glass chandeliers dangle from its glass ceilings, glass balustrades flank the sides of glass staircases, glass doors complement glass doorways with engravings etched on glass. Now one misstep can also cause a tragic cascade of shattered crystals, digging deep onto its master's flesh and causing all sorts of other terrible harms. Much as some would like to trade glass for timber, others clamor for the glass to stay.\n\nThe conservatives should take care to know that America is now a glass house. The American people seek assurement that its officials-elect know how to manage their new home, and there is no better time than the present for them to wield their vaunted wisdom and maturity."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_but_stones_we_must_throw_desc: "Having seen a future of glass houses, the inhabitants of the house that is America were quick to trade old timber with the beauty of glass. Now glass chandeliers dangle from its glass ceilings, glass balustrades flank the sides of glass staircases, glass doors complement glass doorways with engravings etched on glass. Now one misstep can also cause a tragic cascade of shattered crystals, digging deep onto its master's flesh and causing all sorts of other terrible harms. Much as some would like to trade glass for timber, others clamor for the glass to stay.\n\nYet perhaps we should take the risky step regardless. Never before had the glass house been tested for its durability, and despite our misgivings such a test is necessary to assess its future. Let us desist, then, from delaying the long-coming test any further."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_addressing_the_opposition_desc: "President Goldwater may have opposed Wallace's blatant disregard for the rule of law, but in his heart of hearts he believes at least some of the man's vitriol is justified. After all, what well-meaning citizen won't at least feel irritation upon perusing the unconstitutional drivel marketed to cleanse the nation of an original sin? It is telling that millions of Americans still listened to Wallace's firebrand speeches at the height of his reign of terror -- in point of fact, much of the country preferred the despicable man over his equally-despicable progressive nemeses.\n\nLet not history regard Barry Goldwater as a politician devoid of principle. He shall approach his fellow conservatives in the Republican-Democrats in frank dialogue over civil rights these coming days, no matter the frantic calls for "party unity"."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_keep_calm_and_carry_on_desc: "As expected, the left's response has submerged American discourse with their empty, rhetorical outrage. These unwitting agents of tyrants, perhaps out of desperation, saw fit to snuff out the light of conservatism -- for it pierces the dulling fog and reveals their sinister designs. On they have come, a rolling tide of bloody crimson come to crash against the weathered cliffs that house an ivory tower, last of its make, blazing bright with reason.\n\nBut stone is mighty and strong, unflinching despite the hardships of trial.

Circumstance has repeatedly shown the American people's lack of interest over advancing the nation's so-called "civil rights". The ensuing backlash gave birth to the man-shaped debacle that is George Wallace, wreaking havoc on our venerable, yet fragile institutions. And so did America withstand years of stagnation and humiliation for a cause its citizenry does not condone.\n\nFor President Goldwater, the progressives have crossed the line for the last time. Their maniacal pursuits shall stop, and he shall make this perfectly clear in front of the nation's battered patriots to rouse them into action."

Seemingly emboldened by the disgraceful flight of a mutual enemy, they have since ratcheted their bold-faced demands in Congress and on otherwise peaceful streets and parks -- no doubt in the mistaken assumption that their tricks will work on President Goldwater as well.\n\nLong has he suffered their arrogance and contempt, both in public and in private. He will not, shall nor concede to their ultimatums, their unsaid threats to law and order. For both principles' sakes, Barry will never blink first against the crimson-tinted abyss."

Though his plate is dented and battered he had given neither inch of land and ounce of principle as he picked them apart piece by snivelling piece. His love for Godly value and virtue has overcome human weariness, and in so doing mustered the strength to drive evil back from our freedom-loving land once more...\n\n"With all the gratitude he can muster, this humble editor congratulates our President for his latest triumph in Capitol Hill. May the Good Lord bless the rest of his term!"\n\n-- The Charleston Mercury"

He must know how to own up to mistakes as ably as he accept recognition for success, lest the world see only the fatal hubris of egoists in him.\n\nIn his weaker moments President Goldwater wonders whether people see greatness or hubris in him, despite his accomplishments. He was only human, after all, and not without the preferences and inclinations present in any man. These biases, so to say, make accepting certain facts an exercise not unlike herding rabid cats.\n\nFacts such as the public's reaction to his last veto. He had expected, and did receive, the well-wishes from good Americans, yes. But overall... well, perhaps the reds held more sway than he thought.\n\nBut no matter. Barry hadn't clawed his way into the Presidency by being thin-skinned, or by standing around and doing nothing. The socialists may hem and haw as much as they like, but one way or another America will return to its better days with the Goldwater's guidance."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_securing_americas_future_desc: "Wallace's victims are many, and the extent of his havoc wrought moreso. America's setbacks in bettering its civil rights may be the most notable, so capturing the public's imagination and attention with its violence and rhetoric, but just as aggrieved -- yet given far less attention -- is the dismal state of its education system. Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_refunding_american_schools_desc: "Whether it was an earnest, yet short-sighted attempt to save money or an attack on notable wellsprings of government opposition, few can argue the repercussions of the Wallace administration budget cuts on education: less skilled people entering the workforce, more dropouts who can't get a job, and an unemployment rate steadily ticking upwards with every quarter. In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry. Effective immediately, the President will restore funding for public schools and educational institutions back to their pre-Wallace levels."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_separate_schools_arent_equal_desc: ""Separate but equal," went the mantra Wallace and his cronies unabashedly uttered in front of the American people when they justified strengthening school segregation laws within and without the South. The white man cannot understand the black man fully, so they went, and neither can the black man understand the white man no matter their shared values and patrimony. Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting. Clearly, separating the equal only furthered existing inequalities -- and the President aims to do away with the concept fully, despite the furor the South will raise."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_free_schools_in_the_land_of_the_free_desc: "Wallace had left behind a bloody mess mangled around and about a field of concertina wire. Cleaning it up will take time, and one can never assuredly say that things will go back to the way they were before his reign of terror. Regardless, the worst of the damage is being unwound inch by gory inch.\n\nFew elsewhere does this show more than in reverting his "reforms" to American education. Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves. Like well-oiled gears sprung into motion, the great machine of academia now turns with more rust lost and old smoothness regained with every gyration. If the President has [Root.GetHerHis] way, then this beautiful machine will never rust again."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_no_man_for_states_rights_desc: "The United States is not simply a single entity. Rather, it is a federation of fifty separate states, linked by the chains of perpetual Union through shared identity, and whose unified direction is decided by the consensus of an assembly of elected statesmen. This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_rat_in_sheeps_clothing_desc: "Never before has "states' rights" been so associated with segregation as it is today. As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of "restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny" in the same breath as "keeping the equals separate". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_saving_states_rights_desc: "Rehabilitation is neither easy nor fast, as accident victims can attest. The body needs time to recover from grievous wounds, and even longer to cope with the loss of organ or limb. Only through repeated exercise, and not a little guidance, can a victim perform as well as they used; in some cases, their past performance will forever be lost in the scene of the crime.\n\nRestoring the prestige of states' rights in this nation is no different. With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_dissacoiate_from_wallace_desc: "America's liberals and progressives are prone to boasting that they alone have brought about Wallace's disastrous fall from grace, with their protests and riots. That cannot be any further from the truth. Sure, picket signs and police brutality catch the press's cameras like nothing else -- but what many ignore is the plight of the innocent conservative, who had either did not ask for or had been duped by the duplicity of Alabama's erstwhile favored son.\n\nDecades from now, the next generation will look back at this decade to look for lessons they can apply to their present. America's conservatives will not be found wanting in this regard."
#GOLDWATER'S BILL LOC

 GLD.127.t: "Environmental Protection Agency Founded by Executive Order!"
 GLD.127.desc: "Despite the administration's best intentions, President Goldwater's desire to see Congress approve the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency have failed. Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the President has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the Republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the President's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the President's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe President can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

 GLD.2.t: "A Meeting of the Minds"
 GLD.2.desc: ""It's no secret we have our share of disagreements, Mr. Judd. Press won't stop speculating on how we'll fall out first." The President shifted in his unfamiliar seat. The Oval Office was far more spacious than the one he'd left on Capitol Hill, and was still an unfamiliar space to him. Across from him, Vice President Judd adjusted his glasses and spoke.\n\n"That's what you called me here for, isn't it? To get ahead of any unforeseen issues. I'm sure we won't agree on everything, but every President and Vice President since Eisenhower has needed to deal with that. I can't promise you my support on everything, but I can keep silent on matters that are less offensive to the Republican Party. Such as your opinion on the unions."\n\n"The unions have nothing to fear from me, as long as they stay in touch with what's good for the nation and not just themselves. But let's start with what we can agree on. The parks bill, and the agency I've proposed to deal with environmental issues-"\n\n"You'll have my full support. Now, about the cabinet- most of these choices, Curtis is a fine statesman, and McNamara is certainly qualified enough for the job. But Regan- Regan concerns me. His policies-"\n\n"What changes would you make to this list, Mr. Judd?"\n\n"Excuse me?"\n\n"Regan is non-negotiable. He's critical for securing electoral support from certain special interest groups and frankly I'm inclined to agree with his view of government's role. I'm asking if there's any changes you want. Katzenbach for Attorney General? Give Udall a position? I've worked with him before, I could do it again."\n\nGoldwater handed the folder of lists to the vice President. "I'm not the firebrand they told you I was, Walter. We can work together.""
 GLD.2.a: "The start of a good working relationship."
 GLD.3.t: "A Conservative Cabinet"
 GLD.3.desc: ""Thank you for meeting me on such short notice Walter." Barry Goldwater led his running mate into the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. It was just days after the election, and while the White House was still occupied for a few months yet, it was time to prepare the transition.\n\n"Of course, Mr. President."\n\nGoldwater stifled a sigh. There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Walter Judd: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, while Judd was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the RDC's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Judd to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. I just wanted to let you know who I'm planning on," Goldwater said, handing over a piece of paper with some scrawled handwriting on it.\n\nJudd adjusted his glasses as he sat on the sofa, looking over the names. As he got further and further down the list, his frown got deeper and deeper.\n\n"These are all Republicans," Judd said. "I don't see a single Democrat, or, rather, anyone that isn't a conservative, Mr. President. This could divide the coalition, especially with certain voters." His voters, those that voted for the RDC because Judd was on the ticket.\n\n"The people voted for a conservative government, Walter. Besides, you're here. You're at the table. That should be more than enough to make the liberals happy."\n\nJudd stood up, handed the piece of paper back. "It's your choice, Mr. President. You should have the people that agree with you around the table." His tone of voice made it clear that he wasn't happy about it. He turned on his heel and left the room. Goldwater shrugged his shoulders and returned to work."

 GLD.5.t: "Evaluation of Useless Programs"
 GLD.5.desc: "Barry Goldwater sat at the Resolute desk, looking at the binder of paper in front of him, labeled with "Current Federal Social Security and Subsidy Programs" on the cover. He rubbed his forehead, staring at the binder with almost two hundred pages of paper.\n\n"You have got to be kidding me," Goldwater said, adjusting his glasses before flipping open the binder, to see an index that listed all of them in alphabetical order. "Thirty years of welfare, and this is the result?"\n\n"Yes, Mr. President," Donald Regan said. The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. "The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of."\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. "Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. "That's the first one to go."\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. "Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month." "I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut. "By the time we are done, this should be a pamphlet, not a doorstop.""
 GLD.5.a: "What's with all these programs?"
 GLD.6.t: "Cutting the Agricultural Budget"
 GLD.6.desc: ""Socialist Agriculture." That's the phrase that is being thrown around a lot lately amongst Republicans, right wing groups, and those around President Goldwater. The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their RDC President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Pact, especially the Nationalist faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but many in the RDC are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."
 GLD.6.a: "The Solid South no more."
 GLD.7.t: "Cutting Welfare Down to Size"
 GLD.7.desc: "Various Presidents and administrations over the years have sought to leave their legacy on the nation, usually with bold programs to make the life of Americans better, easier, more productive and more. So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Democrats or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Republicans are displeased that the spending cuts aren't even more drastic, while Democrats are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished.

Or entertain it, for that matter. "What's it this time Ancel?"\n\nThe now-named Corporal Ancel lugged with him a sniper rifle - one of the brand new M14s-with-a-scope RUMINT said Rock Island was pumping out like candy - as he approached. "Just thinking of a cool-sounding name for this here Goldie's Gift." He caressed its varnished, slightly pale white stock like a man caresses his afterglown lover in bed. "Angry beauty never missed a dime in five hundred yards!"\n\nNow Ancel singing Goldwater's praises was a genuine surprise. "'Goldie's Gift'?" Whitley snorted. "Coming from a diehard Rightist like you?"\n\nHis friend held up two fingers. "One: I vote for anyone without an R or a D next to their name." He brought down one digit. "Two: Anyone who gives me a factory-fresh gun has my vote. It's that simple really," the corporal finished, shrugging.\n\n"I'll be sure to tell my sister you've finally seen the light." She deserved some good news outside their dysfunctional manor every now and then.\n\nAcsel stared nonplussed. "Don't even joke about that one Snoot.

Now tell me what they call the color white."\n\nAfter jogging years of disuse off his mind, Whitley managed a hesitant translation."

 GLD.20.t: "Meeting With Morton"
 GLD.20.desc: "The interesting thing about Thruston Ballard Morton, Goldwater mused to himself, was that he was such a profoundly uninteresting-looking man. If you combined the faces of all the members of Congress into one man, the result would probably look quite similar to him. Clean-cut, short hair, square face. It was hard to imagine such a non-descriptive man could wield such power - yet, here he was, facing the President down in the Oval Office.\n\n"Mr. President," he began politely, "it's the opinion of myself and my friends that Mr. Regan has gotten a little carried away with his plans." Goldwater's head cocked to the side, light glinting off the lenses of his glasses. "His heart is in the right place, of course, but he's taking it... well too far with these tax and welfare cuts. Some of what he's pushing for is economic nonsense."\n\n"I chose him for his role because I agree with much of that so-called nonsense, Morton." Goldwater responded. "Frankly, I don't think it's nonsense at all."\n\n"You may not, Mr. President, but the party doesn't agree. A lot of people are worried. I can't guarantee his ideas make it through the Senate." Morton replied, settling in his chair as he lined up his main attack. "Now, I think there's more than enough room between us to compromise, especially on trade and the national debt. We work out a deal there, and I guarantee that whatever bill we put out passes. You have my word."\n\nGoldwater considered the offer for a moment - Morton was not speaking emptily. A fair number of moderates in the RDC would be sure to follow what he did. Approaching it pragmatically, he made his choice. "Alright, you have your deal. I hope you're ready to explain to my voters why I'm going back on my words.""

 GLD.21.t: "International Trade"
 GLD.21.desc: "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions. Now is the time for America to embrace free trade."
 GLD.21.a: "Aye."
 GLD.22.t: "Goldwater's Way"
 GLD.22.desc: ""So America, I ask you: do you want to trade with a people that use slavery and torture? Do you want to become the nation that sells to the butchers of men? Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargoes with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republicans, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Republicans, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Republicans, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

After all, this whole thing is his idea, a way to try to bring the alliance closer together. Officially, it's been stated that the goal of the summit is to encourage more trade between the members of the OFN in a spirit of freedom and democracy, while still maintaining their strength and will to stand up to the Fascists and Imperialists in Eurasia.\n\nHowever, the US President has not been quiet about his desire to forge free trade deals and open more markets, which some of the smaller nations are hesitant, if not downright hostile to. After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil, and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin. And maybe Goldwater's charisma and forceful speeches just might be able to convince the OFN to unite closer together..."

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external fascist threat from Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

"Therefore, it's vital that the OFN seek to strengthen all members, not simply through military means, but by increasing economic and social ties between all of us."\n\nPublic response has been mixed so far.

Despite a last ditch attempt at a Filibuster from an NPP Senator that stretched late into the night, calling the bill a "...disaster in the making for the hardworking American..." Yockey's supporters denounced it as a return to the failed interventionist politics of the past. However, the bill passed with the majority support from the RDC and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods, and more from nations like Canada, Australia, and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDC have claimed.\n\nThe Marxist faction was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck President.

 GLD.48.desc: "Today President Barry Goldwater announced that he has been in contract with the governments of Canada and Mexico in regard of his proposed North American Trade Cooperation Treaty, inviting America's neighbors to meet in Washington, DC., to negotiate.\n\nFree trade amongst the three largest economies of North America has long been a goal, a dream for those seeking to bring the United States, Canada and Mexico closer together. However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations. Labor unions in Canada and the US are afraid that big businesses will seek to lower costs by building factories in the cheaper and less unionized Mexico, while farmers in Canada and Mexico are afraid of being overwhelmed by American food without the import quotas they currently have, or Hollywood and American TV networks destroying her neighbor's cultural institutions. And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place. But Goldwater isn't daunted, and in fact seems to be relishing the chance to make the biggest effort yet to reshape the global economy."

Already some America's biggest corporations are announcing that they are planning on investing millions in Canada and Mexico on factories, while approvals from oil pipelines from Alberta and Veracruz are being sought to ship millions of barrels of crude to satisfy American demand. However, protests by Mexican indigenous groups that have had constitutional protections on their lands removed, Canadian farmers who are nervous of having the markets flooded with cheaper food, and unionized American workers afraid for their jobs have erupted across the continent.\n\nBut President Goldwater can be proud in what he has accomplished: he's made trade between the three major nations of North America open and free, and brought the US, Mexico and Canada closer together.

Our military forces are not servants of the government, but of the people.

Namely that the former should be cut to the bone, and then some, and the later should be allowed to run free with next to nothing to hold it back. Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power. At first it was welcomed: some make work programs to get the unemployed workers back to work. Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans? The lazy and workshy, those that only have enough ambition to game the system for free money, now get checks from Uncle Sam to spend on booze and prostitutes, rich food and all the luxuries of a modern life, all by lying and cheating the average person. The American people became apathetic, weary, and resigned to this nightmare of red tape and thievery, undaring and meek in front of a monolithic entity of agencies, bureaus and departments.\n\nBut no more. Today begins the process of slashing through the bloated government. Programs are being re-evaluated. Taxes are being slashed. The debt will be erased. Budgets are going to be halved, and halved again. Thousands of paper pushers, whose only job it was to stifle everything about America, will be booted out to find some actual work. Those living the high-life on scamming the welfare system or squeezing the average man and woman for every dime will now have to actually find a job and be productive. Restrictions that have held the American economy back for decades will be cut to ribbons. The Free Market, now revitalized, without anything holding it back, will allow everyone to prosper again."

Many states, especially in the Great Plains and the South, are only served by small banks and unable to provide the services that are considered standard and normal in places like New York or California. This has prevented farmers, entrepreneurs, and ordinary people from accessing resources that would allow them to expand their businesses, hire new workers, build new homes, and much more...\n\n"Today I'm asking Congress to pass the Interstate Banking Act of [GetYear], which will remove many of the restrictions on the merging of banks, as well as reducing the regulations that are currently preventing many viable and hardworking people from getting the loans they need to buy homes, cars, businesses and more. This new act will also cut taxes and fees that the federal government places on the banks, to give them more money, which can then be borrowed by everyday Americans..."\n\n"It has been the policy of my administration, from the moment I took this esteemed office, to get the government out of the way, to allow the untapped potential of our nation that had been held back for years to flourish. This act that I'm asking Congress to pass, along with all the other programs and actions my administration have taken, will allow our nation to grow and prosper like it has never seen before.

It was such a pleasure to get out of the endless hurly-burly of Washington, with its filth and smoke and smiling monsters waiting to sink a knife in him as soon as his back was turned. Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after."\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper. Accompanied by the distant crash of the Lower Falls, the President ended his speech with a quote by the naturalist John Muir-"

It creaked behind him as he gazed up at the immaculately white ceiling. Lethargically reaching forward, he picked up the cup of coffee she had left him and took a brief sip. Hot as the Yellowstone Caldera.\n\nIt was official: his dream of a government dedicated to protecting America's natural places had come to pass. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill. It had been a battle well fought, and a victory well earned. After the endless bustle of the past few weeks, the President was finally able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a hot cup of coffee and a moment's peace, as well as the knowledge that he had forever ensured the preservation of America's natural heritage."

Since our humiliation at the hands of Japan and Germany, our society has strained and struggled and our politics have become polarized and acrimonious. Friends have become enemies, and opponents have become allies in a whirlwind of fear and panic. The forced merger of the old Republican and Democratic Parties, and the rise of the National Progressive Pact to form the unwanted, yet unbreakable two party system that has been with our nation almost since our birth, has led to ideologues and populists of both extremes. Screaming at each other on the radio and on television, and drowning out the center in a flood of hate and anger. The moderates of both sides, those that can agree on compromises and get stuff done. There has been no direction, no course. America is a broken nation."\n\n"But today, we begin to repair it."\n\nIn his first major speech to the American people since his inauguration, President Goldwater identified many of the issues that faced America, including a divided political scene, a stagnating economy, and a listless population. But he also laid out his policy agenda, which is as bold and daring as any seen or heard since at least the Great Depression. While the details were limited, and Goldwater said that he would find the best course of action through discussion with his Cabinet and Congress, he promised that whatever it is, whatever he tries to do, it will be for the good of America as a whole.\n\nNewspaper editorials and radio commentators, those that often speak of gloom and doom, were much more upbeat the next day. Even Goldwater's opponents said they could respect the earnestness and forthright manner that he spoke, even if they couldn't agree with his prescription on how to cure the USA. But for those that voted for Goldwater in November, it was exactly what they wanted. A promise to solve the many problems that face America, no matter the cost."

McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Democrats and the Progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

Hailed as a major blow against electoral corruption, the FECA was intended to level the playing field and root fraud from the political process.\n\nNevertheless, there will always be people willing to skirt the law if they think it'll get them what they want. Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment.

He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Judd strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

Shoving the revolver in his coat pocket, he clambered over a chain-link fence and skidded down a muddy slope to the street below, making his escape into a knot of twisting alleys.\n\nThe newspapers would call it a senseless murder, motiveless, no suspect. Used car salesman, father of three, devoted husband and pillar of the community. And, though it was not printed, Klokard of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. With his death the agent's anonymity was safe, allowing him to continue reporting on their seditious behaviour, sifting for dirt to take them down.\n\nFor years to come, people walking that stretch of pavement would point the darkened bloodstain out to their friends, and wonder whose it had been."

 GLD.136.desc: "Office of the President of the United States\nFROM: SAC, Jackson\nSUBJECT: Review of KKK Organization and Activities\n\nMr. President,\n\nPer your request, please find attached various files and documentation pertaining to the organization, activities, and goals of the KKK. Effort has been made to assemble a concise yet thorough briefing on the group. Further materials are available at your request.\n\nThe Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, to use their full appellation, represent America's foremost domestic threat, in the view of the Bureau. The KKK and its predecessors have been monitored and actively engaged by the Bureau since the late 1910s. Around 1920, Klan activity became far more bold, corresponding with an explosion in membership. Despite the Klan's ostensible support for law and order, they have actively menaced both the Bureau and any state or federal authorities who oppose them. Even so, the Klan has been consistently protected for decades by corrupt and/or segregationist state governments and courts, as well as many state police forces - overwhelmingly in the South, naturally. KKK membership within all three of these institutions is common throughout the former Confederate states, while minor branches exist in most other states.\n\nThe KKK should not be misunderstood as merely a pro-segregation activist group, Mr. President. They are a genuine threat to American citizens of all colors and creeds, so long as those citizens are not both white and aligned with their cause. Both ordinary crime - mostly violent in nature - and outright terrorism are standard practice for the group. Naturally, their main targets are civil rights activists and institutions which support them. You will recall the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama - that was the Klan's work, though we still lack sufficient evidence to prosecute our suspects. That was only one of many similar attacks, which range from bombing to arson and murder.\n\nThe Director agrees that the KKK poses a serious threat to domestic stability and the lives of our citizens, and must be dealt with decisively as soon as possible."

The puddles covering the parking lot of the Philadelphia Sheraton Hotel, remnants of that morning's storm, glimmered like countless diamonds in the rays of sunlight poking through the clouds. Around him, three unmarked black cars screamed into the parking lot, disgorging a dozen hard-faced men in black suits. Crandall gave the signal, and they strode towards the hotel.\n\nTheir deep-cover boys in extremist groups had finally uncovered actionable intel on the greatest threat to the United States, the infamous fascist ideologue Francis Parker Yockey. After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence. Swinging his gaze back to the conventioneers, he realized with a lurch of the stomach that they were middle-aged ladies one and all. Spluttering apologies, he slammed the doors behind him.\n\nThe bastard had flown the coop! Ignoring their shit-eating smirks, Crandall glanced over his men, wondering which of them was the snitch, then gruffly gave the order to return to the cars. They wouldn't get their man today. He was, Crandall reflected with irritation, probably already sipping a scotch and soda in an airplane bound for South America. Well, a man like Yockey wouldn't run forever. He'd come back, and when he did, they'd get him."

Ignoring the simple beauty of nature around him, Donald made a beeline for his charcoal-stained old firepit. Without ceremony, he dumped the box among the ashes, squirted it with kerosene, and lit it with a thrown match. Tongues of fire reflected in his eyes, Donald watched the flames consume his robes, the dark green fabric of the Grand Dragon crumbling into ash.\n\nAlthough he told himself that what he did was out of simple pragmatism, Donald was afraid, a fear that would rule him for the rest of his days. He frowned as he stared into the flames.\n\nFollowing the radio's announcement that the Klan would be banned and its leaders arrested, a thousand similar scenes played out across America. In a single night, the power and organization of the Klan was decisively crushed by the President's agents, by methods of sometimes arguable legitimacy. Nevertheless, there was a change in the air. A new era was dawning, one in which black people could walk the streets without fear, their would-be tormentors hiding inside, peering with bloodshot eyes through the venetian blinds, forever wondering.\n\nWondering if today would be the day they got the call in the night."

All over the country, Yockey's web of shell corporations are being raided, his inner circle arrested on whatever charges we can reasonably expect a jury to believe, and membership in his political organizations made illegal. Although the man himself has vanished, presumably on his way to safe haven in Europe or South America on a phony passport, we've torn his power to shreds and, in doing so, we've excised the pulsing tumour at the nation's heart.\n\nThankfully, there has been little backlash to our persecution of the fascist fifth-columnists lurking within our society. Yockey has long been a stain on the NPP, and as much as they'd love to denounce us for attacking their party members, they can't do so without looking like they're endorsing his sick ideology. After all, Joe Citizen has little sympathy for fascism after the humiliations heaped upon us by Germany and Japan.\n\nEnjoying his morning coffee, President Goldwater allowed himself a moment of quiet triumph. He felt like the hero slaying the dragon in those old adventure tales he'd read as a kid, all those years ago in the hazy Arizona of his memory. He'd broken the back of Yockey, the Jew-hater, the would-be Imperator. Never again would he or his ilk threaten America.\n\nThe President smiled as the sun crested over the horizon and sipped his coffee. It tasted like victory."

Through the outstanding efforts of the FBI, we have been able to sneak into the meetings of the Marxists and discover their secret plans with little ease. Their talk of wealth redistribution and the so-called "welfare state" is undermining the principles our founding fathers laid out for us: the party must be crushed and humiliated for America's sake. Their ideas and flashy red uniforms are easy targets for the justification of treason; it is proof enough that they are organizing an uprising against the government. We cannot afford such a drastic change in politics when we are already so far into the diplomatic war with Germany and Japan.\n\nMarxist NPP meetings of any size will be banned indefinitely.

Our education system needs to focus more on the failures of communism so that we could prevent any possibility for a socialist revolution in the future.\n\nThis latest Senate-approved bill will accomplish just this task. The bill revamps the social studies class by adding our own anti-communist propaganda to further lead students away from the false glimmer of the red star. A Knoxville, Tennessee teacher described her support for the new bill, "I mean, look at Russia when they adopted communism. There's no telling what kind of authority stretches across that barren land now. I would hate to live in an America that looks like those thousand-piece puzzles. Hopefully our kids grow up to hate those wretched Reds."\n\nThe Marxist Caucus responded as predicted: a few small protests here and there across major U.S. cities. One such protest in Minneapolis turned violent as the leftists were struck by average citizens whose everyday lives were disrupted.

Some newspapers were reluctant, while others began bizarre campaigns against the Marxists, with one local Utah paper calling all leftists "Communist Mutants From Space". Even the more moderate positions of the Marxist Caucus are coming under fire for "attempting to inject their awful beliefs into our pure American society".\n\nSince the inception of this campaign, any newspaper, regardless of the amount of readers, will be federally funded for any anti-communist articles. This has led to a growing number of pro-Yockey and fascist newspapers gaining attention, especially in the South and Midwest, the old headquarters of American Populism.

A hardline conservative and strong believer in supply-side economics (better known by many as "trickle down theory"), Regan had long espoused ideas of stripping the federal government down to the bare minimum, which in his mind was basically maintaining an army, and staying as far away from telling anyone what to do.\n\nThe conflict came to a head early in Goldwater's Presidency, as discussion regarding cutting welfare spending and lowering taxes resulted in a heated debate between the President and VP Judd, captured for posterity on the tape recordings that Goldwater had maintained in the Oval Office.\n\n"Mr. President, if you keep going down this route with Regan, you are going to destroy the economy, and the party," Judd stated. "I know you are not in favor of regulations and such, but most of them are in place for a reason. We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. "That will be enough to keep the RDC together."\n\n"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!" Judd yelled. "Are you willing to let that happen?" "If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!" Goldwater bellowed. The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Judd put his foot down.\n\n"Mr. President, you have a choice. If you do what Regan is suggesting, you can kiss the Republican-Democrats goodbye. I know quite a few congresspeople that would rather work with the NPP than you. So, it's your choice to make."

However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Democrat Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nRepublicans have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater.

 GLD261descpass: "Congratulations Mr. President: we did it. We proved all the economists and experts wrong. We have successfully got the United States back onto the Gold Standard! We already have reports of many banks dealing with long lines to exchange bills for gold and silver coins up to the daily limit, but they are managing to fulfill all requests made by their depositors. However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase. While it may be too early yet to determine the full effects, I'm confident that this accomplishment will bring new prosperity and growth to the United States for years to come."
 GLD.261.a: "Well..."
 GLD261descfailure: "Terrible news Mr. President! Our efforts to get the US back on to the Gold Standard has failed! Banks are overwhelmed by furious depositors trying to get their bills exchanged for precious metals, though most have run out, and there is no way for us to get more coins to them any time soon. Those that are not getting the gold or silver are now sure they are being swindled, and banks are on the verge of collapsing. Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage. The only ones that seem to be enjoying the current situation are the NPP across the aisle. Already, Progressive leaders and supporters are gloating, saying how they will fix all this. Rumors of impeachment are already spreading through Congress, and, to be frank... we might deserve this. Maybe we should have listened to the experts?"

 GLD.262.desc: ""Thank you for meeting me on such short notice Walter." Barry Goldwater led his running mate into the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. It was just days after the election, and while the White House was still occupied for a few months yet, it was time to prepare the transition.\n\n"Of course, Mr. President."\n\nGoldwater stifled a sigh. There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Walter Judd: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, while Judd was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the RDC's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Judd to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nThe bad blood wasn't going to go away, especially not overnight even with the victory in the election. But that didn't mean that Goldwater couldn't at least try.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. And I would like your opinion on a few of the posts," Goldwater replied.\n\nThat caught Judd off guard. "Excuse me, Mr. President?"\n\n"I want to get some Democrats and liberals around the table. To show that I'm being serious about uniting the Coalition. Namely Health, Education, Interior, Labor. I know they aren't the fanciest positions, but I want to show that I'm willing to listen to different opinions."\n\nJudd leaned back on the couch, surprised at what Goldwater was saying. After all these months of helping to get a man that was against nearly everything that he stood for into the Presidency, he was now getting an olive branch in return.\n\n"So, can I get your help, Walter?"\n\n"Of course, Barry.""

Already, articles from the Patrons of Franklin are emerging everywhere, from rural communities to the biggest cities.\n\n"We as Americans desperately need to wake up to the current madness. I have walked through the streets of New York City, watching men, women and children blindly attack a young man due to his Marxist affiliation. This man was coming home from his day job; he never wished harm on anyone. Do Americans not realize how much disregard Goldwater has for the U.S. Constitution? The article all Americans are supposed to hold dear as if it were the Bible? Let me remind you of the First Amendment: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, right to assemble, and the freedom to criticize the government. Arguably, Goldwater has taken all of these rights away from you; you have no rights as of now. You can't say you're communist, you can't support communism in the papers, you can't praise communism, you can't assemble for communism, you can't criticize the government for their role without a prison sentence. Wake up before this tyrant sends this country to Hell! Politicians, if you can hear me, Goldwater has committed acts of treason and should be impeached!"\n\nPresident Goldwater has read and reread this article many times over, and he must find a way to counter the smearing before the media turns on him."

Over the past few weeks, Goldwater has come under fire from the Progressive NPP for his 'conspicuous' attacks on the radical left, going so far as to prohibit party meetings. Several unknown authors formed a group called the Patrons of Franklin to criticize Goldwater's unlawful behaviors, citing violations of the First Amendment. The authors used pen names such as Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, and Paul Revere in their writings.\n\nGoldwater stood firm in the face of the media's elaborate questions, and his responses were on-point. His explanations regarding the evils of socialism were as reasonable as they were crystal clear. His delicately-prepared reasoning ended many doubts the public had about the introduction of anti-communist propaganda. His smooth, reassuring speech immediately drew critical acclaim across the nation, especially from right-wing groups. Many are convinced that even though Goldwater might not be the greatest President in U.S. history, he is arguably one of the most patriotic.\n\nSince the press conference ended, the Patrons of Franklin have yet to write an official statement on Goldwater's speech."\n\n-Washington Post"

"Oh, really? How is it any different over there? Our Reds are getting caught and locked up. Doesn't seem they'll be out of prison for a while, either."\n\nThe Nationalist voter firmly pushes his friend a few steps back. "I don't think you're getting it. Those Nazis are systematically executing anyone suspected of salutin' the Red Star. Any Communist would be praisin' God forever if they only got a life sentence in jail for being Communist. You see, Reds in Germany are bein' shot on the same streets we're walking now. Either that or they're tortured behind walls. And I have a feeling that that stuff's gonna be happening here in a short while. Personally, I'm grateful, I despise those deplorables. But these are dark times we're heading towards.

When the media confronted Goldwater for his attacks on leftist organizations, he had this to say:\n\n'Never before in my life have I ever made such a deep realization of my own actions. Several newspaper articles written about me were... very difficult to comprehend; it was at that moment I realized I had put my own interests above the interests of all of you. We aren't a civilization built on hate and prejudice, like the Nazis or the Japanese; we listen to the voice of the people here.'\n\nCritics easily judged Goldwater's introduction as 'too obvious that he was trying to roll back on his beliefs' and that he was being 'blatantly deceitful'. However, as Goldwater went on, the critics grew more and more silent.\n\n'I have not been listening to America's voice in these past weeks. I have decided to overhaul my previous policies on anti-socialism. Already I am working to pardon over a thousand Marxist members who were imprisoned for their affiliation. In the land of opportunity, it is essential for everyone to have a say.'\n\nPublic response was mostly favorable, but leftists were overly supportive and Nationalist members withdrew their acclaim for the President entirely. Ever since the speech, membership of the Marxist Caucus produced a surge not seen since last year. I, for one, am thankful to have a President that listens to the people and can respect our constitutional rights as citizens. I will proudly continue my work under the Patrons of Franklin to denounce any and all extremist activity in our great nation." -Patrick Henry, The Washington Post"

When Goldwater stepped onto the podium, he eagerly renounced his anti-socialist ways in front of a media crowd who proved to be incredibly skeptical of the President. One reporter commented, "How can a world leader introduce all these pro-censorship measures, denounce all of it the next day, and expect us to believe he has a sudden change of heart? This isn't a simulation he's playing: Goldwater's supposed to be one of the most powerful men in the world."\n\nGoldwater had answers for every question the interviewers asked, but the man's voice was shaky and his posture was uncomfortable. He didn't show much confidence in his responses, either.\n\nThe media's word on the speech was very unpleasant towards the RDC: many journalists called Goldwater the "Opportunist President" for his attempts to flip his beliefs to gain extra votes. Nationalist politicians considered Goldwater "a cheating liar" and "the first bogus President in a long time". According to a Gallup poll released after the conference, Goldwater's popularity with the American people decreased as much as 10%. Only Marxist politicians showed any kind of support for Goldwater, but even they are convinced that the President will backstab them more to appease the right-wing crowd."

Officer Alistair MacKinnon was killed instantly, his partner Officer Brock Tarrant taking cover and calling for reinforcements. A tense 7-hour siege ensued with the perpetrators. An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs. One filled almost half a page, showing Officer Tarrant in a particularly heroic pose, engaging the Sovereigntists as his fellows attempt to retrieve the supine body of his murdered partner.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement to even further increase the relevance of the Far Left NPP.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning.

The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption.

But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein."\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. "If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them," the President continued, "were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court."\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down.

Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career.

Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks.

 GLD.union.7.desc: "Barry's answer came in the form of one comprehensive bill authored by the Republicans, fast-tracked from one hearing and committee to the next, and finally put out on a vote in both houses of Congress. Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Republicans bellowed their assent, Democrats muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked. President Goldwater can only shuffle in his seat and see these maneuvers waltz a Congressional ballet on the session floor -- if, of course, they decide to attend at all."
 GLD.union.7.a: "One more moment of truth to agonize over in his term."
 GLD.union.8.t: "The Union Recruitment Standards Act Passes!"
 GLD.union.8.desc: "Pen in hand, Barry Goldwater drew his cursive signature on top of the hundred-page stack of paper on the Resolute Desk.\n\nEven with the congregation of Congressmen and journalists packed in his office, he felt no rush to scribble his penmanship. No, paper this valuable deserved only the most perfect strokes the aging President's hands can create. So did the fountain pen rise and fall in loops to make a capital B, then run another loop crosswise to make a small A, and so on until it stopped as a cursive r's little right notch. With the signature drying up on its front page, the Union Recruitment Standards Act finally became law.\n\nAs soon as the President set his pen to its holder the Oval Office exploded in congratulatory applause and thanks. Shaking hands and hugs wormed their way around the gaps between smartly tailored suits. Cameras snapped a watershed moment for American labor into memory with incandescent flash powder.\n\nSo too did they capture President Goldwater's smiling mien, right before he treated himself with a sip of coffee from a worn-out mug. Few would argue he didn't deserve some joe after getting this far into fulfilling his big promises."

 GLD.union.9.t: "The Union Recruitment Standards Act Fails!"
 GLD.union.9.desc: "When he delivered his address the morning after the disastrous vote, President Goldwater's features bore the marks of heavy fatigue: Purplish eyebags peeked from behind his glasses; normally immaculate swept salt-and-pepper hair stuck outwards in angles and rays; and the creases and dimples of age became deep trenches flanking his seemingly chiseled frown.\n\nWith a hoarse, scratching voice he launched an invective delivered as if by a grandfather to their misbehaving grandson -- he chided his opponents for stonewalling the hope of many workers across the country, scolded his supposed allies for flagging in their support when he needed them most, and admonished "certain perfidious actors" who stood to gain the most from his failure. Less sympathetic observers would describe the President's response as a diatribe spoken in bad faith.\n\nTwo hundred million Americans react as variedly as one would expect from two hundred million minds. The God-fearing families of the South and Southwest bore the same heavy heart as their President had carried in front of national television. Contrariwise, the working men of Yankeedom and the Pacific Coast paid less heed to the Arizonan's words than the riotous parties they held in celebration of Congress's decision.\n\nAs the minutes wore on and the denouncements petered out, President Goldwater ambled out of the screen after hurling one last snipe at his hated opponents, the trade unionists: "Duplicitous hydras with Medusa's petrifying gaze," he said. Many Americans shared one thought as they watched their commander-in-chief leave the screen with an impatient strut:"

 GLD.union.10.t: "Charting Course"
 GLD.union.10.desc: "In preparation for the war on the trade unions, President Goldwater has assembled the Cabinet to go through the strategies they had planned weeks prior. For such a vast, multifaceted campaign with many avenues of failure, diverging opinions on which strategy to undertake was perhaps more of an inevitability than he thought. At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Democrats share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence. All wise men know to consider the repercussions of their actions. Whether the Arizonan will exercise his wisdom where it is needed most remains to be seen."

 GLD.union.13.t: "The Labor Union Standards Act"
 GLD.union.13.desc: "After months of draft-drawing and consultations with business leaders and key political figures, President Goldwater and his allies have finally introduced their first piece of anti-union legislation in Congress since his controversial "War on Unionism" address. Dubbed the Labor Union Standards Bill, it aims to introduce new requirements in order for a trade union to organize with the federal government's blessing and operate within its jurisdiction. These include a clean record sheet for the past twenty five years, limits on the revenue they report to the IRS, non-affiliation with socialist parties active in the United States, and others.\n\nSenators from the National Progressive Pact decry the President's latest initiative, calling it "(a) gross infringement on the American workers' right to organize." This sentiment has been echoed by the AFL-CIO, who have since called for nationwide strikes and protests against the Bill's passage in Congress. Time will tell if their efforts will bear fruit against the President's own efforts."
 GLD.union.13.a: "One more blow against unionism."
 GLD.union.14.t: "The Labor Union Standards Act Passes!"
 GLD.union.14.desc: "Surrounded by well-wishers, allies and press coverage, President Goldwater has today signed the Labor Union Standards Act into law. The bill itself handily passed in the Senate and House by considerable margins, despite protestations from the National Progressive Pact and a number of Democratic Congressmen who broke ranks to vote against its passage -- futilely, as later events had proved. "This is an appreciable victory over the trade unions who wish to put their own fortunes over America's," the President said cheerfully to the media afterwards, "but we must not mistake it as a cause to invite complacency. Make no mistake: My administration will never cease in following through with its promises to their successful conclusion."\n\nThe American labor movement is in uproar following the bill's ratification. In a joint statement with notable activists, progressive officials and renowned labor organizers, AFL-CIO President George Meany rebuked President Goldwater for "failing to uphold the political liberties of American workers", and that the union will "do whatever it can to prevent the American workers' rights from further attack". Isolated riots have since been reported in Baltimore, Sacramento, and Cheyenne..."

 GLD.union.15.desc: "It seems not even President Goldwater's dignitas can overcome the broad coalition that had coalesced to oppose his overt assault on American trade unionism, for the Labor Union Standards Bill failed to collect enough votes in Congress for due ratification. Press Secretary George Christian relayed to several media outlets after the vote that "President Goldwater is dismayed by Congress' decision, and has reconvened with his government in order to hash out the White House's actions going forward. He regrets that the country's legislature failed to heed the mandate which a majority of Americans had shown their support for on Election Day..."\n\nPundits and political observers have since offered their own opinions on the future direction of the President's anti-union campaign. Some believe he will withdraw after being dealt a decisive defeat in Congress, while others note that public support for his campaign remains steady enough to disincline him from discontinuing at this time..."

The following silence on President Goldwater's part had fueled speculation on his uncertain objectives, which have now been put to rest by a televised address directly from the Oval Office. His calm tone belied the energy with which he delivered the announcement that the White House has filed a case against America's largest trade union directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe public's reaction was instantaneous, divisive, and expected. Republicans proclaimed their full support; the NPP and their progressive allies prepared their demonstrations and coalitions. American households and workplaces had an opinion of their own by day's end -- whether the majority are in favor or against the President's latest action, pollsters such as Pew and Gallup have yet to ascertain. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the next few weeks will herald a watershed precedent for American labor relations with repercussions lasting well after the Goldwater administration."

Internal security within the courtroom had run itself ragged keeping its participants from speaking out of line and protestors from interfering with the proceedings itself. Although arguments were kept from devolving into bloody fistfights, if only just, the entire trial simmered with a consistent level of snide and creative insults exchanged between government and union throughout.\n\nNot that insults were all both sides could offer, of course. The Justices had their fill of evidence and testimony as well: Laws, prior court decisions, compromising materials, even emotional outbursts from several witnesses. Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial. Weeks later, America's most esteemed judges convened behind the court's closed doors to agree upon the AFL-CIO's fate."

 GLD.union.18.t: "Defeat"
 GLD.union.18.desc: "Barry Goldwater was no stranger to loss. He'd lost elections before, lost friends alive and dead, lost everything between a couple dimes and several millions of donor and party dollars. But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing? Something to think about while he spends the rest of his term making like a crippled goose, then.\n\nUnbidden, the old verse from the Book of Psalms left his lips:"

 GLD.union.19.t: "Stalemate"
 GLD.union.19.desc: "Steam rose as faint wisps from the warm mug that had kept Barry Goldwater company this Oval Office midnight, same as the last. He took a small sample of minutes-old coffee, wincing at the acrid taste as he set the mug onto its plate. Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them "come to naught" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their "personal conversations" behind closed doors."

Sweeter than his standard fare; then again, today was nothing standard either.\n\nGlancing across the table, Barry saw the Director's poison-laced stare bore holes at today's issue of The Washington Times. Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned "SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n"What do you mean, Speed?" the President inquired. "We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom."\n\n"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides? They'll be lucky to make it past the end of the century." Barry continued, "The message got across, that's what matters. We'll come for the rest of them soon enough.""

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist. Sweet, sweet victory."

Everyone has their skeletons, after all, least of all large organizations with the money and pull to draw America's hard workers by the millions. The action was of little surprise for President Goldwater's close council -- his legendary antipathy for "bloated rackets led by the most corrupt of men" was well-known within the Beltway and beyond. Director Hoover assuaged concerns of a slip-up escalating into a scandal rivalling the Nixon debacle, saying that his men are, to quote verbatim, "...competent enough not to get caught by some reds and rent-a-cops. His agents will get away with the dirt without leaving a fingerprint."\n\nSo far, the Director's words ring true. After mere days of planning and observation, a clandestine break-in of an office building evinced the corruption President Goldwater railed against: gifts to fellow union bosses, membership fees "creatively deducted" from annual earnings reports, officers buying twice what they make in a month. The subsequent leak to the media from a "concerned insider" made certain of the union's demise from both public shame and public lawsuits."

The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight.

The ice pack did little to stem the pain while he drove to the weekly union meet. "You know how she is," he sighed.\n\nHis diminutive coworker crossed her arms, frowning. "Doesn't make it any less dumb. It's just once every week, she can handle herself without you for a few hours, right?"\n\n"She saw one of the ads last night and-"\n\n"And she fell for 'em hook, line, and sinker."\n\nThe blonde mulled over the words phrased not as a question, but as a statement of fact. Willow and his old friend had their... disagreements, which inevitably bled into how James should spend his time. He'd learned to choose his words carefully when the topic is broached; in this case, the only sensible decision was to say nothing at all.\n\n"Seriously," Rosie grumbled, "what good's those degrees of hers if she can't tell facts from all the horse dung in Gramps's farm? Clear as day, Goldy's ads are all..." She hummed in thought, pinching at an imaginary beard. "All..."\n\n"Gobbledygook?" James offered.\n\nAnyone else and they'd have given him a questioning stare for a word supposedly only children would say. But his friend had a welcoming sense of humor, he thought happily, if the titters that left her lips said anything. Seconds later, they evolved into stomach-aching chortles that echoed through the waiting lobby and caught the attention of the handful early arrivals mulling about.\n\nRosie's laughter drew in their nods and smirks -- not at her, for some reason, but at James instead. He returned each with a level stare before leaning to his side. The womanly bell chimes lifting his spirits up smothered their suspicious looks somewhat. If nothing else, they made for pleasant ambience while the lobby waited for Boss Atwood and the rest."

 GLD.Speer.1.t: "The New Embargo"
 GLD.Speer.1.desc: "In spite of himself, Speer could feel his fists tensing beneath his desk.\n\n"And is it certain that their decision as it stands is final?" he asked, calmly.\n\n"Yes, my Führer. I believe Goldwater made a point of it during his election campaign. He sees trade with the Fatherland as... not in their national interest."\n\nThere was a moment's pause, as Speer shut his eyes and gently rubbed the bridge of his nose. Finally, he responded: "Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once." At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards détente with the Americans, this new President was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. "You asked to see me, my Führer?"\n\n"The Americans have restored the embargo. I want you to contact their government and ask them... no, you are going to tell them that we will talk this out. I will not allow our efforts to normalize relations be in vain." Speer did not turn from the window as he spoke.\n\nSchmidt nodded thoroughly. "I will get their Foreign Minister on the phone at once. How soon should I ready the diplomats to meet with our counterparts?"\n\n"Immediately.""
 GLD.Speer.1.a: "The Americans must listen to reason!"

 GLD.Speer.2.t: "A German Foot in the Door"
 GLD.Speer.2.desc: "Robert McNamara had taken a break for lunch when his secretary barged in, informing him that German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt was on the phone. He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your President, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again."\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. "The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists," McNamara concluded. "I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra. "Get him back on the line. I've made my decision.""

 GLD.Speer.3.t: "The Door Swings Closed"
 GLD.Speer.3.desc: ""My Führer... the Americans have-"\n\n"Yes, Schmidt," Speer interrupted gloomily, "I already know."\n\nThe Americans had rejected the Reich's request for negotiations, and already Speer had been inundated with panicked communiques from business leaders whose property and staff abroad suddenly found themselves declared illegal. German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland? I am willing to speak to them there.""
 GLD.Speer.3.a: ""Tell Goldwater I will meet him personally.""

 GLD.Speer.4.t: "Speer Proposes Face to Face Meeting"
 GLD.Speer.4.desc: ""You're serious? The Führer's actually proposing that I meet him one on one?"\n\n"I scarcely believed it myself, Mr. President. But the offer is genuine. I spoke directly with Mr. Speer on the phone, and he is insistent that he is willing to personally negotiate this."\n\nAcross the desk from McNamarra, President Goldwater sat back in his chair. This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."
 GLD.Speer.4.a: "This is preposterous."
 GLD.Speer.4.b: "Clear my diary. I'm going to Geneva."

 GLD.Speer.5.t: "The Door Slams Shut"
 GLD.Speer.5.desc: "Schmidt was somber as he spoke. "I'm afraid it's not going to happen, my Führer. The American Foreign Minister was quite adamant, their President has no interest in speaking with us."\n\nSpeer did not speak for a moment. He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. "I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now." Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

 GLD.Speer.6.desc: ""He... he actually agreed, my Führer."\n\nSpeer did not look up from his papers. "Who agreed to what?" he asked, completely distracted.\n\nSchmidt continued, more forcefully. "The American President, my Führer! He agreed to the meeting. He is on his way to Geneva as we speak."\n\nSpeer slowly put down his pen and stared at Schmidt in disbelief. His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. "Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. "We have much to prepare. This meeting is crucial for the future of our relations and for Germany's place in the world. Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat."\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. "I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations."\n\n"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get." Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.""
 GLD.Speer.6.a: "To Geneva. We have work to do."

 GLD.Speer.7.t: "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc: "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.""
 GLD.Speer.7.a: ""Guten Tag, Herr Speer.""

 GLD.Speer.8.t: "A Meeting in Geneva"
 GLD.Speer.8.desc: "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

 GLD.Speer.9.desc: "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Göring to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

Goldwater actually had to suppress a laugh. He had caught Speer out on his hypocrisy, and as soon as he got back to America he would regale the press with how the Führer sputtered and stumbled and came up with a thousand excuses for the continuation of his regime. He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."

What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organization of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish."\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. "Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organization of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow."\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond. "I have done much to bring Germany into modernity! Even a man like you must see that-"\n\nGoldwater stood, a dark look taking his face. "A man like me? And what do you mean by that? Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. "I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer." With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."

 GLD.Speer.13.desc: "Goldwater had expected to come to Geneva to show Speer who was boss. Instead, they were now making a deal.\n\nSpeer, somehow, had convinced him. While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Einheitspakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out.\n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. "This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin.

Goldwater had agreed to loosen the embargo and German business would surely breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nFor years, Germany had asserted its might through military dominance, yet Speer had now proved that they could also stand up in a war of words. That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany. The time for tanks charging across Europe was over; now was the time for the Reich to take its place on the world stage as a true diplomatic player."

The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential.

It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the Free World without being part of it. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy.

If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

 GLD.flavor.1.t: "The Streets of the Bronx, 8:38pm"
 GLD.flavor.1.desc: "Even when the weather is warm, the nights in the Bronx get cold sometimes. Maybe it's the blandness of the tenement brick, maybe it's the polluted city air.\n\nPerhaps, though, it's the rotten state of this country. At least to Robert.\n\nRobert can trace his heritage back to some of the first emancipated slaves in America. His grandfather served in the Harlem Hellfighters. His own father gave everything in the Pacific, and never came home. Robert, directionless after high school, decided to enlist in the Army. Life was rough after being injured in South Africa. Even in a state like New York, no place had room for a handicapped minority man. He worked odd jobs for years, barely scraping by with the help of the NPP's generous welfare programs. While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a President which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home. Come next November, he's going to make his voice heard. Whoever is in that office, something is clear. He can't keep going on like this."

 GLD.flavor.2.t: "The Floor of the NYSE, 4:00pm"
 GLD.flavor.2.desc: "The final bell rang at the NYSE. The floor, busy as ever, was stopped in a dead silence. While there was ticker tape everywhere and every investor was itching to get home, the reality of what just happened finally hit everyone.\n\nThe highest single day DOW Jones rise in history.\n\n"Gentlemen, everyone here today just made history!" The room explodes into applause. A bottle of champagne popped on the trading floor. Stock traders from opposite sides of the room are dancing together. "Tonight, your families will eat well. Little Suzie will get all the toys she wants for Christmas. You can finally buy that new car you've been eyeing for ages. Tonight, you will reap the rewards of the best economy in the history of the world!"\n\nThe sound is deafening; so much so that spectators outside pause in the street in awe. Although the people on the floor were simple stock traders, all from different walks of life, one thing was clear. They were rich, and they loved America. And perhaps, one day, everyone would be able to flourish from the economy that they've helped create. Public confidence has been restored in a system that works for everyone, with equal opportunity for success. No more will John Doe be scared of investment, scared of starting a business, or making money. The American Dream seems alive again."
 GLD.flavor.2.a: "And in their cheers, a dream was born for everyone."

 GLD.flavor.3.t: "The Suburbs of Seattle, 6:31am"
 GLD.flavor.3.desc: "Joseph Miller was one of the lucky few seamen in his crew. Not many people made it alive out of that ship, but he was one of the fortunate ones. Ever since that fateful day in Midway, Joseph does his best working as a shift manager at a factory. The veterans benefits are good. He lives comfortably with his wife and two children. He's active in his community, gives rifle lessons, and recently spoke at his town hall. He was one of the many people who voted in the last election.\n\nToday, Joseph woke up bright and early, as he typically does. Usually he likes to start his day with a shower, and then reading the morning paper as Lucy makes him and the kids some breakfast. But this morning was a bit different. The paperboy came early. A few people were already outside their houses, so it must've been important. With a stretch and groan, Joseph opens the front door, and picks up the paper. "NPP OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TAKING MONEY FROM JAPAN" is plastered on the front. Joseph rubbed his eyes, making sure that what he was seeing was true. With a pause, he closes the door, and sits down at the dinner table.\n\n"Honey, what's wrong? Is everything okay?"\n\n"Yes, Lucy. Apparently the neighbors thought today's paper is interesting. I don't blame them."\n\nPeople in these parts voted straight down the line for the NPP. Maybe it was out of solidarity for our brothers in California. Maybe it was because of how hard everyone here was hit by the war. Maybe it was just how things were here. But the more Joseph read of the paper, the more frustrated he got. To think that the people he voted for are taking money from the people who shot down his brother's plane infuriated him. He puts the paper down, and sighs heavily. If there is change to come this November, it'll certainly not be for a party which is funded by warmongers."
 GLD.flavor.3.a: "For a party of the people, they sure take a lot of outside money."

It's not right, it's not American, and President Goldwater is on the case! Soon, the administration will open up a Supreme Court case in order to take down the massive grip of American prosperity that the AFL-CIO holds. Should we fold in court, however, our administration could risk everything..."
GLD68_afl_cio_victorious: "The AFL-CIO Victorious"
GLD68_afl_cio_victorious_desc: "What once was the bright dream of American conservatism and economic prosperity now lies in the fiery and dark ashes of a failed Supreme Court, right alongside the legitimacy and respect of the country towards the Goldwater administration. The Supreme Court Justices completely slaughtered our attempts to bring down the bloated AFL-CIO, and now, more than ever, the fat unionists will only clamber for more and more American businesses to bring under its control. We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."
GLD68_afl_cio_weakened: "AFL-CIO Weakened"
GLD68_afl_cio_weakened_desc: "The battle was fought, the soldiers of the law were deployed, the artillery of deliberation has been fired, and the cost of this war has been totaled. In the end, however, the wise members of the Supreme Court have realized the truth, justice, and righteousness in our cause against the AFL-CIO in an effort to realize a greater means of prosperity in our country! Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses. And with this great victory for American business, so to comes the glory and respect of the American people for President Goldwater!"
GLD68_anti_corruption_crusade: "Crusade Against Corruption"
GLD68_anti_corruption_crusade_desc: "Corruption within the United States government has grown far too large and far too powerful, able to sway the tides of Congressional legislation, Executive action, and even Judicial deciding. This cannot stand for the beacon of liberty that the United States of America acts as in this harrowed world; rather, the administration shall begin immediate action to combat potential sources of corruption. Furthermore, President Goldwater has realized that the NPP stands as a far greater suspect in the game of corruption within the United States; thus, it ought to be our highest priority to snuff out corruption amidst the NPP before anywhere else in the government."

GLD68_anti_corruption_crusade_2_desc: "Corruption within the United States government has grown far too large and far too powerful, able to sway the tides of Congressional legislation, Executive action, and even Judicial deciding. This cannot stand for the beacon of liberty that the United States of America acts as in this harrowed world; rather, the administration shall begin immediate action to combat potential sources of corruption. However, unlike the rest of American governing, this stands as a wholly unbiased issue, and no faction of the United States government ought to stand as uninvestigated in this time of deep-seeded corruption, no matter the cost!"
GLD68_union_whitelist: "Union Whitelist"
GLD68_union_whitelist_desc: "Of course, outlawing unions in and of themselves would be a tremendously difficult, and, ultimately, wasteful task for President Goldwater and his administration. Rather, issuing a formal list of Presidentially-endorsed workers will be far more digestible for the American public, and allow us to help out those genuine workers' unions who stand to help the average American worker, rather than acting as bullies towards the great American businessmen across the country. Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"
