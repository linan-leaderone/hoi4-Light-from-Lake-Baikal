COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1:0 "Like the fate of the Chinese nation, the history of the §RChinese Communist Party§! is filled with resilient resistance and humiliating defeats. In the nearly half-century since its founding, the Party has been severely hit multiple times, but the people who endured suffering continued to press forward, and the revolution stumbled onward…\n\nThe road paved with the blood of heroes eventually led to §RYan'an§!. There, the communists called for unity and resistance against foreign invaders; there, people fought and produced simultaneously, revealing a picture of a new world that seemed to promise a different future—one without corrupt officials, without warlords and comprador bourgeoisie, where people could work and live freely… Yan'an became a beacon, guiding the progressive forces of all China to boldly pursue the future of this ancient nation.\n\nIn that protracted war, the army led by the Party deeply integrated with the masses, and the people who supported the Party fought in the enemy's rear. The Communist Party's bases spread across the central plains, and the activities of underground Party members infiltrated even the strongest fortresses of the Japanese and puppet regimes. The bayonets of the Japanese army could occupy towns, and their cannons could destroy ancient city walls, but beyond the cities, across the vast countryside, the Chinese military and civilians led by the Communist Party continued to fight."

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2:0 "But as the war dragged on, the fascists eventually gained the upper hand. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, external aid was nearly cut off, and the prolonged war destroyed China's already fragile agricultural economy. The successive defeats on the front lines ultimately led to the §GNationalist Army§!'s great collapse in 1945. As the enemy advanced step by step toward Yan'an, the Party had to abandon the base in northern Shaanxi and embark on a new §RLong March§!.\n\nAt this time, the United Front was reduced to only §WYunnan, Qinghai, and Gansu§! provinces. Some proposed retreating to the nearby northwest, but §RMao Zedong§! believed that the Ma family was deeply rooted in the northwest and had been uncooperative during the War of Resistance, instead actively opposing the Communists. The northwest lacked the revolutionary soil, and the Party should move to the southwest, where §R“the land is vast, and there is much to be done”§!.\n\nThus, the Party once again set out on a perilous journey. The land of China, in the final stages of the war, was extremely dangerous, but §RMao Zedong§! repeatedly led the Party out of danger. Near Chongqing, under Japanese occupation, the troops were bombed by Japanese aircraft. Mao Zedong ordered the troops to hide in the forest, and the pilots, unable to find their targets, blindly dropped two bombs and then returned to base.\n\nThe bombs were intercepted by the overlapping branches and exploded in the air, scattering fragments and startling the birds in the forest.\n\nOnly a few fragments fell among the troops, claiming the life of one person—§RMao Zedong§!."

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3:0 "When the troops, having endured countless hardships, finally reached Yunnan, they found that the situation had drastically changed—after the change of flag in the northwest, Yunnan could no longer hold out and had to make peace with the Japanese invaders. The new leader, §GLu Han§!, to curry favor with his Japanese masters, launched a massive campaign to arrest the anti-Japanese forces in the southwest. The Communist Party, leaderless and weary from the long march, expected to find rest but instead found itself in a new battle.\n\nHowever, as §RMao Zedong§! had predicted before his death, the people here harbored strong anti-Japanese sentiments, and the southwest was a remote border region difficult for the Japanese to reach. After initial losses, the Communist Party quickly established a foothold in Yunnan. New bases sprang up in the border jungles, new fighters, filled with anger, joined the ranks, and the southwest base successfully repelled Lu Han's several encirclement campaigns. Today, it is the largest revolutionary base in the country.\n\nBut the southwest base is not the only surviving flame. In §RNorthern Shaanxi§!, the Party organization left behind after the second Long March survived and even held its own against the “Republic of China”'s new army. Now, despite being surrounded by enemies, the Communist Party maintains a network of guerrilla zones across Northern Shaanxi, nestled between the Shanxi warlords, Mengjiang, and the Imperial Northwest Army.\n\nAnd in the northeast, the §RXinjiang Bureau§!, sent by the CCP in the 1940s, remains active in Sheng Shicai's small government. They do not face the severe armed struggle, but in this land so different from the central plains, the Communists appear isolated and weak…"

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4:0 "When the war situation turned unfavorable, not all §Gwarlords§! were willing to fight to the death under the banner of the United Front. Sheng Shicai, born in Liaoning but ultimately ruling Xinjiang, was well-versed in the art of opportunism. Since seizing military and political power in Xinjiang in the 1930s, Sheng Shicai had been maneuvering between the Nationalist government and the Soviet Union. Twenty years passed, the two great powers collapsed, and the New Order in East Asia was overshadowed by the rising sun flag. Sheng Shicai, however, continued to sit securely on the throne as the §RKing of Xinjiang§!, holding an appointment from the Nanjing government.\n\nJapan's control over this northwest frontier was nominal at best, allowing Sheng Shicai to play both sides by sheltering some anti-Japanese forces in Ürümqi and even incorporating them into the government. Fortune's wheel turned, and now, whether it's the §WNationalists§! or the §RCommunists§!, they all had to defer to Sheng Shicai.\n\nBut while the King of Xinjiang was complacent in his long-lasting rule, things were gradually slipping out of his control. In 1944, the conscription of horses from the herders triggered the §RThree Districts Revolution§! in Northern Xinjiang, and the uprising army was never fully suppressed. Meanwhile, in the newly incorporated troops under Sheng Shicai's command, §Wanti-Japanese sentiment§! and §Rsocialism§! were spreading, undoubtedly pushed by the Communists but rooted in the anguish felt by every soldier from the central plains over the loss of their homeland…"

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5:0 "The §R88th Guards Brigade§! is another legend on the post-war Russian land, showcasing extraordinary courage in resisting the fascists and tyrants of all Russia… This group of exiled foreigners has a winding story—§RMao Anying§!, the brigade commander of this honored unit, is the son of the giant who once led the Chinese Revolution—Mao Zedong. In his early years, he was sent to study in the Soviet Union. Then, the world war broke out. The union shattered, and his homeland fell, leaving him bereft of both his motherlands.\n\nHaving endured the bloody battles of Western Russia, crossed the frigid Siberian wastes, and reached Lake Baikal, the soldiers looked southward—only to realize their homeland had long fallen into the hands of the Japanese invaders. §RYagoda§! promised to assist the Chinese Revolution in an attempt to enlist them.\n\nThe 88th Brigade accepted Yagoda's reorganization and has since been stationed at Lake Baikal. As Yagoda's propaganda material and “model unit,” they received the best equipment and personnel supplements, but this was only to maintain the fragile Far Eastern state.\n\nFor years, the promise of returning home remained unfulfilled, so it was no surprise that when the people on the right bank of Lake Baikal rose in revolt, the 88th Brigade led the charge to overthrow the brutal Yagoda regime…\n\nWith the victory of the revolution, the long-exiled soldiers finally saw their wish fulfilled as they embarked on the journey home. Waiting for them on the long road ahead was an already unfamiliar §Rhomeland§!…"

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6:0 "Sheng Shicai's early rule brought rare peace and prosperity to Xinjiang. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Xinjiang implemented the “anti-imperialist, pro-Soviet, peace, integrity, construction, and ethnic equality” §Rsix major policies§!. In the minds of many progressives, Sheng Shicai was a rare “enlightened warlord.”\n\nBut after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Sheng Shicai tore off the “pro-communist” mask and launched a large-scale crackdown on communists. The §Rsix major policies§! were abolished, and their principles completely abandoned—ethnic minorities were marginalized, and the regime's focus shifted entirely to suppression and “stability maintenance.” Under the banner of “anti-Japanese and anti-communism,” corrupt officials colluded with landlords to oppress the people. Combined with the interruption of trade with the Soviet Union leading to shortages of consumer goods, Xinjiang's ethnic and class conflicts escalated to an unprecedented level…\n\nAll this finally culminated in the §RThree Districts Revolution§! of 1944—herders in Ili took up arms to resist the government's conscription of horses. The revolutionaries advanced rapidly, threatening the rule of the Ürümqi government. But with Sheng Shicai's restructured elite troops and the revolutionaries' lack of external support, the insurgents ultimately failed to capture Ürümqi. The survivors could only retreat to the far north, where Sheng Shicai's regime had little reach, to conduct prolonged guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe disappointment in Sheng Shicai's regime was not only among the laboring people. As Sheng Shicai fully abolished the six major policies, Xinjiang's §Gprogressive figures§! became thoroughly disillusioned with him. They formed the §G“Xinjiang Alliance for the Defense of Peace and Democracy”§! and secretly supported the revolutionaries."

COX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7:0 "The “Western Regions” were never the traditional borders of the central Chinese dynasties. The desolate scene depicted in “No Old Friends West of Yang Pass” still aptly describes the current isolation of the §RXinjiang§! region. Although some light industries were established in parts of Northern Xinjiang during Sheng Shicai's early rule, today agriculture still dominates Xinjiang's economy.\n\nSheng Shicai understood well that agriculture was the foundation of social stability in Xinjiang. Thus, during his twenty years in power, he never ceased to emphasize the repair of water conservancy and the development of agricultural production. However, as external and internal pressures faded, Sheng Shicai became increasingly fixated on merely maintaining his status as the §R“King of Xinjiang”§!. As progressive forces abandoned him, the corruption that had been suppressed began to grow, and landlords and corrupt officials usurped the government's authority, leading to the situation where §Rgovernment orders did not leave Ürümqi§!.\n\nWater taxes became another source of personal gain for officials, while the lifeline of agricultural production—the irrigation canals—rarely saw maintenance. Harvests declined year after year, yet the tax burden continued to increase. Many farmers had to sell their land and become tenant farmers. In many parts of Southern Xinjiang, the backward §Wserfdom§! not only persisted but became even more entrenched in this environment of excessive exploitation…\n\nThe revolutionaries will soon find that defeating Sheng Shicai is but the simplest step."
