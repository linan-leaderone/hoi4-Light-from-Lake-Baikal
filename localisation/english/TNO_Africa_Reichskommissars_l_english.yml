### Leader Descs ###
 POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_MULLER_DESC:0 "Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller is one of the Reich's most beloved media darlings: bold, charming and magnetic. The charismatic leader of Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika and the richest of the Reich's three African governors. A distinguished veteran of Poland, France, and Russia, Müller leads Zentralafrika to operate as the only colony that consistently turns over a profit for Germany, rather than committing near-treasons such as skimming profits or ripping off the Reich on a regular basis. His approach to the governance of Zentralafrika is charitably described as "Laissez-faire," and uncharitably described as "Almost total non-involvement": content to let foreign business concerns ravage the Kongo for all it's worth, while Zentralafrika's coffers grow fat with profits from the tolls of shipping. Meanwhile Müller's German men fritter away their tours of duty drinking themselves stupid, hunting anything that moves, humping anything that wears a skirt and gambling away their pay cheques. That is when they are not whoring themselves out as mercenaries to the other Reichskommissarats and anyone, foreign or German-it does not matter-willing to pay for cheap muscle.\n\nMüller's great passion is hunting, regularly taking long trips into the darkest bush to hunt all manner of great African game, and if he should stumble across partisans; then it becomes an opportunity to hunt the most dangerous game of all..."
 POLITICS_HANS_HUTTIG_DESC:0 "In all of the Reich, few names embody tenebrosity as stirringly as Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig. Once the overseeing commandant of brutal extermination camps during the war, Hüttig has devoted himself to ruthlessly fulfilling the National Socialist tradition over Ostafrika. Within labyrinthine camps of African slaves, and burgeoning swaths of revolting tribes he is seen a pernicious enigma of Nazi horror and a mathematician of ruination. For Hüttig himself, he prefers to see himself as the only German in Africa who sees the truth: Africa is a continent with a heart of utter darkness; and a fist of damascus steel must crush her subhuman evil.\n\nHüttig's sworn loyalty to the Reich, domestic brutality, and organizational competence has been proved time after time again. From ensuring an effective, pure government, employing only Germans and refusing to use African SS divisions, to the constant drill and battling of his elite garrison, bolstered by the former Anglo population of Rhodesia, Hüttig's rigid and militaristic society is more akin to a massive concentration camp than a colonial authority. Yet as his fellow governors leave their dominions to decadence and decay, they are seen as stars for their facsimiles of prosperity and undeserved wealth.\n\nIn return, Hüttig harbours nothing but contempt for his peers, solely communicating with Reich and planning for the inevitable conflicts within the south and the east himself. He has no disputes with the title affixed to him by foreign intelligence - the only Nazi in Africa. To him, Africa needs no one else."
 POLITICS_WOLFGANG_SCHENCK_DESC:0 "Once one of the Reich's most decorated fighting aces, Wolfgang Schenck's administration over Südwestafrika is wrought by the air. He is renowned in the fatherland for flying hundreds of combat missions and in the Luftwaffe he is distinguished for expertise in the development of bombers. Domestically, however, he presides over the poorest Reichskommissariat in Afrika, lacking an industrial base and relying on imports and gas fees for its runways. The burgeoning air force of the nation is his sole focus, as evident to anyone who ever looked over the Angolan horizon. His planes rule the sub-Saharan skies.\n\nOver the years, Schenck has ensured that Südwestafrika is the air hub of German Afrika. In other internal matters, he is known for his leniency and the close camaraderie he shares with fellow Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, who he often attends safaris with in his personal helicopters or joining in the hunt. Perhaps it is the refuge of the tropospheric clouds, away from affairs pertaining to natives or the SS, that attracts him to the skies. It is where solace lies."

 # Deprecated with UA
 #POLITICS_EMIL_MAURICE_DESC:0 "On one particular morning, a crowd of protestors surrounded the offices of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice, demanding basic welfare and at least some respect for human rights. In most other Reichskommissariats, these protests would be answered by a volley of open fire, and then a swift cleanup and denial of any activity against the State whatsoever. But when Maurice woke up and heard the rhythmic shouts of dissent, his only action was a meek request for the curtains to be closed. The fulminations soon dispersed after the building lay completely still.\n\nOnce the chauffeur and a personal favorite of Adolf Hitler, the inescapable, crippling apathy in Maurice seems to have begun to manifest after leaving the Reich in the fifties to oversee Madagascar, an appointment by the Führer amid accusations of clear non-Aryan elements in his racial heritage from the SS. Given the choice between an investigation into those elements or exile, he choose the later. Since his arrival in Toamasina, Maurice has shown little, if any, care for the internal affairs of the colony, forgoing meetings and ignoring the screams of those who would have his head all across the island. He has sent pleas to return to the only country he ever loved countless times, all of which have been ignored.\n\nThe outlook has only grown more nihilistic for Maurice as organized resistance strengthens and native Malagasy militias establish footholds in the central highlands, all while the militarists continue to estrange themselves with the administration. It is clear to those still loyal that an armed conflict looms near, and yet all he can show is indifference. All he dreams is for exile. He may have helped create this enormous house, but all he desires is to escape it. To be delivered from evil."

###EVENTS
 GERAF.2.t:0 "The Lifeline Is Cut"
 GERAF.2.desc:0 "The news of the Civil War in Germany shocked the world and sent many a politician scrambling, but none more so than Germany's loyal vassals in Africa.\n\nAlready having been in a constant state of unrest with the rising forces of African nationalism and the ever growing flames of Communist thought in the repressed people's there, the nations had more and more come to rely on the homeland for military and economic support in return for the massive output of colonial resources.\n\nWith Germany in flames, however, and the central government seemingly disappeared in the smoke, this support has suddenly disappeared. Already, slaves have disappeared from their barracks and insurgent groups across the Congo have begun a new wave of attacks."
 GERAF.2.a:0 "No need to... panic, stay calm, STAY CALM!"

 GERAF.3.t:0 "The New Age of Resistance"
 GERAF.3.desc:0 "As the situation in the African Reichskommissars has deteriorated, the various rebels that the regimes have been battling for twenty years have faced their greatest string of successes yet. Multiple military posts and plantations across Africa have disappeared as the rebels have gotten bolder and bolder in their strikes, and Göringstadt has become swarmed with panicked refugees as independent farmers and settlers have abandoned their homesteads in the wake of this new invasion.\n\nWith rebel control of the countryside and the noose slowly tightening on the central cities of the colonies, it is clear that the Reichskommissars days may be numbered."
 GERAF.3.a:0 "What did we ever do to deserve this?!"

 GERAF.4.t:0 "Afrika-Schild"
 GERAF.4.desc:0 "With the situation spiraling out of control, drastic action clearly became necessary for the survival of the German states in Africa. While the three colonies of Ostafrika, Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika had always had friendly relations, their interactions had never been much further, and they had maintained separate security forces, administration, and Reichskommissars.\n\nWhile this situation has worked well enough with the central administration in Germania to manage the colonies, now that said administration has seemingly shattered, it is clear that action needs to be taken.\n\nAfrika-Schild is the proposed solution, a united defense alliance and a centralized military administration, the alliance may be our only chance to save our domains from utter collapse."
 GERAF.4.a:0 "All for one and one for all!"
 GERAF.4.b:0 "We are doing perfectly fine on our own!"

 GERAF.7.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.7.desc:0 "Although our brave soldiers have made large gains, this war has perhaps dragged on for too long. With our current position in the war, it would be trivial to get the South Africans and their American allies to agree to an offer of a ceasefire, on our terms of course. However, it might be wise to push on, as Endsieg seems to draw closer and closer"
 GERAF.7.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.7.b:0 "We will push on!"

 GERAF.8.t:0 "The South Africans Refuse"
 GERAF.8.desc:0 "It seems that we have underestimated the South Africans willingness to make a deal, as they have replied that they have no intention of agreeing to our generous offer of a ceasefire. This matters little of course, Endsieg will come to the Reich eventually"
 GERAF.8.a:0 "So be it"

 GERAF.9.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.9.desc:0 "As this war drags on longer and longer, some of our advisors have begun to push for an offer of a neutral ceasefire to be presented to the South Africans and their American allies. While wi might have scoffed at such ideas before, perhaps we have better things to worry about. On the other hand, Endsieg might be just out of reach"
 GERAF.9.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.9.b:0 "We will push on!"

 GERAF.10.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.10.desc:0 "As we lose more land by the day under the enemy advance, many of our advisors and even some commanders have demanded that we offer a ceasefire to the South Africans and their American allies. While we would lose a large amount of territory as a result of such a ceasefire, perhaps it would prove to be the best course of action in the long run. But perhaps the one thing keeping us from Endsieg is our lack of will."
 GERAF.10.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.10.b:0 "We will push on!"

 GERAF.11.t:0 "Activate Werewolves"
 GERAF.11.desc:0 "As the South Africans and their American masters push farther and farther into our territory, we are presented with a unique opportunity. As is standard for all Reichskommissariats, we have established our own units of werwolf partisan fighters who will cause chaos and confusion behind enemy lines. We shall make them pay dearly for every inch of ground they take."
 GERAF.11.a:0 "They shall strike from the shadows"

 GERAF.12.t:0 "Werewolves return"
 GERAF.12.desc:0 "Due to driving the invaders from our own territory, we have managed to link up with our werewolf units. While many are battered and bruised they are still stoic in doing their duty for the fatherland, they shall be commended."
 GERAF.12.a:0 "Their service shall be remembered."

 GERAF.13.t:0 "Die Geloof Offensief"
 GERAF.13.desc:0 "Our military commanders have drawn up plans for a bold and surprising offensive, nicknamed Die Geloof Offensief, or the Promise Day Offensive. The plan involves gathering and organizing all of our brave partisans into cohesive units. Once assembled they shall be used on a grand offensive starting on the 16th of December. We hope that this will catch the enemy completely by surprise, although this will noticeably decrease the effectiveness of our partisans."
 GERAF.13.a:0 "Execute the plan!"
 GERAF.13.b:0 "We would rather not take such a risk"

 GERAF.20.t:0 "Pounce on South Africa!"
 GERAF.20.desc:0 "While Afrika-Schild has proven fruitful, and we have scored a choice few victories against the rebel forces, the situation has still not recovered. Still, we lose more and more land every day to the cursed partisans.\n\nThe solution seems to have fallen into our laps. An invasion of South Africa has been suggested constantly in different forms for the past twenty years, and we have gone so far as to keep a steady stream of arms and weaponry, with the Reich's approval and support, going to the Boer's to help them with their struggle. This finally seems to have found fruit, as with the situation in South Africa also deteriorating, the Boers have declared their independence from the South African government.\n\nIt is unsure if their rebellion will see much fruit, but if we were to support them in their struggle, we could find a strong ally to help us against our own insurgents. The other fear is that if we allow the Boers to go to the wolves, the OFN will most likely support the South African government, and then we'd have our enemies at our doorstep. America is cautious however, no doubt if we join the Boers, the Yankees and their pets would be too afraid of conflict with the mighty Reich to try and stop the events."
 GERAF.20.a:0 "The Reich does not bow, it rules!"
 GERAF.20.b:0 "We'll find some other solution..."

 GERAF.21.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.21.desc:0 "It is over. The Americans and the OFN have proven far more eager to hop into another war, and despite the bravery and ferocity of our fighting boys, the betrayal of the local partisans has sabotaged our war effort and ultimately caused us to fail to take our objectives. The only thing that stopped our complete capitulation to the hordes of barbarous Americans and their South African allies was the support from the homeland, which had barely managed to return things to a standstill.\n\nWith America seemingly exhausted by the bloody nose our superior forces gave them, and with our militaries desperately needed to refocus back home, we have accepted the American offer of a ceasefire, though have refused their petty offers for peace. While this will hurt the Reichskommissars, especially the massive landgrab on the part of the OFN, perhaps the shrinking of the borders will ultimately prove to be a good thing for our security."
 GERAF.21.a:0 "Peace with honor..."

 GERAF.22.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.22.desc:0 "It seems that the South Africans and their American allies were suffering just as much as we were. Our offer of a neutral ceasefire has been accepted. as South Africa and America proved to lack the will to pursue a war against our superior German tactics and equipment. Although we have suffered heavily through this war, the same can also be said of the Americans, who now face a growing peace movement in their nation.\n\nNow we must turn our attention to other matters, while we have been successful at managing the increased amount of resistance so far, it is never a good idea to get complacent."
 GERAF.22.a:0 "Now, to more pressing matters"

 GERAF.23.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.23.desc:0 "When the news of the South Africans accepting the ceasefire finally came to our headquarters the officers had special cases of aged wine brought up to celebrate. Once again the superiority of the German way of warfare is displayed to the entire world. The Americans, forced to flee from our superior forces with their tails behind their backs, come home to a massive anti-war movement our victory is all but total.\n\nNow we must turn our attention to managing and advise the new Afrikaner Volkstaat, to ensure that they too reap the all the benefits of superior German administration, as well as to ensure that they realize how much they owe to the Reich, and their obligation to pay it all back with interest."
 GERAF.23.a:0 "Another victory for the Reich!"

 GERAF.24.t:0 "The South African War: Victory!"
 GERAF.24.desc:0 "As the last helicopters evacuating whatever is left of the American forces in South Africa leave, it finally dawns on the remaining South Africans, they lost. Whit this final victory the Reich's dominance over Africa is all but assured. The loyal Boers are fine subjects, and worthy of being given the majority of South African land. Of course, it will be necessary to help this young government through its troubled beginnings, and we will be providing our best advisors on the matters of domestic policy and trade. Once again, the superiority of the Reich is made apparent. Now, if only those Africans would learn the same lesson we just taught the Americans"
 GERAF.24.a:0 "The Reich's superiority is total!"

 GERAF.26.t:0 "Deja Vu"
 GERAF.26.d:0 "After our stunning victory against the uncivilized hordes of American and South African soldiers, we quickly moved into the territories of the former Dominion of South Africa. Our economic analysts, the ones that were personally trained by Göring himself, predicted that by fueling the economy with the fires of war and supplementing that with the spoils from our new conquests, would ensure that our previously rather collapsing mp economies would explode into massive growth.\n\nThose economists were shot today, as the news of another slave plantation being burned down by ANC resistance fighters reached the headquarters of Afrika-Schild. The supposed "Wealth of Africa" with which we were supposed to save our budgets has, unfortunately, seemingly vanished with the evacuated South African government.\n\nThe Afrikaner Volkstaat, our client state administering what was once South Africa, has proven itself to be less than successful at capitalizing on the economic base that exists there. Soon after their government was established the various militia groups that made up the Boer army, once united against their common enemies, soon fractured into cliques centered around powerful generals with the main contention between them being the Boers relationship to us, with a growing force of Afrikaans military men declaring that they will refuse to bend the knee to a German just like they refused to do so to an Anglo... While tensions are dormant for now, they will not remain so for long\n\nWhile they may be uncivilized, the ferocity and skill of these African resistance fighters is undeniable. But what is truly keeping us down is the newfound cooperation between the ANC and the few rouge South African army units still active.\n\nWhile the ANC might previously have been described as a highly motivated but lightly equipped force of revolutionaries, the second part of that sentence must be removed now that they have access to military grade hardware and training. It seems that the supposed "Economic miracle of war" was just an illusion."
 GERAF.26.a:0 "Damn it all to hell!"

 GERAF.27.t:0 "The Ides of March"
 GERAF.27.d:0 "During the middle of the night, in a secluded field in the German colony of Zentralafrika, a plane takes off. Its crew will never return. Inside is former Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, he flees from what appears to be death itself. A few hours later the plane lands in Anjou, the capital of free France. There Müller is met with a warm welcome by his closest friend and newly declared head of the military junta that now leads Free France, Jaques Massu.\n\nA few days earlier Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig invited Müller and Reichskommissar Schenck of Südwest-Afrika to a celebration of their mutual victory over the American swine. Schenck, being located closer to Hüttigs manor, arrived first. He would never return. Müllers spies had warned him only a few hours before he arrived at Hüttigs estate that Hans was planning to murder them both. Unwilling to pursue a war against the elite forces under the command of Hüttig, Müller decided that his time as leader of Zentralafrika was over, and fled the country.\n\nNow the sole remaining figure of German authority in the region is Hans Hüttig, the butcher of Africa. As he took control of all of the German colonies in Africa he announced the creation of the Großafrikanischer Reichsstaat, a new administration which would ensure that the proper ideals of national-socialism would be enforced over Africa.\n\nLittle news leaves the Reichsstaat, but what comes out is horrifying. Entire regions "pacified" by Hurtings fanatical SS soldiers. Slave labor camps that stretch on for kilometers. And a total dedication to eradication any shred of resistance that remains in Africa."
 GERAF.27.a:0 "For Hüttig!"

He stared longingly at the various trophies on his wall; it had been a while since he could really enjoy himself and let off some steam, and they were already starting to collect dust. His daydreaming about his next prey was interrupted by the knocking on his door.\n\n"Hm? Who's there?"\n\n"Herr Müller? Are you available at this time?"\n\n"I suppose I am." Müller straightened himself in his seat, fully expecting a wave of bad news to hit him. "Come in."\n\nA nervous aide sheepishly poked the door open, holding a stack of reports that had the admiralty's insignia sprawled over them. Müller already knew what the reports were about from the demeanor of the aide. He now had the unfortunate task of wasting his afternoon and reading them.\n\n"Herr Müller, I am afraid to report that our fishing vessels were disrupted and mostly destroyed by the Brazilian navy. I am sure that this is a great inconvenience to you, and that I wil-" Müller waved the aide off before he could say anything else, and the aide readily took the cue to give off a shaky salute before retreating out of the room. How was he going to break the news to the elite in Germania that seafood was going to double, maybe triple in price? He'd have one hell of a time figuring that out, and there was going to be plenty of yelling and arguing. Müller certainly didn't look forward to it."

 COG_Lobster_War.2.desc:0 "With his hands against the outside of the ship's cabin, Hans looked to the three other brave fishermen leaning there with him. At least, brave in his country. Here, they were nothing more than crooks, and the Brazilian walking up and down their line armed with a rifle was more than enough to solidify Hans' position as little more than a thief. Their ship had been caught totally off guard by the Brazilian destroyer, and even now its soldiers were running around the lower decks like ants in search of food. With the abundance of Crabbing gear stored below decks, those insects were bound to find something to sate their appetite, not to mention justifying their boarding of the ship.\n\nIt was then that yelling from below deck confirmed Hans' worst fears and broke him out of his inner monologue. A pair of the soldiers ran down the stairs greased with the Atlantic's waters, while another ran up. Returning to what any sailor could recognize as the soldier's captain, the pair exchanged some words in presumably Portuguese, and the captain pulled at the collar of Hans' captain, Karl.\n\n"You are not supposed to be here, you know this?" The Brazilian threw Hans' captain to the deck, water splashing against the shoes of the men still standing as though in a firing line.\n\n"Yes," Karl flatly retorted. Standing up, Karl grimaced at his soaked pants, then looked back to the Brazilian captain. "We know what you think of us, and we know you'll do nothing." The Brazilian captain seemed taken aback, then his frown returned to his face. "Fine. Have it your way, Herr captain." The captain spat in a mocking tone, as the crackle of a radio could be heard from behind Hans, as the Brazilian spoke in great urgency, not that anyone on the ship understood it. As the crackle stopped, and words managed its way out of the plastic brick, the Brazilian spoke again. "You have one minute to be escorted back to Africa, or we ram you at 30 knots. Final offer.""

When he left Germany to take on this job, he was seriously skeptical about how lucrative it could actually be, but Lukas had made a fortune and then some from this fishing contract. As he approached his vessel, he noticed his captain with a worried look on his face, which was never a good thing. Lukas walked up and gave the captain a firm salute, but the captain barely responded with one of his own.\n\n"Men, I have some bad news for you all today. Our contract's been cancelled. Completely."\n\nThe shock barely registered with Lukas and his shipmates. Cancelled? They were bringing in 40 crates of seafood per trip: how could that not be profitable? "Captain, why is it cancelled? We've been fishing well over our quota, and I can't see any reason why." The captain turned his back and stared at the sea for a second, before letting out a deep sigh. "The Reichskommissariat has strongly suggested that we stop fishing in Brazilian waters." The crew shared several incredulous looks before the captain continued, "Believe me, boys. I'm just as dumbfounded as you all are. Even though things have been peaceful, there's no guarantee it will stay that way. You boys will need to find new jobs. It was a pleasure to serve alongside you all."\n\nThe entire crew stared blankly into the sea that they would no longer traverse."

Müller had been dealing with another boring day of paperwork when the report on how Brazil's navy was unable to even deal with some poorly armed and untrained fishermen. An official apology on top of sustained and significant damage to the ragtag pieces of iron they dare call a navy was too much for the Reichskommissar to bear. His stomach began to hurt, and he was nearly doubled over in his chair when the door to his office was kicked in. A shocked aide and guard barged in, but Müller couldn't help himself to stop laughing and wheezing, his face a crimson red.\n\n"Herr Müller! Is everything alright? We were worried about how long you've been, well... laughing."\n\n"I am fine, you fools! Why did you kick my goddamned door down?" The pair looked in horror at the door, but Müller finally stopped his laughing to raise a hand to calm the two. "No worries! I'll call Hans later to get that repaired. You are both dismissed."\n\nLike a schoolgirl reading a love story, Müller couldn't wait about what the report was going to tell him next. At this rate, was Brazil going to pay for the damages caused to the fishing boats? Müller couldn't help but flip through the reports to see what lengths Brazil was bending to the Reichskommissariat. The roars of laughter resumed shortly, and Müller slapped his desk several times to try and brace himself from the next round of laughter."

Were his admirals really supposed to be that confident in a bunch of civilian fishermen? Müller was lost in thought until he heard a knock on his door. It lacked confidence, much like himself.\n\n"Herr Müller? The admirals have an update for you." The aide entered the room, and let a single manila envelope on his desk before ducking out immediately. Müller ripped open the file like a dog who hadn't eaten in a week, only to see one word stand out immediately: defeated. The fishing boats were apprehended and forced back to Zentralafrika by the Brazilian navy, and there were plenty of casualties on the German side of things, while the Brazilians barely sustained any.\n\nThe humiliation was immense for Müller and Zentralafrika. He dreaded the letter he would have to send back to Germania and the Führer. Simply put, there was no good way to phrase this embarrassment, and the Reich's main source of seafood was now cut off completely. Müller massaged his temple and tried to forget about this whole incident. Thank god he had scheduled a hunting trip earlier this week, he thought. The upcoming days would be nigh unbearable without it."

Thing is, Brazil's not hurting for cash, is it? They don't have to scrape by, otherwise their funding is cut by rich uncle Germany hanging an axe over their head, do they?" Uwe spoke up from his seeming concern over his own cards. "Well, yes, but Brazil isn't exactly 'rolling in the dough' either, now are they? Have you seen what half their politics tend to look like?"\n\n"Fair enough, but there comes a point where we're entitled to some of this stuff, right?" Hans countered. "There's got to be some kind of a theft-to-righteous-claim ratio we've got the right to." Klaus and Uwe sat silent for a moment. Klaus spoke up. "Well, I'd imagine that's up for the powers at large to discuss the specifics of, no?"\n\nUwe snapped his fingers, and readjusted his posture.

Lo and behold, looking at the list for the past few weeks, there was a steady uptick of fishing trawlers, bizarrely. Bingo. That was the American expression, wasn't it?\n\nLeaning against the wall of the office, Jean lit a cheap cigarette he managed to haggle from a Belgian businessman. Not that the interaction was easy to go through, of course he tried to sell the tobacco for more than it was worth, but that was to be expected coming from any stuffy Belgian, bitter as they were, and it certainly didn't help matters that the Belgian was selling something to a native. Even still, that didn't matter now. What did matter, however, was why fishing trawlers -of all boats to come in for repairs- were flooding into the ports. Jean snickered to himself, took another drag on his cigarette. Next were the exact documents on what the damages were, specifically. Opening the filing cabinet's correlating drawer, it came as a surprise that there weren't actually any folders from the last months. There weren't any from the last year and a half, in fact. Not even that the files weren't put in place in the first place, there had to be some kind of files registered, this wasn't exactly Schenck's hellhole after all, but even the folders themselves keeping the cabinet organized were gone.\n\nAcross the office, the elevator to the floor dinged. Jean took a last drag on his cigarette. Hastily throwing the registration files back into place, Jean made a run back towards the stairs towards the back of the office block looking across the south Atlantic. Having run down the emergency exit, Jean took a moment to look out across the grand ocean, as he felt a determination grip him like an iron vice.

 COG_Lobster_War.9.desc:0 "Something that Arthur had come to learn about shuffling papers in Müller's name, was that the benefits of choosing what happened and what didn't -at least so far as anyone in Germania was concerned- were so absolutely great, that there was no comparison in the world. Sometimes, sitting in his musty office in god-knows-where, Afrika, was one of the most exhilarating experiences of his life. A thousand different "enterprising individuals" had all asked him for one favor or another, making some things disappear, or some others come into being, all for a reasonable fee, of course. The problem always came with "balancing the budget"- or rather, making up a budget that waved away all the corruption. So, when the notion of including the profits in crabbing within Brazil's waters came to mind, it was practically the perfect crime. Namely, that Arthur didn't actually need to state just how much profit had been accrued from the expeditions. If he handled it right, then it was entirely possible that Arthur could open up who-knows how much more operating room in his little "operation". The problem remained, however, that Arthur didn't know how Germania thought of such expeditions. Did they see it as illegal? They definitely knew about it, there was no way they couldn't have. If it was illegal, then Germania would have already cracked down on the operations. Did they decide to just look the other way? If so, then the bureaucrats in Germania didn't want a reason to know it was going on. Arthur took out the almanac of any respectable bureaucrat; the phone book.\n\n"Hello, Arthur Davies of Zentralafrikan bookkeeping speaking, would you be able to tell me of the legality of crabbing within Brazilian waters? Where does Germany stand on it exactly?" A pause between lines. "Uhmm... I'm not sure if this is the place to call. Have you tried the..."\n\nArthur took a moment to breathe. It was now midnight.

Standing in the middle of the emergency meeting of the sailors and fishermen deep within Brazilian waters, the tension had been growing steadily since Ernst first walked into the dank room with a look of disappointment in his eyes, and a feeling of dread in his gait. Walking up to the one chair set in the middle of the room, Ernst leaned against the back of the strong oak, looking out at the assembled hardly-under-a-dozen sailors surrounding him. "It's no wonder why we're all here. God only knows how long it's been since we left German waters, and even he doesn't know how long since our friends in the government said that Brazil's waters are officially off-limits. Why we're still here is obviously not up to debate so much as narrowing down specifics." Ernst gestured to one of the two mercenaries just walking in on the impromptu meeting. "The necessity of a greater security presence has also gone not without notice, we've all met Hank, after all, haven't we?"

"I understand, Klaus, I've heard it before from a dozen other people in this office, and they've all left happy. I'm not about to break that streak, so indulge me for a moment. Do yourself a favor, listen, and it'll only help you."\n\nKlaus seemed to be one of the more respectable Germans to work under Fischer's auspices, collared shirt, a proper German family, the whole nine yards. This came at the cost, then, of Klaus forcing himself into looking for greater pay. An admirable ambition, until it started digging into Fischer's pockets.\n\n"What I don't understand is why you want out. You get good pay, your job security is secure as ever -regardless of recent events- and you're one of my most valued trawlers. So why?" Klaus let out a deep sigh and leaned against Fischer's desk.\n\n"Because, Reinhard, I can't pay for food. You haven't been paying me, assuming you haven't forgotten, and if you do not pay me, I do not work." Fischer unblinkingly stared at Klaus and leaned forward.\n\n"You leave now, and I don't pay you."

Schramme seems to be taking in plenty of us expendable labor nowadays, and I've always been welcome in his home. I only expect that to continue."

"Maurice, that's an hour, I get a smoke break." Already in the midst of an argument with one of the sous-chefs, Maurice simply flashed a thumbs up. "Dannielle, you're taking over on tables twelve, fourteen, and sixteen, twelve has a lovely pair which is looking for seafood, and I told them I'd talk with the chef, could you handle that for me?"
