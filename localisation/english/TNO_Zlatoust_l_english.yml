 ZLT_Yevgeny_Dragunov: "Yevgeny Dragunov"
 POLITICS_YEVGENY_DRAGUNOV_DESC: "The scion of a long line of Russian gunsmiths, lead practically flows through Yevgeny Fyodorovich Dragunov's veins. He took up the family profession in his youth, and soon applied those skills to the service of the Motherland as a senior armorer in the Red Army. He was fortunate enough to be stationed in the Siberian city of Zlatoust, far away from the carnage of the front lines. However, Dragunov's fortune would not end there, as the dreadful wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union left Dragunov as the de facto mayor over the city. Dragunov led Zlatoust in upscaling the arms manufacturing industry, becoming its main export, allowing the city to claim immense profits in the bloodbaths the Russians would wage against one another in the years to come. Dragunov's fortunes only grew larger when the esteemed engineer Mikhail Kalashnikov arrived in his city, where the two secured a close friendship and a profitable fusion of their technical skills to design the greatest weapons the Russian people had ever seen.\n\nUnlike many of the other warlords in post-Soviet Russia, Dragunov has no delusions of grandeur about reuniting the Union or sacking Germania. He certainly wouldn't mind those, but he's more preoccupied with profit than anything else. Zlatoust has become an island of prosperity and stability in a sea of chaos thanks to its arms trade, and he intends to keep it that way. There are few people he would refuse to sell to, and he's always eager to find more customers. In the coming years, he expects business to be positively booming..."

 ZLT_golden_republic_desc: "With the Urals acting as our wall against the reach of the German Reich, and dozens of Russian warlords vying for power in this contended wasteland, there remains a chance for men and women of this country to make a sizable profit. Many have accused the arms trading ways of our state to be unethical, exploitative, and dangerous; however, what has torn them apart has built ourselves up, providing our citizens just a bit of light in these dark times."
 ZLT_the_two_consuls: "The Two Consuls"
 ZLT_the_two_consuls_desc: "Yevgeny Dragunov and Mikhail Kalashnikov - the two figures around which our Republic revolves. Under their leadership we have become an oasis of peace in this sea of conflict, even though we had to fuel some of that conflict ourselves. As the old maxim goes however, si vis pacem, para bellum."

 ZLT_stocking_up: "Stocking Up"

 ZLT_zlatoust_security_forces_desc: "Ever since our founding, we have held the soldiers of Zlatoust to the highest esteem. We have given them our finest weapons and hired the finest officers to lead them. Now they are fully prepared to defend our noble republic against all interlopers."
 ZLT_final_defenses: "Final Defensive Preparations"
 ZLT_final_defenses_desc: "Conflict is a trait inherent to human nature. President Dragunov saw this truth when they based Zlatoust's economy on selling weapons. But this truth also means that inevitably some warlord will come seeking to conquer and steal the great wealth of our republic. So we shall prepare for this inevitability by building forts, digging entrenchments, and drawing up defensive strategies. With these preparations, no army will be able to desecrate our lands."

### Focus Trees ###
 ZLT_speculation_and_accumulation: "Speculation and Accumulation"
 ZLT_speculation_and_accumulation_desc: "Russia is a harsh, harsh place. Warlords rise and fall, governments come into power and get overthrown within the same day and the common Russian is starving in a hut on a piece of land controlled by a nameless warlord. Despite these unfortunate events, our arms industry has been constantly thriving, with people flocking to our nation in droves to work and serve the Republic. We churn out cheap reliable designs constantly and our business is always in the black, no matter what occurs. Our republic is a light in the darkness of the Siberian wastes, and as long as our citizens and our business prosper, the Republic will prosper. One of the most important aspects of running a successful business, however, is a plan, and with the fate of West Russia growing ominously each passing day, our best course of action is to review our said plan and see what we'll need to improve to fulfill the needs of our citizens and our customers."

 ZLT_stock_up: "Stock Up"
 ZLT_stock_up_desc: "With so many battles and wars being waged all around us, we have constant orders of rifles, anti-aircraft guns, rockets, shells, and munitions to keep track of. While these operations have been unprecedentedly successful, some cracks have, unfortunately, began to gleam in the foundations of our industry. The continuous flow of orders has grown difficult, and hundreds of workers and pieces of machinery have been lost on the assembly line, sometimes because of exhaustion, and sometimes they just fall apart. If this strain continues to plague us, our production could come screeching to a halt, losing our claim to the Republic and any sense of prosperity we've built up for so long. Constructing a stockpile of industrial materials and weaponry would make sure that we always have something to sell while keeping ourselves supplied, should our rivals decide to meet us on the front lines."

 ZLT_the_frontlines: "The Frontlines"
 ZLT_the_frontlines_desc: "Siberia is a brutal region. Only the strong survive, and only those who forge the tools for the strong will prosper. The Free City of Zlatoust is surrounded by bandits, mercenaries and revolutionary fools whose egos and militias believe they have the right to call themselves a "nation." Despite this dangerous position, however, we have managed to secure several advantages: the Yugran thugs and bandits to the north offer extremely lucrative profits, while the juntas and dictatorships surrounding us are some of our most loyal customers. While we have secured a stable position, it's time that the Republic reorganizes its operations and renegotiates some of the dealings with our partners to keep customers coming, citizens safe and profits soaring."

 ZLT_flex_our_muscle: "Flex Our Muscles"
 ZLT_flex_our_muscle_desc: "Some of our neighbors have been getting a bit bold with us. Payments are being delayed, the raids on the borders seem to be getting more and more frequent, and petty bandit gangs attempt to steal whatever weapons and ammunition they can from our stockpiles. The Republic needs to show those around it that we are not some warlord. We are a proud republic that is one of the few safe places in this harsh region. The Republic of Zlatoust is not to be trifled with, and we will keep our people safe and our bottom line intact no matter the cost."

 ZLT_control_the_roads: "Control the Roads"
 ZLT_control_the_roads_desc: "The Luftwaffe bombings, while very limited in our area due to our thriving anti-aircraft gun production, still hit our roads, especially in the borderlands. Our infrastructure is our most important aspect, and we need to rebuild what is destroyed and repave what has been worn down. To rebuild these roads, however, we need money. One supplementary source of revenue we could use for rebuilding are the toll systems across the country. However, with citizens seizing control of the toll stations or bandits raiding them for money, they have become defunct in recent years. Sending in the police will guarantee the safety of our roads, while securing the funds the Republic needs from each and every traveller passing through. In the end, this protection will guarantee the smooth delivery of our products."

 ZLT_the_yugra_connection: "The Yugra Connection"
 ZLT_the_yugra_connection_desc: "The Republic has always had a good relationship with the Yugrans, but lately with the bandit raids and the mobs of brigands that have been crossing their border into ours, we have hit a rough patch. Sending the Republic's best diplomats will be a great way to reaffirm our good intentions and will hopefully allow us to discuss a new treaty. This proposed concordat would establish a mutual alliance between the Republic and the Yugrans, along with several economically beneficent clauses, and a signature of mutual defense. We need as many friends as we can get in this harsh world, and the Yugrans are our best bet."

 ZLT_a_mercenary_state: "A Mercenary State"
 ZLT_a_mercenary_state_desc: "Our glorious republic musters a small, but highly trained and exceptionally equipped army. However, with the deterioration of the situation in the west, and with many warlords wanting to expand and even unify Russia, we need to increase our defensive capabilities. We have a limited manpower pool, so hiring mercenaries, specifically from Yugra, wouldn't be a bad idea. By spending some coin to hire, equip and house a group of mercenaries, we will keep our men out of unnecessary combat and have an expendable force to police our borders and attack any bandits that try to steal from our stockpiles."

 ZLT_pay_to_pass: "Pay to Pass"
 ZLT_pay_to_pass_desc: "The Republic is the light in the darkness of Russia, and we offer what many warlords around cannot: stability, safety, prosperity, and liberty. If we show those who surround us these values we stand by, many will flock to us. This should be a priority, as more immigration means more workers, more soldiers, more scientists and more people to boost our population. The Republic needs to grow, and the more our brethren come in, the more we can grow and flourish in this wasteland. Propaganda leaflets and signs along our most traveled roadways would help convince travelers to stay in Zlatoust and contribute their skills to the Republic."

 ZLT_free_to_stay: "Free to Stay"
 ZLT_free_to_stay_desc: "Zlatoust has one of the most advanced and well kept infrastructure systems in all of Russia. We are a major transport hub of goods and people between the various warlords, and a good way to take advantage of this situation would be to open up our roads to other states, for a price of course. By allowing our neighbors to pay to pass through our area we can have a source of constant, lucrative income for as long as trade continues, and perhaps entice some people to stay..."

 ZLT_guns_for_the_men: "Guns for the Men"
 ZLT_guns_for_the_men_desc: "The recent influx of new troops and mercenaries has led us to require more weapons to arm them. Our industry is struggling to keep up without sacrificing some of our other profitable production lines. Diverting our industry, for the short term at least, is the only solution we have. We will limit production of artillery, rockets and tanks and shift them over to the AK-47M. Another plan the administration has drafted is the purchasing of older, outdated weaponry from bandits and warlords looking to acquire some quick cash. It will be quicker, but it may leave some of our newer recruits disadvantaged in terms of firepower."

 ZLT_theres_always_a_price: "Theres Always a Price"
 ZLT_theres_always_a_price_desc: "As a beacon of capitalist spirit in Siberia, numerous corporations run weapons factories and function as the backbone of our economy. We normally let most companies proceed without intervention, but this time something has gone wrong. One of our T-55 factories has fallen silent, as most warlords can't afford to use armor. Hundreds are out of work, but the government has a solution. We will buy the factory, retool it to make more profitable and restore the jobs of the men and women who have been out of work."

 ZLT_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns: "We're the Only Ones Selling Guns"
 ZLT_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns_desc: "The Republic has been blessed with a vast amount of wood, steel and technical knowledge, which allowed us to start our massive arms industry. The Luftwaffe rarely flies over our country, due to our vast anti-air defenses and the presence of the Free Aviators nearby. This has allowed us to consolidate our position in these dangerous wastes. Furthermore, our security has allowed us to gain a monopoly of the arms industry against all of our neighbors, as each and every single one of them know that only we can produce high quality weapons in a massive quantity. Our reputation of cheap, rugged, and effective equipment draws buyers from across Russia. We have consolidated out position, and it is about time that we start to review our processes. We will take our profits and work on developing new rifles, tanks, and artillery pieces to enhance our portfolio, and improve our industrial methods so we can make our weapons faster and cheaper than anyone else can."

 ZLT_the_siberian_mediator: "The Siberian Mediator"
 ZLT_the_siberian_mediator_desc: "The Republic is well loved throughout Russia, though this more comes out of our business dealings than a genuine alliance. We are a neutral nation, and unlike the Front, the Tsar, or our neighbors to the east, the Republic has no desire to unify Russia. Our neutrality puts us in a unique position. By establishing offices and departments which communicate with other warlords, we can keep them from completely annihilating one another unnecessarily. This reorganization will also help business, because if we allow these mediations to happen here, we can skim the top of these deals for our pleasantries as a host."

 ZLT_the_bullish_charge: "The Bullish Charge"
 ZLT_the_bullish_charge_desc: "Our shining Republic is the only government of its kind in Western Siberia. We are surrounded by authoritarian governments, fiefdoms, and squabbling military men. A way for us to increase our immigration, and in turn our workforces, is to distribute leaflets and other forms of pro-government media to our citizens and the surrounding population, so they can see how and why we are a more wealthy, stable, and prosperous option in this cold and harsh world."

 ZLT_dig_in: "Dig In"
 ZLT_dig_in_desc: "We have no desire to reunify Siberia under our flag, let alone Russia. Our profits are made from conflict and us staying out of it. By increasing patrols, constructing forts and increasing the size of our military, we will be able to protect the sovereignty of our shining republic from the various rabble-rousers around us, who want to loot our armories and plunder our wealth."

 ZLT_sell_off_our_stock: "Sell Off Our Stock"
 ZLT_sell_off_our_stock_desc: "The recent projects to improve the living standard of our citizens have sapped our treasury, and it would be a good idea to look into other forms of making money, other than selling our weapons to other nations. By selling our surplus weaponry to private security firms, we will be able to boost our profits conventionally, while selling to more... "extraordinary" clients will get us some "off the books" earnings as well."

 ZLT_the_yugran_defense: "The Yugran Defense"
 ZLT_the_yugran_defense_desc: "Us and our neighbors, the Yugrans, have common interests. We both seek to survive in the rough waters of Western Siberia, and we both want to fulfill our interests without meddling from other warlords with more conventional power. We will send one of the best diplomats in our republic to see if we can write an agreement of mutual defense, so both of our nations will be able to continue on our paths with a sense of security."

 ZLT_fortify_zlatoust: "Fortify Zlatoust"
 ZLT_fortify_zlatoust_desc: "Our republic's shining capital and industrial center are in a precarious position. While we are in the mountains, which is very defensible terrain, we border a significant amount of neighbors, and the best way to secure the safety and stability of the republic is to build up defenses in and around the city. Mines, bunkers, pillboxes and anti-tank guns will all be prepared and maintained so our citizens and workers and rest easy, knowing that they and their families are safe."

 ZLT_the_all_russian_contractor: "The All-Russian Contractor"
 ZLT_the_all_russian_contractor_desc: "Just because our republic doesn't seek to raise its flag over the Kremlin, doesn't mean that we do not want to show our influence in other ways. By offering our men and time to the petty bandit kings and old Soviet generals surrounding us, we can gain extra funds and we can give our men real combat experience, without exposing the republic to any of the conventional repercussions of war."

 ZLT_surpassing_forecasts: "Surpassing Forecasts"
 ZLT_surpassing_forecasts_desc: "Our Republic is rich, strong, and thriving. Every machine of war, from the Kalashnikovs to the RPG-7s to the T-64s are being produced at a record rate and exported across the vast wastes of Russia. Our beacon of democracy provides a light in the darkness of this cold world. Now that we have secured the republic's position in the short term, it is time to look within our borders and focus on making further improvements to our people's daily lives and our profit margins."

 ZLT_the_home_front: "The Home Front"
 ZLT_the_home_front_desc: "Our citizens have better conditions than nearly any other Russian, barring the Tsars in the west and east, but that isn't saying much. While they are protected by the anti-aircraft guns that we produce, they are still victim to the occasional raid. While they do not live in the basic huts and bombed out buildings that many of their former countrymen reside in, they barely have any heat in the cold winter months, The Republic's efforts shall go to making sure that our constituents are happy, healthy, warm, well-fed and protected."

 ZLT_double_our_portfolio: "Double Our Portfolio"
 ZLT_double_our_portfolio_desc: "The industry of the Republic is already thriving, with guns and takes being made in the dozens every day; however, the Republic never seems satisfied with our profits. In recognizing this dissatisfaction from out people, and in order to bolster our coffers, we shall begin to seek further improvements of our current production methods. By investing a large amount of money to build new factories, procure new production equipment, and hire new workers, we will be able to exponentially grow the production capacity of the Republic. Our people will soon know a new age of prosperity and happiness, and this is just the start of our plans."

 ZLT_guns_for_factories: "Guns for Factories"
 ZLT_guns_for_factories_desc: "We have many contacts across the world who also would like to see the Republic's business endeavors prove successful. One part of the Republic's new initiative to increase goods production and living conditions of our citizens is to procure new equipment for our factories. By reaching out to fellow warlords, émigrés, and foreign agents, the Republic will be able to secure new machines and ammunition to increase our production. This will increase our output capacity by leaps and bounds, which in turn will increase our profits by an even larger amount."

 ZLT_expanding_the_sprawl: "Expanding the Sprawl"
 ZLT_expanding_the_sprawl_desc: "Zlatoust and Nizhny Tagil are our most populous cities and are among the biggest production centers in all of Russia. The Republic has already invested a great amount in our industry, and it is now time to focus on the Republic's most important asset: our citizens. We will invest further money into the well-being of our citizens by building new apartments and suburbs around our main industrial centers, and we will also construct new factories making both weapons and consumer goods for export, and our citizen's enjoyment."

 ZLT_the_industry_never_ends: "The Industry Never Ends"
 ZLT_the_industry_never_ends_desc: "The Republic is booming! Profit margins are going up, equipment is being produced at a record rate and our citizens are happier and healthier than ever, but we can make some improvements. The Republic has vast stretches of land untouched by the hand of industry, and a way to further increase our profit is to start zoning off the land so we can construct Industrial Parks for the Republic. This creates additional jobs in terms of those who are clearing the land and those who are working in the factories, allowing the Republic's citizens to secure a livelihood."

 ZLT_dynamic_revolution: "Dynamic Revolution"
 ZLT_dynamic_revolution_desc: "The Republic is surrounded by despots, communists, and authoritarians. Their people are suffering under the boot of the oppressive regimes that rule over them, and it is in the Republic's best interest to engage in covert operations to further democracy. By arming insurgents in our neighbor's territory, we have a slight chance to weaken our neighbors, and the internal strife that is created will open up new markets for the Republic's weapons to be sold and used. The Republic stands for two things: profits and democracy, and these operations will make sure that both those things are fulfilled."

 ZLT_replace_and_restore: "Replace and Restore"
 ZLT_replace_and_restore_desc: "The Republic's urban centers are modern, but on the outskirts, there are a significant amount of dilapidated and unsafe buildings, and the infrastructure in many places that connect our cities and industrial parks are old and cracking. Using the money from our investments into our domestic matter and our profits from the tolls on the trade roads, the Republic will be able to repair its roads and we will be able to start a new program to refurbish and renovate our many housing projects."

 ZLT_guns_like_no_other: "Guns Like No Other"
 ZLT_guns_like_no_other_desc: "We have the most advanced firearms, artillery guns, rockets, and tanks in all of Russia. We churn out dozens and dozens of munitions daily, but the Republic cannot afford to be complacent. Our Mayor-Consul, Yevgeny Dragunov, and his partner, Mikhail Kalashnikov, are also heads of the state design-bureau, and they both are responsible for creating the weapons that the Republic churns out daily. They have decided that it is now time to reactivate the bureau and invest heavily in our Research and Development divisions so we can create new and improved weapons and methods of production."

 ZLT_out_of_our_pockets: "Out of Our Pockets"
 ZLT_out_of_our_pockets_desc: "The citizens of the Republic work day and night to fulfill the quotas that allow us to fill the coffers of our great nation. Our industry is booming, our roads are modernized, and our buildings are refurbished. It is now time to help the men, women, and children learn more about the world around them, and learn about the history of the Russian people. Dragunov has allowed us to use our investments in the state to build new statues, schools, museums, and recreational centers for our people. The citizens of the Republic will no longer be painted as useless drones who only serve to manufacture weapons of war, we will let our society be known as one that balances business and pleasure."

 ZLT_industry_like_no_other: "Industry Like No Other"
 ZLT_industry_like_no_other_desc: "The Research and Development Bureau is creating a new team to focus on the new field of computers and electronics, and how they can be applied to the republic's industrial methods. To move our developments along more quickly, a new fund will be set up to invest heavily in new universities and polytechnic schools throughout the republic. Zlatoust will have the greatest engineers and researchers in all of Russia, and our most serene republic will further serve as a beacon of hope, democracy, and modernism in this grim world."

 ZLT_into_the_soldiers: "Into the Soldiers"
 ZLT_into_the_soldiers_desc: "Our industry has been refurbished and expanded, and our citizens have one of the highest living standards in all of Russia. Our nation is thriving, but we have neglected one vital aspect of the republic: The Armed Forces. By investing money into new training programs, we will be able to further reinforce our high training standard and make sure that our men are the best trained and equipped fighting force in all of Siberia."

 ZLT_into_the_defense_line: "Into the Defense Line"
 ZLT_into_the_defense_line_desc: "Using our vast profits, the republic's defenses will be greatly expanded. New forts, anti-tank guns, anti-air guns, bunkers, and tunnels will be erected and constructed along our borders. The Serene Republic of Zlatoust will be secure from any threats around us. If any despot, communist, Black League member, or German attempts to try and topple our republic and harm our citizens, they will be met with the fire, fury, and brimstone of the many people who live within our borders."

 ZLT_our_shining_republic: "Our Shining Republic"
 ZLT_our_shining_republic_desc: "Our coffers are lined with gold. Our citizens are well fed, clothed, and have secure housing and modern amenities. Our factories churn out rifle after rifle, tank after tank, an artillery gun after artillery gun. The Republic's way of life, its democratic ideals, have been safeguarded from any potential threats. The Republic has built a lighthouse in the rough oceans of the Russian wastes, offering hope and the prospect of a new and better life for those who flock to its borders. We have built a new and better world, through superior fire-power."

### Events ###

 ZLT.1.t: "The Merchant State of Zlatoust"
 ZLT.1.desc: "The history of Russia is one of blood, defeat, and destruction. Now, even as the remnants of the Motherland vie for scraps, millions live and die by the gun. The West is a prime example: a sea of fire populated by warlords who place more value on dead ideologies than their own people. But there is hope.\n\nHigh atop the Urals stands Zlatoust, the last true bastion of freedom in old Russia. Behind these desolate mountains lie dozens of factories, spared from the Luftwaffe's rain of death. Petty bandits dare not risk scaling the Urals, lest they encounter the Republic's stout sentries. Refugees flock to Zlatoust by the hundreds, fleeing the wrath of madmen, who swim like sharks around the mountain home, eager to rip it apart at any moment.\n\nRumours speak of giant caves, filled to the brim with intact weaponry and heavy equipment, enough to give their owner the edge against any force in Siberia. Unfortunately, there are also those who try to divide the root of Zlatoust's unnatural prosperity. Indeed, for every bag of wheat and valuables traded into the mountains, there emerge trucks loaded with rifles, heading towards the domain of bandits.

A scout detachment was dispatched, who confirmed the private's report: A large group of unmarked soldiers had camped near XXXXXX woods, for what appears to be a military exercise. They shot at target dummies from a range of ~400 meters, and practiced hand-to-hand combat with one another in the evening.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this was not another roving band of mercenaries, as these soldiers exemplified discipline... but most importantly wielded modern weaponry. Private XXXXXXX had flanked this group, hoping to spy on it from the other side of the forest. Although I cannot confirm his reports, he swears that he also saw a fully-functioning tank, maybe even some trucks hidden in the foliage. Whatever the case, sir, these soldiers looked more than ready for war."

A Zlatoust convoy awaited on the other side of the compound, its fur-covered traders drew envious looks from the freezing sentries. For a moment, Jaba thought that a mocking smile flashed across the head merchant's face. He gazed at the mountain trucks, equipped to pass through any kind of blizzard, while he, the most successful bandit in all of Russia, had to arrive on a horse.\n\nThe merchants had brought out three dozen crates of rifles, bullets, and some combat knives for the chiefs. Jaba took one of the guns, an old AK-47: its barrel was battered, but could get the job done. He turned his head and nodded to the bandits. They grabbed the crates and carried them off, not unlike how a vulture feasts on the scraps left by a fierce predator. In turn, some footpads emerged from a nearby bush with heavy sacks across their shoulders. They deposited these into the mountain trucks, then disappeared back into the woods.\n\nThe head trader returned a dry smile, reached into his overcoat and produced a letter. Jaba took it, but before he could open the seal the merchants had already started their engines.\n\nThe head trader yelled out: 'Zlatoust appreciates this deal, and we hope that many more will follow. Send a messenger to us with your reply, there is a lot more from where that came from!'\n\nThe trucks rolled out of the compound, a strong gust of snow blew into Jaba's face."

The merchants had caught his entire camp off-guard, but before the bandits could scramble to their nests in the bushes, Zlatoust's finest entered the clearing. Two dozen men emerged, armed with modern assault-rifles and sporting gas masks never before seen in Siberia.\n\n"We have come to see comrade Jaba!" yelled one of the soldiers as he flung the gun over his shoulder.\n\n"I'm Jaba." The bandit shoved some footpads aside as he made his way through the mud. The meeting wasn't supposed to happen until next week, but Jaba found himself worried for the first time in many months. This base is supposed to be secret - how did the merchants know about it? If they wanted to, they could have ki-\n\n"Zlatoust extends its apologies" mocked the head merchant, "but we had a deal, and my associates would like it to progress immediately." Troops emerged from the back of the front truck, carrying crates decorated with the symbol of death.\n\n"Mr. Ioseliani, here we have two hundred units of Kalashnikovs, one-hundred and fifty grenades, and the last five trucks are yours." Jaba looked at the end of the caravan, a hungry fire burned in his eye. He raised his hand and a pack of mules emerged from the foliage, loaded with sacks of grain. The head merchant raised his eyebrows and stared at the animals, then drew a heavy breath and looked back at Jaba.\n\nThe man from Zlatoust eyed Jaba and his compatriots as they handed off the grain. "Now, in order to secure trust in the dealings between the Republic and the Yugrans, we must understand a level of complete trust. We would like the rest, please." the Merchant said. Jaba turned and looked at the beaming sun rays bouncing off the hidden car mirror, as he motioned it forward.\n\nThe truck roared and treaded through the snowy trail, and after just a few minutes, Zlatoust's caravan was off, riding off in the shadow of a distant mountain."

My messenger tells me that your illness has passed, so I believe it is time for me to relate to you the full story:\n\nAs you know, XXXXX clique had entruded upon our pastures last month, resulting in fifteen skirmishes between our forces and the loss of sixty-two brave men. Despite early promise, the enemy onslaught slowed down near Point XXXX Hill just a week ago, where casualties spiked.\n\nThe resolution originated with one XXXX XXX, who had arrived at our forward outpost in a model XX XXXX and claimed to be a representative of Zlatoust. He offered to mediate our dispute in exchange for XX bags of wheat. With Comrade XXXX's permission I accepted, and was later informed that XXXXX clique had been visited by the same man. He set up a meeting between our parties three days ago, where we had agreed to cede a quarter of the milk yielded by cows grazing on the contested pasture.\n\nIt is my firm belief that further cooperation with Zlatoust is preferable to continued border conflicts with our other neighbors. The representative was cool, charismatic, and well-disciplined. We have confirmed reports of similar dealings happening with Comrade XXXXX's Band, who had also attested to Zlatoust's capacity as a mediator.

Many of you have already experienced the chaos outside the Urals, where evil men slaughter each other for loot and glory."\n\n"-for loot and glory!" finished Salkov, putting down the pencil as he tried to divine the meaning behind the words. You fight for peace, Salkov. Remember that.\n\n"Hear, hear! We are the last bastion of democracy and freedom! It is an honor to sacrifice one's life and limb for these privileges-" the captain raised his hands to the ceiling, the veins on his red face bulged out, some cadet in the back of the room chuckled.

Do you have no respe-" the man fell silent as his eyes observed the incomprehensible scribbles upon the notebook in Salkov's lap, whilst he grabbed his arm. "Show me your right hand."\n\nSalkov felt his heart sink. He pointed a stump at the captain, who stood as if petrified, scrambling to conjure a response.\n\n"Men, take note. This soldier here," he pointed at Salkov, "he is trying to write with his left hand. Soldier, did you lose your hand in combat?" Salkov nodded.\n\nThe captain strolled back to the blackboard and continued: "This man is determined. He does not need to fight - he could be discharged for disability. But he has honor. He has strength. He takes a class right before battle, with a single hand! The boy puts the rest of you dogs to shame! Take note, take note! Be like him! The rest of the world is cruel. Many of you will die. But it is a good cause. Which is why you will fight on, even in the face of death." Salkov retrieved the pencil and continued writing, but felt a dozen eyes glancing at him.

A detachment of hunters were placed in the tall trees around camp. Thus, when the Zlatoust convoy did come to see the bandits, he would meet them on his own terms. So, when the merchants arrived, Jaba emerged from his hut, flanked by four guards, armed to the teeth with the most intimidating (and inefficient) equipment he could scavenge. It was a surprise when a single truck pulled into camp, and out came a single merchant, not of death but of opportunity. He seemed to sing when he spoke, yet his voice somehow managed to maintain integrity and directness. Jaba could only listen as the man made outrageous demands in exchange for nearly trivial promises, but portrayed them in such a way that would make a king understand. However, the deal boiled down to this:\n\nThe bandits are a brave bunch, but lack the numbers to protect their territories (and loot) properly. True, thought Jaba, there are occasional reports of thieves stealing from thieves. Therefore, Zlatoust is interested in offering protection for Yugra, but requires a simple favor: the allowance of its units to pass through bandit territory. This must be some mischievous plan, contrived in the dark halls of Zlatoust. But..."

Limited cooperation and fraternization with bandits has been permitted for senior officers. Mr. Ioseliani's commanders have transmitted the locations of weapon caches and bunkers. It appears that Yugra was significantly more militarized than expected, but the bandits still appear to be unruly and hold no political affinities.

Jaba breathed in the fresh morning air, observing the tranquil scene before him: Pines everywhere, only a thin dirt road separated the old forest from the hill he stood upon.\n\n"Sir," the captain exclaimed and looked down towards a masked figure walking to them, stopping occasionally to catch its breath on the steep slope. You gotta work to meet the king of thieves. The figure finally made it to the top, throwing off its helmet to reveal the head merchant of the East Ural division. Jaba stood his ground, scanning the newcomer only to realize that the man was grinning.\n\n"Mr. Ioseliani, I am about to offer you the deal of a lifetime." the merchant said hurriedly, withdrawing papers from his backpack "My superiors have authorized me to offer you a mutual-defense pact, in the best interests of both our peoples." Jaba remained silent. And? What's the catch?\n\nThe merchant continued: "As a complementary offer, Zlatoust would like to provide your forces with two hundred crates of extra equipment, plus whatever advisory assistance you may require." he handed a document and pen to Jaba: "Oh, and you also get to keep the pen."

He had provided for them. Once, that had been enough, but now every time he closed his eyes, he saw flashes of muzzle fire and heard the thunderous report of the guns that bore his name. He had once been so proud of the AK-47. He still was on some days. It truly was a groundbreaking piece of weaponry, and he occasionally wondered what destructive muse must have been guiding his hands the day he drew up the first designs. Simple. Durable. Deadly.\n\nNo one would have guessed that a farmer's son from Altai would create the most important gun in Russian history, least of all himself. Now here he was, the veteran of two world wars who became an arms dealer disguised as a politician, profiting off a destroyed wasteland. He chuckled as he considered that he may be one of the luckiest men on earth.\n\nYet the disquiet within him refused to pass. He thought back to that first day he had disassembled his father's hunting rifle. He'd been thinking about that day more and more. He hadn't even turned 10 and already he had felt his calling examining the gun, studying the beautiful way each part interlocked with the rest. Sometimes he wished he could push past the veil of time, grab that boy, and shout at him or warn him or plead with him to put the rifle away and never look back. He could have been a mechanic, or an engineer. He could have used his talents to design any number of other contraptions. Who would have thought a fascination with firing mechanisms would lead where it had?

The Republic had recently repaired the railway from Nizhny Tagil, Mischa said, and that had to be the target. His friends disagreed, saying that the ammunition workshops in the suburbs, damaged as they might already be, were the objective. As it turned out, however, they would never know.\n\nEmerging from the clouds above the German formation, a collection of small black dots dove onto the bombers, and as the friends heard the unmistakable sounds of machine-gun fire, and realized what was happening, they cheered. The Aviators were legends, avenging heroes that fought back not only against the Germans, but also against the hopelessness that was felt whenever the drone was heard.\n\nAs one of the bombers was rocked by an explosion, it began to rapidly descend, its angle growing steeper by the second until it was almost perpendicular to the ground. When it struck the ground, not far from the overhang, it was as if there had been a small earthquake.\n\nWhen the bombers, and the Aviators, had left, the group began running towards the crash site and saw others, some with weapons, doing the same. German weapons and scrap were worth a lot to the Zlatoust Republic, who could easily sell them on to the warlords, and Mischa intended to be the one to find them.

Men can't fight a fucking bandit war using knives and fireplace pokers. Men can't bring down a bear with their fucking fists, Dragunov. We've been waiting for months for these weapons, and you've doomed us in our wait. The men and women of Russia will hear about the fucking "business" racket of Zlatoust, Mr. Dragunov!"\n\n"Hello, hello?" With the furious cry at the end of the call, the phone line was cut silent.\n\nDamnit. Another lost customer. Mayor-Consul Yevgeny Dragunov threw his chair back as it hit the ground with a solid thud, and ran over to the window of his office. Across the land, the Mayor-Consul looked over his hardworking people, toiling away in their businesses, earning a hefty profit from all the warring of the Russian lands. It was only by the good grace of God that they had not known of the four missed shipments, starving the regime of necessary funds. Truly, Zlatoust would not be known as "golden-mouthed" for much longer should a solution not be found quickly by Mayor-Consul Dragunov."

 zlatoust_sales.6.t: "Zlatoust Order Failed"
 zlatoust_sales.6.desc: "The burning wastes of a former storage house billowed with smoke against the white winter morning. Another group of bandits broken through the wall, with guns and bombs and bullets they so desperately needed, taking everything they could haul and burning it all behind them. Including the twelve guardsmen who stood to defend their homes, their wives, their families. "Put me on the line with Dragunov." Colonel Utkin said, steely, as the winter morning air puffed the words out in front of him.\n\n"Thirty rifles is what we ordered, Mayor-Consul Dragunov. Thirty. Rifles."\n\n"It was the grave error of several incompetent chains in the command of the businesses here in Zlatoust, Mr. Utkin, they've since been removed from their positions and we may continue our transacti-"\n\n"No fucking deal, Dragunov. We lost twelve men and three officers in the last bandit raid, and I can't even tell you how many people have been lost to starvation. You want to know why that is, Dragunov?

We've been waiting for months for these weapons, and you've doomed us in our wait. The men and women of Russia will hear about the fucking "business" racket of Zlatoust, Mr. Dragunov!"\n\nIt was going to be a long night. Colonel Utkin knew it was no use to try and avoid the business deal with Dragunov, and that, eventually, his village was going to have to submit to Zlatoust's business venturian ways and make them sit, wait, and bleed. Now, all he could pray for was the day where Russians did not slaughter one another in the forest to come sooner."

 zlatoust_sales.7.t: "Zlatoust Equipment Arrives"
 zlatoust_sales.7.desc: "Men shouted in the distance, retreating from the patch of trees and shrubbery handpicked by Colonel Utkin. That early morning, the few stars peaking through the rising sun's glare alongside the gentle falling snowflakes were not strong enough to pierce beauty through the grizzly sight of a blood-stained forest, as cloudy mists of Russian blood sprayed through the trees. There, deep within the Russian wilderness, Colonel Utkin found himself alive. His men, alive. And every single would-be marauder of his fine homestead and village on the run, or lying dead in the snow. Everyone stood silent, taking in their first victory in months, their first chance to make a stand against the Russian attacker who so greatly pillaged their lands for so long. The men threw down their rifles, hugged one another, and cheered to the heavens over their newfound victory against the murderous thieves who plagued them for so long. Colonel Utkin, however, took a minute to inspect the bodies. Boys, the least of which must have been sixteen. A prime age for cadets before the rise of the Soviets, perhaps, but the cold, lifeless eyes reminded him of that day when Russia would war no longer.\n\nCheers and cries greeted the party of guards as they entered their settlement once again, this time having tasted their first victory against the men who tore their land asunder for so long. However, whilst the rest of the men enjoyed family and the taverns, Colonel Utkin made his way up to his office, readying himself to congratulate the man truly in charge of their victory. Spinning the rotary, Colonel Utkin awaited.\n\n"Yes, Mayor-Consul Dragunov? This is Colonel Utkin. I wished to report the lives you saved with your most recent transaction with our government...""
