 #Ideas
 FRA_economic_meltdown:0 "Economic Meltdown"
 FRA_economic_meltdown_desc:0 "Following our defeat in the Second World War, our economy has become evermore reliant on that of the Reich. Pressured into the failed German attempt to turn the Reichsmark into a single European currency, the '50s German economic crash has now left us with a ruined currency controlled entirely by another country. Yet whilst the Germans may have begun to see signs of recovery, the light at the end of our tunnel appears a long way away."
 FRA_the_OAS:0 "The OAS"
 FRA_the_OAS_desc:0 "The Organisation Armée Secrète, or OAS, serves as the secret police force of the state. Specializing in counter-terrorism operations, for the past decade they have dedicated themselves to combating the lingering Résistance forces across France. Unfortunately, pressure on the government to eradicate this element of society has led to the OAS becoming increasingly empowered to a now alarming rate. With several notable incidents now of OAS commanders ignoring the instructions of government, police and military officials, many in the government fear the OAS may only grow more bold in time."
 FRA_the_treaty_of_vichy:0 "The Treaty Of Vichy"
 FRA_the_treaty_of_vichy_desc:0 "For the French people the Second World War was a short and humiliating affair, but the Germans delivered their greatest blow with the enforcement of the Treaty of Vichy. Blaming France for the bloodshed of both world wars, the treaty places heavy restrictions upon our military capabilities, effectively reducing our army to a ceremonial force. Yet the treaty also restricts what kind of research the state can sponsor, places a number of political regulations upon our system and effectively grants Germany unlimited access to French territories with which to do as they please."
 FRA_vichy_restriction_tt:0 "§RCannot train units, disband units, or edit unit templates.§g\n"
 FRA_les_annees_noires:0 "Les Années Noires"
 FRA_les_annees_noires_desc:0 "Surviving largely upon his popularity alone, the death of Maréchal Pétain has marked the end of tolerance for our fascist regime from much of the population. Tixier-Vignancour enjoys none of the popularity of the late Maréchal, with marches in major cities having become far from a rare occurrence. Despite the efforts of our state security services, the popularity of all manner of ideological thought is skyrocketing across France as our people now seek for and demand alternatives to fascism in France."
 FRA_war_against_200_families:0 "War Against the 200 Families"
 FRA_war_against_200_families_desc:0 "France is once more in a state of war, for what seems like the millionth time in the last two centuries. The other wars were conventional, against external opponents such as the perfidious Huns and Anglos. This war, on the other hand, is internal in nature: against those who §xrot the French State and its people from their core.§!\n\nThis conflict is a holy crusade against the §xbankers§! and those that §xcontrol the French economy§!, engaging in dastardly §xmanipulation of the Nation from the shadows.§! If the French Nation is to regain its high status, it must remove these enemies, without regard to the cost!"
 FRA_200_families_vanquished:0 "200 Families Vanquished"
 FRA_200_families_vanquished_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of Pierre Poujade, the enemies of our nation have been vanquished. The bankers and those that controlled our economy, engaging in dastardly manipulation of our nation from the shadows, have been thrown down.\n\nWith these bastards removed from their formerly privileged position, no longer free to fester at our Nation's core, the French people may move on unopposed. M. Poujade assures us that there will be no negative consequences arising from this, and we have no reason not to believe him...\n\n§x...right?§!"
 FRA_back_in_the_pakt:0 "Back in the Pakt"
 FRA_back_in_the_pakt_desc:0 "The French State has returned into the arms of the Einheitspakt and the protection of the German Reich. Though in the aftermath of the betrayal by the Himmlerite bastards of the Schutzstaffel in Burgundy we foolishly separated ourselves from our German allies and benefactors, we have now reunited our fortunes to those of Germania.\n\nThese newly regained ties with the Master of Europe are certain to propel our nation forward."
 FRA_learning_from_the_reich:0 "Learning from the Reich"
 FRA_learning_from_the_reich_desc:0 "The Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation controls vast swathes of territory that stretch from the peaks of the Alpes to the western strands of the Caspian Sea. They have conquered this through the unconquerable might of the Wehrmacht, repressing any opponents with ruthless Germanic efficiency.\n\nWe stand to learn much from the Germans: politically, economically, and - for all that it might enrage people to say so - militarily too. We should take notes from them, adopting their methods for use in the French State."
 FRA_mediterranean_brotherhood:0 "Mediterranean Brotherhood"
 FRA_mediterranean_brotherhood_desc:0 "The French and the Italians have a shared history - beginning in the Roman Empire and continuing through glory and misery to the modern era - a shared geography, a shared Roman-derived culture, a shared tradition. We have more in common with our Italian brethren than we ever will with the German bastards that tore our nation to shreds and handed it over to Himmler's goons.\n\nUnited under fascism, France and Italy will together establish their own place in Europe, free of Nazi influence."
 FRA_learning_from_the_empire:0 "Learning from the Empire"
 FRA_learning_from_the_empire_desc:0 "The Italian Empire has control over vast, bounteous colonial possessions and imperial subjects that stretch from the peaks of the Alpes in our east to the ancient shores of the Persian Gulf. They leverage their great political, economic, and military abilities to keep tight control over their empire, to preserve the welfare of the Italian project and the greatness of its conquests.\n\nIf we are to truly unite with our Italian kinsmen and allies, we must learn from them and apply their methodologies to the French State."
 FRA_latin_bloc:0 "The Latin Bloc"
 FRA_latin_bloc_desc:0 "Years ago, the Duce, Benito Mussolini, proposed a plan to establish a Latin Alliance between the Romance-language nations of western and central Europe. That plan fell through amidst the chaos of the Second World War, but now that we have liberated ourselves from the German scum, we - both the State and its people - are willing to consider it again. Very willing, in fact.\n\nThe ever-strengthening ties forming between Iberia and France have resulted in a new alliance in Europe - the Latin Bloc, an economic union likely to be of great benefit to the two up-and-coming nations."
 FRA_across_the_pyrenees:0 "Across the Pyrenees"
 FRA_across_the_pyrenees_desc:0 "We, Iberians and French, are not so weak-minded as to let the Pyrenees separate us spiritually and mentally in addition to the physical separation they present. Though mountains loom over our border, we are united with our southern brethren.\n\nThrough the Europeanist foreign policy of M. Sidos and the ideological similarities between our two glorious nations, we have successfully strengthened our ties. Long may this persist; may our nations regain their past glory together!"
 FRA_delouvrier_plan:0 "Delouvrier Plan"
 FRA_delouvrier_plan_desc:0 "Faced with the challenge of reconstruction after World War II and the crises and oppression that have followed it, the French State has implemented the Modernization and Re-equipment Plan, which was designed to spur economic recovery. Colloquially known as the Delouvier Plan, this initiative is expected to revitalize the economy from its sorry state.\n\nThe formal aims of the Plan are: to develop national production and foreign trade, particularly in those fields where France is most favourably placed, to increase productivity, to ensure the full employment of manpower, and to raise the standard of living and to improve the environment and the conditions of national life.\n\nTo that end, we will secure broad consent of the people - workplaces, unions, industrialists, as many people as we can find. We will also intervene only where it is needed in the basic industries; we have faith that outside of those industries people will be able to do what they know is best for their interest and that of France."
 FRA_the_fair_state:0 "The "Fair State""
 FRA_the_fair_state_desc:0 "We tried for all we were worth, but we were unable to bring democracy back to the French State; all we are left with is a knockoff: the "Fair State". The government of M. Antoine Pinay has made some steps towards the restoration of a truly republican, democratic state in France, but the crawl towards freedom has been slowed by its delusional opponents.\n\nThe nation is in dire straits: the militias - such as Darnand's gang - and rightist remnants in the government have managed to prevent the long-awaited French return to democracy. All we can do now is wait and hope for a better future - alas that the French population is all too used to doing this."
 FRA_plan_PRIME:0 "Plan PRIME"
 FRA_plan_PRIME_desc:0 "Planification, Restructuration Industrielle, Modernisation, et Émancipation! These are the four principles upon with Plan PRIME is based on and the four pillars that shall make France once more stand proud as a modern nation. The brightest minds of the nation now serving under the Comité de Coordination Nationale, the body in charge of the Plan PRIME, shall ensure that France's industry will once more be something to be proud of."
 FRA_technocratic_constitution:0 "The Technocratic Constitution"
 FRA_technocratic_constitution_desc:0 "The masterstroke of President Bichelonne's political career, the 1970 French constitution has finally become the law of the land, cementing technocracy as the optimal system of government in France and codifying its place and its merits into the framework of the French State and its political institutions.\n\nGreeted with overwhelming cheers and euphoria by industrialists across France, the 1970 constitution nonetheless remains relatively unpopular with the remainder of France's population, calling into question its longevity and drawing uncertainty towards the future of the French State and Bichelonne's technocratic status quo."
 FRA_Henri_VII:0 "Henri VII"
 FRA_Henri_VII_desc:0 ""The last monarch in France was Napoleon the third." Or at least that is what old history books said and will now have to change. For France now has a new monarch, King Henri VII, guarantor of the French Constitution and ensurer of peace and stability in France. Or at least he should be in theory. Sadly, the young King has some... different ideas to the party on some key issues. France once more has a King, but he isn't what Action Française wanted out of one."
 
 #Characters
 POLITICS_JEAN-LOUIS_TIXIER-VIGNANCOUR_DESC:0 "In his ascension to Presidency, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour is the quintessential representation of the current catastrophic deadlock the French State finds itself in. Elected to the long-defunct National Assembly of the Third Republic in 1936 and the subsequent French State, he is as loved as he is hated in the spheres of French Politics.\n\nAfter the catastrophic West Russian War and the establishment of the Ordensstaat, Pierre Laval's - the then-President of France - unexpectedly died, leaving the French State once again with a ruinous political system. The nearly-collapsing State found Tixier-Vignancour as the most capable man of uniting a shattered nation, and thus, he was appointed to the seat of power. Despite the hurdles, he nonetheless succeeded in ensuring the continued existence of the French State, through successfully uniting the fractured Parti Nationale, rebuilding the faint sense of stability that had been destroyed in the wake of the economic crisis.\n\nWhile ostensibly not a Germanophile, his messages of further collaboration with the Germans continues to draw large numbers to the various opposition movements in the Assemblée, hungering for a change from the status quo. As the Reich continues to deteriorate, and the chaos that had gripped France before rears its head once more, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour and his government are stuck fighting over meaningless issues - while the new era of French politics begins to advance without them.\n\nWith the Résistance growing in strength in every passing day, and the looming threat of Burgundy breathing down the French State's neck, the French State is perhaps in the worst position it can be in.\n\nVignancour himself knows that the peace in Europe is tenuous, and once broken - France may well burn once more."

 POLITICS_CHARLES_HUNTZIGER_DESC:0 "Charles Huntziger has served France for many years. He served as a general in both World Wars, and he was one of Pétain's original cabinet members. As Pétain forged an armistice, he appointed Huntziger to lead the French side of the negotiations, although Huntziger was unsuccessful in lessening the Treaty of Vichy's harsh conditions. Huntziger served as commander-in-chief of the French land forces and as Minister of Defense for twenty years.\n\nHuntziger could only watch as his nation turned into a shadow of its former self. When the German economy collapsed, France could do nothing. When the Germans gave away half of France to Himmler to run as his own nightmare-ish fiefdom, France could do nothing. Now, as Himmler's SS cross the French border, conquering French cities and killing French people, France can do nothing.\n\nTixier-Vignancour fled the nation, his destination unknown. Huntziger was made temporary Head of State, a half-hearted attempt to callback to the glory of the Maréchal. Huntziger feels no glory in his promotion, he feels no legitimacy. The old man has placed France's future in the hands of the Assemblée, in hopes that his successor may be able to restore some hope in France's future."

 POLITICS_PIERRE_POUJADE_DESC:0 "If any person can bear the unfortunate task of representing the current devastation of France, it is Pierre Poujade. Steadily climbing the pillars of power in the chaos of the 1950's, he secured the Prime Ministership after Vignancour's successful bid for President. Enjoying his newfound position of power, Poujade was hopeful for a slow, careful political career. Of course, that all changed when Europe was once more thrown into utter mayhem.\n\nViolently thrust into the spotlight after the chaos of the Franco-Burgundian War, he was delegated the responsibility of grappling with yet another period of utter chaos as the political foundation of the French State fell through. Using his array of contacts, allies, and friends in the different strata of the remaining administration, Poujade managed to steer himself out of the fire and into the throne of power once more.\n\nPolitically, Poujade prides himself as the protector of the "little man", promoting a culture based around the founding principles of the state: Labor, Family, Fatherland. Promising a rebirth of a grand France, he does not delude himself into thinking it will be easy to rebuild his nation after the deluge of catastrophe which has struck it, especially with the hidden forces that lurk within the government, plotting to destroy his rule from within.\n\nShould he fail to keep these rotten forces at bay, the French State as he knows it may very well cease to exist. Should he succeed, however it will finally begin to emerge from the ashes of oppression."

 POLITICS_PIERRE_SIDOS_DESC:0 "The descendent of a long line of French soldiers and nationalists, Pierre Sidos has always been at the forefront of the traditionalist and hardliner wings of French politics. Losing both his father and his brothers in the Second World War, Pierre stands out in the scene of nationalism in being a stern pacifist.\n\nCreating a new movement in the 1950s, which aimed to embrace the new German World Order as well as to push against the rapidly-spreading flame of socialist and communist movements across the country. This movement, named the Mouvement Occident, became his gateway into the vast world of French politics.\n\nA passionate speaker, able to easily sway crowds with his intricate knowledge of expressions and mannerisms, he quickly rose the ranks. Becoming the head of the Parti Populaire Français, he led the party to become the flagship nationalist and most German-friendly party in France.\nFollowing the Franco-Burgundinian war and the ensuing chaos, Sidos finally found his chance to strike. Securing the Presidency, he now bears his responsibility - the completion of the Révolution Nationale - to extinguish the weak democracy of France, to promote a Europe that is united in brothership (including with the Germans), and finally, to return to the fundamental values which founded the French State."

 POLITICS_ANTOINE_PINAY_DESC:0 "Brave men carry the torch of liberty even when to do so is hard. Braver men still craft this torch from the ashes of oppression - and Antoine Pinay is one such man.\n\nA long-standing veteran of French politics, Antoine Pinay has long been mired in the politics of France, serving in both the Third Republic as well as the subsequent French State. A charismatic and eloquent speaker, he used his relative popularity among the population to assert himself as a moderate and an industrialist in the Parti National. Pinay is a firm believer in the dream of a truly fair French State, taking the mantle on the reformation of France following the death of Pierre Laval as the leader of the reformist wing of the Parti National. However, despite enjoying a broad support base, Pinay never did have the chance to truly push his reformist ideals - sidelined by the numerous hardliners of the French State, many thought that his ideals of a fair France would never see the light of day.\n\nOf course, then Burgundian tanks entered Paris. In the ensuing chaos, Antoine Pinay, along with the rest of the Réformistes, successfully made a bid for the seat of power in France, bringing the reformist light to France once more.\n\nHe now controls a shattered nation - shellshocked from the war, with the already-tenuous political system having been utterly destroyed, the fragile foundations giving way to the pressures of reality. With the conservative elements of the Parti National plot in the darkness, while the flame of extremism continues to spread unchecked throughout the population, Pinay certainly knows he does not have an easy path ahead of him.\n\nRegardless of all of the obstacles he faces, Pinay will never give up hope on his dream: a new France, free, fair and democratic. In the end, he seeks nothing less than the restoration of the French Republic - and he will go through any steps necessary to ensure that Democracy will triumph."

 POLITICS_JEAN_BICHELONNE_DESC:0 "The goal of a country must be of continued self improvement - the steady march of progress, development, and strength. Jean Bichelonne sees this as his motto; a devout technocrat, he has been deeply involved in the French State and its economy ever since the end of the Second World War.\n\nPerhaps the most defining moment of his development as a politician, he was one of the loudest and most ardent critics of French economic policies only years before the economic crisis that the French State found itself with the collapse of the German economy. Losing all faith in the idea of a continental industrial powerhouse, Bichelonne now presents an alternative - a technocratic France, a major industrial center of both themselves as a country, and Europe as a whole.\n\nCold and calculating, members of the Parti National frequently describe him as "an exceptional mathematician lost in politics". Stubborn in his ideals of a France free from German meddling, he shows no sign of compromise in his relentless criticism of the Reich, usually to the dismay of those who wish to try to find an agreeable path forward with him. Certainly not a politician, his consistent inability to compromise and negotiate makes the road to his plans difficult, but he does not let that stop him. Foreseeing a utopic plan of industrialization, development, modernization, Bichelonne possesses a decisive will to put France back on the list of some of the most developed nations in the world. An optimistic plan, yes, but he will let nothing get in his way of a truly modern France on the world stage."

 POLITICS_PIERRE_GAXOTTE_DESC:0 "Among most politically aware French men and women, few would have expected Pierre Gaxotte to have risen to the top of the political ladder to become their President. An academic historian by trade and journalist by inclination, Gaxotte has made his monarchist and militaristic sympathies apparent in his writing. Even with the fall of the French Republic, his critical work on the French Revolution continues to inspire the reactionary and oligarchical upper class of the French State.\n\nAn underling of the far-right political theorist Charles Maurras, he has kept his mentor's party, Action Française, from collapsing following his death. Seeking to return the Bourbon dynasty of the pre-Revolution monarchy back to the throne and highly critical of Pétain's rule, Gaxotte has remained a relatively minor force in French politics. Now, as its President, he intends to use his power to revive monarchism in France, regardless of what its people think. Backed by the forces of reaction, Gaxotte intends to crush what remains of France's revolutionary spirit."

To be an ambassador to France was comparable to a safety inspector in a KZ; your job was already done, so why bother? Reflecting on his apathy, Hermann was almost thrown out of his chair by the shock of his phone ringing.\n\n"Schneider, who's this?" Hermann suddenly realized he had entirely forgotten his etiquette for speaking to his subordinates, not that they seemed to be showing him any as of late.\n\n"It's Tobias, the French just walked in to drop off a letter." Hermann waited a moment for more details.\n\n"So?! You know how many of those we get on a single day, Tobias?!" The man stuttered for a moment before recomposing himself.\n\n"Yes, sir, but I don't think a convoy precipitates a fucking agricultural mission, it's en route to your office now."\n\nOpening the letter, Hermann's mind raced as to what it could contain, as his eyes dragged across the page. Muttering to himself, he recited the rough details of the page.\n\n"Yadda yadda, new geopolitical situation, yadda yadda, holy shit." Hermann reread the page, then picked the phone off its receiver, and dialed for Germania.\n\n"Herr Schneider, we trust you have good news?"\n\n"Yes, Herr Wagner, we have. Sidos reached out to us first, and it seems they're picking us over the Italians, and even Iberians.""

 FRA_SKELETON.12.desc:0 "Ambassador Hermann Schneider took another shot of Schnapps and flicked his eyes back to the dossier in front of him. The French PPF was a monster of a political party, all-powerful and entirely unpredictable, even to itself. Those in favor of any number of other allies all constantly at war with itself, and the German majority had won out. Until the leader of the German faction and Prime Minister, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, died almost out of nowhere. Figures. Now the parliament would be nearly split down the middle a dozen different ways, and a letter was sitting on his desk, from a pro-Italian cabinet member whose message was now withdrawn entirely, though then received a third letter that the first was still official. Hermann massaged his brow reading the umpteenth dossier on parliament members he could still reach out towards and attempt to help, or at least offer some kind of reassurance, but the rest of the parliament was not making it any easier. Recognizing his phone ringing, Hermann picked up the receiver.\n\n"Herman Schneider, ambassador to France?"\n\n"Schneider. You told us France is coming back, so would you care to explain the-"\n\nSchneider cut in. "I am aware of the situation, sir, I've been the one informing you, if you hadn't noticed. You understand what's happened to the PPF with la Rochelle, don't you? The situation is spiralling and will continue to do so until they set themselves straight, and I've already requested for our 'intervention' however possible. There is nothing new to report, so if you in Germania would stop bothering me in this regard, it would be deeply, deeply appreciated." A moment of hesitancy passed on the other side of the phone, and Schneider heard a deep sigh emanate from the line.\n\n"Thank you, Herr ambassador. Your input is deeply," -the voice on the other side grated as it spoke- "deeply appreciated.""

 FRA_SKELETON.14.desc:0 "Ambassador Schneider ground the stub of his cigarette into the ashtray sitting on his desk, the tarred ceramic uncovered under a manilla folder. The French remained egregiously indecisive, as seemed to be the norm at this point. On the bright side, they'd seemed to calm down their politics, much to the pleasure of pundits in Germania, though it hardly eased Schneider's nerves in any capacity. Pulling the ashtray closer as Schneider attempted to light a cigarette one-handed, the lighter slipped from his hands. Lunging for the silver, Schneider yanked the ashtray back, showering him in cinders and ash. At that moment, the phone rang.\n\n"Yes?! Christ on a crutch Tobias what do you fucking-"\n\nTobias spoke without breath or pause. "Yessir but the French are on line 1 and they refuse to stop calling putting them on no-" With a prolonged beep, Schneider could hear the shallow breathing of someone on the other side.\n\n"Ambassador Hermann Schneider speaking, who is this?"\n\n"Good afternoon, Herr Schneider, this is Pierre Sidos. I am inquiring as to whether Germany would be willing to host a visit from the French delegation in approximately a week's time- details can be clarified before, but I am asking, Germania be interested in this offer?" Schneider went blank white, reaching to his lips for a cigarette. All Hermann found was a small puff of ash covering his face, and realized there must be a pile of cinders coating his face. Struggling to focus on the topic at hand, Schneider contemplated whether or not to take the offer. On the one hand, the French might finally be reigned in, and if this was the first step to do it, showing how open Germany was to old friends could prove a boon. On the other hand, the French had thus far only proven a liability prone to infighting, and potentially collapse, though that was far from reasonable, Schneider admitted to himself."

Tobias took another drag from his cigarette.\n\n"You not smoking Schneider? Even in the presence of the great brown one himself?" A small crowd behind Tobias chuckled, half of them with eyes fixated on the screen. "Jesus, look at him," Tobias pointed at the image of Bormann walking with Sidos down the halls of one of the countless buildings in Germania.\n\n"Looks like my uncle." One accountant said. "Or my step-dad." Said another. A few chuckles broke out across the cramped office, some more confident than others. The room went quiet, as focus readjusted on the pair walking down the halls. The room focused on the hum and narration of the television again, listening for the conversation.\n\n"...and a special announcement comes with it!

Already..."\n\nA series of contained hurrahs and "hey-heys!" broke out, and died down after a dozen or so seconds of celebration.

We believe the benefits of such a proposal are, if accepted, mutually beneficial.\n\nWe believe that a mutual understanding between our two nations is more than possible.

Scorza and other top officials had accompanied the French President, discussing relations and potential avenues for the future.\n\n"... And with our nations' shared Latin and Mediterranean heritage, we are natural allies," explained Sidos, as the group marveled at the ancient ruins surrounding them.\n\n"Indeed, and closer ties would strengthen our ability to combat German domination over Europe," replied Scorza, leaning slightly against the metal railings of the platform, "I think the first step would be an increase in trade, to better tie our nations together."\n\n"I was thinking the same thing. Not only would France gain a much-needed injection of foreign capital, but it would allow Italian businesses to fill in the vacuum left behind by German companies that pulled out after our shift in policy.""

Both the Spaniard and Portuguese man had even pretended to play nice to look convincing. Yet for the last few days, the French were quieter than Efrain on siesta. They were convinced they had failed.\n\nThen, suddenly, the phone rang. It was the French, both men were sure of it. The two jumped up from their lethargic positions and raced to the phone. Shoving and yelling, both tried grabbing the phone. After a small slap fight, Efrain managed to capture the phone, holding his Portuguese counterpart away with his other arm.\n\nEfrain warmly greeted the voice on the other end with a big grin plastered on his face. "Hello, this is Efrain from the Iberian embassy, how can I help you?"\n\n"This is President Pierre Sidos, Monsieur Efrain. I was wondering if Iberia would be willing to host a diplomatic visit in the next week. We can work the details out later, but I need to know if such a thing is possible." Efrain was in shock. He had not expected the caller to be the President, let alone requesting a visit.\n\nAs tempting as a yes was, the answer was not so easy. Taking the offer would commit them to their neighbor, and the thought of sabotage was not impossible. God forbid there be another Malta. Yet, the two were neighbors and more economic cooperation would never hurt. Miguel, who had been eavesdropping the entire time, stole the phone in Efrain's contemplation. Unlike his Spanish compatriot, he already knew his answer to the President."

The small city saw more tourists than anything, and even that was scarce with the current political climate. Yet it was in little Andorra where two well-guarded cars drove up from opposite sides of the city and met.\n\nThree men stepped out of those cars, and they would find themselves becoming well acquainted over the following days. Sidos, Salazar, and Franco all greeted each other with a familiarity that seemed all too familiar. In the city, the three dined on the nation's fine delicacies, catching up on past times that did not exist.\n\nFrom there, the three traveled together to Madrid for the real show. The two Caudillos showed their soon-to-be ally around the city as Iberia's most privileged tourist. Franco took special pleasure in showing their guest around his half of the union, yet the special attention all went over the President's head.\n\nAt last, the fun had to end, and both parties found themselves in an empty room with nothing but a table. Trade dominated the discussion. From tariffs on wine to wider agreements on industrial goods, everything was covered. Perhaps most interesting of all though, was the idea of a Latin Union, the two nations combined in a new power block that could halt that of the Germans and Italians.\n\nDespite the appeal, the idea did not feel quite ready. In the future, the three men confirmed to themselves. Still, as Sidos boarded a train back to France following another night of parties, the three men were left satisfied. They all knew this was the beginning of a new relationship, one that would change the course of Europe."
