 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_MANGOSUTHU_BUTHELEZI_DESC: "The abject failure of the ANC to prevent a Boer takeover of South Africa proved to be the last straw for the organization's moderate faction. As the ANC's leaders were killed or exiled by Hertzog's regime, the ensuing power struggle for the organization's remnants was won by none other than Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\nOfficially only the hereditary leader of the Buthelezi tribe, Prince Mangosuthu is the de facto leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the largest ANC splinter group. Mangosuthu and the chief ideolouges of the IFP are steadfast in their belief that the ANC's extremism was the root of its failure, and that only by cooperating with sympathetic white governments will racial parity be achieved. In spite of this moderation, the IFP's goals are no less radical than those of the ANC, and the backlash from the Boer's horrific treatment of South Africa's natives has only further convinced the tribal leaders who prop-up Mangosuthu's government that segregation has to end, one way or another.\n\nThe thin line the Prince has to walk between ideological radicalism and his pragmatic strategy is represented by the unstable alliance of tribes that make up Mangosuthu's political front. While it is little more than an informal arrangement upheld almost entirely by personal loyalty to Mangosuthu, at a disadvantage in industrial capacity and military experience, the alliance nevertheless carries with it the ANC's unbreakable spirit. This makes an arrangement with Viljoen's moderate whites all the more pressing, for should Mangosuthu prove unable to fulfill his promises of a negotiated end to segregation, the IFP's more extremist elements could gain the upper hand."

 ZUL_ifp_anc_split: "IFP-ANC Split"
 ZUL_ifp_anc_split_desc: "The ANC was built on alliance between radical and moderate native South Africans, one that has been shaky since its foundation. The inability to properly deal with the Boers was the final straw for this alliance, causing the ANC to splinter apart. The largest moderate faction, the IFP holds power, but the future can be finicky and only time will tell if the Zulu-Xhosa alliance will remain stable or suffer the same fate as its predeccesor."

 ZUL_anti_segregation_resurgence: "Anti-Segregation Resurgence"
 ZUL_anti_segregation_resurgence_desc: "The IFP has not always had the most radical view on segregation. During the days of the South African War, they were moderates, focusing more on cooperation with the white government. However, after the injustices experienced under the Volkstaat, the issue has been rejuvenated in importance, with a renewed anxiety felt by both the people and the government, that kind of injustice shall never occur again."
