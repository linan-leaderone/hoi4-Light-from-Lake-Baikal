vc.1.t:0 "The Conference Begins"
vc.1.d:0 "From all over Italy, delegates, representatives, politicians, bureaucrats, blackshirts, and more, coming from all strata and organizations of the PNF's massive political apparatus, are convening in Verona. The medieval city is draped with Italian tricolours and fascist black flags; crowds cheer as the Duce's car makes its way through the city, escorted by a small contingent of elite blackshirts, before finally reaching the location of the Conference - Castelvecchio, a castle outside of the main urban center. Built by the Scaligeri dynasty back in the Middle Ages, it is now swarming with curious onlookers, journalists, and armed blackshirts manning their posts.\n\nThe other guests of the Conference entered the Castelvecchio with much less ado - talking and plotting, as silently the blackshirts posted around the building stood watch with their rifles in hand. Uniforms and suits huddle together in small groups, talking quietly before breaking up and then starting again, in an endless dance around the tables where bottles of fancy wines and plates full of snacks are emptied then filled up again, while the politicians scheme. Deals and alliances are made and broken, and when all the delegates are called to sit in the main hall, secretary Scorza and Prime Minister Ciano make eye contact for a second, as the latter prepares to take the floor for the conference's opening speech. A tense silence permeates the air - the battle to decide Italy's future has begun."
vc.1.a:0 "Woe to the defeated."

vc.2.t:0 "The Future of the MinCulPop"
vc.2.d:0 "The Ministry of Popular Culture was founded in 1937 to control and regulate Italy's media and art industries, to make sure that they follow party lines. Conceived as an answer to the German Reichsministerium for Propaganda, the MinCulPop soon instead became a source of ridicule - its bloated bureaucracy egregiously easy to circumvent, its censorship useless at best and actually harmful at worst, and its overall efficiency a matter of jokes. Its very name evokes hilarity among the Italian people, as its acronym, MinCulPop, sounds uncannily similar to the Italian word for arse.\n\nTo amend this sorry situation, many party officials have suggested a renewal of the MinCulPop. Spearheaded by the Secretary Carlo Scorza, this reform would radically alter the bureaucracy of the MinCulPop, making it more efficient, more expedient, and most of all, more effective at spreading the fascist values to the general population. The Duce has rapidly shut down such proposals, as him, along many others, feel that it would be a mere waste of resources, as the MinCulPop has largely outlived its usefulness. Nevertheless, this matter has been brought up in Verona, and is now being discussed by the Congress."
vc.2.a:0 "Couldn't they at least change the acronym?"

vc.3.t:0 "Ciano Speaks Out Against the MinCulPop"
vc.3.d:0 "Galeazzo Ciano has addressed the Conference regarding the proposal to reform the MinCulPop and, as predicted, he spoke out against reforming the institution. Arguing that censorship in Italy isn't as necessary as it was in the 1920s and 1930s, when the subversive threat of communism and sedition was still a serious threat, Ciano has instead proposed that the funds needed to restore the MinCulPop be redirected to more pressing matters.\n\nThe Duce went on, speaking out in favour of the Italian movie, literature and television industries, which have proven to be very profitable and popular abroad, and the MinCulPop is only harming them by slowing down the production of new cultural products and by stifling the creativity and genius of Italian directors and writers.\n\nWhile some rounds of applause arrived from parts of the Conference, many fascists politicians were much less enthusiastic about the proposal, fearing a possibly deregulated entertainment industry could lead to seditious tendencies spreading more quickly among the population."
vc.3.a:0 "Everyone loves Italian cinema!"

vc.4.t:0 "Scorza Speaks About the Importance of the Ministry"
vc.4.d:0 "Applauded by large sections of the party, Carlo Scorza has taken the floor for the first time in Verona, delivering a plan to reform MinCulPop which would take into account the Duce's worries regarding the ministry while at the same time giving it the importance it deserves. By streamlining the bureaucracy, allowing an advisory board of directors and entertainment experts, and ever so slightly relaxing the censorship, the MinCulPop can easily and expediently be turned into a modern and efficient institution.\n\nScorza continued by remind the Conference of the importance of defending and upholding the values of the fascist revolution among the population, and to warn against the dangers of seditious, lascivious and downright degenerate artistic products making their way to the population, corrupting the Italian youth and weakening the strong moral fibre of the nation. While many in the Conference were evidently enthusiastic at the Secretary's words, many more were puzzled, and somewhat convinced that this is just a thinly veiled power play by Scorza."
vc.4.a:0 "Seriously, change that acronym."

vc.5.t:0 "The Grand Council Votes on the MinCulPop"
vc.5.d:0 "While Scorza managed to strong arm the Duce into letting the Grand Council vote about the MinCulPop reform, there's no guarantee that the proposal will pass, and it's likely that it will be shot down by the delegates of the Grand Council choosing to follow Ciano's stance. However, Scorza has been gathering support, so a victory isn't impossible.\n\nBehind closed doors, the Grand Council votes in silence. "Sì" and "No" are written down one by one, and when the votes are counted..."
vc.5.a:0 "Scorza's proposal is shot down!"
vc.5.b:0 "Scorza's proposal passes!"

vc.6.t:0 "Reform the Blackshirts?"
vc.6.d:0 "Since the March on Rome, the Voluntary Militia for National Security, popularly known as the Blackshirts, has expanded its powers. The Blackshirts now enjoy considerable power in Italy, rivalling the Carabinieri's official powers. Blackshirt units are feared for their terror, attacking on occasion American tourists, university students, colonial subjects and anyone else perceived to be an "enemy of fascism". The Blackshirts also constitute one of the most reactionary groups within the PNF apparatus, effectively constituting an "old-boys" network of prominent hardline fascists, especially in the higher ranks.\n\nCiano, going into the Verona Convention, wishes to limit the power of the Blackshirts. Accordingly, Ciano plans on instituting a retirement age and limiting the Blackshirts' arrest powers severely. Scorza, hoping to shore up support among the Blackshirts and conservative Fascists, will do his best to oppose these reforms. The stage is set for a potential confrontation between Ciano and Scorza, and the MVSN members at the conference have been... less than neutral over Ciano's proposals."
vc.6.a:0 "Let's hope there isn't a fight."

vc.7.t:0 "Ciano Speaks in Favor of Blackshirt Reforms"
vc.7.d:0 "Ciano rose to the podium, with tension hanging in the air. He opened by thanking the Blackshirts, offering at least lip service to their accomplishments over the past 40 years. Ciano commended the Blackshirt units who fought so bravely in Africa and Europe, and the Blackshirts who stamped out communist insurgents. Ciano earned the applause of a significant portion of the room, however, notably, the Blackshirt commanders in attendance held their applause.\n\nFollowing the pause, Ciano next moved into a condemnation of Blackshirt excesses. He condemned "overzealous" suppression of protesters and dissenters, along with colonial excesses. Murmurs and whispers filled the chamber following this, and several Blackshirt commanders walked out of the speech. Seemingly undeterred by this slight, Ciano continued his speech, laying out his set of reforms. First, he suggested a mandatory retirement age for the blackshirts, and in what might have been the most pointed words of the conference, condemned a "gerontocracy" among senior Blackshirt officers. After this, he suggested remedying the brutality problem with a substantial reduction of the Blackshirts' civil authority, including their ability to make arrests.\n\nCiano's speech only increased the tension within the chamber, and with Scorza speaking next, the conference seemed wholly on edge."
vc.7.a:0 "That didn't make anything better."

vc.8.t:0 "Scorza Opposes Blackshirt Reforms"
vc.8.d:0 "Scorza opened his speech with a long, name-by-name thank-you to each of the present Blackshirt commanders for their "long service to Italy," in a clear rebuke to Ciano's "gerontocracy" remark. Scorza next defended the Blackshirts and their actions, arguing that the suppression of "disloyalty" necessitated occasionally brutal methods. This earned him cheers and applause from the Blackshirts in the room. Scorza next launched into a blistering attack on student protestors, seemingly only tangentially related to the subject at hand, albeit closed out with a thanks to the Blackshirts for stamping them out.\n\nScorza then attacked the proposal to remove the Blackshirts' arrest powers. These powers, Scorza argued, were so fundamentally necessary to the MVSN's status that their removal would in effect spell death for the Blackshirts and, by extension, the PNF's control over Italian life. Yet again, the Blackshirts present enthusiastically cheered, while the rest of the chamber's reaction was considerably more tepid. As Scorza closed his speech, he took time to target what he described as a shift away from ideological fascism that has characterized the conference, and expressed hope that in the upcoming vote, the Grand Council would support the proposal that 'strengthens the fascist ideology'."
vc.8.a:0 "Fascism needs its enforcers."

vc.9.t:0 "Vote on the Blackshirt Reforms"
vc.9.d:0 "As expected, the reform proposal was deadlocked, and sent on to the Grand Council of Fascism. The vote is also expected to be tight in the Grand Council, and both Scorza and Ciano have attempted to court potential swing voters in the Grand Council. Trust among both factions in the Grand Council has seemingly completely evaporated, and as the Grand Council members begin to vote, any bit of goodwill at the conference seems to evaporate.\n\nThe Grand Council once again votes, with "Sì" and "No" written down, and when the votes are tallied..."
vc.9.a:0 "The Blackshirt reform passes!"
vc.9.b:0 "The Blackshirt reform fails!"

vc.10.t:0 "Loosening Government Control Over Trade Unions?"
vc.10.d:0 "Since the dawn of the fascist era, strict regulations have been placed on trade unions across the country. Back in the 1920s, a new fascist trade union was set up, called Confederazione Nazionale delle Corporazioni Sindacali (National Confederation of Syndical Corporations), and the pre-existing trade unions, especially the leftist ones, were banned and their remnants integrated into the Confederazione Nazionale.\n\nOriginally meant to become one of the pillars of the new fascist state, a bloated bureaucracy and a shift in power dynamics within the regime caused it to become a tool of oppression, rather than empowerment - especially after the Leggi Fascistissime of 1939 made strikes illegal and further clamped down on workers' rights. The Confederazione Nazionale allows very little actual worker representation, and is instead perceived as a tool of control used by the fascist state to prevent the workers from organizing into independent unions - fueling anger and radicalization among the urban poor.\n\nThe Duce has proposed a radical solution to this problem - breaking up the Confederazione Nazionale into smaller, more independent trade unions, allowing for actual worker representation and more autonomy. Needless to say, this proposal is controversial, and many in the PNF, among them Carlo Scorza, have voiced their strong opposition to it."
vc.10.a:0 "Solidarity forever?"

vc.11.t:0 "Ciano's Stance on the Trade Unions"
vc.11.d:0 "Once more, the Duce has addressed the fascists reunited in Verona. This time, Ciano's speech wasn't made up of firebrand rhetoric or grand declarations, but cold, hard numbers. Production targets, GDP growth, purchasing power - a bombardment of graphs, tables, pie charts that could have been taken straight out of an economics textbook. With this data, Ciano argued that the Confederazione Nazionale was stifling the growth of the Italian economy by imposing a byzantine bureaucratic system over the productive aspects of society.\n\nEven more worrying, there is proof that the lack of worker representation is a leading cause of spreading dissent and anger among the lower classes, which could be fertile ground for the spread of communist extremism. By allowing smaller, more autonomous, and more easily manageable trade unions, all these problems can be solved with one easy move. Some applause arrived from the Conference, but many were clearly puzzled by the excessive amount of numbers and figures thrown at them."
vc.11.a:0 "The economy, you fools!"

vc.12.t:0 "Scorza's Stance on the Trade Unions"
vc.12.d:0 "Carlo Scorza has once more spoken out against Ciano in Verona. The Duce's plan to reform the trade unions was met with anger by large strata of the party, many of which felt that a key component of the fascist political edifice was being directly attacked. Scorza's speech was much less fact-oriented than Ciano's - reminding the Conference of fascism's national syndicalist roots, evoking vague terrors of communist spectres still lingering in the air, and celebrating all the great things fascism did for the Italian working classes, Scorza sung his paean to fascist trade unions, drawing a thundering applause from the Conference.\n\nHowever, the weakest part of Scorza's address was the lack of clear policy proposals to address the problems faced by the Confederazione Nazionale, and the woes it brings to the Italian economy. Much murmuring was heard in the Conference, but it's not clear if he managed to sway many people to his side."
vc.12.a:0 "Fascism for the working classes?"

vc.13.t:0 "The Grand Council Votes on the Trade Unions"
vc.13.d:0 "The most hotly contested issue so far resulted in yet another stalemate in the Conference, with neither Ciano nor Scorza able to bring enough support to their side to make a breakthrough. Once more, to avoid a rift breaking the PNF apart, the Grand Council will have to vote on the matter. The air is tense, and the atmosphere is cold - everyone knows that this vote will have historical significance.\n\nOnce again, the "Sì" and the "No" are written down, as dead silence hangs over the members of the Grand Council reunited together. Once again, the votes are counted, and..."
vc.13.a:0 "Ciano's plan has passed!"
vc.13.b:0 "Ciano's plan was rejected!"

vc.14.t:0 "The Acerbo Laws"
vc.14.d:0 "As the Verona Conference enters its closing days, a new and incredibly divisive issue has been brought up - electoral laws, also known as Acerbo Law. Named after fascist politician Giacomo Acerbo, who wrote the law and presented it before the Italian Parliament in 1923, it was designed by the Partito Nazionale Fascista, with support from various right wing parties, to ensure that Mussolini and his coalition had complete and firm control over parliament. The laws stipulated that whichever party had the majority of votes - provided that they gained more than 25% of the total votes - gained two thirds of the seats in Parliament.\n\nThese laws were only used in a single election, in 1924, which predictably resulted in the PNF conquering a supermajority in Parliament. Following this, more and more laws were passed to build up the fascist dictatorship and concentrating power in Mussolini's hands. Now, in Verona, some members of the PNF close to Ciano have proposed a review of said laws, including the original Acerbo Law of 1924. Their proposal consists of a few changes of electoral laws, which while still maintaining the PNF's supremacy, could potentially open the door to independent parties running and possibly even defeating the fascists.\n\nNeedless to say, large amounts of the Conference were outraged. Fierce debates arose, with Ciano largely keeping silent - still, the debates escalated, with some scuffles even breaking out among party members."
vc.14.a:0 "Everybody, please, keep it civil."

vc.15.t:0 "Scorza Plots in the Darkness"
vc.15.d:0 "This evening, Carlo Scorza and a few important representatives from the PNF have met at a dinner, in a luxurious restaurant in Verona's old town. There, in an elegant dining room behind closed doors, all of Scorza's guests could witness the secretary's cold, calculated, and terrifying rage. Ciano is proving to be a much harder target than expected, and despite everything, much of the PNF still supports the spineless traitor usurping the title of Duce.\n\nHowever, the blowback against the proposals to change the Acerbo laws have provided Scorza with a precious chance. A chance to ride the wave of dissent in the PNF to oust the Duce once and for all. Not one step back - the Acerbo laws must be defended, at all costs. Scorza made his point extremely clear - the fate of the fascist revolution, and of Italy, depends on this."
vc.15.a:0 "Are Ciano's days numbered?"

vc.16.t:0 "Ciano Meets Behind Closed Doors"
vc.16.d:0 "After the fierce clashes in the Conference died down for the day, with the various delegates going to their hotels for the night, Ciano reunited his closest advisors behind closed doors. A few generals, some high ranking politicians, a few lesser known names - all worried by the louder and louder voices coming from Scorza and his clique. This is it, the final stand - if Scorza manages to ride the wave of support to defend the Acerbo Laws and use the momentum to gain more and more followers, this might be the end of Ciano's tenure as Duce.\n\nA defensive line must be drawn to stop Scorza's offensive - a compromise solution. Without repealing the Acerbo laws, they will be amended - allowing for freer popular choice of PNF representatives in local elections. This is not just a battle over an electoral law, it's a battle over who controls Italy, and the Duce is not willing to give Scorza a single inch more."
vc.16.a:0 "We're in the endgame now."

vc.17.t:0 "The Grand Council's Final Vote"
vc.17.d:0 "After Ciano presented a moderate plan to amend the Acerbo laws, the chaos in the Conference turned into dead silence. Suddenly, everyone realized clearly that this was not a battle between supporters and opposers of the Acerbo laws - it was a battle between Ciano and Scorza. Without uttering a word, all the members of the Grand Council entered one by one the room where the final vote was to be held.\n\nAfter what seemed like an excruciatingly long time, all the votes were cast. The speaker of a council stuttered for a moment before reading the sheet where the votes were counted, and announces the final result..."
vc.17.a:0 "The Acerbo laws will be amended!"
vc.17.b:0 "The Acerbo laws will be maintained!"

vc.18.t:0 "The Final Vote"
vc.18.d:0 "With the speeches concluded, the members of the Party lined up to cast their votes in the vote of confidence for Ciano. While not legally binding, passing this vote will allow Ciano to pursue some, if not all, of his reformist agenda. Once the counting was concluded, Secretary Scorza took the stage to announce the results..."
vc.18.a:0 "The delegates remain faithful to Ciano!"
vc.18.b:0 "The delegates vote against him!"
vc.18.c:0 "A major shock - the vote is tied!"

vc.19.t:0 "Ciano Declares the Congress a Success"
vc.19.d:0 "In spite of hardships and fierce opposition from his own party, the Verona Conference has ended as a net victory for Ciano. In his closing speech, as the crowd of fascist representatives sat silently, the Duce expressed his happiness at the newfound unity and strength of the party, and his commitment to push through with reforms and changes for the greater good of Italy. Scorza remained silent, and dark faced. When Ciano ended the speech, booming applause filled the air, but Scorza didn't clap.\n\nPower dynamics in a fascist state can be a fickle thing, but one thing is certain - Ciano's hold on the PNF, and on the nation, is now stronger than ever. According to leaks and rumors coming from within the party, Scorza's clique is rapidly dissolving, as more and more prominent politicians jump ship to Ciano's faction, clearly the winning one. Ciano's name was cheered by the crowds in Verona, while the Duce stood on the car that was to bring him to the airport. The Duce has no intention to waste time - once back in Rome, he will finish the job that was started in Verona.\n\nWith Ciano's newfound hold on the PNF, it is still hard to predict what the future of Italy will look like. The most optimistic observers argue that this new development will push Italy on the path to full democracy, though the true extent of Ciano's plans is still a matter of speculation."
vc.19.a:0 "Ave Ciano!"

vc.20.t:0 "Scorza Takes Over in Verona!"
vc.20.d:0 "The Italian public at home and abroad was shocked to receive the news - a surprise proposal was submitted by Scorza to the Grand Council, in the morning of the final day of the Verona Conference. Many members of the council were puzzled when they noticed the Duce's absence, but everything became all too clear when the secretary's proposal was read out - it was a motion of no confidence, aiming to remove Galeazzo Ciano from his position as Prime Minister of Italy and Duce of Fascism.\n\nThis was the last stroke of Scorza's political masterpiece - a takeover of Italy from within the PNF. The vote was held quickly, with members of the PNF close to Scorza urging to hurry up - and when the votes were counted, the result was announced by the secretary himself. With the motion passing, Galeazzo Ciano is relieved of all his positions in the Italian government and in the PNF. At the same time, an urgent telegram reached Verona from Rome - Scorza's men in the capital were successful in strong arming the King, much like Mussolini himself did back in the 1920s. His Majesty King Umberto II has agreed to grant the title of Prime Minister to the Secretary of the PNF, Carlo Scorza, and his inauguration ceremony is scheduled to take place soon in Palazzo Venezia.\n\nImmediately after the telegram was received, the Grand Council held two more votes, to name Scorza as Duce of Fascism, and to call for the arrest of former Duce, Galeazzo Ciano - both passed with an overwhelming majority. News from Verona and Rome are confused, chaotic and distressing, but one thing is certain - the era of Ciano has ended."
vc.20.a:0 "Ave Scorza!"

vc.21.t:0 "The Conference Dissolves"
vc.21.d:0 "With the final vote tied both Ciano and Scorza simultaneously tried to claim some measure of success, but both privately knew they had failed, leaving the party directionless. No second vote was held, and the delegates simply packed up and left. Neither Ciano nor Scorza gave any interviews to waiting press, and a sullen mood has descended on Rome."
vc.21.a:0 "The Party will endure..."

vc.22.t:0 "Preparations for the Verona Conference"
vc.22.d:0 "Over the past few months, the differences between Ciano and Party Secretary Carlo Scorza have grown untenable. Scorza's vehement opposition to any and all of Ciano's proposed reforms grinds the government to a halt weekly, and all parties realize something must be done. Preparations are being made to hold a convention in Verona to address the future direction of the Italian government and the Party."
vc.22.a:0 "One way or another, reform is needed."

vc.23.t:0 "Ciano Gives a Speech"
vc.23.d:0 ""Friends, countrymen - while I have always been and will be a member of our great Party, the tenets that uphold our country are not set in stone."\n\nCiano delivered a speech today in Rome, where he urged the 'evolution' of the National Fascist Party.\n\n"The world in 1921 is drastically different than the one today. Our great founders could never have predicted the rise of television, modern medicine, and the other defining traits of our new era. Just like the economy, the government must adapt to our modern reality.""
vc.23.a:0 "His time is approaching..."

vc.24.t:0 "Scorza Meets With His Supporters"
vc.24.d:0 "Party Secretary Carlo Scorza has spent the last few weeks leading up to the Verona Conference meeting with a collection of old-guard diehards in the Party. While these meetings have taken place behind closed doors, Scorza has deliberately leaked some information to the press.\n\n"A return to our roots is required," he said in a press conference held earlier this week. "We must hold true to our values in this era of increasing uncertainty around the world.""
vc.24.a:0 "He needs all the support he can get!"

vc.25.t:0 "Suspected Red Brigade Activity on Conference Grounds"
vc.25.d:0 "While our newspapers tried our best to cover it up, reports still emerged that three Red Brigade agents were captured this week snooping around the conference grounds in Verona. They have resisted 'enhanced interrogation' and confessed nothing, but we suspect they were searching for vulnerabilities in the building's security, including backdoor entrances and exits.\n\nThe population, already uncertain about this conference, is increasingly wary that this could turn from a show of unity into a fiasco."
vc.25.a:0 "Raise security at once!"

vc.26.t:0 "Ciano Meets With the King"
vc.26.d:0 "While King Umberto is little more than a figurehead, he has met with Ciano this week and endorsed his plans for the Conference. Following on the heels of last month's security fiasco, this move has assuaged many common people that this conference will be a good thing for the long-term stability of Italy."
vc.26.a:0 "An important meeting, for sure."

vc.27.t:0 "Scorza Speaks at the Council"
vc.27.d:0 "While Ciano was meeting with the King, Scorza was preparing a speech to deliver to the Grand Council of Fascism. This morning, he took the stage to rousing applause from the hardline members of the body.\n\n"Gentlemen - Fascism has and will continue to be Fascism! No more reforms, placations to degenerate leftists and liberals, or rumors of democracy! We are united in purpose and aim to stick to the foundations that won us the war and took us to greatness!""
vc.27.a:0 "Maybe he has a point..."
