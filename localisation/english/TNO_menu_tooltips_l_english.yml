TNO_ugly_american_icon_tt_delayed: "Brothers are those who share the same breath.\n'When brothers quarrel within the walls, they unite to resist outside aggression,' comes from §Y'The Book of Songs · Minor Odes · Tang Di'§! and is used to describe internal conflicts. However, no matter how intense the internal struggle, brothers will unite under the same banner to resist external enemies. According to the 'Zuo Zhuan,' during the Zhou Dynasty, Duke Mu treated his clan unjustly, and the descendants of Duke Zhou quoted this poem to explain the importance of unity among brothers.\n\nEven though the §xCommunist Party§! in the northwest and the §qNational Protection§!§e Army§! in the southwest had significant ideological differences in the 1960s, they chose to temporarily reconcile and established the Third United Front when faced with a common enemy—§JJapanese imperialism§!.\nAs the saying goes, 'When danger is near, brothers rush to help. In times of peace, friends may be distant, but brothers are always close.' When brothers quarrel within the walls, they unite to resist outside aggression. When friends are in danger, they may hesitate, but brothers will always come to help."
