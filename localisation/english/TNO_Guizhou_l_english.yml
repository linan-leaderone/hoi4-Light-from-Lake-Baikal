## Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_HE_YINGQIN_DESC:0 "It is unfortunate that every day, He Yingqin's control of Guizhou seems to be coming closer to its end. The military is already practically controlled by Yunnan and the economy is hanging on by a thread.\n\nMost had expected He Yingqin, as one of Chiang Kai-Shek's right hand mans, to take an important role in the governance of China, and his shrewdness only supported this. Of course, few expected the Second Sino-Japanese War, in all of its furious terror, to render the old KMT dead and Wang Jingwei ascendant, least of all Yingqin. After defecting in the last few days of the war, He Yingqin's political reputation survived by the slimmest margin, and he lies on a razor's edge.\n\nNow the Chinese appointed governor of Guizhou, balancing minority and Han relations and attempting to steadily liberalize the country, He Yingqin has one worry that keeps him up at night. Yunnan."
