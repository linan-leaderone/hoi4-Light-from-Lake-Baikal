 PAN_corruption_high: "§RHigh§! Corruption in the Assembly"
 PAN_corruption_high_desc: "Corruption has ingrained to our bureaucracy to such an extent that it became the system itself: no bill, public development, or acquisition happens without backroom dealings and private "donations" to politicians and bureaucrats, and any investigation to put these issues to light are smothered before they can even start anywhere.\n\nOur government is shackled by the barons, and our humiliation witnessed by our people, who trust in us less and less by the day."
 PAN_canal_payments: "Canal Payments"
 PAN_canal_payments_desc: "The economic value that transits daily from the Panama Canal cannot be understated; even with the blockade between Japan and the US, Panamá is the only means one can cross the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean without crossing the perilous, cold Southern Ocean. Millions flow through hundreds of ships crossing the canal daily, and yet only a meager 250 thousand is shared to our country properly.\n\nOur strategy's importance is undeniable, yet we are the ones that profit the least from it."
 PAN_oligarchy_4: "Influence of the Oligarchy-Extreme"
 PAN_oligarchy_4_desc: "Plutocracy is seldom defined as a serious government method, yet in Panamá it is virtually the rule. The wealthy and powerful dictate the political life of the country, who gets elected, what projects are made, and whose money-laundering companies acquire the exclusive right to government projects that will never be finished; the voice of the people is but a faint, easily ignorable echo in the halls of power, an afterthought to the barons' nation."
 PAN_party_stability_low: "Coalition Stability: §RLow§!"
 PAN_party_stability_low_desc: "Every bureaucratic branch of our government competes and infight each other, trampling each other for benefits or funding, while politicians simply look for their benefit, first and foremost.\n\nAs long as this situation keep as is, no change can ever come to our benefit."
 coalition_working_modestly_well_idea: "The Coalition Is Working Fine Together"
 coalition_working_modestly_well_idea_desc: "What was once a pipedream is now shaping into reality, as the members of our coalition have united into a goal besides their self-survival in the political apparatus; while disagreements are still the daily routine, we can say for once that the representation of Panamá is headed towards the right way."

 POLITICS_RIDLEY_DESC: "Alright so if your expecting some obscure Panamanian madman that would fit the BurgSys ideology or a funny joke, i got neither.\n\nSo Ridley is commonly put on the lower end of mid-tier, and this placement is clearly bullshit and heres why. First off, all of Ridley's smash attacks are crazy, with side B K.Oing at like 40% and his down smash having enough range to cover any ground recovery from a ledge. Thats not even bringing up Ridley's up smash which is almost as destructive as Ganondorf's up smash with the same range, and faster. *Almost* every Ridley arial is good, with back air dealing considerable damage and front air being easy to land and can easily keep the other person from recovering properly. Then theres his up air that completely dicks over any character even close to the top blastzone. His spike sucks, but thats really it (even with the spike though it has it's uses).\n\nThen there's his specials, which are all decent to fantastic. Ridley's side B is an incredibly useful commmand grab that instantly grants you control of the stage. Then theres his up special which, admitedly, isn't the best recovery, but coupled with Ridley's extra jump makes it servicable. Plus it's high damage output and knockback leave it as a solid attack too. His neutral B is a great projectile move, which is basically just Mario's fireballs but better and more of them. Finally, skewer is cool.\n\nRidley's biggest weakness is it's size and lack of armor to justify it. But, its solid air maneuverability keeps it from just being a sitting duck, and it's multitude of great attacks, atleast in my opinion, make up for it.\n\nSo, to conclude, make Ridley high mid-tier to low high-tier.\n\nAlright, TED Talk over."
