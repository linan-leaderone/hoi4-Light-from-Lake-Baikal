 #Leader Desc 
 POLITICS_JOSE_QUESADA_DESC:0 "In many ways, ETA and its military wing was a product of the francoist dictatorship. The brutal attempts to delete Basque language and culture, the exile into which old Basque nationalists were forced, the repression of workers' movements, the rampant industrialization and urbanization of Euskadi with immigrant workers flocking into the region - these were the ingredients that would converge into the sudden appearance of the abertzale movement. And these very same factors led to the appearance of José María Quesada Lasarte, too.\n\nBorn into a mixed Basque and Navarrese working class family, his father would die fighting on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, but his soon would soon take up the struggle. One of ETA's first militants, Quesada was directly responsible for several daring paramilitary and political actions, attacking convoys carrying Spanish and Iberian soldiers, publicly burning Iberian flags, and other such public demonstrations - quickly becoming the enemy number one of Iberian intelligence, and always escaping their grasp.\n\nOne of the most prominent commanders of the military wing of ETA, he was elected to take charge of the Basque government after the coup that brought the armed organizations of the abertzale left into power. While some paint him as a puppet of his younger, ambitious generals like Argala and other militant abertzale youths, Lasarte enjoys the widespread support of ETA, and he and his clique have multiple times stated their objective - Basque Country and freedom, whatever the costs."
 
 POLITICS_TELESFORO_MONZON_DESC:0 "The recent history of the Basque Country was fraught with conflicts, between the people of Euskadi and their masters in Madrid and between different factions of the Basque movement - and Telesforo Monzón was in the centre of them all. Born into a wealthy aristocratic family in 1904, as a young man he soon joined the Basque Nationalist Party, or EAJ, quickly becoming president of his local section. An intellectual, writer, poet, and fervent supporter of jeltzale ideology, Monzón collaborated with CEDA and other groups against the Frente Popular, but when the nationalist coup d'etat that would lead into the Spanish Civil War took place, Monzón and the rest of his party found themselves fighting on the republican side.\n\nAs the war ended in disaster, Monzón and the rest of the Basque government were forced into exile. Establishing himself just across the border in France, Monzón remained a close friend of EAJ leader and lehendakari of the Basque government José Antonio Aguirre - however, his relationship with the party soon began to deteriorate over diverging positions. Monzón felt that the EAJ was not doing enough to bring about a free Euskadi, and that more radical action was needed. Thus, he kept himself in close contact with the small grassroots organizations that began to spring up in the country - first of all, Ekin, which would later evolve into ETA.\n\nIn time, Monzón became more or less the only person enjoying widespread respect among both the jeltzale right and the abertzale left - and when Iberia fell into chaos and the Basque people took to the street, Monzón was a natural choice as the new lehendakari. Taking upon himself the difficult task of managing the wartime Basque government and attempting to bridge the ideological abyss between ETA, with its numerous affiliated movements, and the old guard nationalists of the EAJ, Monzón is now the lynchpin of the delicate political equilibrium holding the Euskadi forces together - but it's hard to tell for how long it will last."
