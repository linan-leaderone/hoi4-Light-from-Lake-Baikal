 CHT_Mikhail_II: "Mikhail II"
 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC: "Prince Michael Andreevich Romanov was born in exile in Versailles, raised in Scotland, studied in London, and spent the Second World War in Australia serving in the Royal Navy. Although he had hopes of returning to a motherland he had never seen with a Nazi victory, they were dashed by the creation of the Reichskommissariats at war's end. Instead, Prince Michael settled into a civilian life in Australia, working as an aeronautical engineer and staying out of the limelight. Until he received an invitation to Harbin.\n\nWhat started out as a dinner party with some White Russian émigrés escalated rapidly, and he soon found himself swept away by a clique of White Army generals led by Ataman Semyonov and installed as Tsar Mikhail II in the Siberian city of Chita following a swift campaign of steppe warfare. Though he tried to tell them that his parents' marriage was morganatic, and he thus had no claim to the title, they cared little and continued to hold him up as a legitimizing figurehead.\n\nThe Tsar is now stuck between his ally-turned-enemy Konstantin Rodzaevsky's fascist clique to the east, Yakutian separatists to the north, Japanese client states to the south, and a post-Soviet dictator to the west. Needless to say, he's been dealt better hands.\n\nBut he is nonetheless determined to make the best of the situation - assuming the generals ever let him determine anything, that is."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHEPUNOV_DESC: "Boris Nikolayevich Shepunov is, and has always been, an uncompromising man.\n\nA stringent anti-Bolshevik ever since the term had meaning, he fought with Grigory Semyonov during the Civil War, becoming a lifelong confederate and protegé of the great Ataman, and followed him into exile in Harbin following the fall of the Transbaikal.\n\nThere, searching for both logistical and political support for the White movement, he aligned himself closely with Japanese interests, accepting a position within the Japanese-sponsored Bureau of Russian Émigrés. There, he worked to organize training courses on the capabilities of the Soviet Union, hoping to find something to assist in defeating them.\n\nWith the collapse of the Union, and the triumph of both Germany and his Japanese backers in the Second World War, he thought that chance had arrived. He was wrong, but it was not long before he, together with Semyonov and some of his former students, devised a plot to lure a Romanov princeling to Harbin. The success of the plot and the installation of Mikhail II as the 'Puppet Tsar' of the Far East did much to advance and legitimize the White cause, but the collapse of the alliance of convenience with the fascists shattered his dream of a glorious advance, and left him little more than yet another Russian warlord.\n\nIn the wake of the consolidation of the Far East and the Ataman's death, however, he has finally managed to rise to become the Prime Minister. Once and for all."

 CHT_Nikita_I: "Nikita I"
 CHT_Nikita_I_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LNikita Alexandrovich Romanov, uncle of Mikhail II and enthroned as Nikita I, Tsar of all the Russias, is a puppet.\n\nHe knows this. His ministers know it. His generals, who hold his strings tightly, most certainly know it.\n\nAnd yet, he is content. Born in the waning days of the old Empire, he well remembers, as a young man, only narrowly escaping the fate of many of his relatives. Initially settling in Paris, he continued his education at Oxford, married and had children, and continued his life as best as he was able. But he never forgot the land that he considered his family's birthright, and during the 1920s and 1930s was very active in émigré monarchist circles. During the Second World War, he initially watched the collapse of the Soviet Union with glee, but the establishment of the Reichskommissariats and the brutal infighting amongst the Russian statelets that followed, he was sure that monarchism in Russia was dead and gone.\n\nBut then he received an invitation to Chita. He had heard that his nephew, Mikhail, had been installed as 'Tsar' by a clique of old White Army officers, and hoping for a political appointment he accepted, flying himself and his family to the frigid Siberian city. There he found two things: disappointment, and a 'friend' in Boris Shepunov, the most powerful member of the clique following the old Ataman's death. All of that changed, however, when Mikhail overplayed his hand. Nikita does not know the specifics, but he knows that Mikhail is gone for good, exiled back to Australia, and that Shepunov selected him to be the Army's figurehead Tsar.\n\nIn truth, Nikita would like to have power. But he saw what happened to Mikhail, and if signing whatever Shepunov and the military put in front of him allows him to re-establish even illusory Romanov control over Russia, then he is content to do so.§!"

 CHT_Grigory_Semyonov: "Grigory Semyonov"
 CHT_Grigory_Semyonov_hog_desc: "§YAtaman of the Transbaikal Cossack Host\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LGrigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, the infamous Ataman of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, has spent nearly his entire life fighting the forces of Bolshevism, and he sees no reason to stop any time soon. Born in Transbaikal, Semyonov was once viewed with some skepticism thanks to his mixed Buryat heritage. After giving a good account of himself in World War 1, Semyonov was sent back to his homeland to put together a division of Buryat volunteers. It wasn't long, however, before he was facing down the barrel of the October Revolution. Semyonov wasted no time rallying his forces for rebellion against the Bolshevik regime, and what followed was years of brutal guerrilla warfare against the Red Army in the Far East. In the end, Semyonov was forced to retreat to the city of Harbin, a haven for Russian exiles with nowhere else to go.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union finally collapsed under the pressure of German invasion, Semyonov and his White allies saw their chance. They lured Mikhail Andreevich to Harbin in the hopes they could use him as a source of legitimacy, and marched beyond the Amur to reclaim what they perceived to be rightfully theirs. Now Semyonov and his ragtag force of Cossacks and White paramilitaries find themselves isolated in their old stronghold in Chita. The old Ataman still hopes to one day finish his herculean quest to take Russia back from the brink, but his advanced age has begun to creep up on him...§!"

While old, Mikhailov believes that he has a few final tricks up his sleeves to end, once and for all, those who have treated him so poorly.§!"

 CHT_Boris_Shepunov_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nReactionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LBoris Nikolayevich Shepunov was once a name spoken with a certain degree of both fear and resentment throughout the Russian émigré groups that inhabited the Manchurian city of Harbin, and now, as the new supreme commander of the White Army, his reputation for brutal decisiveness and fervent anti-Bolshevism has followed him north of the Amur.\n\nOnce a soldier in Semyonov's roughshod army in the Russian Civil War, Semyonov followed his defeated comrades to Harbin, a place where he was quick to find himself right at home. In his efforts to reestablish influence for the battered Whites, Shepunov was able to establish close ties with the pro-Japanese regime, and started to train local forces for a hypothetical invasion of the Soviet Union. In the meantime, Shepunov was able to put together a group of like minded individuals willing to do both his bidding, and the bidding of local Japanese security forces. Together, Shepunov's "vigilantes" stalked the streets of Harbin, carrying out reprisals against other émigré groups they deemed to be hostile to their vision of a renewed White Russia.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed and his old superior Semyonov marched beyond the Amur, Shepunov and his gang were among the first to follow him into the fray. Now that Semyonov has passed on, Shepunov has taken the reins as the true power behind Mikhail Andreevich. His personal dislike of the Tsar is an open secret, and there is no telling how long he will continue to tolerate the man he perceives to be both illegitimate and incompatible with his goals...§!"

 CHT_Anatoly_Sobchak: "Anatoly Sobchak"
 CHT_Anatoly_Sobchak_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nNational Liberalism§!\n--------------\n§LTwo words perfectly encapsulate who Anatoly Aleksandrovich Sobchak is: youthful, and pragmatic. In his early 30's by the time that he was appointed prime minister of the resurgent Russian Empire, Sobchak was formerly the young and quite successful mayor of Chita before being spirited away to his now much more important post.\n\nSobchak's political career had already bloomed during his time in Chita, where he earned a reputation for getting what he wanted - though, unlike many others in Russia, he did so through handshakes, smiles, cordial relations, and back-door dealings. Finding himself on the side of Ivan Mikhailov's anti-army group, he was rewarded soon after with the post of prime minister. While none are quite sure what Sobchak truly stands for, they know that, whatever it may be, he'll find a way to get it.§!"

 CHT_Alexey_Abaza: "Alexey Abaza"
 CHT_Alexey_Abaza_eco_desc: "§YEconomy Minister\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LAlexey Borisovich Abaza is an anomaly in the White government. Whereas most of his colleagues are exiles, Abaza was born and raised in Harbin, and has neither a political background, nor a military one. In fact, he would rather be anywhere else.\n\nBorn in 1916 to a Russian family working for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Abaza attended a prominent school in Harbin with a focus on musical pursuits, and emerged from his education as a talented pianist. Over the next decades, his talents would see him perform in programs across Japan's sphere of influence, and eventually moved to Tokyo to pursue his career in music even further. After the war ended, the late 1950's would see him return to Harbin after spending many years away, during a tour across Japan's new conquests across East Asia.\n\nWhile performing at a dinner party for White Russian exiles, however, he gained the attention of the host, Ataman Grigoriy Semyonov, who would forcibly rope him into a mad plot to invade the Russian Far East. As years passed, the officers of the White Army took a liking to him, and began to entrust him with political offices regarding cultural programs. Abaza cares little for the monarchist cause, but, much like the Tsar he now serves, he is forced to deal with these strange new circumstances as best he can.§!"

 CHT_Nikolay_Kossov: "Nikolay Kossov"
 CHT_Nikolay_Kossov_sec_desc: "§YSecurity Minister\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LWith decades of military experience under his belt and the ability to fluently speak over five different languages, Nikolay Kossov is a man with many talents. Moving with his family to Harbin in 1918, Kossov was in exile far before the hell of the civil war was able to affect him. From there, his career was quite colorful; first as an officer in the Fengtian Clique's army, then as head of military transportation of a district in the newly established state of Manchukuo, then on to become head of Russian counterintelligence in Manchukuo's 4th Army, then finally as a member of its general staff.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, Kossov was in charge of the training of Russian exile recruits in Harbin. Ataman Semyonov's plan to invade the Russian Far East together with the RFP did not escape Kossov's notice, and, with a trained force of emigrants at his disposal, decided to offer his support. In the campaigns that followed, Kossov became a trusted figure within the newly established White Army, utilizing his many talents for both military matters and affairs of internal security.\n\nWhen Boris Shepunov took charge, Kossov was a prime candidate to take Shepunov's place as the White Army's security expert. While his fondness towards the Japanese and deep connections to Manchukuo lead some to distrust him, he is nonetheless an irreplaceable component in the White Army's machine.§!"

 CHT_Dmitry_Volkogonov: "Dmitry Volkogonov"
 CHT_Dmitry_Volkogonov_sec_desc: "§YSecurity Minister\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LDmitry Antonovich Volkogonov represents a radically new direction for the White Army. He is rather young compared to most of his colleagues, and carries with him a wholly different perspective on both the White Army's strategies and how the Empire itself should be governed. After the failure of Shepunov's preemptive coup against the Tsar, Volkogonov was promoted to take the disgraced general's place as the head of the White Army, and the new commander is already hard at work putting his ideas into practice.\n\nVolkogonov was once a low-ranking officer of the Red Army garrison in Chita, and had privately grown troubled with the excesses of Genrikh Yagoda's regime. When the city was eventually overwhelmed by Semyonov's invasion, the White Army found itself in dire need of new officers as the new occupiers looked to massively expand their forces. Volkogonov was among the few who answered the call, and his actions over the next years would lead to meteoric rise through the ranks, as well as increased friction with his older colleagues. The young general, with his limited experience with the Red Army, found the Whites' tactics to be antiquated, and grew weary of their all-encompassing control over the state apparatus.\n\nIn aligning himself with Tsar Mikhail, Volkogonov took a massive gamble, and thankfully for him, it paid off generously. As the new commander of the White Army, Volkogonov is free to push forward with his ideas of modernizing and de-politicizing the military. Beyond the military however, Volkogonov also advocates for extensive liberalizing reforms in the Empire, including the implementation of a strong Constitution.§!"

 CHT_Nikolay_Ukhtomsky_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1895 into a princely family of nobility near Simbirsk, Nikolay's father, Alexander Ukhtomsky, was the leader of all the nobility of Simbirsk. Although Nikolay Alexandrovich entered Petrograd University, he did not graduate because of the outbreak of war with Germany, enrolling in Nikolaev Cavalry School instead. Graduating in 1917, he took part in the war as part of the 5th Uhlan Regiment until 1918, when he joined the war effort of the Whites in the Russian Civil War.\n\nServing initially as a personal adjutant to Colonel Stepanov, commander of White forces in Kazan, Ukhtomsky would go on to participate in battles along the Urals until the end of 1919. By 1920, the fortunes of the war were decisively against the Whites, and Ukhtomsky fled from Krasnoyarsk to Harbin, leaving in 1922 for Germany.\n\nSeven years later, in 1929, he returned to Harbin and began to engage in journalism, in which he heavily opposed the Bolsheviks and communism and called for the restoration of the White movement. These efforts, as well as his aristocratic background and monarchist views, brought him close to Semyonov, and when Semyonov left Harbin to finally begin the restoration of the Tsar, Ukhtomsky went with him to aid his efforts.§!"

When the Soviet Union finally collapsed under the pressure of German invasion, Semyonov and his White allies saw their chance. They lured Mikhail Andreevich to Harbin in the hopes they could use him as a source of legitimacy, and marched beyond the Amur to reclaim what they perceived to be rightfully theirs.\n\nAfter carving out fiefdoms of their own from the carcass of Genrikh Yagoda's crumbling empire, the White factions split along ideological lines. Now Semyonov and his ragtag force of Cossacks and White paramilitaries find themselves isolated in their old stronghold in Chita. The old Ataman still hopes to one day finish his herculean quest to take Russia back from the brink, but his advanced age has begun to creep up on him...§!"

 GENERAL_LEONID_MUSTAFIN_DESC: "§LBorn in 1914 near the city of Chita, Leonid Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and worked from an early age. Joining the ROVS in 1933, Leonid became a surveillance agent for the border police, before becoming a combat instructor, and finally a clerk at BREM.\n\nJoining the army of Manchukuo in 1938, he quickly became a sergeant-major of a communications unit, and graduated from a course to become a commissioned officer in 1943. Training with Cossacks in that same year, he was made a platoon commander and then an adjutant, finally becoming a lieutenant in 1944 and earning a position as a headquarters clerk. His final promotion in the army of Manchukuo was to major, and over the course of his service he received several awards from his superiors.\n\nSeen as wiser than his older brother, he is not as devoted to Shepunov as Vissarion, although he respects him and served as an enforcer in his security forces back in Harbin. When Shepunov followed Semyonov to retake Russia and restore the Tsar, Leonid dutifully followed.§!"

 GENERAL_VISSARION_MUSTAFIN_DESC: "§LBorn in 1910 near the city of Irkutsk, Vissarion Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and began to work as a teenager, first at an arms factory in Mukden, then a gas station, and finally as a border police officer before at last finding employment at BREM.\n\nAfter receiving some education he joined the army of Manchukuo and became a sergeant-major before graduating from a course to become a commissioned officer, eventually becoming a major and receiving several awards from the government of Manchukuo.\n\nA protege of Shepunov since the early 30s, he was one of the first to serve in his security force, acting as Shepunov's much feared chief enforcer, causing Vissarion to be viewed by many as dull and violent, especially when compared to his younger brother. When Shepunov chose to follow Semyonov back into Russia, Vissarion was right behind him as always, and has continued serving him in Chita ever since.§!"

 GENERAL_NIKOLAY_KOSSOV_DESC: "§LBorn in 1908 in Kiev, Nikolay Borisovich Kossov has had a wildly successful military career. He moved with his family to Manchuria in 1918, in the midst of the Russian Civil War. Growing up in Harbin, he served in the military of the old Fengtian Clique, rising to become an officer even before the overthrow of Zhang Xueliang by the Japanese.\n\nAfter the establishment of Manchukuo, he only became more prominent, becoming head of military transportation in a district of Manchukuo, then chief of the Russian counterintelligence unit of the 4th Army of Manchukuo, before finally helping lead a cavalry division into the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, after which he became a member of the general staff. Becoming a leading officer at the headquarters of the 4th Military District, he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he also became the chief military instructor of Russian emigrants in Harbin, and received his final promotion in the army of Manchukuo in 1945, to colonel. When Semyonov at last left to reclaim Russia, Kossov was one of the many who followed. During his time in Harbin, Kossov mastered several languages in addition to Russian, including English, German, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nHe is known for being generally supportive of Japanese interests and has many useful connections over in Manchuria, though this causes him to be distrusted by some.§!"

 GENERAL_DMITRY_VOLKOGONOV_DESC: "§LDmitry Antonovich Volkogonov is a rather young general within the White Army. Hailing from the city of Chita itself, he's long stood as an outlier in the White Army's officer corps - a leader of more "liberal" officers, compared to some hardliners like Shepunov, Volkogonov has spent the past few years cultivating a grassroots informal organization of younger officers within the city of Chita with the goal of liberalizing the empire.\n\nDynamic and impassioned in his quest to end the de facto stratocracy that Semyonov and his successors had imposed on the monarchy-in-exile, Volkogonov has harboured a quiet and simmering resentment towards Shepunov and his stooges for quite some time. Regardless of the direction of the empire, Volkogonov has an interesting career ahead of him.§!"

 CHT_uneasy_figurhead_desc: "All hail Tsar Mikhail II, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias by the Grace of God! Many praises ring out in Chita for the Puppet Tsar, but the reality of the situation is very different. Essentially kidnapped and forced to assume the throne amidst bickering and aging White Army officer cliques, Mikhail wishes for little more than to see his home again, far away from Russia."
 CHT_sunset_of_white_chivalry: "Sunset of White Chivalry"
 CHT_sunset_of_white_chivalry_desc: "Much of the state's military leadership consists of aging White Army generals more concerned with past glories than addressing the situation at hand. Many of them are not long for the world, and the illiberal nature of the government makes attracting younger and more innovative replacements difficult."
 CHT_white_army_leadership: "White Army Leadership"
 CHT_white_army_leadership_desc: "The leadership conflict was solved; the Tsar can worry about taking charge once we finally reclaim the Motherland.

 CHT_imperial_prospector_corps_desc: "Siberia is a cruel mistress. Thick, freezing cold forests and miles upon miles of sprawling, uncharted land. Not to mention the even more hellish climate up north. But, Siberia is also filled with untapped ores. Thus, the Imperial Prospector Corps braves these climates in search of these minerals, blazing trails through the east and taming the wild beast that she is."

 CHT_imperial_development_company_desc: "The Imperial Development Company is a state-run corporation tasked with the clearance of land area in the harsh Siberian wilderness, and the development of infrastructure and public works across our prospective empire. Thanks to generous 'investments' out of our Tsar's pockets, the IDC has wasted no time transforming the wasteland into something more usable."
 CHT_specialist_training_idea: "Specialist Training"
 CHT_specialist_training_idea_desc: "The focus on specialist training for the state's military is having a marked effect, as ordinary soldiers are responding effectively in situations that ordinary drills could not have prepared them for.

Take heed, for the Ataman is watching from far above!"

 CHT_imperial_governing_committee_military: "Imperial Governing Committee"
 CHT_imperial_governing_committee_military_desc: "The Imperial Governing Committee, a political structure tasked with oversight of the state's vast and near-autonomous territories, has been dominated by military interests.

 CHT_the_true_heirs_of_harbin: "The True Heirs of Harbin"
 CHT_the_true_heirs_of_harbin_desc: "When the Bolsheviks overthrew Alexander Kerensky's unlawful government in the October Revolution, they threw Russia into chaos. The White Army, ourselves included, fought them bravely and for years before being forced to retreat. Keeping the belief of a Tsarist restoration alive, we relocated to the Manchurian city of Harbin and formed both a government-in-exile as well as an unlikely (but necessary) alliance with the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in the face of Nazi onslaught we seized our chance and, with Tsar Mikhail II, moved to take our rightful place. But the fascists betrayed us, stopping our advance and splitting our territory. They claim legitimacy, but they have none. With the leadership of Grigoriy Semyonov and his ever-loyal generals, true patriots of Mother Russia, we will defeat them and prove that we are clearly the true heirs of Harbin."

 CHT_civilian_investments: "The Tsar's Investments"
 CHT_civilian_investments_desc: "What is an empire without a military? And what is a military without a civilian industry to act as its support, producing anything and everything, from combat rations to supplies needed for logistical support and beyond. Our empire will eventually span the entirety of Russia, and right now we will need to ensure that a precedent is set for the establishment of the Tsar's investments into domestic, civilian industries - not just to support our ever-hungry military, of course, but to guarantee that our state will not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure that every Russian - from the wealthiest residents of our glittering cities to the poorest of the villages - are taken care of and given the opportunity to earn luxury."

 CHT_mining_knowledge: "Siberian Resources"
 CHT_mining_knowledge_desc: "Siberia is so frequently portrayed as a vast, unsettled wilderness, covered in marshy swamps and frozen tundras. While this assessment isn't inherently false - it tends to obscure the material value of the land that we currently occupy. Its value isn't what's on top of the earth that we stand on - but instead what's underneath. The region has a large amount of resources that we can exploit, such as silver and copper, for both personal use and export.\n\nMost importantly, however, the paramount resource that any Siberian statelet could covet - coal. Coal is used to power our hungry factories, allowing them to consistently pump out the goods that we need to survive and thrive. We need to invest in the extraction of these resources for the benefit of our state and our economy."

 CHT_Military_investments: "The Military's Addendum"
 CHT_Military_investments_desc: "No empire is formed, and no empire endures, without a strong military. Without us. Ataman Semyonov, having led us on the long journey to Chita, understands this implicitly. But we find ourselves weakened by budget cuts imposed upon us by the civilians. This is intolerable. Dangerous.\n\nWe have submitted an addendum to the budget currently under review which, if accepted, will ensure that we get the resources we need to prepare for the fights ahead. All we need to do is meet with the Tsar and convince him of the addendum's importance. Without it, the state will not endure."

 CHT_import_industrial_expertise: "Contact the Reform Bureaucrats"
 CHT_import_industrial_expertise_desc: "It's the sad truth that our industrial body is severely lacking in any sort of expertise or veterancy. Any technical or industrial experts that Chita once harboured were either killed in the decades of strife or fled, apparently anywhere but here. But without those well-versed in industrial management and development, how will we be able to ensure an effective and efficient development of our industry? Clearly, outside help is needed. Many of the White officials, despite residing in Chita, still have significant connections in Harbin and, by extension, Manchuria as a whole. It may be best for us to contact Manchuria's reform bureaucrats - those who had been put in charge of the miraculous industrialization of their state - to see if they have any resources or manpower to spare. Sure, there may be a cost in acquiring their expertise, but surely it's worth it."

 CHT_connecting_chita: "The Imperial Transport Commission"
 CHT_connecting_chita_desc: "Siberia is, to put it lightly, vast and ill-connected. For many of our soldiers, weeks-long marches are required to get from one place to another, and it's often worse for the peasantry living in the towns and villages within our domain. The economic inefficiencies caused by the logistical issues presented to our administration are simply unacceptable, especially in light of the conflicts that lay just beyond the horizon. We must found the Imperial Transport Commission, headed by the most experienced of our White émigré friends of course, which will be tasked with the connecting of all the towns and major villages within our statelet."

 CHT_industrial_machinery_deal: "Import Industrial Machinery"
 CHT_industrial_machinery_deal_desc: "Our industrial equipment is, to put it diplomatically, terrible. Other, more couth members of our administration have said even truer things about its state. The reality is that most of the equipment that we have in our factories is inherited from the Soviets, and almost all of it is decrepit at best and completely unusable at worst. But you can't make new machines without, well, working machines.\n\nAnd so, we must begin to search for ways to import industrial machinery, for the sole purpose of kick starting our own domestic and civilian sectors - perhaps our old friends in Manchuria can help out. This will not only ensure that we have an operable industrial economy going forward, but that our factories will be able to effectively churn out weaponry and supplies for our soldiers."

 CHT_examining_the_force: "The Officers' Requests"
 CHT_examining_the_force_desc: "Any good military needs a well-motivated officer corps. We can promise them glory for the future, but for the moment we need to promise them money. They are woefully underpaid and underequipped, but those they lead are much worse off. They are requesting funds - not to line their own pockets but to provide proper equipment to those they command.\n\nTheir requests are noble and just, and surely the Tsar cannot but see the wisdom in ensuring that his loyal soldiers are properly equipped before they bravely face his many enemies. Consequently, funds for this purpose will be added to our budgetary requests."

 CHT_examine_our_artillery: "A Modern Artillery Corps"
 CHT_examine_our_artillery_desc: "Two world wars have conclusively proven the superiority of artillery on the battlefield as a significant force multiplier, and this is one of the few principles that our older and younger officers both agree upon.\n\nHowever, the artillery we possess is both few in number and antique in manufacture. It may be expensive, but if we invest in a new and modern artillery corps, using our own customized designs and organization, we can ensure that we have the best artillery in Siberia!"

 CHT_new_infrastructure: "The Imperial Prospector Corps"
 CHT_new_infrastructure_desc: "More copper, more iron, more coal... more, more more! The current production quotas aren't nearly enough to keep up with the rapid - no, exponential - industrial growth that we're witnessing. Without the resources to support the massive increase of factories that we're looking at, well... perish the thought. Mikhail, at the behest of the brightest economists of Chita, has declared the formation of the Imperial Prospector Corps, an organization that will be dedicated to the searching out of mineral deposits within our borders and begin their exploitation. Progress comes at a cost, certainly, and the IPC is well aware of that. But in a place as wild as Siberia, Mother Nature can take a backseat to progress in order to ensure the prosperity of the Tsar's subjects."

 CHT_public_works_company: "The Imperial Development Company"
 CHT_public_works_company_desc: "In the darkest days of the anarchy that reigned in Siberia following the concrete establishment of our state centered in Chita, unemployment was rampant and many turned into transient workers, often without a home. While things are looking brighter now than they were then, our civilian sector is still suffering.\n\nThus, a number of our prominent economists have proposed founding an Imperial Development Company, a state-run corporation that is put in charge of and sponsors public works projects - organizing them to give people employment and further develop our crippled civilian industry. The reorganization of our civilian sector is paramount to ensure that our state has a functioning economy during the wars of reunification that are ahead."

 CHT_industrialization: "An Industrial Empire"
 CHT_industrialization_desc: "With no shortage of assistance from the Imperial Development Company and the Imperial Transport Commission, the industry of Chita, the heart of the White movement, has gone from terminal to roaring in the matter of months, it seems. As our industry and output get stronger, we continue to construct more factories in an ever-increasing cycle of industrialization.\n\nBut we shouldn't stop here - this industrial growth is only a small step towards our goal - a fully industrialized state spanning from the Pacific to the Baltic. Nonetheless, the models for growth that we have constructed and tested in the area of Chita, and their general success, will act as examples for what we can do in the future. But for now: there is no rest for the brave worker."

 CHT_war_resources: "Strategic Resources Extraction"
 CHT_war_resources_desc: "While the industrial equipment that we received from Manchuria and abroad helped revive our civilian industry and allowed us to actually operate the factories that we currently possess, sadly, it's not enough for us to expand our resource extraction campaigns. The Imperial Development Company, as effective as it has been so far, seems to be a bottomless pit of demanding further resource allocation to ensure a continued development schedule, and one of the most pressing demands that their administration has come to us with is the implementation of further resource extraction. Thus, we must take on a domestic effort to improve our industrial equipment, as it has now become possible, so that we can take full advantage of the natural resources afforded to us by the bounty of Siberia!"

 CHT_reclamation_act: "The Reclamation Act"
 CHT_reclamation_act_desc: "Our small enclave has many things - an ever-dedicated officer corps, the best troops that can be conscripted, and factories that belch out refined, industrial goods day in and out. What we are lacking, however, is usable, arable land. Sadly, apart from the city of Chita and a few other mentionable towns and villages, most of the land that is controlled by the Emperor of All Russia and his administration is completely unusable.\n\nVast tracts of marshes and forests so thick that a man could barely pass through the trees. After a wise suggestion whispered into the ear of the Tsar himself, Mikhail II has declared the implementation of the Reclamation Act, a law that puts the Imperial Development Company in charge of clearing unusable land to transform it into tracts of earth that could be used for anything from low-yield farming to training grounds for our troops. Anything's better than the squalid backwaters that the IDC has been tasked with clearing."

 CHT_importing_rifles: "Import Japanese Surplus"
 CHT_importing_rifles_desc: "The Tsar is told that our industry, fledgling as it may be, works day and night to produce the best equipment for our soldiers. This is a polite fiction. In truth, we do not have the capacity to produce enough rifles, cannons, ammunition for the soldiers we have, let alone those we want to recruit.\n\nDuring the years we spent in Harbin, we made excellent use of equipment given to us by the Japanese. Manchukuo is just across the Argun, and we still have many connections there. Importing a small amount of the vast stockpiles of Japanese arms scattered around the country should prove a simple task."

 CHT_artillery_imports: "Support Artillery Investments"
 CHT_artillery_imports_desc: "Our officers' plan to modernize our artillery is close to fruition. Working together, our older and younger officers have rapidly developed a detailed plan to completely overhaul our army's artillery in both doctrine and design. All that's left is to obtain the Tsar's approval.\n\nTsar Mikhail knows how critical the military is, and how much we've done, how much blood we've shed, for him. He won't refuse us. He can't."

 CHT_specialist_training: "Specialist Training"
 CHT_specialist_training_desc: "Modern warfare is dominated by the specialist - the soldier who both trained in and experienced with tasks that no ordinary soldier would be capable of. We are surrounded by enemies, but the Tsar can be assured that our triumph can be guaranteed by transforming our soldiers into an army of specialists.\n\nTraining relating to command decentralization, behind-the-lines operation, sabotage, and much more will be worked into our soldiers' regular training regimens. In this way, we can say that we will never be caught unprepared."

 CHT_the_Far_East_Finest: "The Far East's Finest"
 CHT_the_Far_East_Finest_desc: "Our military is Siberian, and very few of our soldiers and younger officers have spent time west of the Urals. But this is a strength - if they can survive and thrive here, of all places, they can do so anywhere!\n\nIf we incorporate their knowledge and values into our standard training, we can transform our collection of conscripts, émigrés, and vagrants into the Far East's Finest, a disciplined force seemingly invulnerable to the cold and capable of remaining organized in even the worst of weather. The Tsar wouldn't want it any other way, we're sure of it."

 CHT_the_Tsars_own_division: "Imperial Guard Divisions"
 CHT_the_Tsars_own_division_desc: "Colloquially, our army is often referred to as 'The Tsar's Finest,' a nickname intended to give pride to the many peasant conscripts making up our forces. But some officers have proposed making the nickname a reality, concentrating a handpicked group of the most loyal, most experienced, and most physically fit soldiers together in specialized units.\n\nThe old Tsars had their Imperial Guard, elite infantry that could not only handle any task but also inspire others to greatness. It is only natural that Tsar Mikhail, the rightful Emperor, has his own."

 CHT_the_tsar_combined_arms: "A Unified Doctrine"
 CHT_the_tsar_combined_arms_desc: "One of our greatest military struggles is the constant disagreement and infighting between our officers regarding operational doctrine. Older generals cling to the grand battleplans of the Great War, while younger officers propose concepts of combined arms. This paralyzes progress, and can no longer be overlooked.\n\nA decision defining the future of our armed forces must be made. We will hold a conference, including both the oldest and most innovative officers, and presided over by the Tsar. With the eyes of their monarch upon them, they will finally decide upon a unified doctrine."

 CHT_true_modern_warfare: "Modern Warfare"
 CHT_true_modern_warfare_desc: "While distasteful, we must acknowledge that the Bolsheviks demonstrated innovations in modern warfare. Their application of it against the Germans might have been ineffective, but it nonetheless set a standard for warfare across the vast expanses of Russia.\n\nWar has changed, and it's clear that we need to invest in the mechanization and motorization of our army so as to ensure that our soldiers are well equipped for the realities of Siberian combat, regardless of the protests of some of our older officers. Our empire cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors - backwards thinking is to be discouraged at all costs."

 CHT_stabilize_budget: "Making Our Play"
 CHT_stabilize_budget_desc: "With our civilian industry taken care of and growing, our borders secured with defense schemes in place, and the military's pressing needs attended to, we can finally look outwards and begin the process of finishing what should have been done years ago - the systematic destruction of the Russian Fascist Party and its thugs.\n\nNow is the time - we can capitalize on their squabbling, destroy the Party, and recover the territory that we worked so hard to conquer when the Union collapsed. The Bolsheviks couldn't destroy us, and neither could the fascist betrayal. Now that we're able, we can finally display the strength and endurance of the true White movement!"

 CHT_western_defence_scheme: "Western Defence Scheme: Chita"
 CHT_western_defence_scheme_desc: "The city of Chita, over four decades ago, was the capital of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, where Ataman Semyonov had made his last stand as the final hope for defeating Bolshevism in the Far East. Now, it is once again our hope for restoring the Tsar to his rightful place in the nation, and the Army must take careful steps to defend its holdings.\n\nThe provisional capital of the monarchy is situated dangerously close to the frontier where our control ends. We have no other choice but to protect it, and thus the High Command has suggested the construction of fortifications and the design of new plans to ensure Chita will not fall. West and north of the city, additional garrisons will be placed and new defensive lines will be formed. As our headquarters, it is the first place where our overhaul of defenses will begin."

 CHT_western_defence_scheme2: "Western Defense Scheme: Ulety"
 CHT_western_defence_scheme2_desc: "If one was to follow the road leading out of Chita and heading southwest, just before they cross into communist-held lands, they would come across the small settlement of Ulety. Initially nothing more than a normal village, Ulety earned the attention of the Tsarist generals as the final outpost controlled by them in the west. A small military base has been built, where soldiers guard the principal road before it enters hostile territory.\n\nAs part of the 'Western Defense Scheme' endorsed by most of the Tsar's generals and approved by His Majesty, Ulety will be reinforced, as everyone understands that it is a crucial choke point for any invader. By building a new, larger outpost there, we can help ensure the safety of our warlord state and hopefully stall any possible enemy from the west before they reach Chita."

 CHT_eastern_defense_scheme: "Eastern Defense Scheme: Srednyaya Olekma"
 CHT_eastern_defense_scheme_desc: "On the bank of the River Olyokma, as it enters Transbaikal, rests the small town of Srednyaya Olekma, which could be considered our greatest base in the northeast. It has proven crucial in maintaining a line of defense against Rodzaevsky's fascists, and continues to be a checkpoint the Tsarist Army uses to exert its authority in the northeast, as well as stop occasional raids by hostile warlords or simple bandit groups.\n\nA reinforcement will be required if we look to expand into the fascist-held lands and secure our flank to the north at the same time. As it is the only town we hold in the region, it must become a stronghold against any army."

 CHT_eastern_defense_scheme2: "Eastern Defense Scheme: Tupik"
 CHT_eastern_defense_scheme2_desc: "South of the city of Srednyaya Olekma, where we last focused our efforts on backing up the garrison, Tupik is yet another village saved by anarchy or oppression by the arrival of the White Army. Since we prepare for the very real possibility of war with Rodzaevsky, known as the 'Vozhd' of Amur, the Eastern Defense Scheme has begun, and Tupik is a key part of that. By significantly reinforcing the settlement, we can end the constant raids in its surroundings, and build yet another strong defensive point near the frontier.\n\nThe situation in Tupik is considered different by many in the government, though, as the village is tiny and there are no pre-existing military installations there. Despite that, it is judged as crucial in forming a line in the east, and the Tsar's most trusted generals believe building up Tupik will be an easy process."

 CHT_eastern_defence_scheme3: "Eastern Defense Scheme: Amazar"
 CHT_eastern_defence_scheme3_desc: "The final outpost we must fortify and perhaps the most important, seeing as we are heading into conflict with the fascists to our east, is the town of Amazar.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway, although often damaged, rebuilt and destroyed in the last years, has still remained a vital artery to the lands beyond the Urals, connecting city after city and allowing the transport of people and supplies across its length. Amazar has had the luck to not only be included in the dozens of towns the railway passes through, but also just barely escape the grip of Rodzaevsky.\n\nAs both an important railway junction and the last camp to the east, we must take great care in protecting the town. Reinforcements will be called to act as garrisons, and reconnaissance units will be formed there as well. Soon, they might prove surprisingly useful."

To tackle the enormous challenge presented by our mission of liberation, critical changes will have to be made to the character of our movement. No longer is the White Army a scrappy band of old exiles, riding into battle on horseback as though the glory days had never passed.\n\nAs our territory grows and our ranks fill with fresh faces, it is clear that we must shift our eyes to the future. Thus, the transition to a proper nation-state commences. Legal scholars have already begun work on the Empire's new constitution, putting great emphasis upon the divinely ordained authority of the Tsar and his loyal generals, while rejecting the chaotic mob rule that led to Russia's fall from grace. It is from these humble seeds that a legitimate body of government will sprout forth; God willing, one worthy of prosecuting the liberation of our sacred Motherland."

 CHT_an_inconvenient_figurehead_desc: "Grigoriy Semyonov was well aware that in order to build rapport with the people, the White movement would require a figure commanding national pride to rally behind. To that end, Semyonov chose to seek the restoration of the monarchy. While Vladimir was the true heir, he had thrown his lot in with the German invaders; an unforgivable betrayal in the eyes of the Ataman. Thus, invitations were sent to every other Romanov we could find to join us in Harbin, under the pretense of a dinner party in celebration of their dynasty.\n\nOnly one would reply, and his name was Mikhail Andreevich.\n\nTo say that this arrangement is far from ideal would be generous indeed: Mikhail was certainly not our first choice, nor our second, or even our tenth, and yet, he is all we have. The Tsar is already viewed with skepticism by his people, and is widely disliked by the White Army's officer corps. Boris Shepunov in particular was among the first to protest the Ataman's choice of monarch, but, in order to honor his old comrade's wishes, he intends to make the best of the situation. The people need not know about their Tsar's dubious claim for now; he is their rightful sovereign, and let none say otherwise."

It is possible that this wouldn't matter if he had charisma, but, tragically, Mikhail possesses all the social acumen of a clinically depressed plumber. Perhaps it would be wise, for the time being, to keep the Tsar out of public view to grant him time to acclimate, and in his absence craft a more convenient narrative.\n\nBehold, the Tsar of Holy Russia! A veteran of the Second World War, our monarch proudly served the Fleet Air Arm. After a career of daring aerial heroics that earned him too many medals to count, the humble Mikhail opted to retire to a modest life as a brilliant aeronautical engineer. When the Ataman voiced his plea to the world, however, only our gallant Mikhail Andreevich was brave enough to answer him. On one snowy night in Harbin, he astonished the White exiles with his commitment to liberating Russia's people, and now, he stands at the forefront of Russia's salvation!\n\nIt's all complete nonsense, of course, but our loyal subjects need not see it that way..."

When the time had finally come to return home, however, it soon became clear that although the exiles had never forgotten their roots, memories of her sons had long since lapsed from Russia's thoughts. Generation after generation had been born and raised under the watch of the Bolshevik devils, poisoning their minds with Lenin's lies and slowly eroding the traditions of the past.\n\nEven now, the newly-liberated peoples of the Far East remain unconvinced of the restored monarchy's intentions, their lenses tinted red from decades of indoctrination. If the true Russia is to be resurrected, the consent of the people is paramount. Propaganda will be of help, but actions will reach their hearts faster than any poster or speech. With the aid of Chita's civilian administration, work programs will begin to phase out military workers in favor of labor drafted from the people, granting job opportunities to the commoners by the good graces of His Imperial Majesty. In time, the people of Russia will rediscover for themselves the benefits an Empire has to offer."

Thanks to the efforts of the state, the people are content with their new ruler at best, and blissfully apathetic at worst. Now the time has come to peak beyond the horizon, and attempt to build bridges with the White movement abroad.\n\nMost of them have shunned the efforts of the White Army so far, considering Mikhail's reign to be a farce on account of his marriage. While their complaints would have held water in years past, the situation is rapidly changing. The Transbaikal Government's forces continue to gain momentum; accomplishments which have surely not gone unnoticed. Perhaps these victories can be used to entice the other White organizations into taking our efforts more seriously, and display the Chita government as the last, best hope for a restored monarchy.

This system seeks to tear down the barriers between the civilian administration and the military hierarchy, effectively installing Shepunov at the head of both.\n\nSome legal scholars within Chita have complained that this is a blatant turn towards stratocracy. But they simply don't understand - the system is simply a measure to ensure that the men that the prime minister trusts the most are the ones that are in positions to best assist him. Regardless, the military is owed its due, having been responsible for the rebirth of the White movement."

His speeches, only barely intelligible, have long been a sore spot between the Tsar and the military.\n\nHowever, Mikhail has, surprisingly, expressed a degree of interest in his duties. With a renewed sense of vigor he goes about learning Russian and involving himself in any way that he can. It seems that our prayers have been answered!\n\nWhile some worry that this will lead to a more independent-minded Mikhail, at the end of the day, the military is still in charge."

His first audience was with Mikhailov himself - adding to Shepunov's reluctance - though Mikhail's intent to visit and inspect the Imperial Guard in Chita seemed to placate him.\n\nWith these public visits and private audiences, the Tsar will make himself known to both the people and those within the civilian positions of power as a present and willing monarch."

At a public event in Chita, the Tsar would make overtures and actions that Shepunov would simply be unable to abide by.\n\nThis, of course, is incredibly dangerous - even if it was successful, it would draw a line in the sand and likely make the prime minister of the Tsar's plans. However, if Mikhailov's bet pays off, Shepunov would have his machinations revealed publicly.\n\nMikhail knows that without sufficient civilian support that this plot could backfire intensely - however, he has ultimately decided that it will be worth it.\n\n§RWarning: without sufficient civilian support, this plot could seriously go wrong for Mikhail...§!"

The pair sat down to dinner, ostensibly to discuss the future, in the Imperial Palace of Chita while Boris Shepunov mustered the local garrison, under the control of Volkogonov, to march on the palace and arrest the "plotters".\n\nThe deafening quiet in the Tsar's dining room paralleled the silent, tense march of the Chita garrison as both headed towards the climax of the long-awaited confrontation between monarch and military.

Now, however, our borders have grown to encompass the entire Russian Far East, and the IDC as it is cannot effectively expand operations to the rest of the region.\n\nPerhaps a state-sponsored expansion of the IDC is in order. With the help of some generous financial investments from the Tsar himself, the IDC will be expanded far beyond their previous capabilities.

After the establishment of the Imperial Development Company and their reclamation campaign, we were able to turn it into something far more usable.\n\nThe results speak for themselves, and it is only natural that we look to the rest of our newly-acquired lands to give them the same treatment.

Once the proper infrastructure is developed, we can begin filling the new space with all sorts of productive enterprises. Factories, mines, and arms manufacturers shall be the order of the day.

Our interests in exploiting the natural resources of the Far East and eventually beginning industrialization efforts will fall woefully short of their goals if we don't have a reliable labor pool to back them up.\n\nOur chief of staff, Boris Shepunov, has proposed a controversial solution. He believes that the vast number of prisoners taken during the wars to reunify the region are serving little use sitting in prison, and can be better utilized by putting them to work. Although some concerned ministers have pointed out that such an idea would be immoral, it is worth remembering that these fascists and Bolsheviks would have very well inflicted the same treatment upon us given the chance!"

While previously their support only came in the form of war materiel and covert aid, our unification of the region means that the proverbial door is officially open to the Japanese.\n\nWe see no reason why this shouldn't be encouraged.

Luckily, our bonds with the Japanese and the Zaibatsu have only grown stronger over time, and we can use this to our advantage.\n\nJapan's industry is one of the most modern in the world, and it goes without saying that their cutting-edge industrial equipment plays a large role.

This will not do, and the solution may once again lie in the land of the rising sun.\n\nJapan's economy is renowned for its brutal efficiency, and we would do well to try and copy their methods of production however we can.

If we continue to use the same system of governance once utilized during the struggle against the Reds and Fascists, our economy will surely begin to face drastic consequences for our inaction.\n\nIvan Mikhailov, Minister of Finance, has proposed a solution that comes straight from the long and celebrated history of our empire. The thousands of towns and villages of our state shall have their voices heard and their labor concerns considered via a system of local councils, modeled after the Imperial Zemstvo system. Mikhailov believes that these modern Zemstva will take a considerable amount of strain off our administration and better organize the peasants and workers of Russia."

These financial conglomerates control much of their economy, and are the key driving force behind the Sphere's financial interests. To build a functioning, powerful economy of our own, perhaps we could look to the Zaibatsu for inspiration and foster the creation of our own business giants.\n\nSponsored by the crown, we shall establish a series of Imperial Corporations. The corporations will serve a similar role to the Japanese Zaibatsu, and will hopefully grow to be a formidable economic force in their own right. To better ensure the corporations have opportunity to grow, they will be given a great deal of privileges and be allowed to operate as they see fit so long as their interests do not conflict with those of the Empire. If all goes to plan, the Imperial Corporations shall be the greatest weapons in our economic arsenal."

Such a system has worked well in the past, and famously was responsible for transforming the western portions of Siberia into Russia's industrial backbone.\n\nAlthough the conditions are not nearly as favorable in the Far East, that is not to say we cannot establish specialized zones to nurture the region's burgeoning industry. As we create these zones, we will look to our urban centers as well as the spaces of nature that had been reclaimed.

Times have changed, and we cannot continue to accept anything less than the very best men for the White Army.\n\nChief of Staff Boris Shepunov demands a strict tightening of the Empire's recruitment standards to ensure that only capable, disciplined fighting men will make the cut.

Sadly, our current regimens are mostly designed with the goal of getting as many recruits through the system and into the fray as quickly as possible.\n\nTherefore, the priorities of our approach to the training routines have to make a drastic change. Instead of focusing on the bare minimum to increase the quantity of new troops, the new drills will focus on building discipline and proficiency. The White Army's recruits will get to terms with the rigors of warfare on the training grounds, rather than on the battlefield.

Despite the general staff's hesitations, there is only one answer to this problem: the White Army needs new blood.\n\nAlthough the old Whites have been skeptical of allowing new officers into their ranks due to fears of liberal and even socialist sympathies infiltrating the higher echelons, the fact is that we cannot avoid the inevitable. We will need new officers at some point, for the White movement will die out with the old generals otherwise.\n\nThe time has come to ignite the flames of Russian monarchism and anti-Bolshevism within the next generation of Russians, for it is they who will become the general staff of tomorrow."

Sadly, we currently lack the facilities for training new officers.\n\nThe general staff has proposed establishing Imperial War Academies for this purpose. The Far East is home to a few war colleges from the Soviet era and older that have gone without use for many decades now, and they could serve our purposes quite handily.

Sadly, the world has moved on from fighting on horseback. Fight it as we may, cavalry as we know it is simply obsolete, but that is not to say the idea itself is without merit.\n\nMobile units have evolved, and now armored vehicles such as the tank and APC have fulfilled the role that the valiant riders of old once played. To keep in touch with our traditions of fighting on the move without shunning modern innovation, it would be wise to embrace the tried and tested tactic of mechanized infantry blazing across enemy lines supported by heavy armor.

No, we have already begun to plan how to circumvent this unique economic situation that our new benefactors have imposed upon us. However, in the meantime, it's time to publicly acknowledge the benefit that the Zaibatsu have brought us and prepare for their landfall in the Far East."

 CHT_emigres_abroad: "Émigrés Abroad"
 CHT_emigres_abroad_desc: "With our conquest of the Far East, we have once again put ourselves as a real, if not obscure, blip on the international map. One of the unexpected but certainly welcome side effects of this has been the revitalization of the waning White émigré movement, the survivors of the Civil War or their children. These émigrés exist worldwide, with significant populations in Europe, Harbin, and the Americas.\n\nWith our diplomatic situation stabilized a little bit, it's time to appeal to these émigrés. We will ask for donations from those interested and able, as well as promising repatriation to all émigrés who come to the Far East and serve our government in the reconquest of all of Russia. We expect the first wave of the most dedicated and ideological émigrés to come shortly."

 CHT_back_to_manchuria: "Back to Manchuria"
 CHT_back_to_manchuria_desc: "When our brave soldiers departed from Harbin, we were a mixed group of fascists, conscripts, and Tsarist ideologues. Unfortunately, a great many of the Whites in Harbin, reluctant and cynical about our attempts at reconquest, stayed behind.\n\nOver the years, these émigrés, or the most prominent of them, became quite close with the Manchurian reform bureaucrats, involving themselves with Manchukuo's large and healthy industrial sector. Now that we've established ourselves in the Far East and proven to these once-cynical émigrés that we're here to stay, only the most traitorous would think not to join us, and bring with them all of the industrial expertise they've cultivated over the years."

 CHT_across_the_ocean: "Across the Ocean"
 CHT_across_the_ocean_desc: "Great numbers of émigrés, instead of fleeing to Harbin, instead went to Europe or the Americas. While the Nazis have imposed a curtain of terror over most of the lands that they conquered and secured, émigrés who still can come from Europe, and those who are the most willing to come from the Americas, shall do so.\n\nFurther promises of repatriation and involvement in the government through privileged positions have indeed already enticed many, and will surely do so for more émigrés, attracted by the prospect of a true restoration of the empire. With these new émigrés, especially those from the United States and England, bring with them their academic backgrounds and highly educated children - this steady stream of men and women from the more learned parts of the world will serve to increase our ability to educate the next generation and help create a real educated base for our Russia."

 CHT_looking_for_recognition: "Looking for Recognition"
 CHT_looking_for_recognition_desc: "Now that we've stabilized the Japanese demands and begun to attract an influx of émigrés who will help in the development of our nation, we can finally think about actually lobbying for official recognition. Controlling but a quarter of Russia's territory and only a fraction of her population, this will certainly be an uphill battle - but with the Japanese backing our claim to Russian legitimacy, the hardest steps have already been taken.\n\nAn official statement of intent for the reclamation of Russia and the re-establishment of the Imperial Tsarist system shall be made, but assurances towards Washington in regards to constitutionalism and our eventual distancing from the Japanese will hopefully placate their fears. Ultimately, our goal is to have both the Americans and the Japanese view us as the rightful Russian heir."

 CHT_off_to_tokyo: "Off to Tokyo"
 CHT_off_to_tokyo_desc: "While it may seem like a no-brainer at this point for the Japanese to recognize us as the rightful claimant to Russian unification, their administration has certainly been fickle in the past, and are certainly not perfect - a stark reminder of this was their support of the RFP instead of our movement.\n\nThus, the administration in Chita has prepared to send an official delegation to Tokyo in order to request the Japanese officially recognize the White movement based in Chita as the rightful heir of Russia. Their sending off by plane from the city of Chita was seen as a new era by many within Chita's administration - a new era of success and prosperity."

 CHT_a_hope_beyond_japan: "A Hope Beyond Japan"
 CHT_a_hope_beyond_japan_desc: "The Japanese are the "safe bet" in terms of international recognition, but by no means are they the only power whose recognition that we seek. Apart from Tokyo and her spherelings, the Americans across the Pacific and their economically-powerful Organization of Free Nations has long been a target of some of the more open minded and innovative individuals within our ruling circles.\n\nGiven our close work with the Japanese for the moment and our quashing of the American favourite from Magadan, this will almost certainly be a quest that will end in disappointment. However, it's important that we try, and at the very least establish a precedence for a future relationship with Washington and her allies."

 CHT_the_tsars_speech: "The Tsar's Speech"
 CHT_the_tsars_speech_desc: "Tsar Mikhail, his authority now cemented after the fall of Shepunov, has decided to take to the air waves to announce a new era in the history of Russia: an era of freedom, prosperity, and individual liberty, where all Russians, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, will have the chance to live in harmony and peace.\n\nOf course, the Tsar actually has to know how to say that in Russian. Mikhail was born in France and spent his life just about everywhere but Russia. When he was kidnapped and brought to the city of Chita as a prisoner in all but name, he was forced to read speeches phonetically, frequently not even aware of what he was saying. Even now, his Russian is poor.\n\nThis has apparently not dissuaded the reinvigorated monarch, who has consulted with Mikhailov to get a full-time language tutor - so that he can finally learn the language of his people."

 CHT_enforce_the_new_imperial_system: "Enforce the New Imperial System"
 CHT_enforce_the_new_imperial_system_desc: "Despite all our best efforts, the civilian administrators that we've put in place are still struggling to enforce order over the vast amounts of territory that we control in name. Furthermore, some elements in the army, reports Volkogonov, are still simmering at the removal of Shepunov. These serious allegations have alarmed many in the Tsar's new regime - and have quickly brought them to take action.\n\nThe Tsar and his closest have decided that the new system that they worked so hard to create - and gambled with the Tsar's life - to solidify is priceless, and as such, should be guarded against all attempts at dissension and sedition. However, Volkogonov and Mikhailov have warned of extremes; the new administration must walk a very delicate tightrope to ensure that the actions they take to secure their rule does not demonize them to the people they are humoring."

 CHT_a_new_white_movement: "A New White Movement"
 CHT_a_new_white_movement_desc: "The White movement was established in the wake of the October Revolution, when the Bolsheviks seized power in Moscow and Petrograd, sparking a civil war that would last for years. That was in 1917, over five decades ago. While the prominent leaders of the original White movement were once brave and valiant soldiers, officers, and statesmen, the ravages of time killed many and enfeebled many more.\n\nWith the passing of the Ataman in 1962, the last of the great veterans disappeared, leaving in his wake the worst of the worst.\n\nBut now, we find ourselves in control of the last vestige of the White movement - and, with our triumph over Shepunov and the reunification of the East, we can begin to make the White movement our own - defining it in modern terms, shedding the archaic and bringing in new generations of ideologues, so long as they don't deviate too far from the Tsar and his clique's vision."

 CHT_depoliticize_the_army: "Depoliticize the Army"
 CHT_depoliticize_the_army_desc: "One of the main issues that the White movement faced during our shaky first years was the dominance of the military and its strongmen in the politics of the movement. Individuals like Boris Shepunov and any other potential power brokers that would have succeeded him are representative of the worst parts of our movement, and thus should be weeded out and eliminated - if any are still around.\n\nFurther, however, it's important that we not just weed out existing troublemakers, but also ensure that the army will forevermore be an organ of the Tsar's will - and nothing more. The academies will churn out officers dedicated to the Tsar and no one else, and the troops will equate their support for the Tsar as important as their dedication to Russia or God himself."

 CHT_end_their_legacy: "End Their Legacy"
 CHT_end_their_legacy_desc: "There was the White movement, and then there was Boris Shepunov. Shepunov and his cronies, decrepit old men who didn't believe the Civil War ever ended, while being a part of the White movement, certainly didn't represent it.\n\nThe White movement is best represented by those who worked behind the scenes, as well as the tempered constitutionalists and Tsarist loyalists: the exact sort of people who trumped Shepunov and his perfidious schemes not just a few years ago. Thus, we should work to end the legacy of the likes of Boris Shepunov and his clique of enfeebled old men. His name shall be demonized, his character placed beside the Soviets and the fascists as threats to our movement, and all those tied to him or his old administration shall be investigated, and, if need be, forced into retirement and obscurity."

 CHT_make_our_claims_official: "Make Our Claims Official"
 CHT_make_our_claims_official_desc: "Our administration and its predecessors have long claimed the legitimacy of the Russian Empire, denying the legality of the February and October Revolutions. However, while we've held ourselves to this for years, the vast majority of the international community takes our claims with a grain of salt.\n\nThus, it's time to make a formal statement to our people and to the entire world that we are who we say we are: The heirs to the Russian Empire, the last legal and organized government to rule over all of the Russian people. Of course, lots of work still needs to be done on the specific announcement to make sure that it not only makes our claims clear, but also that it is palatable for the international community."

 CHT_redefine_our_history: "Redefine Our History"
 CHT_redefine_our_history_desc: "We have a chance - an incredibly, extremely rare chance - to be able to reforge our identity in light of the recent domestic triumphs that we have had. Throughout the Russian Civil War and the years of exile in Harbin, many began to believe that the White movement was synonymous with some very, very terrible tendencies: virulent anti-semitism, the so-called "White Terror", a history of cooperation with the despicable and long-defunct Russian Fascist Party to name but a few.\n\nWe need to make it clear not only to the world, but to our people, the ones that we shepherd, that these tendencies were not - and are not - representative of the White movement. Instead, only a few select individuals of our movement, like the perfidious Shepunov, for example, were responsible for what the whole movement became known for. Our White movement, bad eggs not included, is one that has always aimed for the restoration of a free Russia under the Tsar."

 CHT_placate_the_workers_worries: "Placate the Workers' Worries"
 CHT_placate_the_workers_worries_desc: "One of the legacies of the Soviet Union was the vast and overly-ambitious Central Siberian Plan, which saw a massive increase in industrialization east of the Urals, throughout Central and Western Siberia - some of which we now control as our own territory. In these areas, where industrialization is much higher than in other places that we have controlled in the past, the workers, used to generous concessions by their former administrations, have grown worried that the Whites would not respect the rights that they cherish so dearly.\n\nWhile we don't plan to give them the same concessions afforded to them as the Soviets, not by a long shot, the administration has agreed that a small, conservative bill of workers' rights would serve to placate the worries of the workers in Central Siberia and ensure that they would be more willing to cooperate with us."

 CHT_a_new_generation_of_industry: "A New Generation of Industry"
 CHT_a_new_generation_of_industry_desc: "Despite our well-documented attempts to distance ourselves from the Co-Prosperity sphere and their long, damaging economic tendrils, few would admit that our former association with Japan and her scions in Harbin have been complete wastes. One of the few genuine bonuses that we've garnered from our cooperation with Tokyo was in the form of the Manchurian Reform Bureaucrats - a series of Japanese and Manchurian men who set about industrializing and modernizing Manchukuo's economy.\n\nWith significant time spent in Harbin and its educational institution, there has been a new generation of White émigré economists, the first and oldest only just now entering the relevant workforce, inspired by these Reform Bureaucrats, that have a number of ideas on how to steer the future of our economic development. These new economists should be recognized and given the positions needed to ensure that they will have the most positive effects on our economy as possible."

 CHT_expand_the_imperial_corporations: "Expand the Imperial Corporations"
 CHT_expand_the_imperial_corporations_desc: "One of the first and most central suggestions that these young Reform Bureaucrat-inspired economists have suggested is the systematic destruction of Japanese Zaibatsu influence within our nation and the expansion in their stead of the Imperial Corporations that had been set up when we were first struggling with the fascists so many years ago.\n\nThey have aptly suggested that we should be, in accordance with our international goals, reducing our reliance on the Zaibatsu which have until now been a fairly influential force on the economy, and instead focus on growing the Imperial Corporations into massive companies in their own right. While some argue that this would only be a temporary measure pending a more tempered reaction in the future, others have been silent on the future of these Imperial Corporations."

 CHT_introducing_new_officers: "Introducing New Officers"
 CHT_introducing_new_officers_desc: "Our rapid expansion westwards has been both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, we reach ever towards the unification of Russia, on the other, the plethora of logistical and manpower-based issues seem to never end. One of the most glaring issues is the lack of commissioned officers in our service.\n\nThere have been a couple of ideas about how to counter this crippling lack of skilled leadership. The first is to begin raising a new generation of officers to be trained and disciplined in our way, molded to our exact image. The second method, perhaps more practical, would be to simply repurpose and conscript officers of our now-defeated rivals in the Far East and Central Siberia to assist in both leading troops and training new officers. Likely, this would result in a less "ideologically pure" group of officers, but it would certainly be a lot easier."

 CHT_volkogonovs_plan: "Volkogonov's Plan"
 CHT_volkogonovs_plan_desc: "The new chief of the army and interim prime minister of the government, Volkogonov has come to the Tsar and his advisors to suggest what he calls the eponymous "Volkogonov Plan". He has outlined a series of issues within the Imperial Army and a group of solutions that would address them.\n\nFirstly, a grand, sweeping plan of conscription will be introduced to make sure that we'll have enough soldiers for our final push westwards. Secondly, there would be a comprehensive and total propaganda campaign among our troops and throughout our territory that would help redefine the image of the White Army, wiping away the fear and distaste that many have for our movement."

 CHT_a_quick_chat: "A Quick Chat..."
 CHT_a_quick_chat_desc: "Up until now, the Japanese have been both good and bad for us. They have provided us with machinery, weapons, and logistical support, not to mention the model upon which we have based our new economy on.\n\nHowever, all of these things have come at a price. Economic concessions, namely, and the expectation that one day, these so-called "debts" to Tokyo will be repaid in kind with diplomatic, economic, and political favors.\n\nRealistically, we have no interest in being even moderately in debt to the Sphere. Thus, we should set expectations going forward with our former benefactors in a terse, but honest conversation that they'll surely not be happy about."

 CHT_and_a_long_call: "... and a Long Call"
 CHT_and_a_long_call_desc: "With the Japanese dealt with we can finally look across the Pacific where our true diplomatic future resides: The United States of America. The leader of the Organization of Free Nations and one of the most ardent opponents of both the exploitative and fascist Nazis and Japanese, they're consistently reaching out to nations around the globe to aid them in their international struggle against authoritarianism.\n\nWhile our movement has a history of authoritarianism itself, now that we've shed the problematic individuals that had garnered that reputation for our administration, we can begin to work towards bridging the gap between ourselves and the Americans. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it."

 CHT_one_final_push: "One Final Push"
 CHT_one_final_push_desc: "One final push - that's all we need. One final effort, a single exertion. We've come so far, and we've attained so much. From the barren hinterland of Chita, to the struggle with Shepunov and his cronies... we now stand at the precipice of glory, ready to achieve everything that we've struggled towards for so long. A pure, unadulterated, White movement, aimed at the systematic destruction of Bolshevism in Russia, but, more than that, the genuine support of the monarchy - the Tsar himself - and by extension, God's Will.\n\nToday, Mikhail II and his advisors have demarcated a new, official holiday throughout Russia, to occur annually: Tsar's Day, to celebrate the life of the Tsar and to recognize the importance of those who had played a role in his ascension. Volkogonov, military leader of the caretaker government has made a resounding speech intended to reach all Russian ears, praising everyone's work in the reclamation. It ended with three words that will become increasingly common in the coming years: S Nami Bog."

 CHT_the_new_white_order_desc: "The dust has settled, and the chaos that overran Chita has come to an end. Prime Minister Shepunov has emerged victorious over the dissidents and traitors who put the White movement in great jeopardy. With Mikhail behind bars, a more proper successor to the Romanov legacy must be found, but before that can happen, the situation must first be stabilized.\n\nPrime Minister Shepunov has officially become the Imperial Regent in the absence of a Tsar, and his first decree is to place the entire nation under martial law, in the interest of restoring peace and stability. A new day has dawned for the White movement, and its future is brighter than ever."

 CHT_our_friends_in_tokyo: "Our Friends in Tokyo"
 CHT_our_friends_in_tokyo_desc: "Of all the foreign powers, none have been a greater friend to our regime than the Japanese. Whatever we ask for, from rifles to tanks to aircraft, is promptly delivered. Meanwhile, the mighty Zaibatsu continue to expand in influence across the nation. Wherever they go, their investments provide an ample boost to the strength of our economy.\n\nWe see no reason why this shouldn't continue. Strengthening relations with Japan is to be encouraged, for why would we shun those who have brought us so much wealth in the past? It is time to reach out to Tokyo, and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our economic partnership."

 CHT_reap_the_rewards: "Reap the Rewards"
 CHT_reap_the_rewards_desc: "The Zaibatsu continue to grow in influence, extracting immense wealth through the development of our resources. Their generous investments have given new life to Russia's enterprises, and have almost single-handedly brought our economy into the modern age. There are some worries, however, that their control over our nation has become too great.\n\nIndeed, it has not gone unnoticed just how dependent we have become on our Japanese partners. Every day, a native Russian business is consumed by the ever-expanding empire of the Zaibatsu, and concerns over the implications of this only grow louder. The Regent is not deaf to these worries, and a policy on how to address the situation is forthcoming. For now, however, we can safely continue to reap the rewards of business with Tokyo."

 CHT_a_line_in_the_sand: "A Line in the Sand"
 CHT_a_line_in_the_sand_desc: "At the Regent's request, a diplomatic delegation is on its way to Tokyo. Its mission: to renegotiate the terms of our economic partnership with the Japanese. The Zaibatsu grow too powerful for our liking, and many officials believe that the sovereignty of Russia itself is at stake if we do nothing to stop them.\n\nWhile we do not wish to cut the Japanese off entirely, we must set boundaries. The Zaibatsu can continue their business so long as it does not jeopardize our sovereignty or workforce. A line in the sand shall be drawn, and both parties will be all the better for it."

 CHT_a_mutually_beneficial_arrangement: "A "Mutually-Beneficial" Arrangement"
 CHT_a_mutually_beneficial_arrangement_desc: "The Zaibatsu bring so much benefit to our nation, so who are we to stand in their way? In his infinite wisdom, the Regent has decided against renegotiating terms with the Japanese. He believes that trying to limit the expansion of the Zaibatsu would hurt the economy, especially considering how dependent our business interests are on them in the first place.\n\nThere are still worries that the Zaibatsu are being used by the Japanese to obtain economic control over the state, but the Regent dismisses these claims. Japan only wants what is best for both our peoples, and being overly suspicious of foreigners without good reason is merely an unfortunate relic of the past."

 CHT_a_militarized_society: "A Militarized Society"
 CHT_a_militarized_society_desc: "Imperial Regent Boris Shepunov, now firmly in command of the state apparatus, has wisely envisioned a new society for Russia. In both the distant and recent past, the influence of non-military cliques threatened to tear the country apart.\n\nNo longer! The White Army, long a vanguard against destructive radicalism, will become intrinsically linked with the apparatus of state. Governors will be chosen from among the ranks of the military, the local police shall be subsumed by the army, and martial discipline shall become part of everyday life."

While many of the new Whites remained steadfast in their obligations to the state, we have not forgotten those who did not.\n\nOaths of loyalty were once a mere formality for service, but now they shall become legally-binding.

 CHT_follow_the_trail_desc: "The ringleaders of the conspiracy against the military are safely behind bars, but concerns persist that many of their sympathizers remain, free to continue insurrection in secret. This is unacceptable, and the time has come to follow the leads gained during our investigation into the false Tsar and his cabal of traitors.\n\nOnce identified, they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

However, there are still many émigrés who doubt our legitimacy, still citing the dubious circumstances of Mikhail's parentage.\n\nWith the false Tsar out of the picture, we now have the opportunity to reassert our claim as the legitimate successor to the old Empire. Though we have more suitable claimants ready to take the throne, they need more time to properly understand the subservience required of the position. Despite this, we can at least begin the process of establishing continuity with our predecessors while the Regency continues."

This is a great triumph indeed, but now the question is raised of what to do with the vast new territories acquired.\n\nFor the time being, the lands of Central Siberia shall be placed under military administration. There are many elements in the region hostile to our interests, and only strong military authority can solve these problems before they grow out of hand.

We shall use the lessons of that conquest to address the issues encountered and better prepare ourselves for the future.\n\nMany say it cannot be done, that the old Whites who lead our army are stuck in the past.

To the west, our greatest foe awaits, preparing as we are for the final conflict. The coming war will be the hardest we have ever faced, but when we emerge victorious we will have secured the greatest prize: the total unification of Russia.\n\nBrave soldiers of the empire, your hardest test draws near.

 CHT.1.t: "The Unwilling King"
 CHT.1.desc: "Tsar Mikhail rose, dressed, and prepared for the meeting with his High Command. It was to take place in the 'Grand Royal Palace', an extravagant title for the rather modest residence that he had been installed in.\n\nSeating himself at the head of the table, Mikhail watched as the generals and functionaries entered. Many were very advanced in age, yet were energetic and passionate, the thought of a grand reclamation of Russia by the White Army spurring them to action. Several were younger, primarily descendants of émigrés or newer recruits themselves. He had always trusted them more; they were more logical and not as shackled to the distant past of the old Empire.\n\nAtaman Semyonov opened the meeting, delivering a speech on the latest developments. His hands shook, and his balance was unsteady, but his voice and eyes were crystal clear. One by one, the other generals stated their opinion and expressed their concerns. Mikhail mostly remained silent and only occasionally expressed his expected approval as the other generals expressed their opinions and concerns, his head full of thoughts of the life and wife that he had left behind in Australia.\n\nOnce the meeting was adjourned, and escorted by his personal bodyguards, Mikhail decided to walk the streets of Chita. Under freshly fallen snow, the city looked picturesque, and his "subjects," from children to old men, happily went about their lives in the surprisingly safe city. Though he was still uncomfortable in a position he had not chosen, Mikhail felt a moment of pride for this island of stability that he had been chosen as the figurehead of."
 CHT.1.a: "One cannot simply reject the throne."

 CHT.2.t: "The Death of the Ataman"
 CHT.2.desc: "Most unfortunate news has arrived from Chita, the capital of Russian monarchism in the Far East. Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, known as 'the Ataman', has passed away from natural causes at the age of 71. A popular figure in Chita, and a valuable ally of Tsar Mikhail, he has departed this world to join many predeceased comrades.\n\nBorn in the Transbaikal in 1890, Semyonov first distinguished himself in the old Tsar's Cossack legions during the Great War. When the Civil War began, he organized some of the first anti-Bolshevik revolutions in the Transbaikal and, with the help of both the Czechoslovak Legion and the Japanese, managed to seize both Chita and the surrounding regions. There he held out against the Soviets even as the rest of the White movement crumbled, before being forced to flee into Manchuria.\n\nDecades later, as a leader of the émigré community in Harbin, he became a leader of the Japanese-supported anti-Bolshevik front, and rose to become the indisputable chief of the military clique that crowned Michael Andreevich, taking the new Tsar to Chita upon his triumphant return to the city.\n\nAs per his wishes, the Ataman has been buried in his home village of Kuranzha. While it may be dangerously close to the frontier with the socialist revolutionaries, thousands of people, from peasants to generals, have visited to pay their respects. Even His Majesty has issued a statement, expressing his condolences. Semyonov may have left behind a troubled legacy for some, but all of Chita recognizes him as a strong and respected leader."
 CHT.2.a: "He defended his motherland until his final moments."

 CHT.3.t: "An Offer from Chita"
 CHT.3.desc: "Today, a series of proposals and requests have reached our foreign office with a surprising address - the city of Chita, in Russia. Currently held by the Tsarists, the pro-monarchy legacy of the Harbin movement, the city and its administration has requested of us a large degree of industrial aid in the form of factory support and spare machinery. We could agree to deal with them, theoretically, in exchange for some future favor, or we could simply reject the warlord rabble."
 CHT.3.a: "Sure. Always nice to pad the favor wallet."
 CHT.3.b: "No, reject these Tsarists. We've done enough for them."

 CHT.4.t: "Manchurian Industrial Aid"
 CHT.4.desc: "A reply to our request has come through today, sent directly from the capital of Manchuria. The reply, dripping with formality barely contained the implications that the letter hid: the subsequent industrial aid that would be provided to the Tsarists in Chita would come at a cost, and the cost would be more than just money. The Manchurians and their Japanese masters frequently dealt in favors, something that our government has already accepted as a reality. On a long enough timeline, it seems likely that they will come knocking at our front door, asking to be repaid.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, it appears as if Manchuria, likely with the permission of the Japanese, have agreed to our proposal for industrial aid. This is a fantastic win for us - while it won't necessarily help us directly legitimize our government and provide political recognition, it will however allow us to bolster our petty industrial output and shore up our manufacturing. One of the best ways to ensure our victory over our rivals is to make sure that we can put more guns in our people's hands than they can, and that's just what we intend to do with this aid."
 CHT.4.a: "When can we expect the first shipment?"

 CHT.5.t: "Manchuria Refuses to Aid Us!"
 CHT.5.desc: "A simple, manila letter was received today, sent by the Manchurian foreign office. It contained their response to the request that we had made of them - to attain industrial aid from Manchuria, and by extension, the Japanese, in exchange for cash. The response was a simple, single-paged letter politely declining the opportunity, but thanking the Tsarists for bringing the offer forward. The letter was promptly burned after it was reported to those who needed to know.\n\nWith the offer for industrial aid declined by the Manchurians - likely at the hands of their Japanese masters, we can expect that any further industrial development will have to be done directly by us, instead of being reliant on foreign aid. While this is certainly a setback, it's not one that's unrecoverable. That being said, there are plenty of ways for us to fund this industrial development even without the Manchurian's help. Increased taxes, the use of the military for building, and the melding of private and governmental sectors will all be useful for just that. In the meantime, while our foreign affairs office licks their wounds, we can go ahead and draw up a number of proposals for domestic industrial development."
 CHT.5.a: "No one tell Mikhail about this..."

 CHT.6.t: "Reclaiming the Wilderness"
 CHT.6.desc: "Exiting his lodge with a fishing rod in hand, Kiril surveyed the landscape before him. It was another beautiful, picturesque day in the unspoiled Siberian wilderness. The rest of Russia was going to hell, but as far as Kiril was concerned, this place was paradise on earth. Or at least it was, until Kiril spotted a pillar of black smoke rising from the tree line. Looking more closely, he thought he saw distant trees beginning to tumble down and flocks of birds frantically flying away. "What the hell?!" Kiril exclaimed, throwing down his rod as he ran off to investigate.\n\nWhen Kiril finally arrived at the scene, it was worse than he feared. Scores of workers in hardhats were in the process of chopping down trees by the dozens, and large construction vehicles were recklessly tearing up the ground. In the midst of all this, a foreman was directing the workers. Kiril clenched his fists as he angrily approached the foreman, unconcerned with the notion that he may be trespassing. The foreman, a grizzled, older man like Kiril, turned to face the strange man approaching him from the forest. "Who are you? What the hell do you want?"\n\n"I'm Kiril. I live back that way, and I want to know why you're tearing down my forest!" The foreman chuckled mockingly in response. "Your forest? This ain't your property, pal, we checked." Kiril was visibly unsatisfied with this answer. "This is where I come to hunt. I survive off this land! Who gave you the right to come and rip it all apart?!" The foreman sighed. "Look, we're with the Imperial Development Company. The government said we were to clear space for construction, so take it up with them and stop wasting my time!" The foreman turned away from Kiril, and he took this as his queue to leave. Kiril promptly retreated in a huff, and knew that he would be spending much of his night writing angry letters."
 CHT.6.a: "No land is safe from the march of progress."

 CHT.7.t: "War on the Horizon"
 CHT.7.desc: "Mikhail II stood outside the door, the crack in which allowed the voices within to be clearly heard. His generals were holding a meeting, and the Tsar felt that it would be impolite to interrupt, feeling content to remain just outside and listen.\n\nThe unmistakable voice of General Leonid Mustafin spoke first. "I'm not overly concerned by the fascist militias, but I understand Matkovsky has recruited a large mercenary force. They're experienced fighters, and could be a real problem for our soldiers."\n\nAt the general's words, which seemed to imply conflict was about to begin, Mikhail couldn't help but begin to worry. Was war really coming so soon?\n\nA second distinctive voice, that of Boris Shepunov, the Army's Chief of Staff, spoke next. "I disagree, Leonid. Mercenaries want to fight bandits, not real armies. When they see our soldiers, they'll scatter to the wind, and leave the fascists to their fate. And that rabble won't stand a chance against our forces!"\n\nMikhail felt his heart sink. His suspicions were correct, and regardless of what he might want, his little realm was going to war. He tried not to think about all the ways it could very poorly for him. Trying so hard, in fact, that he accidentally pushed the door open.\n\n"That's all well and good," said a third figure, that of General Vladimir Abramov, "but we still have no plans for the occupation of these territories. How do you propose we..." Surprised at the appearance of their sovereign, Abramov trailed off as all of the generals turned their attention to Mikhail.\n\nShepunov was the first to speak. "Your Imperial Majesty, we have exciting news!""
 CHT.7.a: "The pen is set aside, and the sword shall be drawn."

 CHT.8.t: "The Calm Before the Storm"
 CHT.8.desc: "For a very long time, the poorly-marked border zone between the Transbaikal Principality and the lands belonging to the Russian Fascist Party saw little traffic. That has changed. Seemingly overnight, Tsarist troops have established a formidable presence, constructing roads, ammunition depots, and more, visibly and openly preparing for armed conflict.\n\nCorporal Fedorovich was no fool. He knew that these exercises were not for show, and that his unit would soon be going into battle. He began smoking more to help calm his nerves, but couldn't shake the knowledge that he might not live to see another month. Taking a long drag, and hearing footsteps as he did so, Fedorovich raised his head and saw his squad leader.\n\n"Good morning, corporal," the sergeant said. "Got a light?" Fedorovich nodded, lighting the cigarette as asked. The sergeant looked to the east as he took a drag, past the small creek that had substituted as a border marker and towards the distant mountains. He gestured to Fedorovich. "Over that river lies a land filled with hordes of angry fascists." Fedorovich remained silent as he followed the sergeant's gaze. "I'm not going to lie, corporal, it's going to be rough. They're going to throw everything they've got at us, and we're going to take losses. There's no avoiding it, so prepare yourself while you still can, and if the time comes, make sure you take as many fascists down with you as possible."\n\nWith that, the sergeant discarded the cigarette, gave the mountains one last look, and made his way back towards the rest of the men. Fedorovich appreciated the small talk, but his anxiety hadn't waned. Death lay in wait just over the horizon, and the corporal wasn't ready to face it."
 CHT.8.a: "The tension is overwhelming."

 CHT.9.t: "The Execution of Konstantin Rodzaevsky"
 CHT.9.desc: "Konstantin Rodzaevsky took one last look at his surroundings. His beloved Siberia was just as beautiful as always, and his captors couldn't have picked a finer day to execute him. On the journey to his place of execution, he had shouted himself hoarse, and all that was left, radiating from every feature, was rage. It was something his executioners could no doubt see.\n\n"Konstantin Rodzaevsky, do you have any last words?" As the lead executioner spoke, Rodzaevsky returned his attention to the men who now had their rifles trained on him.\n\n"Yes. I do." His sore throat struggled to form the words. "Everything I did, I did for Russia. You can call me a monster, but soon the people will realize that only monsters have the strength to save this country. Perhaps if I had killed that decrepit bastard Semyonov and the rest of those forgotten relics back in Harbin when I had the chance, we'd find ourselves in a very different situation, yes?" The demagogue managed a pained, wheezing chuckle and stood as straight as he was able. "Go on then, make your weak Tsar proud and shoot me already."\n\nA flurry of rifle fire aptly punctuated Rodzaevsky's mocking final words, and the former fascist leader fell to his knees before pitching face-first into the blood-stained snow. With that, Rodzaevsky's movement had concluded the very way it had conducted itself all these years: with unrestrained, bitter violence."
 CHT.9.a: "Perhaps there is some justice in the Russian Far East."

 CHT.10.t: "Life Under the Tsar"
 CHT.10.desc: "Sofiya cautiously made her way down the sidewalk, doing her best not to draw attention to herself as she tried to get home with her groceries. It had never been safe to walk the streets of Zeya before the war, and she saw no reason why that would change now. Just a few minutes more, and her apartment would be in sight...\n\n"Excuse me, ma'am. Could I have a moment?" The voice, coming from behind, stopped Sofiya in her tracks. It had to belong to a soldier - no civilian in Zeya would stop another on the street so casually. Slowly turning around, her heart sank as her suspicions were confirmed. A young Tsarist soldier stood there, awaiting an answer. Though the uniform was different, the gun slung over his shoulder had become synonymous with oppression and abuse under the fascist regime, and she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.\n\n"Apologies, ma'am, but I saw your bag and was wondering if you knew where I could find the grocer." He smiled at her apologetically. "This town is like a maze." Taken aback by the polite nature of the soldier's request, Sofiya replied cautiously. "O-of course, it's on the corner of the intersection just ahead. Just follow the sidewalk from where I came and you can't miss it." The soldier nodded his head in response as he moved to follow her directions. "Thank you, ma'am. Carry on."\n\nAs the soldier departed, Sofiya sighed in relief and hurriedly continued towards her apartment. Such a peaceful exchange would never have happened under the fascists, who were more gangster than soldier. Sofiya was still nervous about having armed men watching her every move, but maybe things were changing for the better?"
 CHT.10.a: "Time will tell..."

 CHT.11.t: "The Question of Yakut Autonomy"
 CHT.11.desc: "As expected, our troops encountered minimal resistance during the 'hostile takeover' of Yakutia, and the vast territory is now under the protection of both the Transbaikal Principality and the Tsar. We must now answer the question of what to do with it. Yakutia is enormous and densely forested, and our army is far too small to maintain strict control.\n\nTsar Mikhail has uncharacteristically broken his usual silence to offer a potential solution. He seems to think that compromise will ensure stability in the region, and that it would be prudent to give a certain degree of autonomy to the people of Yakutsk on the grounds that they pledge their support to us.\n\nWould promoting a friendly Yakut government be a wise move, or would it be better to directly annex the territories?"
 CHT.11.a: "We shall establish a loyal occupation government."
 CHT.11.b: "Their lands belong to us now."

 CHT.12.t: "Directing the Budget"
 CHT.12.desc: "Our young empire has limited resources, and hard choices will have to be made. We must decide which sector of our nation will receive the majority of government funding. While we could attempt to balance our efforts, such an approach risks an unacceptable dilution of effectiveness.\n\nTsar Mikhail has voiced his preference for funding the so-called Loyalists. They wish to focus on developing Chita's infrastructure and expanding its industrial base. To do this, however, much-needed funding will have to be diverted from the military, a dangerous prospect in these desperate times.\n\nIvan Mikhailov, the Minister of Finance has, together with the general staff, proposed an alternative idea. They believe that civil spending should not be our priority until the region is united, and that all funding possible should be diverted to the military until unification is achieved. Although the civilian budget will suffer in the short term, a powerful army may be necessary to secure our position."
 CHT.12.a: "Our civilian industry needs support."
 CHT.12.b: "The military, of course."

 CHT.13.t: "The Execution of Valery Sablin"
 CHT.13.desc: ""Any last words, Bolshevik?"\n\nValery Sablin, now a disheveled, defeated shell of his former appearance, looked up at his captors. Their guns were now trained on him, and there was not a doubt in Sablin's mind what they intended to do. "Speak, red! You won't get another chance!" This time, Sablin decided to humor their taunting demands. "So, this is what it has come to. The war is lost and I'm to die in this dusty basement for my trouble. It's funny, I always thought I'd be executed by the NKVD, not some Tsarist relics." Sablin attempted to stand up straight and look his executioners in the eyes. It was harder than it looked, for the would-be revolutionary was greatly weakened from his time in captivity.\n\n"You Tsarist bastards think killing me is going to end the revolution? Have you learned nothing? The people of Russia will never accept a reactionary monarch. Soon enough, they'll remember all over again why the revolution happened, and when that day comes, another will rise in my place to avenge me and the rest of my comrades. Do your worst, but know that it's going to take a lot more than killing me to crush the revolutionary spirit of the people! This isn't over, not by a-" Without warning, the impatient Tsarist executioners opened fire and prematurely ended Sablin's defiant last speech.\n\nThe force of the rifle rounds caused Sablin to fall backwards against the wall. As his body slid down to the floor, the young revolutionary drew his last breath. Sablin's execution had finally brought the socialist movement in the Russian Far East to a tragic close, and symbolically heralded the ascendancy of the White movement."
 CHT.13.a: "A bang and a whimper."

 CHT.14.t: "Tsarist Infiltrators!"
 CHT.14.desc: "Terrible news! Not long ago, our brave fighters on the frontlines began to report that critical supplies were going missing. Scouts were sent to investigate this matter, as it is not uncommon for our soldiers, who mostly consist of needy peasants, to skim some off the top to provide for themselves and their families. What they found was all the more troubling.\n\nThe supplies weren't being stolen, they weren't arriving in the first place! As it turns out, teams of Tsarist troops have somehow slipped past the frontlines and have established themselves behind our forces in an effort to intercept and disrupt our supply lines. Contingency plans are already being set in motion to squash this little problem, but the damage has already been done and many of our fighters are going without much-needed supplies."
 CHT.14.a: "They still have their faith."

 CHT.15.t: "The Next Step"
 CHT.15.desc: "Tsar Mikhail II leaned against the ornate balcony, a pensive look on his face as he looked out over the frozen town of Chita. In the room behind him, an extremely festive, and extremely loud, party celebrating "his" victory over the other warlords of the Russian Far East was well underway. Hearing footsteps behind him, Mikhail turned to see Boris Shepunov, who looked quite pleased with himself.\n\n"Mikhail!" he called, "What are you doing standing out here all alone? Come, join us!" Shaking his head, the Tsar turned back towards the balcony, and in response Shepunov advanced to stand beside him. "Mikhail," he began, "what's wrong?" The general's jovial demeanour had disappeared. "You've been so distant lately. Care to explain what's going on?"\n\nThe Tsar took a moment before responding. "Boris, now that we...now that you've won, what's going to happen to me?" Shepunov was silent for a moment. "What's going to happen? Now you're going to rule the Far East, Mikhail. Why do you think we're celebrating?"\n\nMikhail shook his head again. "I mean, what do you and your men plan to do with me?" Shepunov nodded slightly, fixing him in a glare. "Ah, I see. Even after all we've accomplished, you still want to go back to Australia, don't you? Speak!" After a long moment, Mikhail replied. "No. No, I want to stay here." A wolfish smile returned to Shepunov's face with astonishing speed. "Good. Very good." He placed a hand on Mikhail's shoulder as he turned to leave. "Your destiny is here in Russia, my liege. Never forget that." Mikhail watched as the general left, returning to the party.\n\nThe Tsar thought on Shepunov's words. Perhaps, in a way, he was right. His destiny was here, in Russia. But he was also wrong. Mikhail was a Tsar, and a Tsar is meant to lead, not follow..."

 CHT.16.desc: "Foreign Minister Nikolay Ukhtomsky drummed his fingers nervously on the desk as he stared at the phone. It was late at night, and he had forgone sleep to await an extremely important telephone call that he knew was coming. The air in the room was tense, the only sounds being that of the owls outside, Ukhtomsky's fingers, and the grandfather clock in the corner. Eventually the telephone rang, and Ukhtomsky sprang into action, immediately picking up the receiver.\n\n"Ukhtomsky speaking."\n\n"Did you get our telegraph?" The speaker on the other end spoke perfect Russian - but with a distinctly Japanese accent.\n\n"I did," Ukhtomsky replied, "and I want to assure you that while the government in Zeya has changed, its intentions have not. The usual contacts will continue the arrangement as-is, but they will now represent us. Is that acceptable?" There was a long pause, and Ukhtomsky struggled to keep his nervousness in check.\n\n"We had a very specific understanding with previous parties," the voice said. "Does your government intend to uphold its...particulars?"\n\n"We do. Unequivocally."\n\n"Very well. We will do the same." The speaker on the other end abruptly hung up. Ukhtomsky leaned back in his chair, and let out a relieved sigh."

 CHT.17.t: "The Trial of Mikhail Matkovsky"
 CHT.17.desc: ""Mikhail Alekseevich Matkovsky, leader of the Russian Fascist party, you have been accused of heinous crimes against Russia and her people. What say you in your defense?" For a moment, Matkosky remained silent. He tried his best to maintain his composure to preserve some small shred of dignity, but the situation made it rather difficult. "I wish to say that it was never my intention to cause harm to Russia. I only did what I thought was necessary to bring strength and unity back to this broken nation, and at the very least, I would argue that my government was a far more legitimate entity than this sham of a trial!"\n\nMatkovsky almost immediately was showered with jeers from nearly everyone present at the trial. He attempted to dodge the vegetables being thrown at him by people in the gallery, but found it difficult with the guards restraining him. One of the prosecution, who almost entirely consisted of members of Chita's general staff, used this opportunity to lash out. "Mr. Matkovsky, as I'm sure you are aware, your father died bravely fighting with us against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. And what has his son accomplished, standing here accused as a war criminal and a fascist tyrant? Mikhail Alekseevich, you are a disgrace to your father's legacy and a disgrace to our movement. I would go so far as to declare you are undeserving of wielding the very name of Matkovsky!" Matkovsky, who was still preoccupied with the objects being hurled his way from the gallery, scoffed at this accusation.\n\n"That's ridiculous! How dare you-" Before moods could flare any further, the judge slammed his gavel several times to regain control over the court. "Order! I will have order! Now, Mikhail Alekseevich, you are charged with over ten thousand counts of murder, and 3 counts of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?" The accused's answer did not shock anyone. "Not guilty!" Before this defiance could cause any more mayhem in the court, a one hour recess was called for the court to deliberate on a sentence..."

My life has grown stranger over the years and I feel as though I have no avenue through which to vent my frustrations. You are one of the wisest men I have ever known, and I hope you can find it in you to give your foolish son good council.\n\nAs you know, I spent much of my life in Australia after serving with the Fleet Air Arm. It was one of the happiest periods of my life, and regrettably the situation has changed for the worse. Several years ago, I got an invitation from a group of Russian émigrés in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of the Romanov family. It seemed like a quaint affair, an opportunity to celebrate my lineage.\n\nBut instead I found myself having a crown placed atop my head in the city of Chita, deep in the Siberian wastes. As I write, I still remain in Russia many years after I left for Harbin, the Emperor of a realm I have no real interest in ruling. This place is horrible, father. I have no real power and these old Whites do not care about me or my well-being. The only thing they do care about is using my name to legitimize their barbaric wars and the atrocities that follow. If I attempt to make a decision, they look at me as though I have three eyes. This land is cold and harsh, and I miss Australia every day. I feel a deep pain in my heart when I think of the wife I left behind.\n\nYou are the only one I can think of to turn to, father. I am locked inside a golden cage in a land that is foreign to me, and I do not know what to do. If nothing else, I can only ask that you forgive your son for being so stupid as to find himself in a situation such as this.""

But what's done is done, and now I have no choice but to face a hell of my own making.\n\nI sincerely regret once again troubling you with my problems, but in truth I have nobody else to turn to. This land is foreign and cruel. I have no friends, only scores of villainous men who pretend to respect me in public and no doubt mock me in private. I am a living, walking joke. They call me Tsar, but everyone knows the truth. I'm a puppet, a figurehead.\n\nI'm now convinced that Russia is one of the worst places on earth. The nights are long, the winters are longer, and the people of this land are irritable and violent. I have gained newfound respect for my forefathers, who somehow managed to keep this god-forsaken frozen hell under control. 'My' armies have seen a great many victories, but I cannot share their enthusiasm. How can I? They claim to be fighting on my behalf, but this is not true. They do not fight for me, they fight for the idea I've been chosen to represent, and for the men who hold me captive.\n\nI desperately want to leave, but I cannot. I am kept under house arrest in all but name, a glorified pet to these relics.

 CHT.20.t: "A Lonely Evening"
 CHT.20.desc: "The Tsar's palace was a lonely place, moreso at night. When Mikhail had first moved in, things had been different. Early sleeps turned into early mornings, and he hardly ever noticed the hugeness and the emptiness of the place. But as days turned into months that turned into years, things began to change. Late, sleepless, silent nights blended into lethargic, lonely days. More and more alcohol was brought into the palace, and everyone knew who was consuming it. He had bodyguards, sure, faceless children of émigrés - but Mikhail knew he couldn't name a single one of them.\n\nOne of these long, sleepless nights, defined by Mikhail's wonders and regret, the powerless Tsar sat in a chair, overlooking a dark window. He couldn't see out of it - the streetlight outside was damaged, and the bright lights of the palace contrasted so deeply with the black night outside that Mikhail only saw his reflection. His mind wandered often, but tonight he could only think of one thing: his father. He had never endorsed Mikhail's visit to Harbin, even begging him not to go. Mikhail had attempted to write letters to his father, many times, with nearly a dozen letters in total written. And yet, he lamented, he had never received a single response.\n\nHe had once been close to his father, but his deafening silence had further crippled Mikhail. With a glass full of liquor in his hand, he wondered why his father refused to respond. Was it to punish Mikhail for leaving? Or perhaps, had he moved and not received the letters? A dreadful thought passed through the Tsar's mind: maybe his father didn't care to respond at all. He finished the brown liquid in a single belt - the first of many, he was sure. Mikhail missed his father. He missed his home, and his family. His mind shifted to one thing: another letter."

It had been artfully enclosed within the vanilla-colored envelope, the result of masterful practice and care by the Tsar. He sighed the deep, long sigh of a man preoccupied with a momentous decision. Gently taking it from his desk, he left his quarters to find Fedor Orlov, his secretary.\n\n"Mister Orlov...?" Mikhail asked quietly as he opened the door. Orlov, sitting at his desk just outside, stood at the Tsar's entrance. "I have... one more letter for my father. He hasn't responded to the others, but I had to send one more. Would you take care of it for me?"\n\nOrlov looked at the letter, and put his hand out to receive it. But as he did, meeting the Tsar's gaze, guilt overwhelmed his features. Tears welled in the young man's eyes. "What is it, Fedor?" The Tsar asked. "Oh, my Tsar, I've done you a great injustice..." Orlov replied.\n\nOrlov proceeded to tell the Tsar his whole story: Shepunov had long been paying him to deliver Mikhail's letters to himself instead of to the post office, and on more than one occasion he had even witnessed the general burning Mikhail's letters.\n\nHearing this, Mikhail felt something he had not felt in a long time: rage. "I see, Fedor. Thank you." Mikhail did not hand the letter to Orlov. Instead, he turned, headed back into his quarters, and wasn't heard from for the rest of the day."

His mind carried a heavier burden than usual, as recent revelations had caused the Tsar much grief. Was there a single man he could trust?\n\n"Good morning, Your Majesty!" The familiar voice broke his reverie. Turning, Mikhail turned to greet Ivan Mikhailov, his Minister of Finance. "What a welcome surprise," Mikhailov said, beaming. "Majesty, would you care to join me? I find a morning stroll is better with company." Although Mikhail did not fully understand why his minister was in his private residence, uninvited, he nodded, and the two men began to walk.\n\nAlike in mind and outlook, minutes passed as though they were seconds while the two spoke, and the subject quickly turned to political matters. "I swear," Mikhailov began, "some days I would rather cast myself into Lake Baikal than continue to haggle with our generals."\n\nMikhail cast a brief, nervous glance around before he replied. "It could be worse, I suppose. Most days they don't even let me leave this house."\n\nMikhailov's pace slowed. "There are many things in this land that simply do not make sense, Majesty. The military holds even more influence than you think." Mikhailov's pace slowed to a stop, and Mikhail watched with concern as the minister cast his own nervous glance around. "Ah, I fear I may have said too much, my Tsar. I should leave before I am missed. We should speak again soon, preferably under less conspicuous circumstances."\n\nStanding alone once again in his gardens, the troubled Tsar was more confused than ever."

You've hardly ever spoken about it."\n\n"Do you want to know the truth, Mikhailov?" The Tsar's tone was much more aggressive and authoritative than usual, and it took Mikhailov by surprise. "Australia was a paradise in comparison. I hate this place, Ivan. And you know what the worst part about it is? I can't leave. No matter how hard I try, there's no way out."\n\nMikhailov was stunned, the spoon slipping from his hand. "Y-your Majesty, I..."\n\n"Enough!" Mikhail roared. "I'm sick of pretending everything is fine, because it isn't. I can't even write letters to my family, did you know that? The other day I learned my secretary was delivering all my mail to Shepunov! Don't you get it?! I'm being held hostage in a country where everyone is spying on me, it's too cold, and I can't even properly speak the language!" Mikhailov was silent, his mouth agape. It was as if, for a few moments, the Tsar had become a completely different person. After a moment, Mikhail calmed. "I... I'm terribly sorry," he said. "That was rather undignified of me."\n\n"No, Your Majesty. You speak the truth. It is a sad state of affairs when even Russia's holy sovereign is nothing more than a slave to the whims of his army. You are the Tsar, the Emperor of All the Russias. The military likes to pretend that means nothing, but they have forgotten their place.

He had known the moment the reports of the collapse of the Red Army's positions outside Irkutsk had arrived. The White Army had entered soon after.\n\nThe following days had been spent in a cell, one of his own, while the decisions on his fate were made, far above and away from his current position. It had taken far longer than he thought - the product, no doubt, of the confused and inefficient nature of the White-led government that had been once reported by the NKVD. But there was, in truth, only one possible choice. And it had finally been made.\n\nWhen the door opened, Yagoda stood. He had resolved to meet his end in as dignified a fashion as possible, not like the so many supposedly strong men he had seen collapse into primal terror when their end approached. He was gripped strongly all the same, and was led through the underground passages and up the stairs, finally emerging in the building's courtyard where a stanchion had been erected in front of one wall. In front of it stood a large party of soldiers and officers, waiting for his placement.\n\nToo many people, Yagoda thought. There was a reason he had always ordered men shot in a dark basement - it prevented people from knowing just what had happened, which therefore prevented any attribution of martyrdom. The knowledge that his name would endure long past this moment was small comfort. But it was still comfort, of a sort.\n\nIn his last moments, as he was fastened to the post, Yagoda felt something he had never felt before. Not fear, but apprehension. Apprehension for what came next. He wondered if all men in such a position felt the same.\n\nAnd then the command was given, and Yagoda felt no more."

 CHT.25.desc: "In their attempt to unify the Far East, the White Army had expected, and trained, to fight both communists and fascists. They had not expected, or trained, to fight religious extremists from the north.\n\nBut fight them they had. Defeated them, they had. Even through defections in their own ranks, peasant rebellions behind the lines, and truly difficult territory, they had defeated the fanatics in the field. Further, upon capturing Omolon, they had also captured their leader, the enigmatic priest Alexander Men.\n\nAt the decision of the central government, Men had been placed on trial, and the entire process had proven far more difficult than anticipated. Because Men would not speak. Not a single word. Through pretrial motions, opening statements, evidence presentation, cross-examination, and the like, he had remained entirely silent.\n\nThis was causing problems for the state as a whole. The sentiments that Men had spoken to in so much of the rural population still existed, and without any response from him, the trial increasingly looked like little more than one for show. Were he to be found guilty, as had been intended, and given appropriate punishment, he would undoubtedly be considered by many as a martyr. And that could not be permitted if stability was to be preserved.\n\nTherefore, the decision had been made and conveyed by proper means. Men was to be found guilty on some, but not all charges, and given a lengthy prison sentence. There would be unrest, but in time and as the government solidified internal control, people would forget about the priest rotting, silently if desired, in his cell.\n\nAnd at that point, the sentence could easily be extended indefinitely. Or restored to that as originally intended."

More and more, they overruled his decisions and took over his portfolio. He supposed he had never gotten along too well with the general staff, but they were going too far. Somebody needed to put a stop to their control over the government, and Mikhailov knew exactly who that somebody would be.\n\nHimself, of course.\n\nIf he couldn't convince Semyonov to loosen his grip, then he might have to resort to more drastic measures. Some freedom would do the people of Chita good, just as it did the economy.

There were countless internal troubles too; a pathetic Tsar, unending unrest, and a seemingly eternal lack of funds. On top of all this, he had already figured that Semyonov was one foot in the grave. It was becoming a real mess of problems.\n\nHowever, it was his mess to resolve, and he would bring down anyone who disagreed with that.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that it meant facing the Tsar himself.\n\nOnce the dominance of the White Army, and himself by extension, was secured, and the unrest suppressed, order would surely follow the long arm of Imperial law across the Far East. Only then would peace begin to come to Russia.\n\nThen, as the twin evils of fascism and Bolshevism fell to the ground like coins, Shepunov would watch, just as he had with the fascists all those years back in Harbin.

However, while some men would take a break after dealing with as much as Volkogonov had been assigned, he simply moved on to the next stack of papers without hesitation.\n\nHe knew he was being assigned all this paperwork because the old generals did not like him, and made very little effort to hide it, but that did not slow Volkogonov down in the slightest. When presented with such difficulties, he would simply have to succeed beyond all expectations. If he kept overperforming, one day somebody would have to take notice. The only real problem he faced was...\n\nA young officer under his command opened his door and saluted, making Volkogonov look up. Immediately, he felt like he knew what this was about, and developed a sense of dread. "Sir! An officer got into a fight with a civilian while drunk. He's from your command, so his punishment is for you to decide."\n\nLetting out a long sigh, Volkogonov stood up and walked towards the officer. He didn't know if he was sighing in relief that it hadn't been as bad as he had expected, or exasperation that this was the third incident involving tensions between the soldiers and civilians this week. He just wished that the army, and generals like Semyonov and Shepunov in particular, would come to its senses and realize they were meant to help people, not hurt them. "Very well. Lead the way."\n\nThe officer frowned and looked at Volkogonov strangely. "Sir, permission to speak freely?" At Volkogonov's slight nod, he continued. "Have you been sleeping well?

His last campaign for the mayoral office had really gotten people fired up- then again, people all across Russia were fired up, desperate for any improvement to their lives whatsoever. He did hope to improve as many lives as he could, though certain... individuals made that task much more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nA squadron of soldiers came towards him, their rifles slung over their backs. Speak of shit and it comes, Sobchak supposed. "You are Mayor Sobchak?" The soldier closest to him asked, his question at least sounding genuine; Sobchak supposed that even though he was popular among the people, with the way things were, soldiers had much more important figures to learn the names of.\n\n"That would be me," Sobchak answered pleasantly. "Is something the matter?" The soldier did not answer, instead shoving a piece of paper towards Sobchak that he had not noticed before. Frowning, he read the paper carefully, his eyes widening more the more he read. "Tax increase? Another one?" He asked, sounding incredulous.\n\n"Sorry." The soldier said insincerely, sounding almost bored, before turning and signalling for his squadron to leave. Sobchak kept switching between looking up at their retreating backs and down at the paper. Did they think him some kind of messenger, meant to give people bad news on their behalf?

Ataman Semyonov said weakly, his voice almost a whisper. Shepunov did as he said and took position on a dusty, vintage sofa by the fireplace. The old man took longer, bones audibly creaking as he sat across from his protege. "Boris, I'll get right to the point. I don't have nearly as much time to waste on platitudes these days." Semyonov ended off with a chuckle which quickly transformed into a messy cough.\n\n"That makes two of us, Grigoriy. Just tell me what you need of me."\n\n"Boris, my time here is running out. It shames me deeply that I won't be able to see Russia cleansed of the red menace in my lifetime, but perhaps I can rest more peacefully knowing that the struggle will continue without me." Semyonov leaned forward. "When the time comes, I want you to take my place."\n\nShepunov was speechless. He had long followed in Semyonov's footsteps, but to take his place? "Grigoriy, I would be honored, but, are you absolutely sure that I'm the one you want?"\n\n"I've had decades to think it over, Boris.

He could not yet say the same of Semyonov's replacement, both as interim Prime Minister and as Commander-in-Chief of the military as a whole, Boris Shepunov. He knew of the general of course, Semyonov's long-serving protegé, and had interacted with him before, but never in such a political capacity.\n\nShepunov had spoken grandly at Semyonov's funeral, eulogizing the man and proclaiming his greatness, no-doubt already knowing that he would be stepping forward to fill the power vacuum. Mikhail was sure that he had equally grand plans. The White Army always did, especially when they involved him.\n\nWhich was why, on this very day when he formally 'invited' Shepunov to take control over the government, he had to fight hard to keep his expression neutral. The man's entire demeanor was entirely different. He walked differently. Spoke differently. His eyes even seemed to have, if possible, gotten even colder than he had remembered.\n\nAs Shepunov thanked him for his 'confidence' and turned to leave, no doubt to execute whatever plans he had already made, Mikhail could no longer prevent a grimace from crossing his face.\n\nWhat was to come?

In Russia, I mean."\n\n"What are you saying? You're the Tsar, you cannot leave." Shepunov raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I don't like it here, Shepunov.

You are going to be staying here in Russia for as long as that crown rests on your head, and I would suggest, strongly, to put to bed any thoughts of abandoning your destiny."

Yeltsov, a man who mere years ago had been a private, eating bottom barrel food not fit for a rat, was now the man who would guard his Tsar with his life.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Tsar was there, stepping out on the top of the Palace's tall steps.

The neighboring White Army formations could fight well enough, of course, but they rarely attempted special maneuvers. So as the sounds of galloping horses began echoing through the small valley that the outpost rested in, they were at first confused. They then realized, far too late, that the sounds were both too loud, and coming from the wrong direction.\n\nWhen the contingent of White Army cavalry broke out of the treeline, immediately overrunning the too-close pickets and galloping towards the outpost at breakneck speed, the RFP officers tried in vain to prepare a defense. But there just wasn't enough time.\n\nThose few troopers already on duty could not believe their eyes. The cavalry advanced, despite their great speed, in perfect echelon, with no subunits becoming separated or fragmented. As they approached the outpost's perimeter, they expertly divided, with the main force leaping over the poorly-maintained wire obstacles and smaller ones circling around both to flank and prevent escape.\n\nThe result was carnage. Utterly overwhelmed, the cavalrymen slaughtered the RFP, either where they stood, or as they tried to flee in terror from this unexpectedly proficient enemy. When it was all over, both the outpost itself and the intelligence contained within had been secured for minimal casualties.\n\nWhen the cavalry departed back westwards, they burned the outpost to the ground, sending the message that the White Army was no longer as ill-disciplined as the RFP itself often was. It was a real, professional force, with tactics to match.\n\nAs they intended to soon prove in increasing fashion."

This particular meeting was of the latter variety.\n\nThe general, one of those closest to Semyonov's inner circle, had walked right past his deputies and secretaries, entering Mikhailov's office and closing the door behind him. From his demeanor Mikhailov could tell that, whatever the man wanted, it would not be something he himself would be pleased to grant. And that he would not have a choice besides.\n\nThe request, as he expected, was polite. The military would be 'requesting' further funds to be diverted towards their own initiatives in the upcoming budget. In order to ensure the defense of the state and of the Tsar, of course. The authorization for that diversion to be included was placed in front of him a moment later, with all of the specific amounts and diversions meticulously identified. All it needed was his signature on the bottom line.\n\nUnder the general's stare, Mikhailov knew he would, and did, sign the document. The general whisked it away a moment later, leaving without further word. As the door closed behind the man once again, Mikhailov once again felt the deep frustration that he had grown used to begin to build within him.\n\nThis time, however, it was even stronger than usual. The military had always ensured its own primacy in the Principality's budget. But lately their 'requests' had grown, in both frequency and amount. Very soon, Mikhailov knew, and if the trend continued, he was not sure where the civil government would find funds for projects of any size.\n\nHe also was not sure if the military cared."

He wasn't alone, of course. Both Minister of Finance Mikhailov and Mayor Sobchak were present as well, giving their own speeches before his own, but as they spoke his anxiety only increased.\n\nHe might not have wanted to be in Chita in the first place, the figurehead Tsar of a formerly-stateless army, but as long as he was he was determined to put his best foot forward. The only problem, at least as far as speeches were concerned, was his Russian. Or, rather, his lack of any considerable experience at speaking it.\n\nAs Mikhail took to the podium, to what was to him an unexpectedly enthusiastic cheer, he withdrew his speech and began to speak, nervously at first, but with increasing confidence. Until he realized he had missed a word. And then a second one. And then a third. In a sudden panic, it was as if he had forgotten Russian entirely.\n\nThankfully, Mayor Sobchak seemed to have noticed his monarch's distress. Intervening, Sobchak thanked Mikhail for taking the time to address his subjects and, in doing so, allowed him an opportunity to step off of the stage.\n\nAs Mikhail left, personally quite relieved, he was again surprised by the cheers that followed him.

Advancing past their former defensive line, the unit soon encountered what they at first thought, owing to the wire fence and observation towers, to be a fortified supply depot. The towers abandoned, a small group of volunteers breached the main gate, under close supervision. Shortly thereafter, they returned, their faces white. The rest of the unit soon discovered why.\n\nThe compound was no supply depot. It was, rather, a camp for those that Rodzaevsky's regime had considered undesirables of any sort. Politically, socially, ethnically, religiously, or for any reason at all. The camp's former guards had deserted alongside their compatriots, but they had left their prisoners behind.\n\nThe shells that moved were more skeleton than human, walking around in a daze, and seeming not even to recognize their liberators as men at all. More than one had fled in primal terror at seeing a uniform, regardless of who it belonged to. Two of them died shortly after gorging themselves on food the soldiers had provided, before the unit's medical officers imposed strict rationing.\n\nBut the worst came when a young corporal found the graves, of such scale that, despite their attempts, the fascists had been unable to properly conceal them. Overcome, the corporal found himself vacating the contents of his stomach before swooning, and taking much effort to revive.\n\nThe unit's commander hastily dispatched messages demanding relief.

His face turned solid and his muscles tightened, preparing himself in case things became heated.\n\n"I apologize for the confusion, but you are not cleared for the conference," the guard said. "I advise you to turn back around and leave, Mr. Sobchak. The meeting has already been underway for a few hours."\n\nA sudden wind chill rushed up the stairs as the guard finished his words. Anatoly's face turned still, albeit tinged with confusion. Shepunov had promised him a spot and now he was told that he had missed it. However, his confusion was brief and replaced with the unfortunate revelation that Shepunov had lied.\n\nSuddenly, his isolation heading up the stairs made sense. Not wanting to risk anything worse, he quietly agreed with the guard before heading back down the stairs and to his office. After all, there was always work to be done, whether or not it was appreciated."

 RUS.smuta.CHT.3.t: "The Ideal Tsar"
 RUS.smuta.CHT.3.desc: "The crackling of a fire mixed with Tchaikovsky while the evening sun set over Chita. Mikhail sat in the homely study found in his palace with a book in his hands. He enjoyed the quiet time, it let him think and get away from the madness that was Shepunov and his clique. Plus, the reading gave him an excuse to practice his Russian.\n\nHis relaxation was interrupted by a change in the radio. Tchaikovsky had been replaced with talking of some kind. An unfortunate change of events, but he had learned by now he had no control over such things. However, as the program went on, he could make out his name. Then he realized; it was describing his life.\n\nShifting his attention fully to the radio, he found the description creative to say the least. Since when did escort become a synonym for kidnap, he thought to himself. Descriptions of exotic Australia and cultural adeptness were met with similarly bemused thoughts by the Tsar. However, as the program went on, he found their little lies quite flattering, which had the effect of loosening his lips.\n\n"Hmm, the savior of Russia and its people from Nazism? A tactful reformer and fighter for all Russians you say? The man who inspired his men to defeat the communists? Why, that all does have quite a nice ring, doesn't it? They should be this supportive more often."\n\nUnfortunately for Mikhail, he was not alone. Two guards stood at the door and got a good glimpse of the episode playing out before them. In fairness, they had become used to seeing the Tsar unbecoming like this. What did surprise them was the smidge of confidence they saw from the Tsar and for that, they raised an eyebrow."
 RUS.smuta.CHT.3.a: "In a rare instance, they even saw the Tsar smiling."

 RUS.smuta.CHT.4.t: "A Whisper from Home"
 RUS.smuta.CHT.4.desc: "Alyosha was a simple man of routine. Every Saturday he would wake up, make coffee, and go out for the mail and paper. Today was no exception as he went out and grabbed his mail, balancing them with the cup of coffee in his hand. When he got inside and looked at them, there was one that stood out among the rest.\n\nIt was a simply folded pamphlet, made out of thin, cheap paper. On the front was a picture of a Russian officer that looked like it came off of a recruitment poster from the First World War. Inside was a map, which directed the reader to some remote city north of Mongolia, with several different routes to get there. On the back were directions in Russian, while the front bore English. Not having actively spoken Russian in years, Alyosha chose to read the front.\n\n"Want see world? Learn heritage? Fight terrible communists and earn citizenship by enlisting! Create story of great adventure and fortune. Make proud family. Join war of glorious Tsar in Chita! -Seattle-Russian Printing co."\n\nTo say Alyosha was bemused would be an understatement. At first, he considered it a prank before thinking about the effort some locals would have to go through to create it. Plus, the broken English lent some credence to the authenticity. Besides, the anarchy in Russia was enigmatic, who could dispute the possibility of a monarchist clique in the remote city of Chita?\n\nHe did not have much desire to go and fight personally, life was good in America. However, he did know some people at the local community center who might be interested, and if they did not somehow already receive a pamphlet, he would be sure to share."
 RUS.smuta.CHT.4.a: "What a curious morning find."

 RUS.smuta.CHT.5.t: "The Tsar's New Groove"
 RUS.smuta.CHT.5.desc: "The city of Chita was set ablaze with light and cheering. Rather than being bathed in the horrors of defeat, it instead soaked in the triumph of victory. The war was over. They had won. Flags emblazoned with the imperial eagle were illuminated in the red, blue, and green fireworks as song echoed from the streets below.\n\nOverlooking one street, the Tsar of this new realm, Mikhail, stood on his balcony gazing upon the spectacle before him. The Tsar was filled with a mix of complex and conflicting emotions over events. On one hand, it was difficult not to become roused at the sight before him, as soldiers paraded down the streets in song. Yet, there was a lingering dread in the back of his mind; one he could not quite place.\n\nA few more moments of thought crystallized the feeling - he was stuck here. In the absurdity that was the success of those ludicrous plans of the White generals, he realized he would never see anything beyond Russia. Whether he liked it or not, he would have to accept this country as his new home. As his stomach turned over the thought, his ears perked at a new sound emanating below his balcony.\n\n"God Save the Tsar! God Save the Tsar! God Save the Tsar!"\n\nThe chant below only grew louder with time as more and more joined in. Slowly, the discomfort in his stomach was replaced with something else; something which stirred in his heart. Seeing these people, his fellow citizens, applaud and cheer him in such a way provided an odd comfort for the out-of-place tsar. This might be his unwilling home now, he mused - but perhaps it would not be so bad after all."
 RUS.smuta.CHT.5.a: "The moving pains started to fade, just a little."

 RUS.smuta.CHT.6.t: "A Conversation in the Cemetery"
 RUS.smuta.CHT.6.desc: "The celebrations that engulfed Chita spread out across the city. Deafening explosions rang out, escaping well outside the city limits, as bright lights polluted the normally calm sky. However, just outside of the city center, a lonely graveyard stood with row after row of tombstones marking the peaceful sleep of their inhabitants below the noise.\n\nBoris Shepunov walked through the sea of sorrow around him. Ignoring the commotion outside, he headed directly to a single grave in the corner of the field, one he was quite familiar with. Reaching it, he knelt and cleared off the tombstone revealing the name Grigory Semyonov.\n\n"Hello dear Ataman, it's been a while since our last conversation, hasn't it? You appear to be doing well, or at least more at peace since you were alive." He smiled faintly. "I could bore you with more details of my struggles, but I have good news."\n\n"We have done it, we have won. At last, the Far East is ours, united under an imperial realm just as you dreamed of so many decades ago. There is still much work to be done though, with the west still unclaimed, but that is for the future. Now is the time for celebration," his voice briefly trailed off. "I only wish you were here with me to celebrate, my friend."\n\nShepunov's voice had become croaky by the end of his conversation. Gently, he placed a single flower on the grave before slowly getting up and turning around. As he walked towards the exit, he was brought back to the world around him as a firework went off above him. He still had much to do when he got back to the palace."
 RUS.smuta.CHT.6.a: "He shed a single tear before leaving."

 ### Regional events ###
 CHT_regional.1.t: "A Legacy to Consider"
 CHT_regional.1.desc: ""Presenting His Imperial Majesty Mikhail II, Emperor of All Russia!" Mikhail emerged from his entourage, coming within sight of the vast row of troops that stood before him. Upon seeing their Tsar, the men stood at attention and gave their due salutes.\n\n"Hail, Tsar Mikhail!" Despite being caught off guard by the overwhelming cry of his name, Mikhail tried his level best to maintain a dignified composure. The procedure went on as planned, as the Emperor made his way down the row exchanging handshakes and salutes. He couldn't help but notice that these young men looked at him with a great deal of admiration, as though he were a figure of divine status. One of the officers he had come to couldn't have been older than twenty.\n\n"Hail, your Imperial Majesty. It is an honor to serve you." The young officer gave a gracious salute.\n\nMikhail sheepishly went in for a handshake. "No, no. The honor is all mine. I am truly grateful for your service." The Tsar gave a slight, nervous smile. He glanced back at Boris Shepunov, who was standing behind him. The old general had his arms crossed, and his impatient expression clearly indicated that he wanted Mikhail to pick up the pace.\n\nAs the inspection concluded and the royal entourage made its way back to their transportation, Mikhail passed by a sight that had caught his eye. A large bronze statue depicting a heroic cossack warrior on horseback was prominently displayed out front of the army base. Mikhail stopped briefly to examine the bronze figure, captivated by the pose of the warrior. The Tsar imagined himself in his place, with thousands of young men looking to him for guidance in the heat of battle."
 CHT_regional.1.a: "A man can dream..."

 CHT_regional.2.t: "Packing the Committee"
 CHT_regional.2.desc: "With the recent establishment of the Imperial Governing Committee to aid with the administrative matters of the empire, a mad scramble for control over the new organization has already begun. The interest groups who dominate the political scene have their eyes upon the committee, eager to pack it with their allies.\n\nFirstly are the Industrialists, who represent Loyalists. This group mostly consists of wealthy aristocrats and businessmen, and are keen to utilize the Committee to expand their business interests in the empire. Also among this group are close political allies and confidants of Tsar Mikhail II, and control over the Committee would surely mean an expansion of the crown's influence.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians and military men allied to the White Army also seek to bring the IGC under their control. The majority of these men have connections to the White Army's general staff, and by extension, Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov. Should the IGC fall under the military's influence, Shepunov's power would once again be cemented over matters of state.\n\nWho shall dominate the Committee?"
 CHT_regional.2.a: "The Industrialists pack the Committee."
 CHT_regional.2.b: "The Military asserts their authority once more."

 CHT_regional.3.t: "Handing Out Grants"
 CHT_regional.3.desc: "The time has come to decide who shall govern the administrative divisions laid out by the Imperial Governing Committee. Minister of Finance Ivan Mikhailov and Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov have butted heads over this critical decision, each submitting their own plan for how the country should be governed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Shepunov's plan for allotting the grants heavily favors the military. If he were to have his way, the governors would largely consist of loyal military men. These handpicked officers will be veteran confidants of Shepunov, with some of them serving with him since the days of the Russian Civil War.\n\nIvan Mikhailov's plan, on the other hand, heavily favors Loyalists. Mikhailov believes that "Royal Governors" should be assigned the grants. These governors will be elected from amongst the civilians of the empire, rather than from the White Army.\n\nIn the end, which of these men will get their way?"
 CHT_regional.3.a: "The land grants will be given to the royal governors."
 CHT_regional.3.b: "The administrative divisions fall under the control of military governors."

 CHT_regional.4.t: "Getting Our Hands Dirty"
 CHT_regional.4.desc: "Boris Shepunov was not pleased. It had been several months since his armies had achieved victory over the Empire's foes, and yet, despite his best efforts, the lingering remnants of past enemies continued to find ways to become a thorn in his side. Today, he had called a meeting with the rest of the White Army's general staff to make his displeasure known.\n\n"Gentlemen, please explain to me how, after supposedly destroying our enemies, they are still out there killing our troops and giving me a headache in the process?" There was no response. No doubt, Shepunov's generals were spending the silent moment formulating excuses rather than providing answers.\n\n"I can assure you, sir, that while these insurgent actions are indeed a pain, they are nothing to be worried about." General Mustafin's tone did not exactly scream confidence. "I predict that they are too insignificant to persist for too much longer, and they will fall apart on their own given enough time..."\n\n"Pardon me, Leonid, but that's bullshit and you know it. They're out there right now killing our men and trying to undo all of the hard work we've accomplished, and you're going to sit there and tell me it's under control? Do you even have a clue what's going on?!" Silence again. Nobody wanted to be next to face their superior's wrath.\n\n"Well, it seems you fools had the audacity to claim victory without finishing the war. That ends today. I want all of you to send your best men out to start making arrests. After this week, I don't even want to hear a peep of dissent, understood? We will no longer suffer traitors on my watch.""
 CHT_regional.4.a: "No more half measures."

 CHT_regional.5.t: "Shoring Up Support"
 CHT_regional.5.desc: "Trouble is brewing in the government, and the tensions between the civilian and military sectors are rapidly approaching a climax. Despite appearances, the dominance of the White Army in the affairs of state is not nearly as strong as it once was. Ever since the death of Ataman Semyonov, the military's influence has grown more tenuous by the day. Opportunistic statesmen circle like vultures, and rally around Tsar Mikhail, the one man they believe can spearhead their intentions of breaking the tight stranglehold the White Army has over the state.\n\nWith the support of a clique of young officers and the backing of Ivan Mikhailov, Mikhail conspires to seize control over the government and reaffirm his status as the absolute authority of the Russian state in both name and intent. While they have the backing of wealthy aristocrats and industrialists on their side, there are growing worries that the scheme is doomed to fail without proper support from military elements.\n\nThe White Army and their Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov, on the other hand, are aware that something is amiss. While they still do not have conclusive evidence that the Tsar is conspiring against them, they are at the very least suspicious enough to prepare for preemptive action against potential dissidents. Contingency plans are being drawn up, and the White Army remains on high alert.\n\nSooner or later, one faction will move against the other, and the destiny of the White movement shall be decided."
 CHT_regional.5.a: "The White Army tightens control."
 CHT_regional.5.b: "The loyalists grow in influence."

 CHT_regional.6.t: "A Small Hiccup"
 CHT_regional.6.desc: ""This is your final chance!" Boris Shepunov shouted, knowing that the Tsar's Honor Guard, occupying the residence's first floor, could hear him clearly. "Surrender and stand down! That is an order!" There was no response, either in word or action, and Shepunov sighed in frustration. He had hoped that the loyalists would come peacefully, and surrender the Tsar without bloodshed, but it was not to be, and now many of them would have to die. He turned to his subordinate. "General Volkogonov, you may begin."\n\nVolkogonov nodded and picked up his radio. "All units!" he commanded, "commence operation on my order!" With one final nod from Shepunov, Volkogonov gave the command. "Fire!" The soldiers, having prepared themselves in predetermined positions, obeyed, and within moments began pouring fire into the Tsar's residence.\n\nRifles and machine guns raked the windows and doors as the cannons of the armored carriers blew holes in the walls, reducing much of the first storey to rubble. Return fire was sporadic and inaccurate, and before long, ceased entirely. A short while later, Volkogonov's soldiers stopped firing as well.\n\nExamining the scene, Volkogonov's chest tightened. He could see the twisted and mangled bodies of the Honor Guard, until only a few moments before comrades like any other, scattered amid the rubble, and those that were still alive would be crippled for life. Full of shame, but not wanting to show it to anyone, least of all Shepunov, Volkogonov turned away as his men advanced on the residence with weapons raised."
 CHT_regional.6.a: "All according to plan."

 CHT_regional.7.t: "End of an Era"
 CHT_regional.7.desc: "Boris Shepunov sternly examined the scene that lay before him. His troops had the Tsar's dacha utterly surrounded; the rats were cornered in their holes. Only a token force of Imperial Honor Guard and a few conscientious young officers stood between him and those who had conspired against the state. The old general prepared to make his intentions known.\n\n"Attention, all of those who serve the Tsar! We are here only to execute the will of the Russian state! Mikhail Andreevich has thrown his lot in with treasonous elements, and has forsaken his holy vows to protect Russia and her people. Stand down at once!" The Tsar's loyalists did not budge. Shepunov could not take their defiance any longer. "Enough of this farce. General Volkogonov, order your men to attack. This ends today."\n\n"No. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir."\n\n"What the fuck-" Turning to face his subordinate, he was met instead with the barrel of a gun. Volkogonov had his sidearm pointed directly at his face. "What... What the hell do you think you're doing, General?!" Shepunov's voice, usually stern and decisive, now bore a rarely-seen panic.\n\n"Boris Shepunov, in the name of His Imperial Majesty, Mikhail II, I am placing you under arrest." Shepunov's world was turned upside down in only a few seconds. Volkogonov's soldiers had turned their sights inwards, and began violently detaining any units present who answered to Shepunov.\n\n"You too, Volkogonov? No... This can't be..." Words had finally failed him. The Prime Minister and Commander of the White Army, formerly the most powerful man in the Empire, felt his knees give out as soldiers cuffed his hands. Almost as soon as it had begun, his iron-clad reign had come to an end."

 CHT_regional.8.t: "The New Siberia"
 CHT_regional.8.desc: "Kiril grunted as he sat down, one of the few opportunities he had to rest after a long day of work. From this elevated position, he could see clearly the results of the day's labor. Vast ranges of landscape, deprived of trees as far as his eyes could see. In their place were stumps much like the one he was now using as a seat.\n\nHere he was, once a son of the Siberian wilderness and her natural bounties, now doing the bidding of the very men he once tried to resist. Although the pay was very good, Kiril still wondered if it was worth selling his soul and helping them to destroy forests similar to the one he once called home.\n\nAs Kiril lit a cigarette, his mind continued to wander. Siberia was a vast land, but even the seemingly endless forests of a land like this were finite in the grand scheme of things. The Imperial Development Company tore into the wilderness like a pack of wolves, ripping down forests and transforming wide tracts of wilderness into featureless plains of grass. Kiril wondered if, in the future, there would even be any forests left once the IDC was done?\n\nHe had been born and raised a man of the wilds, living off the land and appreciating what nature had to offer. Civilization was overrated as far as Kiril was concerned, and he hoped that more people would come to appreciate its beauty. The problem with this, however, was that the pay was no good. In the end, even a wild beast like Kiril was tempted by the IDC's offer of wealth.\n\nFar in the future, would Kiril's children be able to experience the same kind of life that he once did? Putting out his cigarette, Kiril ceased his thoughts and headed off to end his shift for the day."

 CHT_regional.9.desc: "From head to toe, Semyon's body ached. He had been working in a bauxite mine from dawn till dusk, and had only now managed to find time to regain his bearings outside that damned hole he had spent all day in. Once an officer in the NKVD, Semyon was now no better down than a slave to his captors. Certainly not the glory he had envisioned, to say the least.\n\n"Slacking off again, red?" The familiar voice made Semyon groan.\n\n"At least I know when to stop before I drive myself mad, fascist." He didn't even bother to look at who shot the snide greeting his way. The fascist, a large fellow named Anatoly, chuckled as he took a seat next to Semyon.\n\n"They intend to work us to death, you know. I've seen a few guys drop already. The guards didn't even care, they just walked past like nothing happened." Semyon had seen it too. Men too weak for hard labor with a gun to their back, collapsing hopelessly in a place with no light.\n\n"I don't know what's worse, working with dead men walking or working with fascists like you, Anatoly."\n\nThe fascist gave an empty laugh. "It doesn't matter who we were, Bolshevik. All they see are bodies for the mines. We're all brothers down here, whether we like it or not."\n\nWith that, Anatoly made his way back towards the mine's entrance with his tools in hand. Deep down, Semyon knew that he spoke the truth. Part of him hoped that his former enemy would come back out of that pit alive."
 CHT_regional.9.a: "Bitter foes, stuck in the same boat."

 CHT_regional.10.t: "Not as Planned"
 CHT_regional.10.desc: "General Dmitry Volkogonov was growing more nervous by the second. He had promised the Tsar that he would aid him when the time came, and that moment had clearly arrived. However, as was routine in a land as dysfunctional as Russia, the reality was far more complicated than that.\n\nThe White Army must've had over a thousand troops on the field already, with plenty more on the way. Volkgonov's contingent made up a rather small portion of those present, and he found himself almost as outnumbered as the poor souls trying in vain to protect their doomed Tsar. As Boris Shepunov shouted for the Tsar's bodyguards to surrender, Volkogonov's mind drifted into dark places he would've rather avoided. Was his decision to side with Mikhail a wise one after all? What would happen if he tried to disarm his own superior with odds as hopeless as this?\n\nThe voice of his superior broke Volkogonov's introspection. "General Volkogonov, I want your men to move in. I've spent too long trying to haggle with these fools. Time to wrap this shitshow up." The general was caught like a deer in headlights. What would he say? Was this his moment? To betray the Tsar would be most dishonorable, but the alternative would surely spell his doom...\n\n"General? Have you not heard me? Get your men in gear!" Volkogonov gulped nervously. It was going to be now or never. No matter what decision he had made today, somebody was going to consider him a traitor. The only difference would be whether or not he'd survive after the fact.\n\n"Y-yes sir. All units, prepare to advance!" With that, the troops of the White Army descended upon the Tsar's residence. As he walked away from the line with the shame of it all weighing down his soul, Volkogonov could hear sporadic gunfire erupt."

 CHT_regional.11.t: "An Underdog's Tale"
 CHT_regional.11.desc: ""What the hell do we do now? Oh... I just knew this would be a disaster!" Mikhail was frantic, and on the verge of hysterics. Mikhailov, on the other hand, tried his best to remain calm, but the circumstances made it a challenging prospect indeed. Deep down, he was just as terrified as the Tsar was.\n\n"Just calm down, Your Majesty! I'll uh... we'll figure this out! I just need to think..."\n\n"What is there to think about? They know what we're up to and they have the building surrounded! If only I hadn't accepted that bloody invitation, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with!" Mikhail's hysterical shouting only caused an inescapable feedback loop of panic amongst the two. A sudden burst of small arms fire from outside interrupted their musings, followed in short order by an ear shattering explosion that shook the entire building. Mikhail let out a rather unflattering scream as a stray bullet shattered the window he was crouched by. The two men went prone to the floor, covering their heads as the symphony of gunfire reached its crescendo.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, the guns abruptly fell silent. The heavy breathing of both Mikhail and Mikhailov were now the only sound that remained. Mikhailov was the first to rise, peeking out the shattered window to see what had happened. No luck. It was getting dark, and the smoke emitted from the fighting made it hard for the old man to see.\n\n"What's happened? Did we win?" Mikhail asked nervously, still flat on the ground. The Tsar yelped as the door to his dining room was opened. The two men turned to see General Volkogonov, flanked by White Army soldiers.\n\n"Do not be alarmed, Your Majesty. The traitors have been dealt with. You are safe.""

 CHT_regional.12.desc: "A blast of cold Siberian air was the first thing to meet Nikita Alexandrovich as he made his way out of the plane and onto the tarmac of Kadala Airport. Despite all his meticulous preparations, it seemed that the prince had still managed to underestimate the frigid conditions of the region. Pulling his fur coat more tightly, Nikita continued his descent towards the large group of men who had gathered to greet his arrival.\n\nChief of Staff Boris Shepunov was in front of the gathering, eager to receive the prince. "Prince Nikita, your Highness! Allow me to be the first to welcome you and your family back to Russia."\n\nNikita gave a courteous smile and extended his hand to Shepunov. "Greetings, general. It's good to be back..." The prince, now flanked by his wife and two sons, Nikita and Alexander, tilted sideways to look past Shepunov and into the crowd behind him. "I say, where is my nephew? I would've liked to speak with him."\n\n"I apologize, your Highness, but His Imperial Majesty was feeling a bit under the weather today, and I'm afraid he was unable to be here. I'm sure he would've been delighted to meet with his family otherwise. Come now, let's get you and your family out of the cold." Shepunov gestured for the royals to accompany him, and they obliged.\n\nDespite what the general had said, Prince Nikita found it rather odd that his nephew was not among those who had come to greet his arrival. The prince was greatly looking forward to a reunion, and he had figured Mikhail felt the same. Whatever kind of malaise the Emperor had come under, he thought, it must've been rather severe..."

 CHT_regional.13.desc: "Deep within the Kasumigaseki district of Tokyo, General Vladimir Abramov felt like a stranger in an even stranger land. Here he was, standing inside a nondescript office in the Japanese foreign ministry's headquarters, facing an official diplomatic delegation. Vladimir was hand-picked by Boris Shepunov personally to head the White delegation to Tokyo. Although the general would never dare to question his superior's orders, there was one small hang up that he had with the idea: Abramov was a military man, and had no diplomatic experience whatsoever.\n\nHe wondered why Shepunov didn't just get the Foreign Ministry to handle it instead, but it was too late to do anything about it now. The Japanese were before him, expecting Abramov to be the face of the new Russian diplomatic mission. He knew the future of Russo-Japanese relations may hinge on the success or failure of this meeting.\n\n"In short, His Imperial Majesty wishes to look past any historical transgressions and promote a great renewal in Russo-Japanese relations. Rest assured, we approach as friends and equals." Abramov's statement sounded painfully rehearsed, and he hoped that fact was lost on the Japanese.\n\nHis Japanese counterpart turned to speak to one of his subordinates in a language the Russian delegation did not understand. The diplomat then turned back to Abramov with an unconvincing smile on his face. "Equals, you say? What an interesting perspective, to say the least. Do not worry, General, Japan is indeed open to strengthening relations. I sincerely hope that today's meeting shall be the first of many. Perhaps we will also learn a thing or two about conducting diplomacy in the process, yes?""

 CHT_regional.14.desc: "Boris Shepunov watched on from his balcony as the troops of the White Army marched down Chita's main street. This was the first parade held since the reunification of the Far East, and Shepunov did not exactly hold high expectations for the display his soldiers were to put on. In the past, the White Army's troops were brigands in uniform, no better than the barbarous raiders he had seen several decades ago when he served under Ataman Semyonov.\n\nWhat he saw instead, was quite different. The troops marched in lockstep, their eyes focused upon their Tsar and their arms in salute. Their uniforms were impeccably well-maintained, and slung over their shoulders were the latest in small arms designs. Even an old White like Shepunov couldn't help but be impressed by the gallant figure the soldiers below had presented.\n\nAs the foot soldiers passed, and the famed Cossack riders came into view, Shepunov couldn't help but get emotional. After so many years, this was the army he had been trying to build. Not a ragtag collection of mounted raiders and militias, but a professional force ready to take on the world if it came to that.\n\n"Vladimir, I never thought I'd see the day when the White Army would resemble an actual military. This is simply incredible..." Shepunov's eyes were still on the riders as he spoke to General Abramov, who stood next to him.\n\nMikhail II, however, was the only man present who couldn't care less. What others saw as valiant warriors, he saw as the cold-blooded guards of his prison. The Tsar remained silent throughout the entire event, looking on in silent concern rather than admiration."

Ever since the Fascist government had been driven out of Zeya, she felt quite comfortable walking the streets again knowing that the thugs of the RFP no longer terrorized the city. That is not to say, however, that things were any less strange.\n\nAs she made her way home for the day, Sofiya noticed a small group of people gathered around the sidewalk in front of her. Their attention appeared to be focused on something attached to the side of a building. Whatever it was, it had caused quite a stir. As she drew closer, she could hear the people mumbling amongst themselves. Finally, she was able to see what exactly they were looking at.\n\nAttached to the wall was a large propaganda poster, clearly meant to advertise service in the White Army. Front and center was an idealized depiction of a fierce-looking soldier charging a two-headed dragon with his rifle in hand. The dragon was clearly an evil creature, with one head colored red and the other a deep black. Wrapped in the beast's tail was a pole bearing the tattered tricolor of Russia. Captioned in bold letters were the words "Join the White Army, and deliver holy Russia from the clutches of radicalism!" The symbolism was not lost on anyone.\n\nSofiya could not help feeling twinges of concern. While this poster was fairly benign, similarly militaristic designs would not look entirely out of place in the previous regime. Continuing her journey home, she could only hope that her relatively peaceful existence would continue even as the new regime tightened their grip."

We had to find someone in the building who spoke Russian to find out what he wanted."\n\n"Send him in." Although the ambassador was confused, his curiosity was piqued. It had been some time since the ambassador had brushed up on his Russian, but he was confident he knew enough to conduct diplomacy. After a few quiet moments, the mysterious emissary entered the ambassador's office.\n\n"Salutations! I represent His Imperial Majesty Mikhail II, Emperor of All Russia. I come to you today to request official diplomatic recognition from the United States as the true government of Russia."\n\nThe ambassador was completely overwhelmed by what he had just heard. "Hey, slow down there, pal. You said you represent an emperor?"\n\n"Indeed. On behalf of their divinely-chosen emperor, Mikhail II, the White Army has wrested Eastern Siberia away from the fascist and Bolshevik tyrants. Now that our position is secure, we wish to obtain recognition as the legitimate government we are." This answer only raised more questions. The ambassador was going to have to call someone about this, but first he'd have to get this strange Russian out of his office...\n\n"Well, I'm afraid there's not much I can do, seeing as my job is to handle relations with Japan, but I can make some calls to the State Department on your behalf.

We've given you quite enough already!"\n\n"I suggest you alter your tone, Ukhtomsky. My partners want to ensure that the Zaibatsu can conduct their business as they see fit within your borders. I trust this is not too much to ask, yes?"\n\n"We would be more than happy to accept their business, but you know the Zaibatsu would have us by the balls in no time if we give them the chance..."\n\n"Forgive me, Ukhtomsky, but I don't believe you are in a position to bargain. You either accept the benefits our business has to offer, or don't. For the record, I would argue that this conversation would not be necessary if we were dealing with your predecessors instead..."\n\nA pause. The man on the phone was right, and Ukhtomsky knew it. "Damn it, fine! You'll have your concessions. Just... no more surprises, alright?"\n\n"I knew you would see it our way. I will be in touch."

As usual, they only had bad news: more reports about the insurgents, who grew bolder day by day, more rumors about possible dissent from the civilian administration, and much else besides. It was all so tiresome.\n\nThe old general swiftly downed the glass, and as the vodka stung his throat, Shepunov wondered what the Ataman would've thought about everything. The old cossack always had a knack for keeping his cool, even when the situation was out of control. Now Semyonov was gone, and it was up to him to clean up the mess. The general cursed himself for believing that life would become easier after his army's accomplishments. He should've known by now that victories usually raised more questions than they answered.\n\nDeep down, Shepunov truly missed those old days in Chita, riding out with Semyonov and his cossacks on daring escapades across the Siberian tundra. There at least, he knew that his enemies would face him head on. Nowadays, they hid in plain sight. Peace had made Shepunov complacent, when what he really needed was to be more vigilant than ever.\n\nShepunov moved to refill his glass.

His two friends, however, did not seem to share the same fear.\n\n"Where's your Tsar now, Jew? You thought you could come through our part of town? We still run things around here, and no war is going to change that!" Grigor's friends, clad in distinctive, yet poorly-maintained RFP uniforms, towered over a man on the ground. They had dragged him off the street, and immediately began harassing him, just like in the old days.\n\n"I just collect the census!" the man cried. "I'm not even Jewish!" His pleas for clemency were met with a ferocious barrage of kicks.\n\nA shout rang out from behind Grigor, drawing the attention of all three of the fascists. A pair of White Army soldiers were approaching, weapons at the ready. The sight caused Grigor's stomach to turn. "Step away from him!" the lead one called, "and put your hands in the air! Now!"\n\n"Ah, the dogs of the Tsar are finally here!" barked one of Grigor's companions. "We were just having a nice chat with one of your people!" Grigor could feel death bearing down upon him as he turned towards his friends.\n\n"Hey, wait, we shouldn't-" His thoughts and speech were interrupted as one of his friends drew their weapon. Grigor didn't even have time to call out before the soldiers fired. As the bullets tore through him and he fell to the ground, his face landed next to that of the man his group had been terrorizing."

I cannot afford to have you starve now. There is much to do." Seeing the look the Tsar gave him, Mikhailov continued. "Do not worry yourself, my liege. Everything is in motion, all that remains now is to have faith in our success."\n\nMikhailov set his spoon down, and as he did so, both men noticed that it, along with all the other silverware, had begun to vibrate. From outside, a deep rumbling could be heard, and both Mikhail and Mikhailov rose in unison to investigate, their minds beginning to race.\n\nPulling aside the curtains, they were greeted with a sight that made their blood run cold. Trucks and armored carriers disgorged dozens of soldiers with the insignia of the city garrison, and they were moving to encircle the residence. And, at the front gate, Boris Shepunov himself stood by while an enraged subordinate screamed at the guard commander. The men backed away from the window and looked at each other.\n\n"That's it then, isn't it?" the Tsar said, his voice a near-whisper. "Shepunov's found us out.""

Here he was, acting as a contender for leader of all of Russia without so much as a cursory education in the language of the people he was to rule over. His advisors and he had agreed, it wasn't a good look.\n\nMikhail knew a few words and phrases, of course. He could say hello and goodbye, agree and disagree with statements, and even ask for the bathroom. He even understood Russian pretty well, being able to follow the radio programs and speeches the government played. Unfortunately, his ability to produce Russian was simply lacking.\n\nIn truth, a part of him had resisted taking the time to learn the language, though, he had found himself changing recently. He had seen his subjects for who they really were. Hard working, caring, and accepting people. People who would band together to rebuild a farm after a raid, and house refugees from the east even if they didn't have the food or money to do so. People who had accepted him.\n\nAnd Mikhail had also seen exactly who would rule these lands if he were to leave. Men who would have entire villages sacked if it meant rooting out even one perceived enemy, and they all seemed to have a lot of enemies. He began to feel a resolve, a responsibility to these generous folks who had hosted him here. He was staying here for them, and every day it seemed increasingly possible he might actually end up ruler of Russia. He needed to be ready for that day.\n\nSo there he sat, paper in hand and eye on the clock, his foot tapping as he pondered the people of Chita. Suddenly, he heard the door click and a man come in.

Did you make double sure?" Mikhail enquired nervously as he drummed his fingers on the table.\n\n"I'm positive. Let's just get this over with, I don't wish to stay here longer than I have to." Mikhailov opened his briefcase and laid several papers from within across the table, each inscribed with a list of names. Clearing his throat as he took a seat across from the Tsar, the Minister continued: "So. Let's get down to business. These are lists of important people we'll need to get into contact with. It's very important you commit these names to memory."\n\n"Who are these people, exactly?" the Tsar mused as he inspected one of the lists.\n\n"Potential allies. If we're going to get rid of Shepunov, we'll need friends. If we can convince some wealthy oligarchs and disgruntled military men to join our cause, we'll be well on the road to breaking the White Army's grip."\n\nMikhail set his paper aside. "Very well, I'll see if I can't negotiate with Shepunov to allow some... harmless private audiences. I suppose he doesn't need to know what goes on in them?"\n\nThe minister gave a devious grin.

He would have to choose his next words with discretion. "I'm afraid not, my friend. I wanted to discuss... business. I'm well aware that all of you are chafing under the weight of the monstrous budget sink that is the White Army and are looking for solutions, am I correct?"\n\nThere was a pause amongst the oligarchs before one of them cautiously spoke up. "Tell you the truth? I'm sick of it. You have no idea how much this kind of defense spending eats into a man's profits. Nothing we can do about it though, the White Army's word is law around these parts."\n\n"Our goals are aligned, then. His Majesty and I seek to curb the influence of the military and return the Empire to civilian rule. Of course, to make this happen, we'll need friends..."\n\n"I thought you'd never ask. Tell us what you need, and you'll have it. Just make sure we're taken care of once this is all over, alright?"

What did they even define as "trouble", anyway? Igor figured it was likely one of those "you'll know it when you see it" scenarios, if nothing else.\n\nResting his cheek against his fist, Igor began to notice something rather peculiar about the Tsar. Babysitting Mikhail was nothing new to him, but this time there was something different about his mannerisms. He seemed energetic and talkative, and Igor could swear this was the first time he ever saw the Tsar laugh with sincerity. It felt... wrong.\n\nThe Tsar was a prisoner, and anybody who was anyone in this rump Empire knew that fact all too well. Mikhail was always a miserable sod, so why did he seem to have pep in his step today, and why did it not feel right?\n\nThe captain was broken out of his racing thoughts as Mikhail approached him, a smile still slathered across his face. "Alright, Igor. Let's get out of here, shall we?"\n\n"Erm, yes, of course, Your Majesty." Rising to accompany the Tsar outside, he couldn't help but notice the energy he had seen in him a minute ago was quite prevalent in his tone of voice as well.

"...what are you saying, exactly?"\n\n"It's no secret that this empire chafes under the crushing influence of the White Army. That being said, not everyone in the military is corrupted. General, I believe that you are one of these men."\n\n"You want me to go against Shepunov? I hope you realize that would be tantamount to insubordination. I'm afraid I'll have to report this."

Shepunov said as he began to look through the documents within.\n\n"Logistical reports from our base near Irkutsk. It appears there's been some mix up at the arsenal, at least, that's the excuse they gave..."\n\nThe documents corroborated Kossov's statement. Thousands of rifles, complete with the ammunition, were inexplicably going missing from the depot on-base. He wanted to believe it was in fact a mix up, but his gut told him something else entirely. "This is a rather significant breach of security, Kossov. I want you to look into this, understand?"\n\n"I'll get someone on it at once. If we find out who's behind this, you'll be the first to know." With a salute, the general turned to leave, and left Shepunov to stew in his suspicions.

Some of you are businessmen who drove this empire's great industry forward even in times of hardship. Some of you are politicians who seek only to represent their constituents to the best of their abilities. A few of you are officers of the White Army, the very same force that once bravely defied the Soviet usurpers so long ago."\n\n"Despite these very stark contrasts between you all, you've all come here united behind a singular purpose: to take back our country from the selfish and corrupt generals who seek to transform this ancient and glorious empire into nothing more than a quasi-fascist stratocracy, with me as their helpless puppet."\n\n"I am speaking, of course, of Prime Minister Boris Shepunov. The man likes to think he has us all in his iron grip, but he will soon discover that he isn't nearly as clever as he thinks he is. Despite our differences, we will fight side-by-side to remove this aspiring tyrant from our midst and continue the journey towards reunification.

Apparently, some very curious individuals have been reported making repeat visits to the Tsar's dacha. I looked into it, and it turns out they're all friends of Ivan Mikhailov."\n\nThe general went silent. The Minister of Finance has long been a pain in his ass, but as of late he'd been eerily calm. Did this news have anything to do with that? What business did he or his Industrialist friends have with Tsar Mikhail anyway, and why didn't any of this feel right?\n\n"...sir? Are you there?"\n\n"Yes. I want you to look into the Mikhailov connection. Find out what he's up to, and figure out what's going on at those meetings. Don't screw this up, Kossov."\n\n"You can count on it, sir." With that, Shepunov put the phone back into place. Finally, he had a solid lead.

Did they even want him to see the sun again? The implications here were not lost on Mikhail. There was no Bolshevik infiltration, it was merely an excuse to further stow the Tsar away where he could do no harm to the White Army's ambitions.\n\nSetting the letter aside with a sigh, Mikhail felt several emotions running through his mind at once. A single tear rolled down his face, but the Tsar didn't even have enough energy left to spend crying.

The highest quality defenders, worthy of protecting a king, were now sacked by one simple and swift military order.\n\n"Where are my men?" Tsar Mikhail asked Shepunov, with his arms folded in the corner of a private hallway. "I don't recognize these thuggish street conscripts. These weren't the same men who would have taken a bullet for me the past few years!" Shepunov shrugged, and turned away from Mikhail.\n\n"I'm sure you can see the latent threat of Bolshevism in our Realm recently, Tsar. You've seen for yourself all the reports of Bolsheviks in our midst, waiting for their moment to strike back; strike at you. The Guard may have been a reliable ally to you in the past, but they are far too removed from the chain of command, and I fear they are ripe for infiltration by the enemy. You can rest assured that my men are just as capable of defending you as any of the Guard once did."\n\nMikhail sighed, unable to even see Shepunov eye-to-eye. It was impossible that he could have chosen any radicals. All of those men were willing to bleed and die for the Tsar, regardless of what ideology they held. They were good bodyguards, stalwart defenders, and most importantly, potential friends. People he could trust. But just like the backside of Shepunov, attempting to fight this further would be as if Mikhail would punch a brick wall.\n\n"If you insist, I'll keep these men close."\n\n"Not good enough, Tsar.

The iron bars were cold and slick from the buildup of dew, making his task all the more challenging. Mikhail was hardly in shape for this sort of activity, and felt himself straining as he pulled his body further up. After a few agonizing seconds, though, he was finally sat atop the fence. Mikhail took this moment to catch his breath and determine how he was to get down without breaking his legs, but his rapid thoughts were interrupted when a bright light shined on his position. "Oh, there you are! You had us worried sick, Your Majesty!"\n\n"Shit!" he muttered as one of his guards finally came into view, his flashlight still focused on Mikhail's location. Thinking fast, the Tsar leapt from the fence and into the shrubbery below. The landing was hardly pleasant, but adequately cushioned by the foliage. Lifting his head from the bushes, however, Mikhail was immediately met with three more soldiers.\n\nThe guard in front spoke first, and he did not sound amused. "You'd best come along with us, Your Majesty, it's not safe to be out here this late." Mikhail gave a defeated nod, and rose from the bushes to accompany his captors back to the dacha.

Civilian governments lead one step closer to Bolshevism and disaster, a tragedy that we do not need to remember again.\n\nEarly this morning, a steel magnate based in Chita who has voiced some incorrect opinions about the Army and Shepunov's administration was seized in his office and arrested as an enemy of the state. Close members of his inner circle of friends and contacts have informed us about his wonderful spiels of slander, dismissal, and cynicism toward our government. He would drink a bit too much and complain about infantrymen harassing him one day, then whisper to a confidant in private about his distrust of Shepunov and his large quotas of steel. The commotion was loud and disruptive, so much so that all work in the office stopped to gaze upon the White Army's commotion.\n\n"It has come to our attention that your boss is a Bolshevik ally and is thus a traitor to the state as well as the security of the Holy Tsar. Therefore, he is being arrested as we speak. Do not attempt to interrupt."\n\nAs the magnate was handcuffed and pushed out of his office, mildly bruised, the only thing people could do in the office and on the streets was either look him dead in the eye or avert the hawkish gazes of the White Army escorting him to prison."

While the air was incredibly tense, the garrison stood firm despite advancing toward the protestors.\n\nSuddenly, a Zhdanov was thrown. Then, the rifles rang out. Volkogonov ordered his men to stop, but at this point the streets were a full-on warzone. Protestors scrambled to flee amidst the firepower of the garrison, with soldiers beating protesters with the butts of their rifles and shooting at those who were fleeing. Cries of passion suddenly turned to terror, and the military soon regained control over the streets. All he could do was watch as his own men and junior officers ignored his orders and began to slaughter the rioters like so many defenseless cattle.

An IDOS agent under Shepunov's supervision dug deeper into the original agitation, and found no sign of Bolshevik activity present. What happened was a homegrown, non-leftist protest. Yet, this was of little concern. The more pressing matter was the fact a member of the government was deeply involved in this protest.\n\n"You're certain it was him? Without a doubt?" The agent nodded, and passed over some photos to Shepunov.\n\n"Yes, sir. I have come to a concrete conclusion that Ivan Mikhailov's associates were largely responsible for the power and size of the protest, at worst giving them lip service for their own support and at best supplying them with small arms and calling back the local police force." Shepunov wasn't surprised, but still hid an expression of horror. If his own appointees were working against him, would they support the Puppet Tsar over the White Army?\n\n"That'll be all. Thank you." Shepunov dismissed the agent, and sighed loudly after the door was closed. Even with near-unlimited power at his fingertips, Shepunov still struggled to consider a fool-proof solution to his new rat problem. Whatever the case, it was clear that the integrity of his government was at odds with the wishes of forces which may be loyal to the Tsar. There was work to be done, and not a drop of it would be surrendered to Mikhail's meandering."

 CHT_regional.36.desc: "When Boris Shepunov awoke to the shrill sounds of ringing, he was immediately surprised to find it was still nearly pitch black in his room. The cacophonous ringing was not coming from his alarm clock, but from the phone by his nightstand. Muttering incoherently as he rose from bed, the half-conscious Shepunov stumbled clumsily through the dark towards the phone, not even bothering to turn on the lights. "Who the fuck is this? Do you have any idea how late it is?!"\n\n"Apologies, sir. It's Kossov. I have information on the Mikhailov case you'll want to hear."\n\n"And you couldn't wait until morning to tell me?" Shepunov sighed. "Just... tell me what you've learned."\n\n"I just received a report from the IDOS, and it's rather conclusive. There's no doubt about it that Mikhailov and his allies have been behind all of the recent incidents lately. Worse still, we have reason to believe that he's in league with the Tsar for some kind of action against the government. I'll have the full report for you tomorrow."\n\nShepunov felt a shiver, and it wasn't from the cold. "Very well, Kossov. Keep up the good work." As he returned to bed, the old general found it rather hard to return to his slumber. He had just learned that the nucleus of his movement was now potentially plotting against him, and after all his hard work, it seemed that White Russia was already poised to tear itself apart. When the sun rose that morning, Shepunov had not managed to get any more rest; his greatest challenge yet was close at hand."

With the guns we've procured, we might even be able to arm some paramilitaries to pick up the slack."\n\nVolkogonov stared at the map he and the others stood around with narrow eyes, his arms crossed. "Apologies, Mikhailov, but I think you're forgetting something. Shepunov still outnumbers us by a significant margin. Even with my units in play, and those of anyone else I can convince to join us, we're not in a good position here."\n\n"I agree with the general, Mikhailov," Mikhail II began, "We can't just hope to occupy every city when Shepunov has such an advantage. I have the feeling we're inviting disaster..."\n\nMikhailov sighed as he stepped away from the map. "All due respect, gentlemen, but disaster is assured if we start getting pessimistic like this. Shepunov may have more troops, yes, but we have the element of surprise! If we strike hard and fast enough, that bald bastard won't even know what's happening until it is too late."\n\nVolkogonov shot a concerned glance in Mikhail's direction, and was met in kind. The Minister of Finance was nothing if not motivated, but the other two were beginning to wonder just how well he understood the realities of the situation. The plotters had gathered quite a following, but would be enough in the face of the White Army's overwhelming might?"

While the scourge of Bolshevik infiltrators seems to have subsided, it seems our peers in the civilian administration are unhappy with how we're running things and have decided to take matters into their own hands."\n\n"Those ungrateful bastards. We should just crush them all now and be done with it," Nikolay Kossov interjected, his voice rough and bitter.\n\nFrom across the table, Dmitry Volkogonov sighed wearily. "What, and turn our arms against civilians again? Don't you remember what happened last time, Kossov? We'll need to be smart about this."\n\n"General Volkogonov is right, we'll need to play things safe after that debacle in Irkutsk. Instead of slashing and burning the whole administration, a tight and orderly counter-coup is in order; we shall deploy our units to Chita and detain both Mikhailov and the rebellious Tsar when the opportunity presents itself."\n\n"And who do you suggest we replace him with?" Vladimir Abramov enquired, "We've come too far to abolish the monarchy now, it wouldn't be a good look."\n\n"I believe Prince Nikita will serve as an adequate replacement. He's proven himself committed to our cause, and can actually speak Russian for God's sake. If only he had shown up at Harbin instead of Mikhail...""

He still wasn't allowed to leave the dacha very often, but he took solace in the fact that, perhaps, it wouldn't stay that way for long.\n\nIndeed, his hairbrained scheme to take his rightful place as Tsar, hatched with the Minister of Finance, was finally coming to fruition. Even now, loyal White Army units under General Volkogonov were preparing for the moment when the die would be cast, and Mikhail would make his move against his captor.\n\nHowever, Mikhail had also grown no less nervous over the outcome of the coup. The general too had expressed doubts on the feasibility of the plot, especially under such a short window of time. What if Volkogonov was right? What if Mikhailov's plan was too bold to work, and Shepunov's clique was able to leverage their considerable numerical advantage to regain the initiative?\n\nWorse still, what would become of Mikhail should the plan fail? Would Shepunov take pity upon him and send him home, or did he have a more violent fate in mind? These questions and more weighed heavily on the captive Tsar's mind.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, he had simply spent too much time preparing and overthinking variables that were out of his control. Maybe it was time to kick back and breathe easy for a while? It had been some time since Mikhail had invited Ivan Mikhailov over for dinner. A quiet evening among friends might just be what his weary mind needed..."

I came to give you some rather... heavy news."\n\n"I see. Let's go to my study." Nikita's attitude had gone from warm, courteous glee to that of slight confusion. Shepunov's tone was rather dark, and was cause for some concern for the old prince. The two men headed for Nikita's personal lounge, a rather secluded and quiet spot of the dacha. The curtains were pulled closed, making the room's atmosphere rather bleak.\n\nTaking a seat, Shepunov folded his hands as he began to speak. "Nikita, I have reason to believe that your cousin is plotting to overthrow the government. We are already taking measures to prevent this, but I thought it would be best to bring this to your attention."\n\nNikita stopped dead in his tracks. "My cousin? Overthrow the government? That's insane, he's already the Tsar, what more could he want?"\n\n"It's unclear at this time, your Highness, but know that he cannot remain in his capacity as monarch while plotting treason against his own country. As the only Romanov present with a strong claim, you shall be the one to take his place." Nikita felt pressure building in his chest. This was certainly a lot of information to handle at once. He hadn't spoken much to Mikhail, but he never thought of him as the type to try something as assertive as this. Still, Nikita was not entirely above accepting the crown of his forefathers..."

Yesaul Urakov strode up towards his men, his dark eyes peeking out from under his fur cap. The company commander seemed to be in a jubilant mood, an unusual spring animating his rapid steps.\n\n"Boys, you're probably wondering why I dragged your asses out in the cold so early in the morning." There was some grumbling and cursing amongst the Cossacks, silenced quickly by the Yesaul's words. "Well, shut the fuck up and you'll find out! That's better." A metallic squealing and scraping brough the eyes of all those gathered to the train tracks that the Cossack camp was established to protect. A train had pulled up outside the camp, a row of flatbed cars stretching behind it. Heavy tarps hid the hulking shapes that squatted atop the beds.\n\n"About time!" shouted Urakov. "Come on, lads, let's unwrap your gifts from the Tsar!" The Cossacks hurried out to the train, and after some tugging and unclasping of buckles, all wore astonished grins.

Only a few years ago and he would be setting out into the wilderness to hunt or forage, but now, there was hardly anything left of the forest he once knew so well.\n\nThe old hunter turned his eyes down, gazing at the vast industrial park which had replaced the wilderness. He'd played a part in that, trading his soul for money, helping destroy the forest which had provided his family for generations. Oh the IDC had paid him handsomely for his services, the money helped him keep his home, allowed him to provide his children the education to ensure that they'd do well in the new Siberia.\n\nHis children were somewhere down there, working in the vast expanse of steel and concrete. Siberia may have been tamed, the wilderness replaced with civilization, but civilization was no place for men like him. His children would never be able to live the life he had, probably for the better, but where others saw progress all he saw was the cost to the wildlife, the forests, and the rivers.\n\nHis glass was empty now, alcohol dulling his mind, filled as it was with regrets and increasingly distant memories. Stumbling onto his feet, the old hunter went back inside. One last untamed beast in a civilized land."

After a short time spent in a Tsarist prison camp, wondering as to his ultimate fate, he had suddenly been issued simple tools and sent to an iron mine near Chita. Long hours spent underground had driven him almost to the point of insanity, and nearly destroyed him physically besides.\n\nJust as suddenly, however, he had been ordered into a truck, and within short order had found himself in a munitions factory. Assembling and polishing artillery shells was hard work, but it was nothing compared to mining. Even if there were many more guards watching him now.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't blame them. Placing former enemies in proximity to high explosives would have given him pause as well. But they had nothing to worry about, at least not from those smart enough to properly understand their situation.\n\nEven if escape or sabotage was possible, there was nowhere to go, and Matkovsky was gone. As stressful as work in the factory was, it was a far sight better than that of the mine. The food and barracks were better as well. So Andrei would work, and work hard. One day, he knew, the Tsarists would have to let him go.\n\nUntil then, however, he would work. Finishing his stretch, he returned his attention to the production line. He had hundreds more shells to finish before the day's end."

 CHT_regional.44.desc: ""- and this here is the Ki-209, a fighter bomber with a capacity of over 10,000..." Shepunov slowly tuned out the droning of their Japanese guide. Harbin Airbase had long been a hub of aviation, but right now, Shepunov had neither the patience nor the technical knowledge to follow along. He'd get the summary from his staff once they were back in Chita anyways.\n\nTaking in the view of the Songhua River Shepunov took the opportunity to admire the land in which he had spent so many years. Harbin held many memories, few pleasant, but even he could still appreciate the land's natural beauty, what little of it not consumed under the smog from the city's industries.\n\nTurning his attention back to the tour, Shepunov's eye was caught by a peculiar aircraft, it's backward-facing propellor and rear-mounted wings unlike anything else at the airbase. "Excuse me Colonel, but what aircraft is that?" Shepunov asked, interrupting the officer, his eyes still firmly locked on the offending plane.\n\nRecovering, the guide caught Shepunov's gaze and followed it to the culprit. "That is a J7W3 Shinden, an old interceptor built in the last days of the Second World War. I've been told it handles well, but it's over a decade out of date, Sir," replied the liaison, annoyed at the interruption.\n\nThe general barely heard him and was already dragging his entire entourage over to examine the aircraft in person."

How, then, did the IDOS know exactly where to find them? The door flew off the hinges as the Tsarist death squad stormed inside, the Sablinites scrambling for their weapons. Vasily, Katya, and Boris died in the first few seconds: soft lungs, hearts, and hard heads blooming like dripping roses in answer to the Tsar's bullets. An errant round tore through the portrait of Sablin that stood at the end of the table, the shattering of glass unheard in the rattle of gunfire. The Leninists fought back, firing wildly with pistols and cheap SMGs, crouching behind overturned tables. Others attempted to flee, the last thing they saw before running into the snow were the hollow and betrayed faces of their comrades, who loved them above all others.\n\nThe operation was a tremendous success. Every communist bandit was accounted for, either dead or in the tender clutches of the IDOS. Blood dripped down onto the fallen portrait. If anyone had bothered to look, they might have thought Sablin was weeping blood."

He would have said more, but he was interrupted by the sight of a huge transport ship headed their way.\n\n"Get into position everybody, we've got a ship coming up!", Maxim shouted as his vessel started speeding towards the ship, his blood suddenly pumping. His crew readied their guns on the edge of the ship when a thought tugged at the back of Maxim's head. Ships did not usually sail towards the pirates.\n\nBefore he could warn the crew to turn around, however, several bursts of heavy machine gun fire ripped through his ship and crew. An explosion of pink mist and wooden splinter saw Maxim dive into the water below.

He was no fool, he knew full well who had the upper hand from the start in these negotiations, and he knew they did too. Imperial diplomats always complained that the Japanese were difficult to negotiate with at the best of times.\n\nThey had not, however, ever negotiated with Nikolay Kossov. "Konnichiwa." He greeted them in nearly perfect Japanese before they could begin speaking, catching them by surprise. "Sa, hajimemashou ka." He continued masterfully, saying it was time for them to get started. Now the Japanese delegates whispered among themselves, looking at him and listening in awe of his almost flawless command of Japanese as he continued to lay out the requested terms of the economic agreement.\n\nFascinated by his knowledge of their language, he found them much more agreeable than past negotiators had, and while the deal still favored the Japanese, the terms were fairer than they had been in the past. It was times like these that Kossov found himself glad he had kept practicing his Japanese even after achieving a good level of fluency in the late 30s.

 CHT_regional.52.desc: "Mikhail was expected to attend a state meeting with some foreign diplomats later today, and he had yet to pick out an outfit. Unfortunately, it seems everyone else in Chita had noticed this fact as well, and ever since the Tsar had woken up they had been hounding him with questions as to what his wardrobe would be. Even some of the generals had been participating in the discussions and debates, much to the Tsar's worry. Was his outfit really such a big deal? The stress of the decision had left the Tsar paralyzed within his bedchamber, a variety of outfits lied out upon his bed.\n\nSome of the generals had argued that a simple, quality suit would show modernity and was more appropriate for the meeting. Others had argued that the Tsar's outfit must display his proper glory, and that a simple suit would make him appear mundane and bland. Mikhail had thought this a fairly accurate portrayal of the Tsar, but they chose to ignore his thoughts on the matter. Maybe Mikhail's wife would know what outfit would work best, but she was still a world away from him. Luckily for Mikhail, his paralysis was resolved by an exasperated Shepunov, who barged into his bedchamber, chose a fairly elaborate outfit, and threw the rest haphazardly into Mikhail's closet. He reminded Mikhail that he only had a few hours left to prepare, and slammed the door shut before he could respond.\n\nMikhail couldn't even pick out his own outfit, and yet he was supposed to rule all of Russia."

He had no clue as to who the primary players in the scandal were and was certain that his isolation in Chita meant that the happenings in France would have no impact on him whatsoever.\n\nThe front page, of course, was not why the aide had given him the paper. Several sheets deep, Mikhail had found what he was looking for. A footnote, really, unworthy of its own article, simply an obituary entry.\n\n"Feodor Alexandrovich. Born: 22 December, 1898. Died: 30 November 1968." There was more, of course, a short paragraph dedicated to the greatness of his life and those he left behind. So, that was why the paper had been delivered. Uncle Feodor was dead.\n\nMikhail stared at the entry, feeling a distant ache that was as forced and invented as it was real. He tried again, saying to himself again and again, "Uncle Feodor is dead".\n\nGod, he had to admit to himself, he didn't really care. It was this realization that hurt him more than the actual death. Was he so distant, so removed from the rest of his family that the death meant so little to him? It wasn't as if they had been close, true, but shouldn't he care more about a death in the family? Mikhail pondered this, wondering if when his own death came, it would be greeted with the same enthusiasm he had mustered.

Activities such as the banquet that had been announced by two scions of those very bloodlines.\n\nAttended by the rapidly-expanding upper crust of Chita society, it had been announced as a refined engagement in support and praise of the Tsar and his efforts to expand the Imperial lands. As so many such events in the old Empire had been, however, it quickly deteriorated as the wine and liquor began to flow freely.\n\nThe first activities the scions organized were fairly tame. Cards and other games of chance accompanied by heavy gambling, of course. As the level of inebriation increased, and as the wagers grew, the competitions grew more intense, with outcomes that would not be subsequently spoken of in polite company.\n\nBy night's end, several small fortunes had been won and lost, reputations had been built and tarnished, and, as all the 'esteemed' guests and the scions themselves could agree the next morning, a great time was had by all.\n\nAt long last, proper 'society' had returned to Chita."

Sergey heard the apartment door open behind him, and turned to see a familiar woman with a bag of groceries in hand. Her eyes were wide, and confused.\n\n"Why are you attacking my radio, Sergey? Did it hurt your feelings?"\n\n"No, Sofiya, the damn thing won't work..." Sergey interrupted himself with more hard hits to the side of the device. On the last, the radio finally began to speak. Sergey recognized the voice instantly as General Dimitry Volkogonov, whom he had served under in a past campaign.\n\n"...great honor to announce that martial law will soon come to an end. I have been working with several capable ministers in the interest of establishing a civilian government, and I am quite happy to say that this goal is finally becoming reality. Dear citizens of the Empire, it is my promise that the White Army will, from this point onward, only work to protect the people rather than to enforce their subservience." As Sergey listened, Sofiya came to sit by him. This news was not what they had expected to hear.\n\n"Anatoly Sobchak, who distinguished himself as the mayor of Chita, shall become our new Prime Minister.

As Shepunov, his new 'regent,' came into view between the bars the former Tsar rose to meet him, refusing to be looked down upon. Shepunov nodded slightly in understanding, though his expression was grim.\n\nFor a long moment, Shepunov simply stared at him. "You really thought that would work," he said softly, now beyond the need to perform, "didn't you?"\n\nMikhail returned the stare. "I had to do something, Boris. I couldn't just stand by any longer." He looked up towards the small barred window, set high in the wall. "Enjoy it while it lasts, because it won't. You've doomed Russia, you know."\n\nShepunov's mouth twitched in response as he shook his head. "That's where you're wrong. I've simply doomed you, Mikhail. Semyonov should have left you in Australia. Ruling was not something you ever had the capacity for. Not a garden there, not a city here, and most certainly not all of Russia." Shepunov raised a finger. "Russia needs decisive leaders, and the one time you tried to be one you couldn't even take down an old man like me." Unsure of how to respond, and hating himself for hearing at least some truth in Shepunov's words, Mikhail sat back on his cot in silence.\n\nAfter a long moment he spoke, his voice cold but firm. "Congratulations on your victory then, Regent. Now leave me be."\n\nShepunov bowed slightly. "As you wish, Mr. Andreevich." Without another word, he turned and left, his footsteps fading as a heavy door slammed shut.\n\nLeft behind, Mikhail sat in the dark, longing for the past.

The soldiers' blank expressions didn't change as the one in front, a brown haired man with sergeant's stripes stopped in front of him and began to speak.\n\n"Pack it up. New curfew, 8:00." The two recruits behind him awkwardly shuffled their feet.\n\n"But I haven't even broken even tonight, sir!" Sergei protested, forgetting for a moment that the men he spoke to were the law, at least for the foreseeable future. "I don't remember a curfew being announced, either."\n\nOne of the other soldiers stepped forward aggressively, knocking a cabbage off the cart. "He said pack it up." The sergeant shot his subordinate a glare before picking up the damaged cabbage, replacing it on the cart, and placing a few rubles on the rough wood in compensation.\n\n"My apologies," he began, "but please, go inside."\n\nRealizing he had gotten off easy, Sergei nodded and began packing his cart up as the soldiers Sighing, Sergei began packing it in for the night as the soldiers continued down the street.

No matter what he did, it wouldn't wash off.\n\nA knock came at the door, breaking Volkogonov's fixation on the washbasin. Straightening his uniform and doing what he could with his hair, he moved to open the door. Unfortunately, rather than the friend he hoped for, Dmitri found himself faced with the living reminder of his crimes - Boris Shepunov, the man himself.\n\nWith a grin, the Regent promptly invited himself into Dmitri's home. "You know," he began, looking around, "in all the years I've known you, I don't think I've ever been to your home. A day of firsts."\n\nVolkogonov struggled to maintain his composure. "...good to see you too, Regent. What brings you to my home?"\n\n"Oh, I was just in the neighborhood," Shepunov lied, "and thought I'd thank you. You've been a great help to me, Dmitri. In important times. And I won't forget it." Shepunov clapped him on the shoulder. "I see great things in your future, my friend. Very great things."\n\n"Thank you, sir."

He'd fled to the countryside for safety after the failure of the Loyalist effort to unseat Shepunov and his clique, and had remained in the basement ever since. Without seeing the sky, it had been impossible to tell time using any method other than hunger.\n\nThe boots were getting closer. Crunching snow turned to creaking wood as they entered the cottage. His heart pounded faster.\n\nA moment later, the boots began thundering down the stairs, and Pavel knew it was over. The flimsy door shattered as it was kicked open, flashlights illuminated the room, and before he could even raise his hands in surrender they were on him. A kick to the belly stole his breath. A bag over his head stole his vision. Strong hands on his arms stole his freedom.\n\nDragged up the stairs and out of the cottage, Pavel felt fleeting joy at the feeling of sunlight on his skin, but knew as he was loaded into a truck that he would not see it again for a very long time.

But the handcuffs he wore prevented him from protecting himself.\n\nThe officer leading the group forward paused when they reached the steps leading into the aircraft, and turned to face him. "Mr. Andreevich," the officer began as he withdrew a small key and released the handcuffs, "I have been instructed to inform you that, under your agreement of exile, you are never to again set foot in Russia. Do you understand?"\n\nMikhail massaged his wrists as he took in the words and looked around at the land that he had resided in for so long. "I do. Though I wish things had not ended this way." The officer did not reply as Mikhail gave one last sigh and climbed the steps.\n\nSitting down beside a window, the former Tsar watched without interruption as the plane took off and the land he had ruled, at least in name, disappeared beneath the clouds. Only then did thoughts return to him. He knew he should feel relieved. After all, he was returning to the place he had always known was his true home. But instead he felt only despair.\n\nHad he truly done enough? What would become of the lands he had left? He had tried to make Russia a better place, doing what he could to encourage reform and bring peace to the troubled land. But, in the end, he was leaving it in the hands of Shepunov, a man who knew only war.

The expansion of the Zaibatsu has not gone unnoticed by our economists, and it is argued that if nothing is done to curb their influence, they will soon have total control over our economy.\n\nThis could obviously have disastrous consequences, and Shepunov is considering sending a diplomatic delegation to Tokyo to renegotiate the terms of our economic arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the White Army's command staff argue that our relationship with Japan is too important to risk.

The circumstances of Mikhail's removal still troubled him, but the old prince was not going to let such lingering worries stand in the way of this moment.\n\nSlowly, carefully, Nikita reached out to take the crown from the bishop's hands, and gently placed it upon his head. It was not the same used by the Tsars of old, but that mattered little. The metals and jewels could change, but the God-given authority they represented was eternal. From this moment onward, he was an emperor.\n\nThe bishop continued with the ceremony. "Most God fearing, absolute, and mighty Lord, Tsar of all the Russias, this visible and tangible adornment of thy head is an eloquent symbol that thou, as the head of the whole Russian people, art invisibly crowned by the King of kings, Christ, with a most ample blessing, seeing that He bestows upon thee entire authority over His people."\n\nThe bishop handed Nikita his scepter and orb and as he received them, moving towards the throne for the next part of the ceremony, he couldn't help but see Shepunov watching him from the front row of the cathedral, eyes narrowed and unblinking. Nikita suppressed a shudder. Would the military treat him the same way as it had his nephew? What would happen if Shepunov tired of him?\n\nHe had no answer, and sweeping those thoughts aside, he took solace in that, for now at least, he was the new face of the Russian monarchist movement.

You see, my life has become rather complicated as of late, and to lay the story out in its entirety would be a daunting task indeed. I write to you now not only because of the time that has passed, but also because you have likely seen the news by now and are confused beyond belief. If not, I will still try my best to explain the situation.\n\nAs I'm sure you are aware, I decided to stay in Australia after my service with the Fleet Air Arm. My life in the so-called land down under was relatively carefree, and I look back on those days with fondness. Sadly, it was not to last. Several years ago, I received an invitation by influential Russian émigrés in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of our family. One thing led to another, and I found myself being crowned as the Tsar of All Russia in the frozen wastes of Siberia.\n\nDespite their generous show of goodwill, these old whites merely wanted to use me as a puppet to fulfill their dreams of domination over Russia and her people. I was kept as a prisoner in my own home, the days spent there becoming some of the darkest in my entire life. Despite the hopelessness of my situation, I had come to the conclusion that my arrival in Russia was a sign.\n\nNo matter the circumstance of my birth, a Romanov should never shy away in cowardice when his divinely-ordained realm needs him most. With the help of some like minded allies, I seized power from those corrupt White generals and became the Tsar I was always destined to be.

It is ironic that a strongman like yourself, after having forced this role on to me, has, in a twist of fate, been imprisoned by that very same man that was forced to become their leader. It is a Shakespearean comedy isn't it? Or perhaps a tragedy, from where you are."\n\nBoris Shepunov smiled at the Tsar, but the creases on his face revealed that it was not a smile born from genuine pleasure. "That is true, Mikhail. It is comedic in its outcome - and it can still be, if you rule the way I think you will." Boris laughed a little at that, but not for long. A short silence replaced the bitter laugh.\n\n"So," began Boris, his smile gone, "are you here just to gloat? To bask in your glory, oh great and wonderful Tsar?"\n\n"Actually," said Mikhail, his face still upturned in the shape of a faint smile, "I am here to tell you that you are being released to the Manchurian city of Harbin. From there you will be able to live a hopefully more fulfilling life than the one you lead now. But you will never return to Russia, for as long as I live."\n\n"I guess," said Boris, "I should be glad you didn't execute me, and, yet, I'm not."\n\nMikhail didn't respond, and, instead of retorting, walked away."

"What do you think, Mr. Sobchak?"\n\n"With all due respect," began Sobchak, pushing the documents across the table to Volkogonov, "while I do believe that the plan will work as intended, I don't find myself agreeing with the objectives."\n\nMikhail raised an eyebrow, looking at Volkogonov for a moment before turning back to Sobchak. "Go on, I wish to hear of your reasons."\n\n"Your Excellency, I disagree with this because making an army loyal to our country as well as the Tsar is what allowed for such people as Shepunov, believing themselves above their station in the name of 'protecting the people.' While I do believe that some excesses should be curbed, by in large, the army should be loyal to the Tsar and his will."\n\n"That is just nonsense," responded Volkogonov, his voice rising, "the reason people like Shepunov had such influence is because they had His Excellency as a figurehead, using him as another term for 'the nation' rather than their own personal interests. By combining them as one in the same, we can avoid that from ever happening again."\n\nSobchak laughed. "Irrational, such nonsense!"\n\n"Explain away, Mr. Sobchak, I would love to hear!"\n\n"Stop!" screamed Mikhail, slamming his hands on the table. "I will not hear of this. Sobchak, while I do find your reasons compelling, I find my own experiences have outweighed such positions. I will stand by Volkogonov 100 percent, and I expect you to go through with that plan.

But, he assured her with a wide smile, the new owners intended to provide the exact same types of products, while making the state stronger at the same time. Only now, those products would be made in Siberia, rather than in the factories of Japan.\n\nGalina managed a weak smile, thanked the man, and left. She knew the old store would not be coming back.

His ministers, soldiers, airmen, and other civil servants had, in his name, secured control over almost all of Russia proper. They had defeated fascists, communists, bandits, and more. And they had returned security to millions upon millions of ordinary Russians.\n\nIt was, therefore, only natural that he formally announced his claim to the long-vacant Imperial throne, and thus his government's claim as the successor to, and reincarnation of, the Russian Empire. To many within the lands his state controlled this would seem an almost academic statement. Mikhail had been called Tsar for many years, even before he had secured power over the White officer cliques.\n\nBut politically, and more importantly internationally, it was anything but.

Long hours at the forge filled one's lungs up with gases that would whittle away one's ability to breathe, and accidents were dangerously common. Viktor, of course, knew these things well. You can't work ten years at the steelworks without knowing them.\n\nIt was he'd told his boss when he'd been sat down in the head office today. Viktor had stayed with the forges making steel even as the war in the East had raged on and demanded more and more soldiers. It was where he had worked even as the Tsar's men took Novosibirsk. It had all gotten him a grand total of nothing. His boss told him that they were shipping the forge machinery east, and that he'd have to find a new job.\n\nAnd now?

He hadn't the time to understand any of it.\n\nMemories flashed by quicker than he could understand. Imperial soldiers soldiers at the entrance of his town. Agitated. Yelling. Posters in hand. Another flash. Refugees entering the town.\n\nVsevolod furrowed his brow in confusion.\n\nNot refugees, soldiers. Soldiers fleeing the Imperial Army. The war had been over. They were rebels. Elders didn't want them. Arguments.\n\nA cold permeates his body as he works through the memories. He feels fear. Why?\n\nAnother flash. Imperial soldiers again. Threats. They leave. The scream of bombers overhead.\n\nA tear falls down Vsevolod's cheek. Was he in pain? He reaches for his arm. Nothing there. His vision fades, not enough energy to fear. Not enough energy to think. Silence."

 CHT_superregional.25.t: "Back to Work"
 CHT_superregional.25.desc: "When he was informed that he would be returning to his factory, Fyodor had been extremely happy. That feeling remained, but had been significantly tempered.\n\nOne of the many refugees in Novosibirsk, Fyodor had spent months looking for work, so focused he was unaware of the dark clouds on the horizon. When war with the Tsarist regime broke out, he had actually been pleased. War meant more production, and more production meant more work.\n\nHe became much less happy when the Tsarist troops turned his factory, and many others like it in the industrial zone, into a warzone. Unemployed once again after the fall of the government to the Tsarists, he had scraped by as best as he was able. Until today, when he was informed that his skills were needed again, in the same factory. They would even provide transport.\n\nHe had not realized what it meant when that transport was a military truck. Stepping off at its destination, he recognized his factory, the walls and roof hastily repaired and with larger trucks rapidly disgorging equipment and machine tools. He also recognized the formation of Tsarist soldiers, assembled near the entrance and receiving orders from an officer.\n\nSoon the information was given to him and the other workers as well. They would be working, yes, but they would also be supervised. Closely. Sabotage had been reported elsewhere, and with the industrial power Central Siberia required for the advancement of the state, it would not be tolerated. Here or elsewhere.\n\nThat was fine with Fyodor. He just wanted to work. Whether it was for Novosibirsk's former regime or for the Tsarists made no difference. So he nodded, picked up his tools, and followed the others inside to his assigned station."

 CHT_superregional.26.t: "Spitting Image"
 CHT_superregional.26.desc: "Mikhail II, Emperor of All Russia, said nothing as he beheld the statue of his likeness. It was grand for sure, done in the style of the old imperial monuments, his figure placed astride a great warhorse. He guessed it mattered little that he hadnt rode a horse since the days of his youth at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. There had been plenty of horses in Sydney though, throthing at the mouth as they dashed around the Royal Randwick Racecourse to the elation or dismay of the punters. He missed those days.\n\n"Your majesty," the chief sculptor said, a look of worry etched on his face. "Is the statue not to your satisfaction?"\n\n"No," the Emperor lied, not wishing to force the men to redo the work. "It is a fine piece of craftsmanship."\n\nWhat really bothered him was the face. They had obviously taken some artistic liberties with that part. His receding hairline was nowhere to be found on the sculpture, and his eyebrows, characteristically bushy, were on the horseman's face neat and straight. Worse yet they had given him an immense and imposing moustache, in the style of the old pre-October royalty. It was a flattering image, but in some way it made him feel false, as if he was only playing at being Emperor, and this magnificent figure on the horse was the real deal.\n\nHe realised then that it looked not like him but his grandfather, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich. It had been years since he had remembered the old man. At the age of thirteen he had been brought to France to see him one last time, on his deathbed, emaciated and ravaged by cancer. The skeletal Grand Duke had clutched his hands, and made him promise there and then that he would never forget his duties to family and to Russia. At the time this experience had merely given him a fright, but now, thinking back, he considered his grandfather's words.\n\nThe Tsar turned towards the chief sculptor once more, his mind made up."

 CHT_superregional.27.t: "The Protégé"
 CHT_superregional.27.desc: "A lone man walked up to Boris Shepunov in a hall of the Imperial Palace, catching his attention with a crisp salute. When he realized who it was, a grin spread wide across Shepunov's faces as his eyes lit up with excitement. "Ah! Vissarion! Vissarion Mustafin! Glad to see you're finally here."\n\nLetting his hand fall to his side, Vissarion nodded, his expression serious. "Yes, well. It has been a long time since we've talked just the two of us, hasn't it?"\n\n"Too long! Too long." Shepunov patted Vissarion on the back, as they began walking down the hall side by side"You've grown much ever since I took you under my wing all those years back in Harbin. I always knew you would make for a talented general."\n\nFrowning, Vissarion turned to look at his mentor. "Thank you, but there must be some other reason you called me here today."\n\nThough he was quiet for a moment, Shepunov finally, almost reluctantly, spoke. "...There is. Vissarion, to be frank, if there were anything you could change about my government, what would it be?"\n\nHearing that made it difficult for Vissarion to disguise his shock. Was the old man having second thoughts? "If I could change anything, is it?" He began, deep in thought. "I suppose I'd lighten the presence of the military on the streets and loosen restrictions on dissent. Not to the extent that Mikhailov tried to, mind, but somewhat."\n\n"I see." Shepunov replied, seeming to consider something about his protégé. "Thank you for your advice, Vissarion. I'll have to think about it."\n\nAs Shepunov continued on without him, Vissarion let out a small sigh of relief. That was a no, but it wasn't a no, never."

 CHT_superregional.28.t: "The Loyalist"
 CHT_superregional.28.desc: "As soon as the knock came at the door to his office, Boris Shepunov knew who it was. "Come in, Kossov." He ordered, and the door promptly opened with a creak. Entering in full military uniform was Nikolay Kossov, a longtime subordinate and ally of Shepunov.\n\n"Sir." Kossov began, giving a quick salute. "I'm back from my latest meeting with the Japanese. You will be pleased to hear that the talks went well."\n\nKossov could be quite convincing when he wanted to be, after all, and Shepunov knew that from personal experience. "Yes, I am gladdened to hear that. A question for you, though, Kossov." When he had Kossov's full attention, Shepunov continued. "Do you really believe it wise to remain so closely tied to the Japanese?"\n\n"Without a doubt. If anything, we should be more closely tied." Kossov answered without hesitation. "They were our greatest allies during the civil war, during our days in Harbin, and even now. Returning the favor will only be in Russia's interest."\n\nNodding to himself, Shepunov dismissed Kossov with a wave of his hand. "I see. I'll consider your advice carefully. For now, return to your post.""

 CHT_superregional.31.desc: "Grinding his teeth together, Artyom slammed his fist against the steering wheel of his truck in frustration. He'd been stuck in traffic behind another damn truck for half an hour. He'd made all of his deliveries, now he just wanted to go home! That settled it, he was going to give whoever was driving that thing a piece of his mind.\n\nHowever, the moment Artyom leaned his head out of his window to do so, he saw exactly why the truck ahead of him was moving so slowly, and also why giving the driver a piece of his mind wouldn't be the brightest idea he'd ever had. On the side of the truck, the insignia of the White Army was marked, and down the entire street and even further, an entire convoy of similar trucks slowly rolled along. A supply convoy, or possibly soldiers being taken to a new location. Either way, there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nFlopping back into his seat, Artyom slouched a little in resignation. He had served himself, done a decent enough job of it, and gotten discharged, and now he just wanted an ordinary life. How much more time was the army going to take from him?"
