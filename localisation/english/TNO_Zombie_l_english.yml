 POLITICS_ZOMBIE_JOSEPH_GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "From the dusty crypt emerges a hand, rotting and thin. In younger days, it would have appeared perhaps dignified - now it had the stench of rats. A hoarse croak emerges, nothing like the booming voice it once was. But for Germanian wind and the distant grumble of the horde from the north, the night is silent. Goebbels, the Minister of War, had awakened from a fitful slumber.\n\nIt seems, in fact, that while vocal chords crumble away, oratory skills do not. As the day dawns, Goebbels limps to the horde in the north, muttering German under his breath. He saw the crumbling city, and weeped. He saw the Reich in shambles, and he felt as if he could not breathe. And yet he marches forward, pitifully, to the horde. A podium of bodies is made. Taking the stage, the corpse of Goebbels begins to speak.\n\nAnd speak he does. Of the glory of the undead and Germania. Of the power of war. Of prophecies and fulfillment. Of a new kind of war, in which every man is a combatant. All undead unified in one goal - not to make guns or harvest wheat, but to kill and eat.\n\nThere was a part of Goebells, the part that was still alive, that looked upon what had become and smiled. For once, perhaps, true total war was upon Earth."

#|===========================|#
 ZOM_Zombies:0 "Shambling Horde"
 ZOM_Zombies_desc:0 "Across the world, the dead walk, renewed. No army is prepared for the fight. Yes, men have fought insurgencies and massive forces. They have fought on the sea and in the air. But never has man faced a creature so unlike his own and yet so equal in image. Never had man fought a terrifying mirror-image, one that numbered greater then any military. Never had a shot to the leg or jaw barely phased a man. Never could a man run at speeds and with such endurance that you could hardly keep your eye fixed on them. Never could campaigns of terror not cause a moment of hesitation or a lack of supplies precipitate a retreat. To kill tens, hundreds of millions? It is more likely to face extinction then win the impossible fight."

 ZOM_Zombies_hidden:0 "Shambling Horde"
 ZOM_Zombies_hidden_desc:0 ""

 ZOM_Rodomo_Virus:0 "Rodomo Virus"
 ZOM_Rodomo_Virus_desc:0 "Born of the hubris of Burgundy, the Rodomo virus spreads through the air and infects in a matter of days. The only known course of action is to quarantine and hope for the best.\n\nAnd, of course, burn the bodies. The undead are not something to be toyed with."
 
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_1:0 "Early Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_1_desc:0 "Little more than machines designed to spew ignited gas, these primitive weapons will kill the undead, but with significant risk to the wielder."
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_2:0 "Basic Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_2_desc:0 "Standardized and measured to an acceptable precision, these weapons hold more accuracy and far more range then their predecessors. While still in the early stages of mass production, with enough of these we may yet slow the horde."
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_3:0 "Improved Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_3_desc:0 "Factories across the world have begun to produce one thing - flamethrowers. It is clear that only fire may cleanse the horde, and new innovations in design have proved extremely effective."
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_4:0 "Advanced Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_4_desc:0 "Across the world, hordes let out ghastly screams. Flames whip through city alleys and soaring mountains. Yes, expensive and impractical. Sure, perhaps difficult to shoot. But the unparalleled sheer heat of these weapons, the ability to incinerate dozens in a few minutes, cannot be found in any other weapon."
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_5:0 "Semi-Modern Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_5_desc:0 "It looks like something out of the pulps. Sleek and round. A nozzle and barrel that shines. A thin canister of gas. Perhaps flames, that great destroyer, is our savior."
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_6:0 "Modern Flamethrowers"
 Anti_Zombie_Weaponry_6_desc:0 "Hark, undead! Sleep yet again. Rest your weary head. For your fate is here, and it is flames. Return to whence you came, the graveyards of this broken world. I will be your shepherd, and you, my sheep."

    spook_news.1.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Whispers From the Black Sun"
    spook_news.1.d:0 "For years, the fog of the SS' eternal war has obscured the dark deeds occurring within the uncommunicative Burgundian realm. Over the last couple months, however, even the hushed stories that escape the Ordensstaat have quietened, leaving an uneasy void of knowledge for world leaders. All that global leaders could ascertain came from hushed intelligence reports of secret shipments of containment units and protective gear through Brittany.\n\nBut fresh news has pierced this secrecy, as the French State has now officially blamed an outbreak of rabies in Paris on the SS, leading the once covert discovery to become a storm in international headlines, as more governments look critically at recent viral outbreaks in their urban areas. The world's eyes now turn to Europe's Dark Corner, fearing a new pestilence unleashed by those carrying the emblems of death."
    
    spook_news.1.a:0 "The Silver Skull grins."
    spook_news.1.a.tt:0 "§RFully enable the undead event.§!"
    spook_news.1.b:0 "Keep an eye on it."

    spook_news.1.c:0 "Maybe it's nothing..."
    spook_news.1.c.tt:0 "§GDisable the undead event.§!"

    spook_news.2.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Denounces Burgundian Biological Attack"
    spook_news.2.d:0 "The Reich Ministry of Foreign Affairs has today officially denounced the Burgundian Ordensstaat as responsible for what it calls a "callous and barbaric attack," on the Reich.\n\nWhile the declaration was vague and lacking in detail, many suspect that the recent citywide shutdown of Strasbourg, officially the consequence of a measles outbreak, has to do with it. In an even rarer acknowledgment of the outside world, Burgundy denied any responsibility for any "failures of the Reich's healthcare system."\n\nThe statement has flared tensions between the Reich and its client state, and many are bracing themselves for a possible nuclear exchange after the CIA released photographs showing entire German divisions equipped with hazmat suits and gas masks moving into Alsace."
    spook_news.2.a:0 "Has the Black State gone too far?"

    spook_news.3.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Nuclear Detonation in Industriebezirk Rodomo"
    spook_news.3.d:0 "Seismologists in England have confirmed that aerial reconnaissance photographs showing a visible nuclear detonation across the English Channel in Normandy are not only true, but the result of a nuclear explosion which occurred at precisely 5:28 AM on Thursday.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] and [JAP.GetLeader] have both swiftly condemned the German Reich for carrying out the nuclear attack, believed to have killed millions of Burgundian subjects. In response, the Führer denied the Reich had fired any nuclear weapons. CIA analysts contested this claim, citing the recent large deployment of CBRN equipped Wehrmacht forces to Elsaß.\n\nEngland and several other European countries are literally and figuratively bracing themselves for the fallout, with the nuclear exchange feared to be only the beginning of a wider war."
    spook_news.3.a:0 "Have they gone mad? They'll kill us all!"
    spook_news.3.b:0 "Let's have some fun..."
    spook_news.3.b.tt:0 "§RPlay as the Horde.§!"

    spook_news.4.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]The Ordensstaat Lies Silent"
    spook_news.4.d:0 "Following the nuclear annihilation of the city once known as Greater Rouen, an eerie silence has descended over Burgundy. "Silent as the grave," added the head of one of several increasingly worried intelligence agencies, only in half jest-no more transactions with the Bretons, nor refugees into the French countryside. The Reich is little more talkative than their rogue spawn in the west; the Reichskanzelei seemingly too preoccupied with internal crises to continue denying their widely assumed guilt in the Rodomo Bombing.\n\nThere are, however, two signs that worry observers more than any other. Aircraft that soar near Burgundian airspace report fewer and fewer of the distant city lights seen at night, and even more worrying; people living in the Netherlands and southern England report that the Burgundian radio signal jammers appear to be shutting down one after another."
    spook_news.4.a:0 "Does nothing stir in the dark?"

    spook_news.5.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Battle of Gomorrah"
    spook_news.5.d:0 "After meeting with federal and state officials, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. placed New York City in a state of emergency effective today at 12:00 PM EST. Authorities on all five boroughs were exhorted to implement worst-case quarantine measures in response to "civil disturbance incidents" in Lower Manhattan and adjacent parts of Brooklyn. The disheveled mayor and his family were last seen entering the Holland Tunnel by motorcade.\n\nRegular Army and National Guard units had cordoned the Big Apple shortly before the suspension of all non-essential broadcasts nationwide. What little news escaped the media blackout allege that the military is dispersing crowds from checkpoints with lethal force - a claim which [USA.GetLeader] is expected to address in a televised announcement later tonight."
    spook_news.5.a:0 "What war has arrived at our native shore...?"
    
    spook_news.6.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]IJA Facing Possible Recall"
    spook_news.6.d:0 "Just a scarce few days ago, the first cases of the global epidemic currently ravaging Western Europe, and more recently New York, were discovered in Shanghai. With the first confirmed outbreak in any Asian urban center, the plague is undoubtedly already spreading rapidly due to Shanghai's dense urban arrangements.\n\nThe threat of an uncontrollable outbreak has prompted the IJA to immediately consolidate all forces in China, likely in preparation for a possible withdrawal in preparation for outbreak management in the Japanese isles. With the sudden possibility of a Japanese withdrawal, President Gao Zongwu has mobilized the ROC Army to quarantine Shanghai and prevent the transmission of the plague to other large Chinese cities or international ports. Whether such tactics will prove to be effective remains to be seen."
    spook_news.6.a:0 "Is the orient now too stricken with pestilence and death?"
    
    spook_news.7.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Massacre at the Bering"
    spook_news.7.d:0 "Leaked reports from a small United States Navy patrol fleet stationed near Alaska describe a harrowing scene that occurred when a group of ships approached the fleet in the dead of night, shooting signal flares and asking to open communications - one anonymous source claims that these ships belonged to Russian refugees presumably fleeing from the Far East, asking for asylum within the United States from a strange virus that, in their words, 'ravaged their homes and turned family into frenzied killers'. Shortly after communications were established, the patrol fleet opened fire on the ships, destroying them and killing all on board.\n\nThe President could not be reached for a comment, however the White House has cited that they will do everything in their power to maintain national security and control over their borders."
    spook_news.7.a:0 "The world darkens."

    spook_news.12.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Anarchy Grips the Isles"
    spook_news.12.d:0 "An already deeply disturbed world has today turned its attention to the British Isles, where it appears an unsettling turn of events has occurred. Despite desperate efforts, several military outposts in a rapidly expanding area have had all communications cut off, with more falling silent each day. Little is known about this worrying development, though some recent and growingly anxious reports have gone on to describe blazing fires being witnessed as far inland as the outskirts as London.\n\nWhether or not these occurrences can be linked to each other, or indeed to the rest of the world's troubles, is unknown. The paucity of information is such that the state of the national governments in the British Isles has been put under question, and whether they shall emerge from this chaos intact is far from certain."

Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.\n\nYou are worthy to take the scroll\nand to open its seals,\nbecause you were slain...\n\nWorthy is the Lamb, who was slain,\nto receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength\nand honor and glory and praise!\n\nDare the Lamb break the seal, and see what it be that the scroll conceals?"
