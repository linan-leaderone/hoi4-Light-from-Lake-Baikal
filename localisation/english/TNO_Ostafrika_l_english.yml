 GRO_Arthur_Liebehenschel_hog_desc:0 "§Y$head_of_government$\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LArthur Liebehenschel is one of Hüttig's most consistently loyal, competent, and efficient administrators. Liebehenschel has never failed in an assignment or mission given to him, and has managed to keep dozens of different concentration camps running at a level that few others have failed to reach. Even Liebehenschel's subordinates seem to uniformly respect the man, and there is something exceedingly uncommon in the totality at which he gathers loyalty from his men and his workers.\n\nThere is something odd about Liebehenschel, well known but rarely talked about. Himmler himself has dismissed Liebehenschel as a soft man, too kind to his prisoners. Hüttig suspects somewhat this assessment to be accurate. However, Liebehenschel is too well-liked, too necessary, and too deferential to be removed. As such, Hüttig has chosen to tolerate these rumors of softness... for now.§!"
 GRO_Josef_Mengele_for_desc:0 "§Y$foreign_minister$\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LJosef Mengele is often held up by Germany as proof of the inherent superiority of the Aryan mind. His experiments in the Auschwitz Camp, while highly controversial, were enough to earn him a Nobel Prize in Medicine, though rumors persist that this award was only awarded due to efforts by the German government to pressure the committee. No matter how much the West contests the legitimacy of his experiments, Mengele remains a world-renowned doctor and his experiments are discussed in classes around the world.\n\nWith the recent outbreaks of Malaria in Africa, the Reich has sent Doctor Mengele to the front lines, offering him immense resources with which to study the disease and produce a cure or treatment for the German people. Mengele's cruel, twisted methods have not been tempered in the years since the war, and even now, the native populations of Africa have grown to fear the Angel of Death as so many did before them.§!"
 GRO_Karl_Chmielewski_eco_desc:0 "§Y$economy_minister$\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LAll across Africa, the natives whisper of the Devil of Gusen, and the rumors that follow him everywhere he goes. One common theory is that he skins his prisoners to the bone, using their flesh to decorate his furniture. Another commonly held belief is that he enjoys watching the executions of his captives, deriving a sick sort of pleasure from it. Karl Chmielewski is pleased to hear these rumors, believing they will strike fear into the native's hearts. Chmielewski, considering himself Hüttig's favorite, is prone to brag of the dangerous and vile tasks Hüttig entrusts to him and him alone.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the entirety of the Ostafrikan SS Command despises Chmielewski, seeing him as a mindless brute with only mediocre command skills. Even Hüttig is disgusted by the man and his brutality. The special tasks that Chmielewski is so proud of are, as often as not, tasks that the Reichskommissar believes Chmielewski will fail and put an end to his atrocities once and for all. Chmielewski, however, is effective, so Hüttig has not yet been behooved to take more serious measures against him.§!"
 GRO_Otto_Forschner_hog_desc:0 "§Y$security_minister$\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LOtto Förschner has been a loyal Waffen-SS man since the day he enlisted way back in 1934—at least, according to him. After losing his eye on the Eastern Front, he was made overseer of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, helping fuel the Nazi rocket program on the backs of communist prison labor. But when he was found to be taking bribes and utterly unaware of a sabotage plot right under his nose, accusations of communist sympathies soon came from the Gestapo, and he was swiftly demoted to a sub-camp commander in Dachau.\n\nThe Nazi acquisition of new African colonies became Förschner's opportunity for redemption. He volunteered to serve as a military administrator, working his way up the ranks with efficiency that not even his tarnished record could deny. But his success did not bring him respect from everyone, least of all Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig. Although he is well aware his boss will never see him as more than a "beefsteak Nazi" who dodged justice, Förschner knows that he does his job well enough for his position to be secure for the time being.§!"
 GRO_Richard_Baer_sec_desc:0 "§Y$head_of_government$\n$national_socialism$§!\n--------------\n§LRichard Baer has spent his entire career managing prisons: he was one of the first guards at Dachau, then served on the garrisons at Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, and Neuengramme. His proficiency caught the eye of SS Main Economic and Administrative Office head Oswald Pohl, who had him promoted to a senior level in the Concentration Camps Inspectorate. He also served as head of the infamous Auschwitz-I camp, and would remain in that position through the end of the war.\n\nNow, Baer is in charge of his largest prison yet. It was a no-brainer when Hans Hüttig tapped him to oversee the security apparatus in RK-Ostafrika, and he brought with him a wealth of ideas. The bulk of the Ostafrikan SS's harshest policies are rumored to come straight from Baer's orders, and the trust that the Reichskommissar has in him cannot be understated. It is not clear whether the people of eastern Africa will suffer worse, but it is clear that nothing will get better as long as Richard Baer continues to hold Hüttig's ear.§!"

 ## Ideas ##
 GRO_Just_Another_Camp:0 "Just Another Camp"
 GRO_Just_Another_Camp_desc:0 "For Hans Hüttig, the running of a Reichskommissariat is no different than that of a concentration camp. We are not here to build a nation. We are not here to uplift the locals. We are the guards, and this is their prison. Any signs of dissent will be crushed, and the native population will mine and farm for the Reich until they drop."
 GRO_Aryan_Only_SS:0 "Aryan Only SS"
 GRO_Aryan_Only_SS_desc:0 "Whilst other elements of the Reich are all too happy to welcome degeneracy into their ranks, we can never lower ourselves to such a disgrace. The native population must know their place, below the German, and so the SS in Ostafrika comprise of full blooded Aryans alone."
 GRO_The_Unending_War:0 "The Unending War"
 GRO_The_Unending_War_desc:0 "Our colony is in a near constant state of warfare as countless native resistance movements carry out a persistent guerrilla war against our regime. Our patrols are ambushed, convoys stolen, positions raided and settlements burned. Even the fiercest of our soldiers have come to fear straying too far from the few beacons of civilisation."
 GRO_Filling_The_Stores:0 "Filling the Stores"
 GRO_Filling_The_Stores_desc:0 "It is important for us to keep our garrison armed and ready. We will waste nothing in our efforts to obtain more weapons.\n\nAnd whatever we have, we will keep for ourselves."
 GRO_Oberkommando_Der_Afrika_Idea:0 "Oberkommando Afrika"
 GRO_Oberkommando_Der_Afrika_Idea_desc:0 "The other Reichskommissariats are incredibly far from the reality of this war, and their incompetence is going to cost us victory in our war against the South Africans. To assert our control over our efforts, we have created a joint command to coordinate their efforts with our own.\n\nThe OKA shall see us through to victory over the degenerate Republic."
 GRO_Tribal_Recruitment:0 "Tribal Recruitment"
 GRO_Tribal_Recruitment_desc:0 "We've taken the liberty of choosing some significant natives as bodies for the front. They may be inferior to us, but they are numerous and they will serve our goal of winning this war.\n\nThe more they take the losses, the less we have to mourn over. They're just not Aryan after all."
 GRO_Kindersoldaten_Idea:0 "Kindersoldaten"
 GRO_Kindersoldaten_Idea_desc:0 "In order to solve the crippling lack of manpower, it has been decided to conscript inferior children from the age of ten into the regular army, in both support and combat roles. Their young blood will pave the way to victory for the Aryans, as it is both duty and honor for the servants to the master race: let the enemy look into their innocent eyes as they pull the trigger, and realize that, after all, they are exactly the same as the ones they hate so much."
 GRO_Simplified_Arms_Production_Idea:0 "Simplified Arms Production"
 GRO_Simplified_Arms_Production_Idea_desc:0 "There's no use in making our production plants sophisticated and grand. We only need what we need, and these are basic parts and ammunition. These things are what we need in great numbers but not in quality.\n\nAs long as we have a decent production line, we do not need to worry about anything else."
 GRO_The_Fatherland_Arrives:0 "The Fatherland Arrives"
 GRO_The_Fatherland_Arrives_desc:0 "Our Fatherland has come to our aid, and they have brought with them the necessities of war! With the support they have given us, their promises are, in all legal technicalities, fulfilled.\n\nHowever much to our dismay, the German support comes only in limited defensive and order-maintaining capacities. When it comes to driving the dagger into the heart of the OFN, we are still on our own. Although Müller doubtlessly wishes for a more aggressive delivery of support, we shall still make full use of what they have brought."
 GRO_idea_a_hundred_for_one:0 "A Hundred for One"
 GRO_idea_a_hundred_for_one_desc:0 "The work of our Generalbüro has surpassed our expectations as our troops' numbers have swelled significantly thanks to our efforts. This comes at the cost of its overall organization, as the thousands of untermenschen now conscripted within its ranks are not as well-trained as our superior Aryan soldiers."
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_0:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_0_desc:0 "Thanks to the concerted effort in building an autonomous power line, power has been brought to the entirety of Bouhlerstadt, greatly improving quality of life for the population. Of course, the fruits of Aryan ingenuity and hard labor should only be enjoyed by the master race, and not by ungrateful wretches..."
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_1:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_1_desc:0 "The expansion of Bouhlerstadt's power line have allowed the colonial government to set up a surveillance network of security cameras all throughout the city, to protect the hard-working Germans from the dangers lurking in the dark."
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_2:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 GRO_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_2_desc:0 "By order of Reichskommissar Hüttig, surveillance measures will be extended to the entirety of Ostafrika until unrest is completely crushed and the inferiors have been definitely subdued. No one will be allowed to endanger the future of Aryan domination over Afrika!"
 GRO_Insurgency_Training_idea:0 "Insurgency Training"
 GRO_Insurgency_Training_idea_desc:0 "German weapons and training have turned many of those Boers still living in Federation-controlled areas into a dangerous guerrilla. From secret hideouts, they strike against supply lines, production plants, police stations, and isolated patrols, further destabilizing South Africa and greatly hindering its war effort."
 GRO_Burn_Them_All_idea:0 "Burn Them All"
 GRO_Burn_Them_All_idea_desc:0 "Schenck and his moral qualms about saving "innocents" are nonsensical, and will be dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic. From now on, Ostafrika shall field its own bomber force, ready and willing to perform its duty towards the Vaterland.\n\nThere are no innocents in this war. All enemies of the Reich are guilty of opposing the master race, and the only fitting punishment is to watch powerless as their entire world, their dreams, their hopes, their loved ones BURN."

Should they try, however, they will be met with the drums of war echoing strong from Ostafrika, and countless preparations made for precisely such a situation.\n\nFrom booby traps to ambushes, industrialization to organisation, we are prepared for anything."

 GRO.2.d:0 "To say that things in Ostafrika are moving quickly would be an understatement. Officials in Bouhlerstadt are working without sleep, racing between government buildings and military barracks. With the death of Hitler and the dawn of a fratricidal slaughter at home, lines of communications and supplies have become precarious at best. Every hallway smells of military cigarettes, and the countless office fans are working even harder than any clerk or messenger.\n\nIn the middle of it all, like the trunk among a million twisting roots, is Hans Hüttig. He stands over his desk, looking at scrawled memos, outdated frontier maps, and stained ledgers. All the detritus of an empire in crisis. Quietly, he opens one of his filing cabinets and pulls out a slim folder. Written along the top in small black lettering is:\n\nNOTFALLEINSATZPLAN: AFRIKA-SCHILD\n\nHe looks over it, and takes a breath. This is what must be done.\n\nHe goes back to his desk, and picks up his phone."

Numerous inefficiencies, mass consumption of subversive media, forged documents, and in some cases even subhuman administrators! It was a treasure trove of treachery and corruption.\n\nHe had never been an emotional man, but the present moment moved him deeply. A wry smile crossed his face, and he leaned backwards in his seat. All the paranoia, the self doubt, the maddening fights with his superiors, it had all meant something. The smiling showman and the cowardly degenerate might finally be relieved of duty, freeing the Fatherland and Hüttig himself of their entitlement and insolence.\n\nThe satisfaction was overwhelming. He rose from his desk, and headed towards the door. However, before he reached the handle, a flood of negative emotions returned, paralyzing him. Something felt... wrong. If the bureaucrats in Germania had ignored his warnings once, could they do so again? Even if the evidence seemed damning to him, would it be so to a man a thousand miles away? He needed more.\n\nSo it was that Hüttig returned to his desk, and began drafting even grander plans. If he was to purge the filth from this continent, he would need an irrefutable, overwhelming assault. A new investigation would commence, even more through then the last. The devil would have his due. Hüttig had waited years for such a moment, he could wait a bit longer."

No doubt many of you have already heard of the bedlam that engulfs the mother country as we speak. While it is a regrettable occurrence, the considerable leeway with which Germania has bestowed upon her Reichskommissariats in the Dark Continent has prevented the disorder there from causing similar discord here. We are self-sufficient in resources and capable in function, and will remain so until the next Führer assumes power.\n\nNevertheless, it has also invited problems of its own. Our armies, navies and air forces rely upon Germany to supply them with instructions and skilled personnel. With the current crisis, acquiring either from conventional sources is an impossibility. In effect, all three Reichskommissariats in mainland Afrika are now independent -- with the discohesion that entails. This must be rectified posthaste.\n\nHence, effective today, the separate commands of Reichskommissariats Ostafrika, Zentralafrika, and Südwestafrika shall be temporarily subsumed into Oberkommando Afrika. Instructions pertaining to readjustments in supply chains and postings will be distributed to all units within the month.\n\nOur Reich has a long history of overcoming the hurdles thrust upon it, whether by man or by fate. With the blood of a proud race in our veins, this hurdle shall be one from which we will emerge stronger than ever before.\n\nSigned,\nH. Hüttig\nS. Müller\nW. Schenck."

His officers are bickering about which battalion has been sent where, what squadrons are most vital for interdiction, whose plan would save the race or doom the nation. Aides man the phones that line the walls, sending coded messages out into the field. Everybody knows what they're here for.\n\nThe Boers have taken up arms, declaring a new Great Trek, and the South African blacks have attempted to throw off Cape Town's chains. All three will fail. Tonight, Ostafrika and her allies will go to war. All eyes slowly turn to Hüttig. He allows himself to savor this moment of mastery.

While news of the invasion has yet to reach the general public, our press office is currently preparing a statement to be read by the Reichskommissar on all radio stations.

 GRO.11.t:0 "Ostafrika Provides Industrial Assistance"
 GRO.11.d:0 "As the first step in the plan for the advancement of all the Schild, Hüttig and his men in Ostafrika have sent numerous caravans of workers and industrial materials across our borders. These workers- all African slaves, held in Hüttig's many camps- have been similarly accompanied by their guards, who have immediately set the slaves to work on breaking ground for the new factories. Indeed, it almost seems like the Ostafrikans don't even want our workers touching their materials ourselves- our workers are shooed off when they merely try to aid with construction.\n\nOf course, this secrecy on our own soil is not something we happily tolerate. A letter of protest was sent to Bouhlerstadt to ask Hüttig to allow our workers to speed construction- after all, every day runs the risk of another factory's bombing, or a road being destroyed by American air raids. The response, in typical Hüttig fashion, is both condescending and quite rude. Hüttig's letter details the superiority of the Ostafrikan slave in comparison to our supposedly "lazy laborers", claims that only the Ostafrikan guards understand how to control their workers while maximizing productivity, and even goes so far as to suggest that we begin to model our labor camps off the Ostafrikan ones, as well as training our guards on a regimen based off the Ostafrika model.\n\nThese requests are ridiculous, and will be ignored as such, but it seems that there will be no true solution to this problem. They are building factories for us in the end, whether our laborers are working or not, and who are we to stop them? If Hüttig wants our factories to be built by his slaves and his alone, he can go right ahead, as long as the factories are built."

The workers-slaves from one of the many camps in Ostafrika, and accompanied by their very own guards- have spared no time in breaking ground on our new projects, and already the walls and foundations of our new factories are being thrown together at breakneck speed, with the slaves being pushed to their absolute limit to finish on time.\n\nHowever, this has not come without its difficulties. A strange air of secrecy surrounds the worksites, as our inspectors and workers are turned back whenever they get close to the sites. The language barrier between Afrikaans and German makes communication between our nations tough at best. Our complaints about the issues we are finding seem to go either unheeded or ignored. All of this combined makes for quite the hostile work environment, to say the least.\n\nStill, though, at the end of the day, are the Germans not building our industry for us? Perhaps it is not wise to go and bite the hand that feeds, after all. If Hüttig wishes to build our factories in his own distinct way, who are we to complain? Factories are factories, whether built by Boer or slave."

The air sat less heavily around the city, and the recruits could barely even smell the gas of the nearby motorways as they stepped off the train, fully dressed in Afrikan-SS garb. The uniform and rigidity of the soldiers drew the attention of much of the platform, who watched in excitement as the first German soldiers they had seen came through. Johan held in a grin as they passed by a particular group of civilians- no doubt they were impressed at the clean uniforms and shiny equipment the Reich had to offer.\n\nAs they marched out of the station, they passed by a pair of Boer soldiers.

Unfortunate, but he hadn't had the time to get it fixed in weeks.\n\nThe doors of the train opened, and out stepped a man that Fischer knew would make his life hell. An Ostafrikaner-SS man, completely dressed in a spotless dress uniform. He had even brought the hat. Disdainfully, the man observed the station as he walked towards Fischer. Fischer, suddenly realizing something, ran his hand over his face. He had forgotten to shave.\n\nThe SS man stopped. "Do you know where a Major Fischer is, soldier?" He asked.\n\n"You're looking at him." Fischer replied.\n\n"You're Major-" The man sighed. "I and my men are here to help your division with tactics and strategy.

A round trip to Bouhlerstadt, where they would get the best training of anyone in all of Afrika, and then a trip back to the front lines to fight off the Americans. While they were there, they would even get some of the equipment that the Germans used, which was far and away superior to the rifles and pistols the Boers usually had. Such an offer was impossible to refuse for the most patriotic of the soldiers, and so they went on a journey to become the best soldiers they could be.\n\nThe men have come back, but they've come back changed. They're almost universally quieter. They're far more orderly than they once were. They go around their barracks, enforcing the harshest discipline they can. Rumors spread that these volunteers no longer go drinking, but devote their time to target practice. Some of them have even taken to correcting their officers if they find them as incompetent or incorrect, suggesting their own solutions to problems. Almost all of them are candidates for future officer positions. Unbelievably, we've even gotten reports that they have refused to go on leave to see their families and friends.\n\nThe men are back, and they're better soldiers than any among us, but one can only wonder how they'll adjust back to civilian life when this war ends."

Aboard them are dozens of South African Boers. They're ragged and tired from the hard training, but also confident in their newfound skills. For the Boers, it's a chance to defend their families, their homes, their heritage. And for Ostafrika, it's another dagger in Cape Town's side.\n\nWhen the transports reach the border, the German officers and Boer trainees wave goodbye to one another.

As is only a matter of time with an outbreak, it appears now even our doctors and scientists are becoming infected. Several days ago, after failing to check in, our security forces stormed the laboratories of Doctor Josef Mengele only to discover Mengele and his team had vanished, taking most of their research with them.\n\nWhilst search teams were immediately dispatched to find Mengele, he has unfortunately now been found dead. Reportedly discovered near Böhmstadt, Mengele's naked corpse was found hung from a tree deep in thick jungle. With his hands, feet, nose, ears, eyes, tongue and genitals removed, and a swastika carved into his chest, he was recognised only by a native who remembered Mengele taking test subjects from his village years earlier. It is now believed that Mengele was attempting to cross the border into the Kenya region, likely in an attempt to defect to the Italians, when he was instead captured en-route by the militia forces of rebel leader Idi Amin.

"In a foreign land such as this, loyalty to the Fatherland is of the utmost importance. We remain surrounded by subhumans, savages, and vessels of corruption. It is precisely for this reason that I call upon you, a most steadfast SS officer, for this assignment."\n\nUpon the realization that this was not a disciplinary hearing, Gunter's tense disposition relaxed. The Reichskommissar may have been a paranoid man, but Gunter was clearly not the one under suspicion today. Hüttig slid a satchel across the desk, and peered into Gunter's eyes.\n\n"You are to enter Zentralafrika under the guise of reassignment. Enclosed are all the relevant documents. Observe operations there, and take care to remember the highest ideals of the Fatherland. After a period of a week, expect a corrective order, and another reassignment west. When you have finished this task, you are to report directly to me and me alone. Do you possess sufficient understanding to fulfill your duty?"\n\nGunter nodded, heiled, and was gone as quickly as he arrived. Alone with his hangover yet again, Hüttig clenched his fist. He would uncover their corruption, and finally correct the heinous mistakes of his superiors. Perhaps then, he would no longer be forced to maintain order alone in Afrika. He poured himself a drink."

Those were simpler times.\n\nLike Ozymandias before him, age had slowly weathered once great foundations.

Creeping futility lurked repressed in the back of his mind, growing until it had reached a fever pitch.\n\nAll was lost, his brothers lie dead or missing, his Fatherland torn apart, the Lebensraum fought so dearly for decades ago buried by in an unceasing tide of subhumans. Most of all, Paul himself was lost. The once towering Aryan specimen, reduced to a half naked husk, muttering to himself among the weeds.\n\nThe patrol passed above him, its headlights drawing long shadows across the dirt road.

Rich, dark, malty. Magnificent... but not quite.\n\nHe sighs in reverence, the flavor offering some slight absolution in this damned backwater. Balthasar loves this tea. It reminds him of home.\n\nBack in Emden, Mutti would serve it in thin porcelain cups, not the steel mugs that the troops here are issued. Try as he might, Balthasar never could find kluntje, so he made do with pouring ration sugar at the bottom of his mug. Not as sweet as his tongue recalled, but it was better than nothing. Hardly any cream in Lusaka either, so his imitation tea also had none of the thin white wulkje hovering just below the rim. Always compromises for the Reich in Afrika; teetied was no less exempt.\n\nSometimes, he wonders why he had ever left. He'd already made decent money as a factory guard back home. But then he had seen those posters, read those magazine articles, and then the recruiter had commented on how perfectly Aryan his eyes were. Perhaps he would be something more in Ostafrika, he thought.\n\nThen he remembered.

Its rocket salvo is useless against fast-moving jet aircraft due to the absence of a guidance system, forcing operators to lead their targets.

Their low airspeed and low flight altitude fall within the weapon system's ideal operating conditions.

It got a little better as talks began, with many African delegates demanding to know why they were not already free with the supposed liberation of the continent. The intended month long conference finally collapsed during lunch when an apparent miscommunication caused MPs to refuse General Amin entry to a bathroom on the grounds it was for whites only.

Long shadows flowed down the white pebbled pathways, where, every so often, a gardener could be glimpsed drifting through the gloom. In stark contrast to the slaves meandering through his umbral estate, Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig stood at attention, his spine as straight as the marble pillars that flanked him. From the shade of his palace balcony, he frowned down at the gardeners with distaste. Ignoring the sweat that soaked through his heavy woolen uniform, Hüttig raised his mug to his lips and sipped, savouring the bitter taste of his afternoon coffee. Determined to preserve the purity of his Aryanism, it was one of the few luxuries he allowed himself.\n\nFinishing his coffee, Hüttig returned to his office. A phalanx of revolving fans cooled the air, battering it around the room. A stark contrast to the sweltering malaise of Afrika, it brought to mind nostalgic images of days spent in the wintry Saxony of his boyhood. Wiping such pointless thoughts from his mind with determined efficiency, Hüttig sat behind his enormous mahogany desk and continued his paperwork.\n\nAs he drafted yet another letter to Germania requesting more aid, men and supplies, Hüttig briefly wondered how Müller and Schenck were occupying the afternoon. He conjured the mental image of Müller pissing himself in a drunken stupor and Schenck's desk collapsing under the weight of unread reports. Neither of those indolent buffoons were fit to bear the title of Reichskommissar! Only he had the will, the strength, the purity to advance the Reich's interests in Afrika. Smirking, he signed the letter, dumped it in the out-tray, and snatched another document off the pile.\n\nHüttig frowned as he read. It was a dossier detailing the results of an investigation into the collapse of a recently-constructed bridge in Sambia, which was blamed on poor planning by the German engineers in charge of the project. In a sudden fit of pique, he crumbled it into a ball and threw it in the wastebasket. Scowling, Hüttig leaned back, the creaking of his chair setting him on edge. Always, he was surrounded by idiots and incompetents! How was he supposed to impose the Aryan ideal on Afrika when the dregs were all he ever got, the cravens, fools, bunglers and exiles the Reich saw fit to dump in his lap? Germania seemed to think of Bouhlerstadt as a refuse pile, fit only for those inadequate to serve in the Reich proper. But what, asked a little voice in the back of his mind, did that make him?\n\nFor a moment, Hüttig sat idle, doing nothing but listening to the fans, until their steady thrumming seemed indistinguishable from the beating of his heart.

As he sat, he heard the horrible creak from the chair that made his teeth rattle and his temples pulse. Scowling, his morning already thrown into disarray, he made a mental note to have the slave who had failed in the oh-so-simple task of fixing the chair flogged.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Hüttig centered himself. Ignoring the pulsing headache he was already beginning to develop, he unfurled a map of sub-Saharan Africa, and, taking his pen, began to circle settlements and military installations on the border with South Africa. Reichskommissar Hüttig did not think himself a fool. He knew the fragile peace between the Reich's colonies and South Africa was tenuous at best.\n\nThough supposedly determined to maintain their neutrality, South Africa's Anglo-Saxon government found itself wracked by internal tension caused by rebellious Boers and natives, which they were unable to resolve as a consequence of their pathetic degeneracy. The South African government increasingly maintained its precarious clutch on the nation thanks to aid from the OFN, who were busy digging their claws into the allegedly neutral nation. An OFN-aligned South Africa was an unacceptable threat to the Reich's interests in Afrika.\n\nHüttig began to draw arrows toward Pietersburg and Nelspruit.

Irritated at being dragged from his work in the palace, he looked them over, sorting each into the two kinds of officer sent to him by the Reich: SS officers considered too "ideologically dangerous" for the pseudo-degenerates in Germania, and a motley of incompetents, idiots and failures who had been judged deficient of more meritorious service.\n\nAs usual, most would be useless, bodies in uniforms sent to reinforce outposts or plantations. There were a handful of men who showed promise, but they were the exception. The Reichskommissar had to admit to himself that, for the most part, the men under his command were unmotivated, undisciplined, low on morale and ideologically wayward. Well, he'd just have to find a way to make it work.\n\n"Listen up!" he barked, startling some of the men who had begun to doze in the sun. "Whoever you were in the past, you are now men of the Ostafrikan officer corps! A band of brothers, dedicated to the immortal cause of National Socialism! Understand that we come to civilize this land, to wrench it from the subhuman natives who do not deserve its bounty and the pathetic colonist degenerates who failed in the same task!" Hüttig took a deep breath. "This is a great opportunity! You have been sent here, to the borders of our beloved Reich, because our Führer judged you to have the strength to advance the Aryan race in this strange and wild land! So, though your new surroundings may seem strange, though you may yearn for your homes, do not forget that you are the most important bulwark against the subhumans and the degenerates!"\n\nHüttig had not expected many to be moved by his speech. Most of them stared at him sullenly. Hüttig was not blind to the concerns of his men; he knew many viewed Ostafrika as a punishment position and were reluctant to be there. Nevertheless, he also saw the gleam his words had provoked in the couple of men he had judged as being the cream of the crop.\n\nIf only he had more men like that, he could impose the ideals of National Socialism over the whole continent. No, more than that, the whole world would tremble at the feet of their rightful Aryan masters! For now, he thought ruefully, he'd have to do what he could with the dregs."

As his vision cleared, he saw the slave, tied to a post, his bared back facing the gathered dignitaries. Hüttig lazily raised his hand, feeling the sweat pooled in his armpit coolly trickle down his flank. "Proceed," he ordered, slowly shifting his gaze to the officer with the whip.\n\nCrack. The slave cried out through the gag in his mouth as a furious red gash appeared across his shoulders. Crack. It was joined by another, as the blood from the first oozed down his back. Hüttig held his glass behind him, where it was dutifully refilled. He sipped, frowning. The slave had been assigned such a simple task; to fix the teeth-rattling, migraine-inducing creak in his chair, and yet this effortless chore had somehow evaded him.\n\nSetting the glass upon the table, Hüttig looked at his underlings through the corner of his eyes. He enjoyed giving them a sudden summons to his palace, to test how obediently they would respond. Baer had arrived within an hour, driving up from Bouhlerstadt, and Chmielewski had arrived soon after by helicopter from his villa. Mengele had sent his apologies, insisting he was close to a breakthrough. It was the third time, making Hüttig ponder if he'd have to do something about him.\n\nThey turned his stomach. To Hüttig, his subordinates were barely less degenerate than their own slaves. Baer, watching the punishment with barely-concealed boredom, was a drunk and a glutton. Chmielewski, on the other hand, had a sickly light in his eyes and seemed to thrill at each crack of the whip. He had heard of Chmielewski's villa, of the leather couches, book bindings and lampshades made from the hide of disobedient slaves. Hüttig felt his stomach turn with distaste as he looked back to the slave. Neither of them had anything close to his purity, his strength. They were barely fit to call themselves Aryan.\n\nHüttig watched the rest of the spectacle without passion. Slaves may not always be reliable, needing the whip to put them on the right path, but through the labour of these subhumans he would be able to secure his legacy and turn Ostafrika into a titan of industry, crown jewel of the Reich.

After the war against the Bolsheviks and the Judeo-capitalists the Reich had seized Afrika for her thousand year empire, but, to Hüttig's eternal irritation, Germania never seemed to share his burning zeal to develop it into prime Aryan Lebensraum.\n\nBrow furrowed, the Reichskommissar circled all the locations of major German defeats in the seemingly endless border skirmishes between Zentralafrika and the simian savages of Cameroon. Setting down his pen, he settled his chin on his hand and took in the full image. The Reich's defeats appeared to almost completely have taken place in lush jungle terrain.\n\nHüttig considered the problem. Müller was a buffoon with no clue how to lead his motley band of mercenaries and degenerates, and spent more time hunting elephants from a helicopter than carrying out his duties. Schenck, of course, was little better, wiling away the days tinkering with his planes like a little boy playing with toy soldiers.\n\nNevertheless, there seemed to be an obvious pattern here. By observing Müller's failures, it was clear to Hüttig that the Reich's defeats against the Cameroonian barbarians were not caused by deficient discipline and expertise among the men, issues with supplies or equipment, or even the poor guidance of their idiot leader, but was a result of a lack of training in jungle combat. Yes, that was it! Germans were racially attuned to forests, meadows, mountains, not Africa's primordial, steaming jungles! Hüttig had no doubt his troops, with a little training, could storm the battlefields of Africa!\n\nAllowing himself a thin smile, Hüttig felt satisfied he had secured the future of National Socialism in Afrika. Leaning back in his chair, his good mood was instantly wiped away as he was once again assaulted by that infernal creaking that made his teeth rattle like the scratching of a knife on a blackboard."

Hüttig noticed none of this jockeying for his approval, focusing his attention instead on his soldiers, engaged in a mock battle on the dune expanse that stretched before them to the far horizon.\n\nIt had not been easy to track down distinguished men who had served in North Africa, and had been even harder to convince them to uproot themselves and travel halfway across the globe to Ostafrika in their twilight years to train a new generation of German soldiers in desert warfare. If, as he expected, there would soon be war with the South African degenerates, his men would need to learn to comport themselves in the arid, desolate terrain of the bushveld.\n\nReaching the crest of the hill, Baer and Chmielewski panting with exertion behind him, Hüttig greeted the advisors. Sipping tea and lounging in camp chairs, they were a trio of overweight men with bristly white mustaches who he found difficult to distinguish. As he was handed a pair of binoculars, he wondered how men such as them could have come to be war heroes.\n\nOn the hill the sun was as hellishly bright as ever, but down in the dry basin the men had kicked up a tremendous cloud of dust. Watching them through the binoculars, Hüttig wondered if they could even see each other through the gloom. Still, he supposed, this was the kind of thing they'd have to get used to if they were to be victorious in South Africa.

Arranging their assignment to him had taken years of lobbying, cajoling and bribery and today it would finally come to fruition.\n\nThe television cameras in the back of the vast concrete hall flashed to life as Hüttig stepped in front of the turbine. After months of toil, the newly consecrated Preikschat-Schlicke Power Plant would be brought online to send electricity flowing through Ostafrika's veins, bringing the savage land one step closer to civilization.

Today we bring a spark from the sacred fire of Aryan civilization to Afrika. With this, the latest in German innovation, we do what the degenerates and the subhumans before them could not. We scorch barbarism from this land, we shine a light in the chaos of the darkest continent.

No mention was made of the dozens of slaves who had died in its construction, the dried bloodstains that lurked beneath the pristine concrete, the children who had lost their fathers.\n\nFinishing his speech, Hüttig flicked the switch for the cameras, and for a second was paralyzed with fear. What if it didn't work? What if all the cut corners made it fail, despite the tests? He would be humiliated in front of the entire world, it would be the end of his career. Sweat beading on his forehead, his normally so disciplined mind swarming with irrational anxieties, Hüttig felt his fear rise as the seconds dragged by.\n\nMercifully, it was soon over.

For once it was pleasantly cool, the sun seeming to have foregone its usual bite for the day. The glass of cognac that had quickly become part of his every meal sat forgotten in his hand as he stared into the cloud of smog hovering over distant Bouhlerstadt.\n\nThough they were a mongrel race, the parts that made up the English jigsaw were sound. Centuries of Germanic immigration and intermixing from Saxony, Jutland, Norway, combined with the Celtic blood of the early Britons; the Celts of course being Germanic due to their distant origins in the mountains of what would one day become Austria. And yet, despite their racial lineage, the old English regime had completely given themselves over to Judeo-Bolshevist degeneracy. He wondered why folk of strong Germanic blood had experienced such a total fall from grace.\n\nTaking a sip of cognac, Hüttig cursed the fact that the English had gotten to Africa before the Reich. Perhaps as a clean slate without the taint of Judeo-Bolshevist degeneracy, he would have had an easier time teaching the subhumans to dance to the National Socialist tune. Even now, the Anglos infested their former colonies like maggots in a rotting corpse, and much to his consternation his superiors would not allow him a free hand in dealing with them, though they sought to undermine the influence of the Reich at every turn.\n\nScowling, Hüttig recalled the letter he had received that morning from Germania. Apparently, "as a token of good faith", those pseudo-degenerates wanted him to approve the airing of an English-language radio program for the wealthy Anglo minority in Sambia and Simbabwe.\n\nWell, if he had to, he had to. Still, Hüttig promised himself, he would not allow the Anglos to taint Ostafrikan airwaves with their foul degenerate propaganda. Finishing his cognac, he resolved that all English-language media to be produced would need to have their scripts approved before airing, and would be closely monitored by Reich political agents.

Glancing down at the script, Conway took a deep breath and began.\n\n"Good morning, Reichskommissariat Ostafrika! Welcome to East African Broadcasts. I am your host, Ted Conway, joining me is my co-host Douglas McSweeney. Thanks to the benevolence of Reichskommissar Hüttig, we have been granted a license to broadcast an English-language radio-show to bring news, entertainment and the word of our Reichskommissar to you every weekday at five o'clock! Today we have a special bulletin on the ongoing enormously successful electrification of rural Ostafrika, followed by a report on the unprecedented economic stability the policies of Reichskommissar Hüttig have allowed us to enjoy!"\n\nDoug took over, reciting the carefully prepared propaganda they'd been delivered half an hour before the show. By God, being a Nazi mouthpiece made Conway feel dirty. Still, it was a paycheck, even if there was the constant threat of mysteriously disappearing should he ever slip up. He looked surreptitiously at the sour old bastard in the corner, trying to gauge his reaction, but he looked just as bitter as usual. It made him uneasy.\n\nConway sighed out of his nose, careful not to let the mic pick it up. Then, gathering his strength, he launched into explosively buoyant praise of the Reichskommissar's new mine expansions."

Marked out in bright red circles across each city were the locations of the new network of surveillance cameras that a battalion of slaves were already hooking up to the modern electrical grid. They were designed to give a comprehensive view of major intersections as well as government buildings and areas considered to potentially be hotspots for sedition. This was but the first phase of the plan, Hüttig thought with concealed glee. He'd already placed another order with Siemens for hundreds more.\n\nOstafrika was plagued with unrest from the barbaric simian natives and the seditious Anglo colonists, but they'd have significantly less success stirring up trouble for the Reich when he had eyes on every street. Machines never erred, machines were never disloyal. Once Hüttig had machines watching over all of Ostafrika, he could finally breathe easy, knowing that any threat to National Socialism and the objectives of the Reich would be easily detected. Gazing down at his realm from above, he could find and squash the traitors like insects.\n\nSmiling with grim satisfaction, Hüttig leaned back in his chair and was immediately assaulted once again by the migraine-inducing teeth-rattling screech of his chair. Instantly he seethed with rage. He'd tried everything to fix the damn thing and nothing worked, as a matter of fact it seemed to be getting worse. It was driving him to distraction, he couldn't work with that awful sound ripping across his eardrums like a thousand vicious knives. Centering himself, he decided to order a new chair from Germania.\n\nHe could not let something as ludicrous as a creaky chair affect him so. Resolving to bolster his Spartan discipline, Hüttig told himself he'd indulge in even less luxury in the future, even as he poured himself a glass of cognac. Just to calm his nerves."

Every year more Germans trickle into Ostafrika's quickly growing cities like water down a drain, eager to seek their fortune. With them come new ideas. Political ideas.\n\nReichskommissar Hüttig realised long ago that if dangerous thought is not uprooted when it sprouts, it will spread across the land like a vicious weed, corrupting all it comes into contact with. He had nothing but disdain for Ostafrika's intellectuals and petit-bourgeois, but he knew that unchecked they could infect the rest of his domain with radical thought. Slave liberation? What foolishness, when their prosperity came off the backs of the Untermensch! Clearly wealth and comfort made people think too much. And what better way to dull the development of seditious thought than by filling their minds with propaganda?\n\nLike a wildflower sprouting in the desert after an unexpected storm, the Ostafrikan Television Network sprung up overnight to pour entertainment, sports and Hüttig-approved news into the minds of Ostafrika's more affluent citizens. As a special demonstration of the Reichskommissar's benevolence, brand-new Siemens television sets were given away free all Aryan and Anglo citizens, so that they may all share in the bounty of the modern age.\n\nAnd so the Ostafrikans took the television sets into their homes like Trojans receiving a wooden horse, never suspecting that inside every television set hid a concealed microphone, recording their every word. Ostafrika would never need fear sedition again, all watched over by machines of loving grace."

Another day home from school was fine as far as he was concerned, even if a vicious cold was the price he had to pay. Why'd he need to learn German literature anyway? He was going to run the farm, just like papa!\n\nAfter what for a ten year old boy felt like forever, an image finally popped on screen at the stroke of seven o'clock. It was the usual start to the broadcast day; footage of the Reich and Ostafrikan flags flying side by side as Deutschlandlied played at an ear-blasting volume. Godfrey ignored the boring old song as he wolfed down his breakfast. Much to his irritation, the image cut to a shot of Reichskommissar Hüttig sitting behind a desk. Boring! Couldn't they skip this and go straight to the cartoons? He wanted to watch the new episode of Captain Über fighting the Judeo-Bolsheviks!\n\n"Citizens of the Reich," began the Reichskommissar, "I come to you today-"... and that was about when Godfrey stopped paying attention. Although he felt a twinge of guilt for thinking it, the Reichskommissar creeped him out. He looked like a porcelain doll, pallid and expressionless. While Godfrey got up to get a glass of milk, he listened absently to the Reichskommissar. He was saying that all projections for stability and economic growth had been massively overachieved, securing Ostafrika's place as one of the Reich's most prosperous regions. After that he rattled off a list of figures and facts that made little sense to Godfrey as the image cut to short clips of new gadgets going on sale in the capital and smiling blacks going to work in the mines.\n\nSitting back down in front of the television, Godfrey caught the final words of the Reichskommissar's speech. "Germans, Ostafrikans, be proud, for our great nation has proven the strength of National Socialism against barbarism. Together, we have created the most efficiently run state on Earth. Onwards, to an Aryan future!" Those words sent a thrill through Godfrey. If the Reichskommissar said everything was going well, then it had to be, right?\n\nAt last Captain Über began, and soon he had forgotten all about the Reichskommissar and his speech."

 GRO_FOCUS.13.d:0 "As stonily impassive as a marble statue, Hüttig stared across his desk at Clifford Dupont, Generalbüro representative for Ostafrika's minority of British colonists and exiles. All shrunken and wrinkled, he reminded Hüttig of a piece of fruit that had been left in the sun for too long. Shivering in the arctic frigidity of Hüttig's office, Dupont was reading the treaty that had been drafted by Hüttig's underlings. It would give the Anglos gifts of land to develop in the uncolonized interior in exchange for total and unwavering loyalty to the Reich and a public endorsement of National Socialist values.\n\nPrivately, he thought it was too lenient. The Anglos had long been a simmering pot just waiting to boil over, and Germania wanted to give them land? On the other hand, he supposed, Ostafrika had vast tracts of land that, when cleared, would make fantastic farmland. Perhaps they'd prove beneficial to the Reich's prosperity, as long as he kept them within an iron grip.\n\nHüttig had to stop himself from smiling as Dupont finished reading and deflated like a punctured balloon. If he had his way the degenerate Anglos would be deep in the coal mines instead of putting on a show of still being important dignitaries, but forcing them to dance along to his tune like marionettes was the next best thing.\n\nSigning the treaty would commit Ostafrika's Anglos to Hüttig and the National Socialist cause, in ink at least, giving him the legitimacy to persecute them should they ever stray from the path. He knew Dupont and his cronies secretly wished to undermine his rule, cast him down and take his realm for their own. Feeling his suspicion coil around him like a boa constrictor, Hüttig wanted nothing more than to send this rotting old would-be backstabber to the camps with the rest of the traitors, but until he got the go-ahead from Germania, all he could hope for was to keep them under the jackboot.\n\nDupont, of course, had no choice but to sign."

Instead he'd ended up teaching idiotic Boer farm boys where the trigger was on their K98ks. Stalking up and down the line, watching his men completely fail to hit their targets, Captain Weidmann wondered if this assignment was punishment for some forgotten slight.\n\nTo his mind, the men of the Herstigte Nasionale Party were nothing more than foolish, disorderly rabble with a heritage of unclear Aryanism. Unfocused, untrained and undisciplined, they were little better than the barbaric partisans and rebellious slaves, and he'd had the incredibly unenviable task of whipping a mob of sunburned yokels into a disciplined fighting force foisted upon him.\n\nIt was utterly ludicrous, and yet he'd had no choice but to accept his fate and slip into South Africa, eventually arriving at the HNP's secret training camp in a desolate valley where every breath filled his lungs with a thick coating of red dust. As he watched one of the Boers look down the barrel of his gun to check if it was loaded, Captain Weidmann wondered how Reichskommissar Hüttig had ever come upon the idea that the HNP could be useful in the coming war as anything other than cannon fodder.\n\nSighing as one of the Boers narrowly missed shooting himself in the foot, Captain Weidmann called for a break and went to wash the dust from his throat with a lukewarm beer."

Sipping tea on the balcony of the plantation estate that had been his father's, and his father's before him, James enjoyed the warmth of the rising sun loosening his rheumatic joints as he gazed over the fields of swaying hemp, stretching as far as the eye could see. Soon it would be time to wake the slaves.\n\nFinishing his tea, James stepped indoors to the drawing room to re-read the telegram he had received the prior afternoon. Try as he might, he couldn't find the hidden catch. According to the official telegram, the Reichskommissar had approved the provision of additional funds for British planters to exploit undeveloped land, for their mutual prosperity. The Deutscher Rhodesien Baufonds, they called it. If James' hastily learned German served him right, that translated as German Rhodesian Building Fund.\n\nJames sunk into his most comfortable chair, spreading himself around until he felt comfortable. Then he read it again. Life under the Nazis hadn't been as bad as he'd been expecting; for the most part they left the British colonists in their new Reichskommissariat alone, but there had always been an underlying tension between the British and their new German overlords. And yet, as of late they'd been oddly conciliatory. First they'd permitted English-language radio broadcasts, then they'd granted British planters vast tracts of land in exchange for a meaningless pledge of loyalty he had happily given. They'd even given him a free television set, where Godfrey liked to plant himself on the weekends when he should have been doing his Aryan Biology homework. The Reichskommissar never did anything out of the goodness of his heart, so what exactly did he expect to get out of this?\n\nSlipping the telegram into his suit pocket, James stepped back outside to watch his overseers herd slaves into the fields. In his grandfather's time, all of this land had been untamed. If these funds came through, perhaps they'd give him the chance to stamp his own mark on Afrika."

Soon, all of Ostafrika would be remade in its image, ordered, disciplined, efficient, everything and everyone in their proper place.\n\nUntil the dawn of that golden future however, there was work to be done. Tearing himself away from the view, Hüttig focused his attention back to the pile of maps, already darkening as the light faded. He would have to order a slave to bring him a lantern; he was enjoying the evening serenity too much to return to his office. With a single ivory finger he traced the border between Ostafrika and South Africa, the border that, when his carefully laid plans come to fruition, would soon cease to exist.\n\nNevertheless, although his troops were better disciplined, trained and equipped than the South African rabble, he was not fool enough to think victory a certainty until the flag of the Reich was raised over Cape Town. Until then, he devised contingency after contingency, should the unthinkable come to pass and the enemy push into Ostafrika.\n\nIn case that ludicrous plausibility came to pass, he had ordered the entire border mined and riddled with traps to cut down the advancing forces of the enemy. Nowhere was left open for the degenerates to enter Ostafrika unscathed. With their forces getting blown apart like sausages in a pan for every step they took, their forces would get slowed sufficiently for Hüttig's crack troops to crush their advance and push them to the sea.\n\nHüttig turned his head to look into the distant, dusky horizon.

A thin, lean man with oiled sandy blonde hair stands before a corkboard, puffing at a cigarette, the smoke rising to be whirled around the room by a violently rotating ceiling fan. The man cocks his head as he regards the corkboard. Outside are the sounds of late afternoon traffic, but the man does not hear them, focused as he is on the intricacy of his design.\n\nA dozen or so black-and-white portrait photographs, many of them taken from furtive angles, crowd the corkboard. White string wrapped around the pins of each photograph connects them to each other. One photograph in the centre of the corkboard is connected to all of the others. Its subject is a middle-aged man with a pale, craggy face, facing towards the camera.\n\nThe smoker finished his cigarette and lit another. He moved closer to the corkboard, absorbed by the central photograph. The man's name, written on the photograph in black marker, was Ian Smith, a former British colonist from Simbabwe who escaped into South Africa after the Reich had taken over. After building himself a new farm in Vryburg, Smith had vocally criticised Reichskommissar Hüttig and the new regime, and had become a prominent advocate for the rights of the British colonists and exiles still in Ostafrika.\n\nIn other words, he had become a nuisance. Unrolling the string and unpinning the photograph, the smoker slipped it into his jacket pocket. So, the Reichskommissar wanted to destabilise South Africa with a political assassination, did he? Well, what better way to achieve that than to assassinate one of the most publicly outspoken Anglos and pin it on the Boers?\n\nHe picked up the telephone, dialling his handler in Bouhlerstadt, and in doing so knocked down the first domino that would send South Africa spiralling into anarchy."

It bore little resemblance to those pathetic little headaches he used to get as a boy when he filched a few of his father's beers, which he now realized were a dim shadow of the real thing. Groaning, he leaned forward to stare at his desk. It was stacked high with the paperwork, missives, reports, memos, orders, telegrams, letters, requests, demands, transcripts, bulletins, dispatches, and tidings fair and ill that had accumulated since the prior afternoon. Wanting nothing more than to dive over the palace balcony to the gravel below at the thought of answering them, much less the horrific prospect of having to categorize them, he found his eyes drawn to the morning newspaper sporting the tantalizing headline: "IAN SMITH SHOT IN VRYBURG!"\n\nThough every cell in his body screamed at him, Hüttig watched himself pick the newspaper up and begin to read. His stomach swirled like a whirlpool as he attempted to digest what the newspaper was telling him. Oddly, almost all of the details on Smith's death mentioned in the article were different from those he had been given by his intelligence officers at the party the evening before.\n\nWere his men so incompetent they couldn't get correct intel on their own operation? Or had someone else gotten to Smith before they could, and had taken credit for it either mistakenly or intentionally, in the hope of increasing their prestige on the backs of the real assassins? If his suspicions were correct, and Smith had been taken out by a third party, that meant South Africa's downward spiral was happily progressing on its own and didn't need the extra push.\n\nAt least that's what he would have thought, had he been capable of cogitation.

In a burst of wisdom, the Reichskommissar had decided to establish dozens of new garrison outposts over the barren, arid nothingness of the Ostafrikaner frontier, stretching his already meagre forces to their absolute limit, and he had been chosen to man one. Thanks to a lack of appropriate funds, adequate equipment and competent officers, it had been a debacle from the start. In their first shipment they had received maggot-infested rations and a box full of boots without soles.\n\nNot that Weidmann gave much of a shit anymore. He was almost hoping that the degenerates would come and put him out of his goddamn misery. Every day was the same, infernal heat baking him in his uniform, filling his throat with dust. It seemed as though he was in a dream, one of those strange dreams where you know you're trapped in your own head but you can't make yourself wake up.\n\nCaptain Weidmann painfully suppressed a belch, afraid he'd inadvertently spray the contents of his stomach all over the trail. Well, he supposed he'd better find a slave to fix that fence before anyone noticed. If he was lucky, maybe he'd find a Negress attractive enough to force himself on."

 GRO_FOCUS.21.d:0 "Reichskommissar Hüttig flipped unenthusiastically through the dossier of applicants to the Ostafrikan SS. Most were from the army or were planter's sons looking for a better life. All were horrifically unimpressive, and some were dubiously Aryan.\n\nWhat a motley bunch of exiles and rejects he had to work with. Unlike the pseudo-degenerate pigs Schenck and Müller, he would sooner die than allow natives into the SS. By filling the ranks of the Südwestafrikan and Zentralafrikan SS with mongrel dogs they annihilated any possible claim they could have regarding their advancement of National Socialist values in Afrika. Hüttig felt his temples throb with hatred as the dossier in front of him faded away, replaced by Schenck and Müller's faces appearing before him, contorted with laughter, mocking his dedication to the Reich and to National Socialism. Stomach foaming with loathing, he almost vomited all over his desk from the sheer violent distaste he felt for his fellow Reichskommissars.\n\nDesperate to dispel the vision, Hüttig forced his eyes shut, squeezing tears from the corners to roll down his cheeks and, saltily, into his mouth. Why did the Reich favour them? They were incompetent, wasteful, indolent, and a thousand other unsavoury adjectives! And yet all he ever got were the dregs, the scraps, while his letters on Schenck and Müller's behaviour to Germania went ignored. It was infuriating, stomach-churningly migraine-inducingly jaw-clenchingly infuriating!\n\nRealizing he was losing control over himself, Hüttig took a deep breath and tried to calm down. He shouldn't pine for the attention Germania and the media lavished upon the other two. It was enough to be a devoted servant of the Reich and National Socialism, enough to be a pure Spartanist, a pure Aryan. And yet, even as the rage faded and the tears dried, he found it was impossible to banish that image. Were they sitting in Luanda or Hitlerstadt right now, laughing at him?\n\nThrowing aside the dossier, Hüttig yelled for more cognac."

The corpulent old reprobate across from him flinched a little, already shivering from the polar temperature of the office's dozen oscillating fans. Setting the glass down on the desk, just heavy enough to make a clink, Hüttig asked his underling, "Why do we fight, Baer?"\n\nBaer stuttered as he searched for the answer Hüttig wanted. "Er, to achieve victory, Reichskommissar?" Making Baer pale with a look of the utmost contempt, Hüttig rose and began to pace around the room, followed by Baer's nervous eyes. "Victory. Yes, Baer, we seek victory. Victory for our beloved Reich, for our Führer, and for the immortal science of National Socialism. We fight so that we may purify this land, scour away the barbarity, savagery and degeneracy of Afrika, and erect a new edifice in its place, a monument to the Aryan will to prevail against all odds. Pure, Baer. We will make Afrika pure. What would we do, however, if the unthinkable came to pass, if, against all probability, the barbarians should prevail?"\n\n"Er, ah..." stuttered Baer as Hüttig loomed over him. "We must continue the fight, Baer! To the last man! We must make them pay for every inch of blood-watered soil! If we cannot rule Ostafrika, nobody will!" Hüttig strode back behind his desk and took his seat. "You will form a new unit comprised of our most skilled and trustworthy men. They will be known as the Werwölfe. Ensure that they are trained in sabotage, guerrilla warfare and anti-occupation tactics." Spearing Baer with another sharp glance, Hüttig continued in a subdued tone, "Understand that this must be of the greatest secrecy. Although this is a contingency plan, we must not give the impression we are in any way preparing for defeat."\n\nPouring himself another glass of cognac, Hüttig looked up to find Baer frozen in place.

At last, trying their best to look unflappable, his underlings had arrived by helicopter and chauffeured sedan and were seated in the palace's enormous conference room.\n\nThe meeting was not without purpose. Always feeling the knife hovering behind his back, Hüttig had become suspicious of anti-National Socialist tendencies among some of his officers. Eyes narrowed, he looked around the table, glancing at each man in turn, noting who flinched, and, more important, who didn't. Could anyone on the Generalbüro have Speerist sympathies? To anyone but Hüttig, that would have been unthinkable. Eyeing his generals, he made the mental note to have them put under even more thorough surveillance.\n\n"Men," he began, as the last servant left the room, "We live in precarious times. I will be brief. From the outside, we are threatened by the degenerates and the Judeo-Capitalists. From within, on the borders of the Reichskommissariat, we are troubled by rebels, escaped slaves and so-called revolutionaries. Though we may expect that the racial purity of our men will lead us to victory, triumph is not assured. To prevail against the threats that face us, we must root out the cancer at the heart of Ostafrika."\n\nHe paused, looking around at his men, hoping for a reaction. Baer, looking nervous, always afraid of being replaced as the favourite. Dupont, grey-faced as usual. Chmielewski and Mengele staring back at him with their dead eyes. Stifling an annoyed sigh, Hüttig continued. "We cannot fight the barbarians when our own men are tainted by the stain of reformism. It is imperative that we root out the liberals in our ranks like weeds. They are not fit to serve the Reich, not even fit to call themselves Aryan. You will cooperate with my intelligence operatives in identifying and liquidating these traitors. We cannot allow these subversives to undermine National Socialism."\n\nThe conference continued, Hüttig laying out a plan to eradicate the subversives, all the while feeling that spectral knife draw closer and closer to his flesh. He had to scour the taint of treacherous thought from Ostafrika, without mercy, without quarter, before it was too late."

Feeling his stomach shift turbulently as he stood, he blearily stumbled towards the dimmer to dull the lights. Slumping back in his chair, Hüttig told himself that overwork had led to him falling asleep at his desk. Obviously it had nothing to do with the cognac he'd been drinking since breakfast. Temples thumping, he looked over the desk, trying to remember what he'd been doing before he'd dozed off.\n\nIt all came back to him in a sudden flash of incandescent fury. After dinner, he'd received a telegram from Germania insisting that he cease sending critiques of his fellow Reichskommissars. The pseudo-degenerates in their plush Mitte offices had threatened him, suggesting his constant criticism of those incompetent buffoons was tantamount to treason.\n\nHands shaking with rage, Hüttig poured a glass up to the brim with cognac, just to calm his nerves. How dare they suggest that? Downing his cognac, relishing its bitterness, Hüttig felt the fire of hatred grow in his belly. Not only could he not trust Germania, but he was surrounded by enemies, each waiting to sink their knife in his back.\n\nThe treasonous bastards in the other Reichskommissariats, the traitorous Boers, waiting for their opportunity to slip free of the Reich, the slippery Italians up north. It was like being surrounded by a ring of fire, the flames advancing, always advancing, until the day they'd sear the flesh from his bones. He could not allow the degenerates and the traitors to prevail.\n\nHüttig leaned back slightly and immediately felt that horrific, bone-rattling creak in his chair stab into his brain like a million wicked needles. The blood rising to his face, something inside him finally snapped. Slowly, he watched himself rise, grab the chair and drag it outside to the balcony, into the bracing night air. Hauling it onto the marble parapet, Hüttig used what remained of his strength to shove the enormous leather chair off the edge.\n\nStaring into the lush blackness of his gardens, Hüttig heard the chair shatter on the gravel below. Swaying from side to side, he lurched back inside and passed out on the office floor."

After a moment, he wiped away the sticky tear residue that clung to his cheek and looked around. Somehow, he'd ended up in bed. Had someone carried him there, after he passed out in his office? He felt his cheeks burn with shame, both from the indignity of being treated like a child and the added humiliation that everyone in the palace had probably already heard about it. Head thumping like a jackhammer, Hüttig lay in bed for over an hour, staring up at the ceiling. He would have to re-establish his authority.\n\nHe heard a tentative knock at the door. Although he didn't respond, he heard it creak open, and turned to see who dared disturb him. Baer, fawningly shuffling towards him. Hüttig wanted to yell at him to get out, but he just couldn't summon the energy. All he could do was croak, "Tell me what you want."\n\n"Ah, Reichskommissar, allow me to extend to you my deepest sympathies that you have been taken ill," began Baer, sycophantic as ever, before he was stopped by Hüttig's stare of piercing contempt. Even mired in the pits of the worst hangover of his life, he knew he still held power over the disgustingly corpulent lickspittle. "Er, well, the Generalbüro are concerned about the commitment of our Boer allies. I knew to bring it to you immediately." Yes, thought Hüttig, so that you might squeeze a few kudos out of me. Pathetic.\n\n"Must you bother me with every little thing?" demanded Hüttig scratchily, turning to glare at Baer. "It is simple. Emphasise to them, in a propaganda campaign, that we fight the same fight, have the same enemies. The natives; they seek to destroy everything we have built, to annihilate the Aryan future. You will bring the Boers closer to us. Use whatever resources you need. Now get out of my room."\n\nBaer obsequiously bowed out of the room, thanking Hüttig for his wisdom. Hüttig frowned after him, wondering if it was time to put Baer out to pasture. Or into a grave. As a leader, the men who seemed most loyal to you were the ones to watch.\n\nGroaning, Hüttig fell back to continue staring at the ceiling, wondering if he'd find a new chair waiting for him in his office.

When he had received his new orders, desperately hoping for a transfer to Bouhlerstadt, he had instead found himself sent from his border garrison to this stinking shithole mine at the edge of Ostafrika. Twenty demoralized reprobates to watch over hundreds of slaves, responsible for keeping the titanium flowing. It was no wonder he spent most of his days in an inebriated haze.\n\nWeidmann wondered why he endured, why he didn't just pull out his Luger and put a bullet in his brain. After days filled to the brim with all the savagery and depravity the world had to offer, he was forced to relive it all again in his dreams. Feeling as though he spent every second in a waking dream, Weidmann had begun to wonder if he were going mad.\n\nAnd so it was that, staggering back to camp with vomit on his boots, Weidmann was the first to see the men coming out of the trees. Suddenly death didn't seem so favourable. As the men shouted in their unfamiliar language, Weidmann turned to run into the bushes, despite understanding in a sudden burst of clarity that he could not escape, that these were his final seconds on Earth.\n\nBoots crunching in the humus, he was suddenly reminded of the crunching of his boots in the snow as a boy in his native Thuringia. He felt himself drawn into a memory, tripping and falling in the snow, bloodying his nose against a rock. For a moment, he smelled the tweed of his father's coat as he was carried to bed. It was so long ago, now.\n\nAs the bullets ripped through him, roses of blood blooming on the front of his uniform, Captain Weidmann fell heavily to the dankness of the forest floor. As his empty eyes stared up at the endless void between the stars, he was claimed by a more profound darkness."

 GRO_FOCUS.27.d:0 "Feeling slightly tipsy from the three glasses of cognac he had downed with his simple lunch of sausage and dumplings, regarded by him as a Spartan meal, showcasing to all his impeccable discipline, Hüttig circled a few figures on the document he was reading. Reports on the build-up of rebel groups in the interior were nothing compared to the Ostafrikan racial census. It was one of the most frightening things he had ever read.\n\nAccording to this, the only census conducted since the establishment of the Reichskommissariat, Aryans were still a miniscule minority in Ostafrika even after the settlement programs. Though the racial purity of the Aryan clearly made them superior to the subhumans, the natives clearly had an advantage in numbers. Of course, he'd always known there were more natives than Aryans in Ostafrika, but that vague hypothetical was very different to seeing it written down in black and white.\n\nChewing his pen, Hüttig stared down at the figures, and, after a long time, circled the number of Aryans. Sighing, he began to type up a missive ordering the conscription of all Aryan males in the event of hostilities breaking out, which, of course, they almost certainly would. Although the Germans who had emigrated to Ostafrika, seeking their fortunes on what they were promised was bountiful virgin land had been promised they would be exempt from being drafted, these were desperate times. If they didn't pitch in and do their part to protect Ostafrika from the savages, they would lose their homes, their families, their very lives to the slavering horde. Surely performing their duty to the Reich and to National Socialism was a small price to pay for safety?\n\nEven if it wasn't, it wasn't like they had a choice in the matter. Leaning back in his new chair, Hüttig smirked at the thought. All Aryans should be willing to serve their Reich, if needed, even if they needed a little push to do so. Ripping the completed draft from his typewriter, Hüttig yelled for more cognac."

He'd finally been given an excuse to uncork his last remaining pre-War French vintage, an occasion he had been awaiting for quite some time, as his family had been afforded the honour of hosting Clifford Dupont, newly appointed Kolonialverwalter (colonial administrator, he was able to puzzle out using his shaky skills at German) for Sambia and Simbabwe on his trip down south to Salisbury. Realizing he'd missed his guest's comment, he responded, "Ah, yes, quite."\n\nJames, his wife Marjorie and Dupont were seated at their opulent mahogany dining table in a pool of soft yellow light, enjoying a dinner of roast beef and gravy. Godfrey had been sent to bed already, complaining uproariously as usual. Slaves stood by to refill glasses as Dupont held forth. "Well, I suppose I had to accept, eh? Old Hans is quite the typical Hun and I daresay that without my voice in his ear, or," chortling, "his translator's ear, things would be a deal more hairier for us Brits down here!" Dupont finished his wine and held it behind him, where it was dutifully refilled.\n\nWondering if there was some better way to broach the subject, James asked, "Cliff, while you were in Bouhlerstadt, did you see any indication that the Reichskommissar was building up the military?" At seeing Dupont darken and put down his glass, he quickly added, "It's just that a lot of us out here are worried about the instability that may ensue were there to be, ah, conflict. Moreso than usual."\n\nDupont sighed deeply and frowned up at James. "I won't lie to you, there's a good chance it could get hot, especially out here. I'm doing all I can to talk him down, but Hans doesn't much like listening to anyone who isn't agreeing with him." Following that, the rest of the evening was decidedly subdued, and all retired early.\n\nWhen dawn came, James stood with Godfrey on the plantation veranda, watching the slaves go to work in the endless fields of swaying hemp as Dupont's driver took him away down the driveway in a cloud of red dust. Putting a hand on his son's shoulder, they looked out together into an uncertain future."

Chmielewski and the others were quietly chatting amongst themselves about a strike that had hit one of his new supply depots on the border the day before. Apparently, after slaughtering the garrison like savages, the rebel group that had done it had just left their dead to moulder in the dirt. They were certainly making the list.\n\n"It is complete, Reichskommissar," said Baer, jolting Hüttig from his reverie. Wordlessly, Hüttig snatched the list from Baer's pudgy hand and glanced over it, scowling at the names of the groups and individuals who threatened his rule. The list was to be made public, a propaganda piece to show Ostafrikans the men who threatened their homes and families, those treasonous, barbarous scum who would stand opposed to the Aryan future. Of course, they'd have to remove a few names from the list for the one they sent to their Boer allies. It wouldn't do for them to learn how many of them would someday face the pointed end of a bullet.\n\n"Very well, Baer. I approve. Thank you, gentlemen, you are dismissed." As his underlings filed out of the room, Hüttig rose and made his way to the balcony. It was a cool, refreshing evening, the sun just sinking below the horizon.

Hüttig looked down into the tenebrous verdure of his gardens. Orderly, pristine, pure.

This was his element, and it was showtime.\n\nThe Reichskommissar proceeded to the grand table in the center of this converted meeting hall, upon which a large and impressively detailed map sat, speckled with different icons representing the locations of Ostafrikan forces in the field. A posse of generals stood rigidly at attention around the map, and snapped a salute to Hüttig as he approached. Hüttig swiftly gave a sharp salute in return, as they all stood at ease and got to the business of the day. The business of warfare.\n\n"Gentlemen, let us not waste any time with officialities or pleasantries today. We have a war to fight." Hüttig began, wasting not one moment in arriving to his point. "Currently, where do we stand? What are our vulnerabilities, and where?" he finished, staring at his Generals, as they looked to one another for an answer, following such an unexpectedly rapid commencement of business. "The Zambezi river, sir," piped up an old Generalleutnant. "We have token forces ready to respond to a crossing, but if the South Africans arrive in force, they may break through."\n\nHüttig waved his hand dismissively at the general. "They'd be throwing themselves into a waste of forests and savages. If that's what they wish to expend their forces conquering, then so be it." he retorted, "The Boers have the South Africans nicely preoccupied at this moment. I want to know where we can attack." Several of the generals in the room murmured amongst one another unexpectedly, as if they had never conceived the notion that their superior would have wished to order an attack three minutes into the first meeting of the war. As Hüttig began to deliver an icy vexed stare at his Generals, a Gruppenführer quickly piped in. "The SS divisions 'Verbante' and 'Jäger' stand ready for any operations, sir. You need only say where and when." Hüttig smiled at the response. "Then let it be so!" he replied jovially.

He woke up as early as possible, donning the clothes he had been provided to by those scary men with the masks who constantly walked around the area. His mother never liked them, especially when they hit people with their guns, but ever since they made his father disappear, she always called them the "mashetani giza" - the dark devils. However, none of that mattered now. All Muchoki had to be concerned about was waking up early enough to go to the caves, mine as long as he could, and finally get out for dinner.\n\nHowever, as the day began, young Muchoki knew that something was amiss, especially as dust rose into the air and a line of trucks pulled into the village, sending all of the adults scattering to their homes. A short man got out of a truck, barking and yelling at the mashetani giza. Muchoki's German lessons were going slow, but he could hear him yelling something about the children. It was then that a shiver ran down his spine, as they began kicking down doors, forcefully carrying children into the trucks. Suddenly, with an angry point of a black glove, an older man ordered the devils to grab Muchoki himself, forcing him away from his crying mother and into the back of a truck, as it roared to life and carried him away from his village.\n\nAbdu, Darweshi, Njowga, and a few other of Muchoki's friends joined him in the tightly packed truck, and hours away to a new, loud, and scary place. The Devils ordered them out the truck, and marched them into a dark, concrete room. There, the short man began yelling at them in German, pointing to some smaller versions of what the Devils wore themselves. When they all dressed up, they were marched to a long field where each got a German-made rifle and were told to shoot, and shoot, and shoot, and figure out how to put the bullets back in. If they didn't, they were beat and went without dinner, as Muchoki would learn on his first night.\n\nFinally, after weeks of this cycle, and a bit of learning some more German, Muchoki and his friends were brought on truck out into an open savanna, where they began digging trenches. It was there that the bullets started being fired towards them, and everyone had picked up their guns and shot back. When the big truck with the cannon on top slugged forward, the short man climbed on top the trenches, yelling and screaming, demanding they shoot better or else they wouldn't be fed for a week. It was there Muchoki felt the blood and grey matter splash across his face as the short man's head collapsed upon itself, falling into the trench.

After all, the only danger to a camp this far behind the front lines was the occasional German bomber that slipped through the cracks of the American air defense.\n\nAs the lieutenant finished his thought, he heard the distinctive sound of one of the flying machines, growing closer by the second.

His platoon woozily made their way down out of the fog, but one by one, they began to collapse. Some started to scream, their gurgling shrieks piercing the jungle air. Suddenly, the lieutenant's legs gave way. He tried to stand back up, but his arms and legs jerked uselessly. He tried to scream, but his breath was gone and his lungs would not respond. He tried to inhale, but found his mouth paralyzed. His body spasmed uncontrollably as raw, unfiltered terror rocketed through his brain in its final moments. His mind raced, then slowed, then stopped as he expired.\n\nThe jungle lay silent, the first witnesses to the first deaths of the next stage of war on the dark continent."

When Johnny got back home in the afternoon, the TV was already turned on for a special "Breaking News" segment. His parents didn't even greet him as he came in, and his eyes traveled watch the dishevelled news conference unfolding in Cape Town.\n\n"As of 2P.M. South African Standard Time, we have had reports of a chemical weapon attack on one of our Marine regiments near the Ostafrikan front. The details as of now are undetermined but it is likely that the regiment has all been wiped out."\n\nUpon hearing this, Johnny's mother wailed and retreated into her husband's arms, he himself speechless as the news conference went on.\n\n"Ostafrikan forces have released nerve gas on the regiment and our limited knowledge on its effects means that it would shut down all muscle function upon prolonged exposure. We have no antidotes for their nerve agents as of now and, regrettably, the troops did not have protective gear - as no one could have predicted such brutality and horror at the hands of the Afrika-Schild..."\n\nAlthough the General on the TV blabbered on and on, Johnny could not say a word, as if he had inhaled some of the nerve agent himself.

 GRO_INVESTIGATION.1.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Léopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar Müller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - while he was hunting, which is guaranteed to last for several days, as well as ensuring most of his personal guardas are with him instead of guarding the complex.\n\nNo one noticed the infiltration, and the places have been fully restored after the mission so as to not arouse any possible suspicion. The search had almost proved unfruitful until agent (CLASSIFIED) found a false bottom hidden below a hunting trophy in the middle of the suspect's office. Inside were documents of mostly little value - small bribes and reports from the suspect's own security forces - with a single, important exception.\n\nA contract written in both German and French bears proof of contacts between the suspect and the French general Maurice Challe, currently located in the Free French remnants. The contract details the terms of an illicit transaction between the two: French officers have been "loaned" to the suspect to train his troops in exchange for substantial revenue, probably to be used to cover further illicit operations.\n\nSuch contract is valid proof of military personnel from a hostile power being allowed access to military compounds belonging to the Reich, and therefore to several security documents and military secrets, a conduct violating section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (intelligence activity endangering national security), and punishable by death.\n\nWe advise further investigations on the suspect: while this would be sufficient against common people, the suspect occupies an important administrative position, and as such it is best to gather more material should one accusation be disproved or ignored."

Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar Müller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - while he was on official visit to Windhuk along with several important officials of the colonial administration, scheduled to return in at least three days. At first, the investigation proved fruitless, but when inspecting the chimney, field operative (CLASSIFIED) noticed a stone too clean compared to the others, which were black due to years of smoke and negligent cleaning.\n\nThe stone was removed without damaging the overall structure, and inside the empty socket was a voluminous envelope containing five contracts, written in both French and German: the papers detailed a purchase agreement between the Free French remnants and the Zentralafrikaner administration led by the suspect - whose signature is also on the papers - with the first buying several dozens anti-air batteries from the supplies sent by the Vaterland. Coincidentally, the timing of the contracts matched several reported raids against supply convoys, where those same batteries were supposedly "destroyed by native rebels"\n\nWhat emerges from the contracts - which have been photographed and then put back into their place so as not to arouse any suspicion - appears to be a fraudulent subtraction of military equipment from its intended purpose, which constitutes a violation of section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (sabotage against means of defence), punishable with up to fifteen years in the concentration camps. The covering attempts themselves are false documents related to matters of national importance, therefore violating section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps.\n\nWe advise further investigations. While such allegations are extremely serious, the suspect enjoys a large popularity and several friends in the higher echelons of the administration: having more than one proof is heavily recommended."

The first ones were too few to be considered anything of value, but the more documents they went through, the more it appeared clear that a key section of the colonial budget - the "military expenses" column - has been used as a proxy to hide several large transfers of money: the costs of the garrison personnel, as well as maintenance expenses, have been inflated by several orders of magnitude, but the later reports do not take the received funds into account, indicating their transfer outside of the colonial treasury.\n\nDespite our relentless effort, we couldn't locate the destination of the subtracted funds. However, the documents constitute false documents related to matters of national importance, and therefore a violation of section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps, as well as section 266 of the Strafgesetzbuch (embezzlement), punishable with up to ten years of prison.\n\nWe advise further investigations. While such allegations are serious, the suspect has covered his tracks with surprising ability, implying his employment of expert accountants to make the funds disappear: having more than one proof is therefore heavily recommended."

Unfortunately, the presence of his deputy within the compound made it impossible to gain access to his private chambers, but we managed to enter the archives.\n\nDuring the search for compromising material, agent (CLASSIFIED) found, within the false cover of a book, a list titled "friends of Zentralafrika" and containing several dozens names. While most of the names were either redacted, cancelled or outright ripped from the paper, four names were still legible: two belonged to exiled Belgian entrepreneurs currently residing in Free France, one to a prominent American diamond importer, and the last to an Italian businessman residing in Addis Ababa.\n\nIt appears clear, therefore, that the suspect has entertained close business relationships - enough to consider them "friends" of his administration - with at least four people belonging to hostile powers, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison. Further investigation is strongly advised: due to the important economic ties of the Zentralafrikaner administration, it is plausible that corrupt elements within the Ministry for Colonial Affairs overlook such conduct as long as it brings money to the treasury."

Having infiltrated his private quarters and personal office, left unguarded as the usual security personnel has left together with their master, our operatives began the inspection.\n\nAfter several hours of thorough search, agent (CLASSIFIED) activated a hidden mechanism in the suspect's own desk, revealing small room which contained the suspect's private archives. The folders were arranged in no discernible order - likely an intended security measure - and, with only a little time left before morning, there was not the chance to decipher it. However, in what can only be called a stroke of luck, our operative found a photographic album detailing the suspect's meeting with several prominent corporate suits: while most of them are German, one of them - which has been copied and then put back in its place - shows the suspect shaking hands with a Japanese man in his office.\n\nNot only are the two smiling at each other, suggesting a friendly relationship, but the desk is covered in documents, some of which are written in Japanese. Further investigations have revealed the man to be an important executive from Mitsubishi, one of the major Japanese industrial complexes. From the collected evidence, it appears clear that the suspect has been entertaining business relationships with members of a hostile power, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison.

The place, one of the first restaurants opened in Hitlerstadt, is famed for his excellent service and cuisine, and it is a known secret that Reichskommissar Müller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - has often visited it during his safaris.\n\nBy corrupting a former employee, disgruntled by the sudden termination of his contract, agent (CLASSIFIED) obtained a copy of the restaurant's key, and was able to enter the building after all personnel had left the place. As with most old businesses, the restaurant had an album commemorating visits from important people: as expected, several photos show the suspect drinking or eating, but one of them was especially important, as it showed him in the company of none other than Jacques Massu. The photo - of which a copy has been made - has been taken in the restaurant's courtyard and appears to be very old, as several buildings appear to be still under construction, but the subjects are still clearly recognizable.\n\nThe two men appear to be laughing and in the act of toasting, and their expression is one of great friendship and camaraderie, which means that the suspect has been consorting with an officer belonging to the armed forces of a hostile power, which, coupled with the reported leaks of several security reports from Zentralafrika, constitutes a conduct violating section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (intelligence activity endangering national security), and punishable by death.

It took several hours to put the paper scraps back together, but in the end four documents were successfully reconstructed: three of them were inconsequential - security reports of no use for the investigation - but the fourth proved to be extremely valuable.\n\nThe file -of which a photo has been taken before replacing the scraps back where they had been found - appears to be the rejected draft of a letter sent by the suspect to Patrice Lumumba, an inferior who nonetheless commands a large influence in Zentralafrika. The missive clearly mentions unspecified "services" provided by Lumumba, for which he has received an equally unspecified reward, consisting in "the previously-mentioned exploitation rights in Eastern Kongo"\n\nWhile the exact contents of said services and reward eludes us, this is still proof of a business-like relationship between the suspect and someone outside of the public administration of the Reichskommissariat, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison. While not explicitly punished by any formal provision of the Strafgesetzbuch, this conduct is to be considered especially abhorrent to the Aryan morality as it shows the suspect is granting benefits to inferiors in exchange for bribes of unspecified nature.

The trail has grown cold at the Hitlerstadt Resort, but progress has been made nonetheless, as the team has managed to obtain the register with all the names of the guest who have visited the resort in the last year by bribing one of the employees.\n\nThe reading proved extremely interesting as, alongside the usual German names, several foreign names have been found: while they aren't tied to any rebel or seditious organizations, several - Katagawa, Smith, Aldricci to name some of them - belong to foreign industrialists and corporate suits. While the reason for their presence at the hotel eludes us, it is certain that those people should never have been in Zentralafrika, since the central government has established a heavy embargo on any company or enterprise whose legal headquarters are located within any country belonging to either the Triumvirate, the OFN or the Japanese Sphere.\n\nThe fact that those people, who are emissaries from foreign and hostile powers, travelled to Zentralafrika and resided for several days at the same hotel is enough proof to say that these people had very little interest in a vacation - Hitlerstadt is, in fact, bordering a rather dull quagmire, and very far from the normal safari routes - and way more in establishing trade relationships with the suspect, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison.

Once there, he was able to set up a hidden microphone directly under his own desk, connected to a secret listening station established in an empty apartment near the central compound of the Zentralafrikaner administration.\n\nBefore the batteries powering the device ran out, which requested a second mission to eliminate any trace of our espionage, the team was able to intercept several conversations between the suspect and various members of his entourage. While most of them were of no actual relevance to our case, one of them has given us a glimpse of the suspect's true plans for Zentralafrika: speaking to Rolf Steiner - his most trusted advisor and unofficial deputy during his long safaris - he made several statements of penal relevance, the most important of which was to grant "more freedom of action" to the dozens of corporations running rampant throughout the Reichskommissariat. By doing so, they would manage to "get enough money to cover everything"\n\nWhile the exact context, and especially what they are trying to cover, still eludes our team, this is clear proof of the colonial administration accepting benefits and bribes from both national and foreign businessmen in exchange for a free hand in the resource-rich mines and jungles of Zentralafrika, a conduct violating section 332 of the Strafgesetzbuch (taking bribes), punishable with up to fifteen years of prison.

Even though no personnel was found on board or near the ship's location, this is indeed a very serious finding, especially since the ship appears to be new, in perfect conditions and very recently used.\n\nWhile we have found ample proof of the suspect's incompetence, the presence of a military vessel belonging to a hostile power can no longer be attributed to mere negligence: this is enough to prove that the suspect has helped military personnel from a hostile power enter the Reich and establish a base of operations, a conduct violating section 81 of the Strafgesetzbuch (high treason against the Reich), punishable by death.

Such mess can't be explained merely with negligence or incompetence, and must instead be deemed an indirect defence measure against inspections: our agents were forced to abandon any professional approach, and had to pick folders randomly to examine them as quickly as possible before leaving, to avoid any suspicion.\n\nOne of said documents, however, proved interesting. Hidden inside a seemingly harmless report was a photo showing the French general Jacques Massu, currently residing in the Free French remnants: what was most interesting was not the general himself, but the fact that he was holding - with a very pleased expression - a stuffed lion's head, and behind him was a crate with "Ein Geschenk" written on it.\n\nThe German writing stating that it was "a present" is a clear indicator of who the sender is. Only the suspect has such a "taste" for hunting trophies, something which evidently Massu shares, and no other German would be so bold - or so foolish - to send a present to an officer from a hostile power without protection from above. This is a conduct which learly violates section 100 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Engaging in relations which endanger peace), punishable with up to 10 years of concentration camps.

They appear devoid of any information, lacking both the photos and the personal data.\n\nThe reason why such documents were inside the suspect's central compound eludes us, but not their potential applications. By applying personal data on such ID, anyone could gain entrance to the Free French remnants, a hostile power, and since reports tell of a constant flow of political refugees escaping the French State to join their brothers in exile, it's very likely that they would reach Zentralafrika thanks to the fact that the French State is part of the Einheitspakt: from there, they could receive new documents, and leave for their final destination.\n\nSuch practice would never be allowed to happen without an explicit order from above, which means that the suspect has taken a conduct violating section 99 of the Strafgesetzbuch (working as agent for intelligence service), punishable by up to six years in a concentration camp.

Sadly, we weren't able to discover whether the bottle had been bought by the suspect before or after the embargo was put in place, but should the latter be proved, this could clearly be a case of alcohol smuggling, and it is well known that no one gets such goods if not from the gates of Scotland by paying their government a lot, a conduct violating section 334 of the Strafgesetzbuch (giving bribes) in relation to section 335-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (foreign officials), and punishable with up to 10 years in a concentration camp.

Many similar cases occur in the records, with items from rifles and grenades to tanks and fighter aircraft.\n\nThese indescrepencies may constitute false documents related to matters of national importance, and therefore a violation of section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps, as well as section 266 of the Strafgesetzbuch (embezzlement), punishable with up to ten years of prison. However, they could simply be a matter of lax bookkeeping. The sheer scale of the problem, on the other hand, lends credibility to the former.\n\nWhat is clear is more of an investigation is needed. This is scarcely enough evidence on its own, but it could lead to a far more sinister plot to defraud the Reich. We will find out what is happening with the equipment, and why the accountants in Südwestafrika have become so lazy lately."

Agent (CLASSIFIED) was sent to conduct surveillance of a facility rumored to be a command center for the terrorist group UNITA. For several days, they hid in a concealed location, while they took note of various goings on around the facility. After successfully exfiltrating, our asset was able to give us many interesting bits of information from the reconnaissance, including a photograph.\n\nThis photograph is interesting for many reasons. First of all, despite being fairly well known as an area controlled by UNITA, the area has apparently not been interrupted or disturbed. Operative (CLASSIFIED)'s report states that local garrisons have apparently not visited the area recently, and the photograph shows no evidence of a bombing campaign. This is obviously a huge failure by Schenck's highly vaunted air force.\n\nMore concerning about the photograph is the equipment held by some of the UNITA soldiers. Several soldiers are holding what appear to be LAG G1 assault rifles. These are recent models, introduced in 1958. However, our observations reveal that at least one of these rifles has a metal stock and handguard, making it possibly a G1A1 introduced in 1960, or a 1962 model G1A2. It seems a shipment of G1A1 and G1 rifles had been sent to Südwestafrika to outfit its army, but there is no report on why UNITA seems to have gotten them.\n\nThe worst scenario is that UNITA and Schenck have entered into some sort of agreement where UNITA is given weaponry and left alone in exchange for some sort of cease fire. This could fall under section 202 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Providing Aid and Comfort to the Enemy), punishable by life imprisonment or death. But until a link is proven, it remains speculative. We recommend that more surveillance of UNITA is carried out, as well as more investigation into the Südwestafrika armed forces."

The aim of the operation was to discover evidence of fraud or deceit on the part of Reichskommissar Schenck. Although the results were inconclusive, operative (CLASSIFIED) procured evidence which has added an interesting angle to this investigation.\n\nWhile researching economic programs in Luderitz, the operative discovered a folder marked "Airfield Expansion." The topics weren't interesting, but inside was an interesting photo of something that seems to be unrelated. In the photo, marked only with an identifying serial number, Otto Herrigel, the Economic Minister of Südwestafrika, is seen sitting and conversing with an unidentified native. Our field agent wasn't able to identify the other individual, but our analysts have been able to discover the person's identity. With a high degree of certainty, they believe the native is Sam Nujoma, head of the SWAVO, a terrorist group active in lower Südwestafrika.\n\nAn unauthorised contact with a terrorist group is illegal under section 201 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Conspiracy), punishable by a year in prison. This, however, could lead to a far more serious charge if the nature of the meeting is revealed. If others in the Südwestafrikan administration knew of this and failed to report, they could be charged under section 201-f.

For simplicity's sake, the data was copied and transferred to our headquarters, where it was analyzed. Agent (CLASSIFIED) was able to send us copies of several reports, specifically ones that dealt with Südwestafrikan oil consumption.\n\nWhen investigated, a certain particularity caught our attention. Südwestafrika takes a certain percentage of fuel extracted for themselves, in order to supply their industry and armed forces. This number is supposed to cover only their expended fuel and nothing more. However, the number that we discovered has revealed they are taking far more than they need. Our estimates are that the entire air force and army could be on full operations, and they would not be consuming the fuel they use currently. Something is clearly amiss.\n\nAt worst, this could lead to a charge of Conspiracy to Defraud the Reich, which carries a variable sentence between 5 years and death, depending on the severity, as well as compensation and damages, as outlined by section 212 of the Strafgesetzbuch. It could be, however unlikely, that Südwestafrika has put a system of fuel tanks online and is filling them, with the knowledge and consent of Germania.

This has yielded a large amount of intelligence, most of which is unfortunately mundane. However, one particular conversation stands out amongst the others.\n\nTwo days ago, Wolfgang Schenck had been discussing matters of national security with Field Marshall Hellmut von Leipzig. Leipzig is the highest ranking general in Südwestafrika, as well as the minister of State Security, so it is not unusual that they would be in contact. Neither was most of the conversation, which dealt with bombing raids throughout Afrika. What is unusual is that toward the end of the call, Schenck told von Leipzig that any civilian targets were strictly off limits. Von Leipzig said this was not a problem, but Schenck demanded that he swear that no civilian targets were to be attacked.\n\nUnder Führerbefehle No.45, anything in the Sahara Desert is to be considered an important target. Housing and food stores are mentioned specifically as targets to be hit. Of course, circumstances may prevent every target in the area from being attacked by Südwestafrikan aircraft at this moment. But if they are truly attempting to avoid attacking what the Führer has told them to, the consequences are grave and serious.\n\nUnfortunately, circumstances beyond their control led to the asset having to abandon the wiretapping.

Agent (CLASSIFIED) had been researching the criminal records of various SWAVO terrorists, when they came across an interesting document in the file of Klaus Dierks, from Reichskommissar Schenck, ordering his release from prison.\n\nHerr Dierks is a German-born white resident in Südwestafrika. Born in Berlin in 1936, he had gone to Südwestafrika as part of a course on civil engineering. While there, he joined the native terrorist organization SWAVO and was known to be close to their leader, Sam Nujoma. Eventually, his activities became known to the Abwehr and local authorities detained him. He had been put into the custody of Windhuk Prison, where he was sentenced to indefinite detainment.\n\nRecently, it appears Reichskommissar Schenck took a personal interest in the case and intervened. The letter in Dierks' file was sent from Reichskommissar Schenck last march, and ordered the immediate release of Dierks from custody. It's unclear if Dierks has been released from custody, and if he has been in contact with SWAVO since then, as his file ends there.\n\nSection 118 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Obstruction of Justice) states that pardoning a convicted criminal could be punishable by prison under certain circumstances, such as the criminal being part of a conspiracy which the pardoning member is a part of.

This operation was able to continue for a short while before the wiretap malfunctioned due to unknown reasons and had to be removed. Although short-lived, we were able to pick up one useful bit of information from the operation.\n\nAbout midway into the surveillance, Schenck received a call from Siegfried Müller, Reichskommissar of Zentralafrika. The content of the call is not that interesting, to be honest. Müller calls Schenck out of the blue, and enquires how Schenck is doing. Once initial pleasantries are out of the way, Müller invites Schenck to go along on a hunting expedition that he is planning for the near future. Schenck declines, saying he has extremely pressing matters. Müller expresses his regret. The two talk about a few unrelated subjects before they say goodbye. Müller hangs up first. All in all, the call takes five minutes. A transcript has been attached to this report for reference.\n\nWhat is interesting is the call itself, not the content. Müller and Schenck use informal and occasionally crude language to discuss matters of import, all with a friendly tone. This suggests a high degree of familiarity and cooperation. Thus, it could be extremely likely that whatever crimes that Schenck is commiting, Müller could be an accomplice in, and vice-versa. We therefore recommend this information be sent to the team investigating Müller, to see if they have uncovered any evidence outside of Südwestafrika that would be relevant. Finding out about the "hunting expedition" that Müller wanted to have Schenck join would be extremely important for the investigation."

Based on official reports and some insider knowledge, Agent (CLASSIFIED) was tasked with documenting Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck's schedule and visits in order to establish a profile. Initially, this was a mundane operation, with nothing unusual or surprising uncovered. But the evidence has led the operative to come to a startling conclusion, one that we believe is accurate.\n\nSchenck's schedule is extremely simple. He usually can be found in his palace, or flying his aircraft as a recreational activity. What our asset found, however, is there are occasional gaps in his schedule when he is not doing either of those things. These gaps are not minor, they go on for several days, occasionally. Believing it to be a mistake, our spy asked their sources for more information. There was none. There are times when the Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika is simply missing and unable to be reached.\n\nOne could conclude that these periods of absence is the Reichskommissar shirking responsibility or work. Section 231 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Dereliction of Duty) declares this is punishable by two years of confinement, and more if it is in a combat situation, which Südwestafrika is currently in.

A successful infiltration of the Oberkommando der Südwestafrikan Wehrmacht has allowed access to some detailed after-action reports. Agent (CLASSIFIED) reports there is one event in particular that is extremely interesting for our purposes.\n\nRecently, a supply facility near the city of M'banza Congo was attacked by terrorists, believed to be the Angolan seperatist force UNITA. The small garrison was reported to have been overwhelmed by the surprise attack and the numerous enemy. They were supposedly forced to retreat to a more defensible position, allowing the natives to escape with a massive load of supplies, chiefly medical equipment.\n\nBut our operative reports many things about the story do not add up. The small army garrison reported only a brief firefight before retreating, with no casualties. No rebels were reported killed or wounded. Most suspiciously, a flight of tactical bombers was taking off from nearby Malanje Airfield, bound to attack targets in the Sahara. They could have easily been contacted and asked to help, but they were not.\n\nFrom what we know, the story could have been concocted by native sympathisers in the Südwestafrikan armed forces to explain a handoff of supplies to the enemy. Needless to say, this is a serious crime, and the consequences are dire (Strafgesetzbuch, Section 202, "Providing Aid and Comfort to the Enemy").

Our intelligence indicates there is a substantial amount of rebel activity that could easily be struck by enemy aircraft. And it wouldn't be too difficult to mount a mission in Südwestafrika, due to the large amount of air operations currently taking place, as well as a shorter flight time compared to missions in the Sahara.

This requires the complete annihilation of any facilities or infrastructure located in the area. On first glance of this target report, they seem to be doing just that, logging many airstrikes over the area.\n\nBut a closer inspection raises questions about the airstrikes. Most of them are in the northern desert, sparsely inhabited by anyone and hardly home to any insurgent activity. A smaller number of raids take place in the plains and grasslands to the south, where more natives can be found. Only a few missions take place in the southern jungles, hitting uninhabited places like Borgou. And no raids at all take place upon the coastline, believed to be the main hiding place of the Free French remnants.\n\nIt is unknown why this is so.

 GRO_INVESTIGATION.102.t:0 "Response from Germania"
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.102.d:0 "Reichskommissar Hüttig,\n\nWe have received your report and have studied it in full. And we are appalled by the fact a Reichskommissar such as yourself would debase the office that you hold with such lies and allegations.\n\nThe two men you are accusing are honorable and exemplary members of the NSDAP, with spotless records. Reichskommissar Müller has defended the possessions of the Reich from the Cameroonian menace, and has provided a constant supply of income to the Reich even in our economic hardship. Reichskommissar Schenck is a heroic fighter ace with legendary exploits during the Second Weltkrieg and over Russia, and even now defends the Reich from its enemies in the Sahara. To attack them with such flimsy evidence is nothing short of disgraceful and unbecoming of a fellow Reichskommissar.\n\nThe Kanzlei will decide your fate in due time. A meeting to decide on sanctions for your action will be convened as soon as possible. Consider yourself to be in a precarious position. And prepare yourself for potential retirement or reassignment.\n\nHeil Hitler,\n\nPhilipp Bouhler\n\nChef der Kanzlei des Führers der NSDAP"

 GRO_INVESTIGATION.103.t:0 "An Empty Gesture"
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.103.d:0 "Being the middleman for Hüttig's correspondence with Germania was an unenviable task. Today, that task had fallen on the shoulders of Simon Wissmann, a once idealistic soldier in the Heimat whose transfer to Ostafrika has thoroughly obliterated his initial youthful enthusiasm. He had enlisted to fight the enemies of the Reich and claim more Lebensraum for it, yet here he was trembling with fear as he started to turn the doorknob to Hüttig's office, a fear greater than his father ever felt when fighting in Russia. After all, he knew that if the Reichskommissar was in a foul enough mood, Hüttig would cut him down faster than Yegorov's cannons ever could've. Deep breath, feign more bravery than you'd have to muster when running at a machine gun, and open the door.\n\n"Heil Hitler!" The man shouted at the top of his lungs, saluting in the Reichskommissar's direction as he sat behind his desk. "Herr Reichskommissar, I came as fast as I could. What is the urgent matter you spoke of?" Please, please, please let it be a re-assignment from this hellhole.\n\nIn as foul a mood as ever, Hüttig gestured at a written letter on his table, and spoke in a tone that reeked with resentment. "I want this sent to Germania post-haste." He declared, motioning for Simon to come closer as he continued to speak. "By the peerless eloquence of a true Aryan, I'll convince those stubborn imbeciles in Germania to finally rid me of Schenck and Müller."\n\nPicking up the note, the young soldier skimmed its contents. To his horror, he realized that there was nothing there - nothing of value at least. It was nothing but Hüttig insisting through a meandering word salad to replace his peers across the borders. No evidence, nothing. All his arguments could be summed in one word: "traitors". Simon almost turned pale as he realized not only what the reaction would be in Germania, but also what Hüttig's reaction would be upon hearing the inevitable response. Taking his eyes off the accursed piece of paper, it took all the willpower in the world for Simon to maintain his posture.\n\n"... Herr Reichskommissar, I shall have it sent to Germania immediately."\n\nPicking up the piece of paper, Simon turned around and briskly walked out of Hüttig's office. The sooner, the better, and he definitely did not want to be anywhere near this place when Germania's reply came - assuming they would even bother responding to this."

 GRO_INVESTIGATION.104.t: "A Fitting Punishment"
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.104.d: "He was getting too old for this. Throughout his long and meritorious tenure as the head of the Führer's chancellery, Philipp Bouhler, few things had proven as frustrating as a certain Reichskommissar in Bouhlerstadt. If it wasn't direct correspondence, it'd been someone further down in the food chain having to deal with his requests and accusations.\n\nAs he got behind his desk that morning, few things could've made him long for retirement more than hearing that Hans Hüttig had sent him a personal message, supposed to be the smoking gun that would finally prove the validity of Hüttig's accusations against his opponents. Simply looking at the letter filled him with a tiredness that all the coffee in Kongo could remedy. Nonetheless, he reached for his letter opener and set about to read the letter.\n\nFor all the wrong reasons, Bouhler's sensation of tiredness was quickly removed from his body and replaced at first with bewilderment, then frustration, and then anger. This meandering tirade before his eyes was nothing short of deranged treason! Where there was supposed to be evidence proving guilt, he could find nothing but paragraph after paragraph of rambling nonsense and insistence that essentially based on Hüttig's feelings alone, Germania was to throw out two of the Fatherland's proudly serving Reichskommissars.\n\nFinding restraint, he stopped himself from calling to Bouhlerstadt or even penning a response. Had he done so in the moment, he'd likely just have insisted on giving Hüttig the Sonderbehandlung treatment due to the obvious mental crippling that the sun in Africa had inflicted upon him. No, that'd merely fuel the fool's Jew-like victim complex. A far more fitting punishment would be to simply let his message fester in the rat wheel of the Chancellery's bureaucracy.\n\nAfter collecting himself, he picked up his phone and rung up one of the lowly pencil-pushers at the bottom of the Chancellery's hierarchy. Hüttig was going to get nothing but silence from Germania, and that would drive him up the wall.\n\n"Herr Erhard, I have a letter which I wish for one of your department's clerk's to attend to whenever time allows. Let the man know, this is certainly no urgent matter.""
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.104.a: "And God willing, he'd get nothing but silence from Bouhlerstadt."
 
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.105.t: "A Fool's Errand"
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.105.d: "Simon knew this day would come. When Hüttig realized why Germania had stonewalled him all this time, he'd been sent into a fury the likes of which had rarely been sent before. For what felt like an eternity, the staff in his compound had been treated to furious screams that could've overpowered an artillery bombardment in terms of decibel.\n\nThe other men in the SS quietly wondered what could've caused such fury, but none was stupid enough to enter Hüttig's office while he was in such a fit of rage. Wissman knew why, though, and knowing it certainly did not make him any more eager to deal with Hüttig, having by this point become something of an unofficial secretary to the monster of Africa. Then suddenly, silence. Blissful yet terrifying silence gripped the entire compound after God knows how long he'd been stuck in a fit of rage. Like so many times before, it once again fell upon the young SS man's shoulders to check up on his boss. Only this time, the journey towards Hüttig's office was accompanied with the faint hope that the bitter old bastard finally gave up the ghost.\n\nAs he opened the door, the sight that greeted him was enough to make the young man's eyes widen. Broken furniture, torn books and pieces of paper, and very visible marks on his desk from repeated strikes with some kind of object. Possibly the phone, given the sorry state of that thing. Behind the desk was the sorriest sod of them all. Red in the face, and sadly still breathing. Simon really wanted to leave, but before he could do so the Reichskommissar sprung back to life.\n\n"The fucking treacherous swine in Germania betrayed me! They betrayed me!" Hüttig tried to shout, but at this point his voice was so hoarse that he sounded like he'd gone through all the cigarettes in Zentralafrika in the span of half an hour.\n\n"Herr Reichskommissar, you look unwell. Can I get you some water?", the involuntary intern asked almost out of human reflexiveness upon seeing the man in such a sorry state of affairs.\n\n"Get out! Get out, get out, get out!"\n\nDidn't need to tell him twice. Simon got out and shut the door behind him as fast as a heartbeat, half-worried that the loon would shoot him if he lingered a moment longer. As for Hüttig, he was a broken man. Betrayed by everyone, he had only one hope left. His Führer dead, he had only one choice left: take the matter in his own hands and purge the rot in Afrika."
 GRO_INVESTIGATION.105.a: "Only the Führer himself could have saved me from these fools!"
