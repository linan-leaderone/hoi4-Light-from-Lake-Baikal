 POLITICS_JOZEF_TISO_DESC: "The entire life of Dr. Jozef Tiso, Cleric, a Roman Catholic priest, and President of the Slovak Republic, has been an unparalleled success. From early strides in his education to ordainment in the Catholic Church as a priest, and then a successful career as a moderate politician. It seemed that Tiso was a beacon of hope, a decent and good human being. Yet, by the middle of the 1930s, Tiso's views had shifted toward authoritarian and totalitarian ideas, he had become a radical figure in Slovak politics. Then, when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, Dr. Jozef Tiso was appointed President of the Slovak Republic. Tiso betrayed his own people, buying into the 'Führer-cult'.\n\nAfter the Axis' resounding victory in the Second World War, Europe prospered for a short time, then came the decade of unrest. The Slovak economy, brought down by the German economic crash, had been all but annihilated. Yet, the Slovak government prevailed. In response to increased unrest in the nation, President Tiso introduced further repression against his own people as a mean of silencing all discontent.\n\nBy 1962, President Tiso's health has rapidly declined and shows no sign of improvement. As Tiso's health worsens, many concerned parties within the government have begun to prepare for the incoming event of his passing."
 POLITICS_STEFAN_TISO_DESC: "Though his origins are humble, Štefan Tiso now stands in the center of Slovak politics. Born in the Slovak hinterlands, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during WW1 and later joined the Czechoslovak Legion, returning to his newly independent country in 1920. Later, he became a member of the HSLS, though he endured some criticism within the heavily anti-semitic party, as his wife was Jewish. Tiso earned his Law Doctorate at the Komenského University in Bratislava, became a judge in Trenčín, and eventually was transferred back to Bratislava and became a member of the National Court.\n\nAs the Axis achieved victory in the Second World War and Slovakia was separated from Czechia, Tiso's party, the HSLS, came into power in the Slovak Republic. He became Chairman of the National Court, where he remained until 1944 when he replaced Vojtech Tuka as Prime Minister due to his failing health. Tiso also held the offices of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice simultaneously. As PM and foreign minister, he oversaw Slovakia's entry into the Einheitspakt upon its founding.\n\nŠtefan Tiso is now President of the Slovak Republic, succeeding his distant cousin Jozef Tiso upon his death. While his rule has remained stable, there are rumors of disgruntlement amongst the military. He is also directly opposed by the more radical wing of the HSLS, including those who seek closer cooperation with Germany, such as Alexander Mach."

 SLO_tiso_dead: "Death of Tiso"
 SLO_tiso_dead_desc: "With Jozef Tiso's death the country has been thrown into chaos. The goverment is compleatly paralyzed and the people, starting to realise this, are demanding change. We must act fast to stop any further instability."
 SLO_Chained_Minds: "Chained Minds"
 SLO_Chained_Minds_desc: "To nobody's wonder, free expression of opinion isn't allowed in Slovakia. While some may argue that free speech is undermining goverment stability, and thus its disallowance is fundamental to a functioning state, people aren't very happy about it, as aren't the thinkers."
 SLO_Political_Tensions: "Political Tensions"
 SLO_Political_Tensions_desc: "While Tiso has been our undisputed leader for over 20 years, his health has been declining, as it always does. This, of course, means that everyone involved in Slovakian politics have started vying for power, in all forms possible. And if it wasn't enough, reports about zero resistance activity are appearing to be false..."

 SLO_Agitated_Workers_desc: "While the Republic has been doing quite fine the past few decades, problems still haunt her, such as the workers. Be it low wages, poor working conditions, or just a general disagreement with the goverment, the workers are on constant strikes."
