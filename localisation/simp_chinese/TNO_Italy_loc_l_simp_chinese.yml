Scorza has urged the high profile PNF representatives in Verona to stand down or see their status within the party threatened - at the same time, all party members who will take part in demonstrations in Verona will see their party membership suspended or revoked.

In that square, the first spark of the fascist revolution shone - we must return to that spark, to that revolutionary fervor that burned in the hearts of WWI veterans, of revolutionary syndicalists, of nationalists and of all those who wanted to see Italy and the Italian people achieve the greatness they deserved.

For this reason, Scorza has promised to enact a series of measures to make sure that the all the fascist organizations, from the PNF to the MVSN, from the fascist syndicates to the GIL and the ONB, are brought back to their former glory and efficiency, all under the watchful eyes of himself, the Duce of Fascism."

This will undoubtedly lead to some resistance from the people at the Congress, but we're confident that the majority of them will simply surrender when faced with the prospect of an unwinnable battle - and when the dust settles, everyone will know exactly how Scorza deals with upstarts and rabble rousers."

The glorious saga of Fiume: where poet-warrior Gabriele D'Annunzio set up his state after taking the city by storm, with the eventual goal of integrating the city into Italy. The Carnaro Regency, D'Annunzio's state, was a masterwork of political engineering. Its constitution, the Charter of Carnaro, was the most forward-thinking and advanced set of laws that a nation could hope for at the time.

Fascism lives to the beat of history and changes with the times. For this reason, it is foolish to believe that we can try to suddenly shape the culture, tradition, and spirit of the Italian nation to follow an ideological project. At the same time, we must recognize that the rise of fascism was fundamental to save Italy from the emerging threat of communism at the time, and also brought it to newfound greatness over the decades. Fascism is a historical project that, like any project, changes with the times.\n\nWe, too, shall make our changes, but without disrespecting our past."

All the rest is secondary, as fascism cannot be separated from the figure of the Duce, who should at all times occupy the minds and hearts of any fascist worthy of this adjective. Contradicting the Duce is equal to treason - disobeying the Duce is identical to high treason. All those in Verona will be reminded of these truths, so that they do not get the idea that just as Scorza was put in place after his predecessor was ousted, that means that the same can happen to the current Duce. Obedience, devotion, and loyalty - anyone who does not possess these three qualities is an enemy of the State and of the Duce."

Hopefully, and with a bit of luck, the worst is over, and the situation will be under complete control soon."

Their orders are to restore public order in Verona and make sure any act of insubordination is dealt with, without hesitating to use violence if the situation calls for it. The Blackshirts are notoriously somewhat rowdy, and it's likely that there will be at least some small scale urban warfare, but sending in the MVSN is first and foremost equal to broadcasting a political message - that the people in Verona are betraying the fascist cause, and the most appropriate way to remind them of that is sending the fascist militia after them."

Urban warfare will be almost inevitable, as will be collateral damage to civilians and property, but this is exactly the kind of message the Duce has decided to send the nation.

Once again, their voices are heard, and once again, a new generation of fascists seems to be ready to carry on their legacy.

The voice of Carlo Scorza, the new Duce of Italy, who has now made it clear that he does not intend to follow the path of his predecessor, and who has already shown that his hold on the PNF is indeed solid. The liberals and reformists within the party have been swayed to his side or turned to silence, and from a high balcony in Verona, the new Duce is announcing to Italy and to the world that his reign has begun, and will not end anytime soon."

The consequences of defying the Duce are shown for all to see in Verona - with most of those who were present at the Congress now filling the city's morgues, hospitals and prisons. The PNF representatives at the Congress are already starting to be trialed and purged one by one for treason, and it seems that from now on Scorza will have an almost total control over his party."

Now Carlo Scorza, formerly the secretary of the PNF and now Duce of Fascism, has been accepted by the King as Prime Minister.

While numerous prominent early fascists belonged to the female gender and the early fascist movement asked for more rights for women in their programs, the fascist government's praxis after 1922 told a different story. Women suffered systematic discrimination in work, government, and even education. However, this didn't stop Italian women in the fascist camp, especially among the youth, from demanding more rights and equality - they hope that Scorza's seizure of power might improve the female condition in Italy.

Female volunteers of the SAF will assist the other branches of the Italian armed forces in their tasks, and most of all, seeing women march in uniform together with male soldiers will serve as a reminder of the new age that has dawned for women in Italy."

However, as the GUF proved to be rather difficult to control and somewhat inefficient, it was eventually abandoned. Carlo Scorza has decided to revamp and reorganize the GUF.

This means that each state/colony in the Italopshere will be encouraged to \"specialize\" and focus its economy around a specific sector.\n\nThis will be a boon for several reasons. It will allow each state/colony to focus on what it is good at, rather than haphazardly trying (and failing) to do everything at once. This means that their economies will be more efficient, and thus, it will strengthen the Italosphere as a whole. But most importantly, it means that Italian economic dominance will be assured, as Italy is the only member of the Italosphere with a fully diversified, developed economy. Everybody wins, but most importantly, Italy wins."

The best way to do this will be to enforce protectionist barriers on external countries while reducing or eliminating them for other Italosphere member states.\n\nIn other words, by placing tariffs, duties, and other protectionist barriers on external trade, it will make more logical sense for Italosphere member states to trade with each other rather than external countries.

The Old Guard are a loose group of diplomats and economists who have seen the turmoil of international politics time and again, and chafed under Ciano's weakness in seizing opportunity and dealing with setbacks. Now their star is once more ascendant, and they will do anything required to make Italy a power to be reckoned with.\n\nWhatever the younger wing of the ISPI claims, the old way works. Despotic, extractive, cynical; all may be used for the Old Guard's model, but a top-down colonial empire is best.

But we will walk the tightrope. By maintaining a tense but masterful balance between exploitation and development, withdrawal and investment, we can make our Empire serve us for a century to come.\n\nSuch an approach offers its own challenges. The remonstrations will come at us from both sides, accusing us of stretching Italian power too far or not far enough. It is for this reason that foreign policy is a matter for experts, not the provocations of the hawks and the doves. Time will prove us right.

Yet they do not see that Italy needs to accumulate power now, to increase its international standing, so that we might be able to keep our Empire in the future. We cannot hesitate, and we cannot doubt. Unless we tear down the facade of benevolence which has served us so poorly, we will be overtaken by others willing to be more ruthless, more cynical, and more decisive.

By carefully writing trade agreements and presenting our partners with offers they cannot refuse, we will bring raw resources into Italy at very... competitive rates. The influx of cheap resources will make our industry more able to compete in the global economy, and having opened the sphere's markets for ourselves, we can sell consumer goods back to the sphere's country.

On the contrary, the oil supply allows us to shape our sphere of influence at will, and to show unruly countries how well any rebellious tendencies will go for their people.\n\nThe path forward is clear. Co-opting military and diplomatic 'advisors' to every board of every oil exporter and transporter worth working with, we can feasibly threaten to cut off civilian oil shipping to any country in our sphere which starts to get restless.

But knowing that we cannot bleed our own resources dry, we must look beyond our immediate shores at the countries with a coastline in the Mediterranean. By squeezing economic contracts out of the Italosphere states, making sure they benefit us the most, we will draw on the wealth that is owed to us by our supremacy over these waters.

Yet times have changed, and so have the demands placed on us to achieve our goals. In keeping with these changed circumstances, we will remove much of the regulation set on trade and financial transactions in the Italian sphere.\n\nThe new order of things will pay off quickly. Drawing on our more liberal-minded economists' talents, we will identify precisely which regulations are holding back business and slash them, without any hesitation.

We will neither weaken the state's ability to intervene in economic issues, nor excise it from the economy almost entirely. Instead, we will walk the middle path, and the results of this approach will prove us right.\n\nA guiding principle of the middle road has been aptly summarized by one of our economic experts as 'money where it matters'. By privatizing non-essential sectors of the economy currently under the state's command, but leaving aside many areas that could be of strategic interest, we will make the money we need without throwing aside our mastery of the Italian economy.

Now, however, we face new challenges. We need money, and in divesting ourselves of a large chunk of the public sector, we will acquire that money quickly and easily.\n\nPrivatization is not a simple matter; there will be many details to work out, and we must ensure that the Italian economy remains in the hands of Italian business. Having ensured this, we should go forward with boldness. Being dogmatic and ideological will only harm us in the long run, and in being willing to part with sentimentality now, we will avoid a great deal of trouble in the long run.

Military, economic, and diplomatic - all areas of the greatest importance, and all of which will be strengthened by this move. By reinvesting in the military, we shall make our army once more among the finest in the world, drawing the other global powers' attention.

If an Italian firm wishes to sell back to the homeland, it should not have to deal with petty concerns like 'export restrictions' or 'national sovereignty'. If it wishes to employ people past working hours, then it should not have to meet with inspections. And if it comes face to face with unionisers, we will communicate the duty of the host government to stamp such activity out.

Thankfully, the situation will resolve itself. The Mafias operating in the Italosphere have long perfected the art of mutual benefit, and the positive impact of disregarding illicit trade will not just be abstract.

By encouraging the police to take an active interest in countering subversive activity among workers, we will nip any possibility of rebellion in the bud. Workers will understand that concerns like a 'living wage' and 'safety standards' are irrelevant to their duty. If they do not, then the police will break bones until they do.

We shall have to come to some arrangement with the Pakt, with its immense wealth of resources and markets, and the Duce has expressed his approval for the idea.\n\nNow we must only look at how to proceed. The Megakorps can be bureaucratic and skeptical of innovation, but they have proven adept at making the most of massive economic monopolies. By a number of formal and informal ouvertures to the Pakt, contacting both Reich officials and civilian businessmen, it will be relatively straightforward to identify areas where we can both benefit.

There are a great number of fascist loyalists in the Ministry for Finance, and they will not ask questions when the Duce asks them to create a fund for him. By fiddling with the state budget, overstating national expenses and sweeping some papers under the carpet, the Duce will have at his disposal a significant amount of money, belonging to him alone to share with some close friends. How these funds are used is of no importance. What matters is that if, after long days leading Italy to greatness, the Duce should wish to avail himself of life's pleasures, he shall have all the money he needs to do so.

They found that the reforms, in their words, were \"more imaginary than real\", and seemed designed to \"satiate the Italian public rather than to affect real change\". Though the advisors were dismissed in a huff, they weren't wrong. In the early stages of the Italian spring, Ciano and his underlings had to proceed with the purest caution, lest they tread on the wrong toes and send their nation spiraling into chaos. Now, though, the future seems far more assured. The Fascist Party was won over at Verona, the people have chosen Ciano's vision of the future over the sad nostalgia of Scorza, the inept hallucinations of Curcio, or the madness of Farinacci. From now on, the reforms will proceed, and the true potential of the Italian eagle will be unleashed."

We will shift some of the MinCulPop's tasks to the much more efficient and transparent Ministry of National Education, which will be made into an intermediary between the government and the Italian cultural industry, while finally dissolving this relic of a bygone age once and for all, this is a fundamental step in liberalizing Italian culture and arts."

However, these old horrible times are over. A personality cult will not work well with our nascent democracy, as any party that comes into power will merely wish to restore the Duce to being the leader of Italy. Besides, despite what many may believe, Benito Mussolini was not a perfect man, and he in fact had many flaws. We must move to begin to show the truth of how the Duce is not a God amongst men, but a normal person who does in fact make mistakes.

He's regarded as a sort of savior, a hero for his people, who never did anything wrong. While it's nice for the people to have someone they can look up to, the aura of perfection built around Mussolini has made many people, especially in the uneducated underclasses, instinctively distrust the democratizing reforms of Ciano. If democracy is so great, then why did Mussolini remove it, they wonder.

This, for example, allowed Mussolini to simply change the Statute in order to legally turn Italy from a democratic state into a fascist one. However, many lawmakers and jurists in Italy have pointed out that many laws of the Statute imply that the King has large legal powers in the Italian government, and while historically the Crown has mostly stayed out of the political life (or more recently, was effectively a fancy rubber stamp for Mussolini), these parts of the Statute are a loaded gun pointed directly at our nascent democracy. A functioning democratic state simply can't run the risk of legally turning back into an authoritarian monarchy if King Umberto or one of his successors decide that they don't like the political state of our country, thus, we need to modify the Statute and add safeguards to make sure that the King of Italy can only play a ceremonial and symbolic role, without influencing the political life of our country."

To put an additional safeguard for our democracy, we will create a regime of perfect bicameralism, meaning that the Chamber and the Senate will share the same responsibilities and the same level of powers, that way, governments will need a majority in both Houses to pass laws and change the Statute, making it significantly harder for single parties to dominate politics."

For starters, we shall remove the King's ability to appoint senators; secondly, we will make sure that current senators-for-life (those appointed by the King) have their status removed when the Senate is reformed after the election.

In forcibly repealing the Acerbo Laws, we shall make it possible to imagine an Italy where proportional representation and the will of the people is once more the guiding principle of political life.

He openly admitted that much of what he did was controversial, an abrupt change from the glorious recent past of Italy, tension was clearly hanging in the air as he outlined the sheer change that the PNF, the government and the very country had undergone in his years as Duce.

The first of them to form was the Christian Democrats (or DC), led by Amintore Fanfani, a loose coalition of moderate conservatives, catholics and liberals who stress the importance of accelerating reforms to free up Italy's economy and society, their critics have pointed out, however, that their economic plan would probably spell disaster on Italy's underclasses. To the left, we have the Democratic Front (or FD), led by well known socialist Pietro Nenni, who has managed to take the reins of the leftist movement coalescing it into a single party, the FD mostly wish to liberalize the country's society, while creating a strong welfare state to make sure that Italy's poorest are cared for. The very existence of the PSDI has outraged the more radical conservatives and ex-fascists, who claim it to be a den of communists in disguise. Finally, the party which took the longest to form, to the right stand the National Blocs (or BN), a quite heterogeneous alliance of former moderate fascists (as the PNF formally dissolved to coalesce into the BN), monarchists, and radical conservatives, all gravitating around the charismatic former PNF secretary Giorgio Almirante, who seems poised to continue Ciano's status quo of slow-burn reforms.

Through their dominance over Italian politics, they had ensured that fascism would reign unimpeded throughout all of Italy.\n\nThe Duce knew that any marginally successful attempt at democracy would need to limit the all-encompassing power the party enjoyed over the Italian Empire's politics.

Of course, to begin, he would be required to remove the more extreme proponents of fascism in his party, the hardliners. They shall be cast off into the unknown, and their ideals with them. Then of course, annoyances such as Scorza would have to be dealt with. He had a few, as he called it, \"fun\" ideas in that regard. Finally, the threat posed by the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, or alternatively, the Blackshirts, would need to be eliminated. The militia's efforts were no longer needed, and their desperate attempts to sustain the regime, through harassing and even killing political dissidents only served to hamper any potential growth of democracy in the Italian Empire.\n\nThe Duce perched on a windowsill overlooking Rome. No doubt, this would be a long and arduous task, but in time, the Party would fall. He felt a pang of sadness knowing he would be destroying the very thing that brought him the power he now wields, but he knew that he would be willing to do whatever was necessary to achieve the safety and security of Italy."

 demitaly.20.d:0 "Today, His Majesty King Umberto II di Savoia, King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia, First Marshal of the Empire, has received and accepted the letter from His Excellency Galeazzo Ciano, Count of Cortellazzo and Buccari, First Marshal of the Empire, in which the latter formally resigned his position of Prime Minister of the country. The King has gracefully accepted to preside over the transition period, acting as the supreme executive power in Italy until the elections have taken place.\n\nThis moment marks a historic landmark for Italy, and will forever be remembered as the day when the birthplace of fascism decided to abandon that system, and return to democracy. In the shade of the great monuments of the fascist era, such as the EUR district in Rome, large crowds celebrate the beginning of a new era, which will mean freedom, prosperity and happiness for all.\n\nOptimism is universal at this point, as all major political factions think they have a good shot at winning the elections; the predictions made by media are completely inconsistent, with some polls projecting a victory for the liberals, others betting on the leftists, and a few are even adamant that it will be the neo-fascists who will secure the mandate. No one knows who will win the battle of democracy, but one thing is certain, Ciano, the Duce that ended fascism, has won his own battle."

 cianopartysupport.5.t:0 "The First Election"
 cianopartysupport.5.d:0 "It seems that the Italian Spring has finally turned into summer: the last remains of the fascist regime have thawed, melting away to reveal a blossoming democracy. Such an optimistic prospect, however, might be a bit too naive. The electoral race will be hotly contested, and while for now the prospect of violent radicalism is unlikely to materialize, the vote will reveal large fractures within the Italian society. Three parties have entered the fight, but only one can come out on top.\n\nTo the right, we have the Blocchi Nazionali. Ostensibly a big tent right-wing coalition, the BN is in fact dominated by former members of the PNF loyal to Ciano - the press calls them \"neofascists\", but it's tough to understand exactly how \"neo\" they are. Giorgio Almirante, their leader, is undeniably gifted at politics, and has rallied the vast majority of those who, for a reason or another, wish that fascism never went away. Voting for the BN means voting for status quo, stability, and continuation of policies that have proved successful in the past. A victory for the BN is unlikely, but not impossible - sometimes, in a democracy, the underdog can win.\n\nIn the centre, the Democrazia Cristiana. A coalition of liberals, centrists, and moderates, they designed a vast program of reforms aimed at bringing Italy into the modern age. Focusing on economic development, the DC hopes to abandon the cumbersome leftovers from the fascist era, while still respecting Italy's heritage, traditions and history. The DC are split between a liberal wing and a conservative one tied to the Church, but so far divisions have been set aside in favor of cohesion, and the party rallied behind the charismatic Aldo Moro. The DC attracts votes from the economically liberal but socially conservative upper - middle classes of Italy, as well as from the more Catholic-minded strata of the population. According to media observers, a DC victory is highly likely.\n\nTo the left, last but not least, the Fronte Democratico. Their platform can be summarized in a single word: antifascism. This wider leftist front, crafted by the political skill of former exile Pietro Nenni, sees fascism as the biggest threat to the existence of democracy, and has sworn to fight with all its strength to remove the vestiges of the fascist regime and give Italy the fresh start it deserves. The FD gets its votes mostly from students, for their promises of liberalization of education and press, and from the lower classes, who have been swayed by their promises of a strong welfare state and of policies meant to look after all Italians. It's difficult to estimate how likely a victory for the FD is, but it is certainly a real possibility.\n\nThe pieces have been set, and the game is in motion: the future of Italy will be shaped by these elections, more than it can be predicted now."

With the Italian and Arab populations having lived largely in peace for about two decades now, this new law recognizes the de facto assimilation of the native Muslim population into the Italian administrative unity.\n\nPublic opinion has been mixed about this new development, but the Libyan public opinion generally approved the elimination of one last bureaucratic hurdle that kept them from being considered full Italian citizens.

Each side ended up denying the other's accusation, but it seems that what truly caused this heated climate was leaked reports from ENI, the Italian oil company, suggesting that the Algerian region may be rich in oil deposits.

In urban areas, the operation sometimes resulted in guerrilla warfare as Ustaše supporters were informed about the operation in advance and fought back against the soldiers who came to apprehend them.\n\nIn rural areas, the situation was much worse: heavy fighting has been reported in mountainous regions, in which Ustaše paramilitary groups still control a few hamlets and villages, many of which were either besieged and conquered after brutal combat or simply bombed into dust by Italian artillery fire.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to gauge exactly how much Trolista has actually weakened the Ustaše - while many members of the paramilitary organization have been either arrested or killed, numerous important figures of the organization, including its de facto leader Jure Francetić, seem to have vanished into thin air, escaping the grasp of Italian and Croatian forces."

The then Minister of Foreign Affairs and now Duce Galeazzo Ciano was supportive of Mussolini's decision to give refuge to the escaping masses, and many of them were dispersed across the vast reaches of the Empire. However, many still live in refugee camps and temporary structures, many of them located in the Governorate of the Levant.

It seems that our efforts have borne fruit, as the Indian government has agreed to sign a trade agreement between our two great nations, which will surely improve our trade issues."

 itaintro.19.t:0 "The Indian System"
 itaintro.19.d:0 "Italy and India have never been particularly close, an isolation re-enforced by distance and opposed politics. Still, in some ways, the Republic of India is not too distant from us. They are a second-rate power, with few friends and many enemies. Despite this, we have both stood tall in a hostile world. We are not as powerful as the Reich or Japan, but we are still a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHowever, much to the chagrin of many fascists here in Italy, they are not fascist. The intellectual basis for the continuation of the fascist regime is that a relatively isolated power such as ourselves can only stay alive through a strong, ordered nation, casting away pretensions such as individualism and democracy as detrimental to the ultimate goal. India, in contrast holds free elections, lacks a corporatist economy, and is not culturally constructed around a staunch sense of nationalism.\n\nYet, somehow, they are powerful, and Nehru's government is quite stable, on par with us and on par with the world. How could this be?"
 itaintro.19.a:0 "Perhaps men are not tired of liberty."
 itaintro.20.t:0 "Indian Ocean Wind"
 itaintro.20.d:0 "Chairman Mattei looked from the windows of ENI's headquarters building in Dubai, a modern, shiny building made of glass and steel, but still somewhat influenced by the rationalist style typical of fascist architecture. From his office, he could enjoy an eagle's view over Dubai's port, and there he saw a large ship, from which many men, not too dissimilar from ants at this distance, slowly disembarked one by one. The first ship of workers from India had arrived.\n\nDubai is a strange place: envisioned by the fascist leadership as a shining city in the desert, it rapidly became a fiefdom of ENI when staggering amounts of oil were discovered in the area. Fueled by the oil fever, Dubai kept growing, and its expanding oil and naval industries are ever thirsty for more man power. Thanks to the new trade deals between Italy and India, new and marvelous opportunities of profit will be realized in Dubai, much to the benefit of both our great nations."
 itaintro.20.a:0 "Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai."
 itaintro.21.t:0 "Trade Deals With Japan"
 itaintro.21.d:0 "To the east, the ocean gleams, shining with opportunity. While our relationships with Germany might have gone sour, our friendship with Japan is still as strong as it was when the Tripartite Pact was first signed in 1940, despite the recent and troublesome events that shook the two great Empires. The most natural solution to reinvigorate our economy would be a renewed trade compact with Japan, allowing us to exchange oil and manufactured goods for cheap resources extracted in the Sphere, which will serve to fuel our industrial expansion.\n\nA team of diplomats, including representatives of ENI hand picked by Enrico Mattei, has started to negotiate the exact term of these accords with representatives of the Rising Sun, and it seems that an official visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ino is going to take place in Rome soon."
 itaintro.21.a:0 "Trusted friends are always nice to have!"
 itaintro.22.t:0 "Roman Evenings"
 itaintro.22.d:0 "The Sun sets over Rome, its rays playing with the branches of the cypress trees that line the Appian Way. The cobblestone road seems to stretch eternally in the hills that surround the city, as it once did when Roman legionaries, merchants, peasants and emperors walked along it. Now the Appia Antica is much more quiet, and only two people are walking on it, talking quietly in a perfect French, the language of diplomacy. After all the fanfare, the politics, and the crowds, the Duce proposed a tranquil walk among the Roman ruins of the Appian Way to conclude the last day of Japanese Prime Minister Ino Hiroya's official state visit to the Italian capital.\n\nAs the sound of cicadas is heard faintly in the background, Ciano and Ino find themselves more and more involved in their informal conversation, which started from personal themes such as tastes in music and theatre - but rapidly took much more melancholic undertones. As the first stars begin to appear in the evening sky, two men realize more and more that perhaps, even if separated by oceans and continents, they are not much different from each other. The burden of ruling an empire on the brink of catastrophe, threatened by outside enemies and torn by internal fights, the extenuating task of being forced to commit ever more morally dubious acts of realpolitik, the ever present terror of the possibility that in the end it was all for nothing: such things cannot be easily shared. But perhaps, in that Roman sunset, as the cicadas sung, two men found some peace, even if it was just for a passing moment."

 itaintro.23.t:0 "The Nagasaki Trade Compact"
 itaintro.23.d:0 "A new commercial agreement was signed today in Nagasaki by Italian diplomats and representatives from Japan, Manchuria, China, Guangdong and several other nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Perhaps an event not attracting as much attention as the naval exercises or the state visits, it however far exceeds them in importance. Both nations stand to benefit from the new trade compact, as it allows freer circulation of goods and capital in the Indian Ocean, thus linking the vital resources possessed by the two empires."
 itaintro.23.a:0 "Here's to profit!"
 itaintro.24.t:0 "Our Success With Japan"
 itaintro.24.d:0 "An Italian ship sails into the port of Tokyo. On its deck are hundreds of containers. Some carry the goods that are famously Italian - wine, motor scooters, the like. In others, machine parts and grain. Only a few hundred metres away, barrels of oil are piped out of Italian tankers. Italian oil, extracted from North Africa, now fuels the Japanese Army from Manchuria to Bengal, offsetting the need to exploit the relatively limited Sphere reserves.\n\nBut the success does not stop here.\n\nNo, it goes far further! Italian ties and suits fly off the shelf in the Mitsukoshi department stores. Italian cinema dominates Japanese theaters. An \"Italy Fever\" has seemed to have swept Japan. It certainly will not last, but it still proves just how quickly our new friendship has come together. Still, the most important effect of our new success is the cash that returns to Italy, to Italian artisans and Italian manufacturers. This new cash will help in the rejuvenation of our economy, and will help propel us into an Italian century!"

The Egyptian sun is as ruthless as it always was, but in recent times something has changed indeed: more and more ships pass through the Canal with each passing day.\n\nJapan, India, China, Australia, Thailand: Suez is turning more and more into a true Babel of languages and races, all passing through under the watchful eye of the Regia Marina.\n\nSince the conquest of Egypt from the British, Suez became the jugular vein of the Italian Empire, the one passage that connects the Mediterranean with the rest of the world's waters. Italy's monopoly over it is a vital asset for the Empire, and thus it should be no surprise that the place is one of the most heavily fortified regions in the world, dotted with military installations, bunkers, outposts and fortifications.\n\nLosing Suez is synonymous with losing the Empire, and everyone of some importance in Italy's government knows that perfectly."

For this reason, we must be able to rely on our armed forces, which have always been supporters of Ciano's vision: increasing their budget and giving them more emergency powers should the situation in the country or in the empire go down a dangerous path.

Sure, many of these reforms won't even have a real effect on the lives of most Italians, but they sure won't pass unnoticed: the liberals have asked this merely to test just how far Ciano and the other fascists are willing to go, to see if their newfound love for democracy is real or a farce. Immediately, many close advisors to Ciano have criticized these demands as illegitimate, saying that all further liberal reforms should be postponed to after the elections and discussed in Parliament.

The objective of the operation is nothing less than to secure the entirety of Algeria within a short time period, at which point an attempt will be made to force the Iberian government to renounce all claims of controlling the country.

An economist and journalist suspected for his anti-fascist sympathies, Pirani was taken under Mattei's protective wing and made into his right hand man for Algerian affairs. Pirani has numerous contacts within the FLN and prominent diplomats on the Iberian side, especially Portuguese ambassador Alberto Moreira - and has become one of the most outspoken advocates for a diplomatic resolution to the Algerian crisis. By negotiating with Pirani's help, we might avoid a pointless war, and find a much more profitable and convenient solution."

Bringing workers from Italy would be costly and time consuming, but there already numerous Iberian citizens living as settlers in Algeria - by drafting large scale employ plans to allow Iberian settlers to work in ENI wells and pipelines would foster economic cooperations between the two countries, making both richer in the meanwhile."

Giorgio Almirante is of course our man, and in response to these agitators he will make a speech to the country denouncing them and calling for unity.

 ITA_Giovanni_De_Lorenzo_DESC:0 "乔万尼·德·洛伦佐的掌权震惊了许多意大利人，但并不像人们想象的那么突然。德·洛伦佐出生于一个有着悠久军事传统的家庭，他曾在第二次世界大战中进行了杰出的战斗，后来他进入军事情报局（SIM），在那里，他在工作中表现出了惊人的才能，负责镇压叛乱和整个帝国的情报行动——最终，齐亚诺注意到他，不久，这位年轻的将军最终被提拔为SIM的首脑。\n\n然后，德·洛伦佐真正的工作开始了。德·洛伦佐把SIM重组成一台高效而隐秘的机器，用来做齐亚诺的脏活——收集情报，孤立和打击政敌，其中包括OVRA和其他法西斯组织——并在齐亚诺的反法西斯计划中发挥关键作用，这些都远离公众的视线。在齐亚诺即将去职之时，领袖发布了最后一个命令：“独奏曲”计划。计划确定当意大利民主进入危机时，发动一场快速政变，并设立紧急政府，计划在国家试图恢复法西斯主义时将立即被激活。\n\n现在，在国王的批准下，德·洛伦佐将军被任命为首相，领导一个他任命的内阁，负责保卫意大利的民主。为了将意大利从她自己手中拯救出来，需要做出一些牺牲，消除强硬派和极端分子，限制自由，扩大武装力量，这些都是为了确保齐亚诺的愿景得以实现而付出的代价。民主是一个有很多含义的词——在德·洛伦佐的思想中，民主必须确保法西斯主义、社会主义和颠覆活动的诸多威胁被消除，以及意大利人民团结起来为祖国和国王而奉献。"

 lorenzo.1.t:0 "知识就是力量"
 lorenzo.1.d:0 "Giovanni di Lorenzo knew a lot of things about a lot of people. And this would be the basis for Piano Solo, for to know certain things about people's connections was to wield tremendous power over them. Curbing radicalism, at the end of the day, was simply about unravelling these connections and blackmailing whoever needed to be blackmailed to learn more. And once a solid picture was built, Lorenzo would know exactly which pressure points to use to bring a whole edifice of conspiracy and rebellion crumbling to the ground. Perhaps Italy would never know the debt she owed to men like him, or perhaps it would learn of them and look the other way. It did not matter, for the cause was correct. Many would like to think stability is built on the consent of the ruled, but consent was overrated. Fear worked just as well."
 lorenzo.1.a:0 "He would know, and he would watch."
 lorenzo.2.t:0 "正式的氛围"
 lorenzo.2.d:0 "To know was well and good, but it was not enough. In order for Piano Solo to achieve its objectives, it would need an air of formality and sufficient official authority to act without being questioned. Of course, everyone involved understood that it would not do to refer to the full extent of the plan out in the open. This would only invite accusations of authoritarianism and subversion. All Lorenzo needed was some measure of official approval, of nods from the right people, and of eyes shut where they needed to be. He also needed men to work with, and this an official status would provide. Then, with the assurance provided to the SIM, he could begin to construct his web."
 lorenzo.2.a:0 "Italy would owe them a great debt."
 lorenzo.3.t:0 "Approach the Foreign Governments"
 lorenzo.3.d:0 "The Piano Solo cannot work alone. The SIM needed foreign assistance, Lorenzo knew, and he was willing to make such contacts as necessary with the delicacy and secrecy that the situation required. He was not a diplomatic expert by any means, but was informed that the United States of America and Japan had a common interest in the stability of the Kingdom of Italy. They would certainly not hesitate to help Rome curb radicalism and fight subversive activity, whatever it took..."
 lorenzo.3.a:0 "Our foreign friends will help us."
 lorenzo.4.t:0 "无声的需求"
 lorenzo.4.d:0 "We have been approached, in a manner typical of a delicate request, by the Italian government (or men acting on behalf of it). The Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence body, has asked to trade information we possess on Italian nationals in return for information they have on American citizens. Naturally we have approved the request, and informed them we would be open to cooperate in future in the interest of European stability and anti-subversive intelligence."
 lorenzo.4.a:0 "This will help build Italian democracy."
 lorenzo.5.t:0 "A Subtle Request"
 lorenzo.5.d:0 "With a subtlety not entirely typical of the Italians, the Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence service, has approached us to request an information exchange. In return for information we possess on certain Italian citizens, they will give us useful information on the whereabouts and activities of Japanese in which we already have an interest. Naturally we have approved the trade, and look forward to further collaboration that will help stabilise and strengthen the Italian state."
 lorenzo.5.a:0 "This will help build the Italian nation."
 lorenzo.6.t:0 "Watching Industry"
 lorenzo.6.d:0 "Lorenzo's training and acquired skills allowed him to see things others did not. Where simple men would look at an industry boardroom or factory line and see people doing their job, Lorenzo could make out a potential subversive from a while away. The socialist menace had never really been washed out of Italian industry, even with decades of Fascist rule, and Lorenzo knew that under the surface lurked a beast waiting to tear the foundation of the economy in two. It was for this reason that industry had to be watched, lists of leftist elements made, and plans for dealing with subversion drawn up."
 lorenzo.6.a:0 "The wheel would keep turning."
 lorenzo.7.t:0 "Controlling Culture"
 lorenzo.7.d:0 "Extremism is not borne out of thin air, out of some combination of individual pathology and external circumstances. Extremism is rather something of a virus, and it spreads above all through culture, which has been far too lenient on subversive thought for far too long. Lorenzo understood that to control a culture was to control a country, and if the media was not willing to police itself, then it would have to be controlled by someone willing to do so. To accept anything less would be to leave the germ of extremism intact, with inevitable results to follow."
 lorenzo.7.a:0 "Control what they watch and hear."
 lorenzo.8.t:0 "An Unfortunate Accident"
 lorenzo.8.d:0 "An incident has taken place which could potentially harm the execution of Piano Solo should it become public knowledge. A dissident editor, who had voiced very negative views of the SIM's cooperation with the media, has become infected with anthrax. Naturally to imply any involvement from any actor linked to Piano Solo is an absurd provocation, designed by subversive elements to destabilise the Italian social order. Nevertheless, we must now cooperate with the media further to ensure that the story does not spread. Due to the fear unfortunately sparked by the incident, it should not be very difficult to make them see our way."
 lorenzo.8.a:0 "These things happen."
 lorenzo.9.t:0 "Preparations for a magic trick"
 lorenzo.9.d:0 "Setting up a magic trick takes patience, timing and skill. We possess all of these things in abundance. Though reports about who is involved cannot be confirmed, suffice to say that some troublemakers living in Italy today will not be here tomorrow. They will not die, nor will they turn up in a jail cell. They will simply disappear.\n\nA magic trick, without an audience or applause."
 lorenzo.9.a:0 "Only shadows."
 lorenzo.10.t:0 "Le Scomparse"
 lorenzo.10.d:0 "Extremism in Italy has suffered a setback it will not recover from. A number of people have disappeared; or rather, it would be more accurate to say that they were never there. Figures appearing in doorways, snatches of screams, and scuffles in the middle of the night have all been rumoured, but none of these rumours has been proven. The only thing that is known is that the disappeared will not be coming back, and Italy is the better for it."
 lorenzo.10.a:0 "Gone."
 lorenzo.11.t:0 "Dealing with the Army"
 lorenzo.11.d:0 "Extremism lurks everywhere; the armed forces are not an exception. Luckily for us our friend in the Army, Borghese, has always been dedicated to rooting out subversion wherever it stems. He shall not hesitate to do so when it concerns the men under his command. Whilst we could act to quell extremism in the Army ourselves, it would be better to turn over the information we possess to Borghese, who will do the job better than we could. For after all, why make a job complicated when the solution is so simple?"
 lorenzo.11.a:0 "Discipline will be maintained."
 lorenzo.12.t:0 "Our Friends in Finance"
 lorenzo.12.d:0 "Some of the more paranoid types among the subversives we've encountered in the country possess a strange image of the workings of power: that there is some cabal of corporate giants, politicians and secret service heads who secretly rule Italy. The world is much more complicated than that, of course, and our friends in finance are motivated by nothing more than securing stability and prosperity for all. Those wanting Piano Solo to succeed have connections all across the spectrum, but the finance types are the most beneficial in terms of funding. These relationships will have to be kept smooth, and mutually beneficial, so that the friendship we have built in serving Italy will last."
 lorenzo.12.a:0 "Such friendship is a fine thing."
 lorenzo.13.t:0 "Assurances of Normality"
 lorenzo.13.d:0 "Cesare Merzagora, one of our many faithful supporters in the political class, has been given a difficult task. With the unfortunate demise of the newspaper editor some days ago and some of the actions taken to implement Piano Solo, some of the plan's backers have voiced concern that the measures taken go too far. Merzagora's job is to assure the doubters that whilst such events may have seemed cruel or destabilising, the way forward for Piano Solo is far more benign. They need only trust in his word, and let the structures put in place do their job. More complaints and doubts, however, will not help anyone."
 lorenzo.13.a:0 "All of this is for Italy, after all!"
 lorenzo.14.t:0 "Speaking with the Monarchists"
 lorenzo.14.d:0 "In fulfilling the political objectives of Piano Solo, we have sought out and spoken to the Monarchists taking part in Italy's democratic life.

Exotic documentaries on the remote corners of the empire, thrilling love dramas, and gossip about celebrities and socialites. But this evening, they saw something they had never seen before on TV - a political debate.\n\nIn a modestly arranged television studio in Rome, three men sat on uncomfortable looking plastic chairs, exchanging fulminating looks as a journalist interrogated them on various topics. Answering to a question on his economic program, Aldo Moro, with a slow but determined voice, said - \"...we do not say that the state should control all economic activities, but the state, in the complexity of its powers, should not preclude individual initiatives, but it should coordinate, discipline and orient them...\"\n\nQuestioned on the more openly socialist points of his agenda, Pietro Nenni, with a fiery and uncompromising tone, answered - \"I shall be blunt, socialism is nothing more than to bring forward those who were born in the back ranks!\" Finally, Giorgio Almirante, asked about his opinions on fascism and democracy, answered with a sly smile - \"I was born and raised under fascism, and I believed in it so much that I excused or ignored all its mistakes. That is my past, our past - we cannot deny it. We should strive to let its valid aspects stay alive.\" As families and households around Italy had their eyes fixated on their TV screens, everyone, even the children who could barely understand what those three old man suits were talking about, instinctively knew that this was merely the start of something far bigger."

With the recent wave of liberalization, many of the most active members of the new Italian parties and political associations belong to the gentle sex - and their political affiliation may be surprising. Carla De Paoli, director of one of the most widespread BN newspapers, The Italian, has published a heartfelt appeal to Italian women - to reject the siren calls of the rising feminist movement, and rediscover the profundity of the their traditional role as queens of the households and keepers of the hearth.\n\nStill, by far the louder voices come from the left. Lina Merlin, a prominent member of the PSI and a candidate for parliament in the FD, has become the face of the Italian feminist movement, campaigning in favour of egalitarian laws in matters of divorce and inheritance, the full abolition of state-ran brothels, and founding the Unione Difesa della Donna, a lobbying organization reuniting numerous pro-feminist organizations across the country.\n\nThe centre's answer was not long awaited. In a heartfelt speech before a DC rally, Tina Anselmi, a rising star of the Catholic movement, has stressed the need for Italian women to advance alongside the rest of the country, advocating for equal opportunities on the workplace - with fairer wages, more social security, and better schooling directed at women in the rural parts of the country. As many Italian women and girls feel that for the first time they've been given a voice, now the world of politics wonders how they will use it."

 itaelections66.3.desc:0 "The young generations have always been politically active in Italy, and as fascism attempted to channel the energy of youth into the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti and similar organizations, Italian university have a tradition of being involved in the country's political life. Predictably, many Italian youngsters were attracted by the promises of liberalization of culture and academia offered by the left, and with Marxist and socialist literature spreading like wildfire, organizations like the Italian Socialist Youth Federation, the Movimento Studentesco, and a plethora of others are swelling their ranks at an impressive pace, and the first rivalries between different strands of socialist and communist ideologues are already starting.\n\nTo every action, corresponds a reaction - and from the right, the reaction did come. Reforming the old GUF and other fascist era organizations, the University National Action Front or FUAN are rapidly gathering under its aegis all the right wing students of Italian universities. Slowly but surely, the influence of the far right on the youth is showing in unexpected ways - in Milano, a sort of somewhat openly neo-fascist youth gang was formed in Piazza San Babila, near the city centre. Watched with suspicion by even the BN, the \"sanbabilini\" are already starting to be associated with petty crimes and disturbances in the area.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly due to the radicalism and idealism typical of youth, the centre has managed to attract a fair share of young men and women too. Azione Cattolica and other Catholic movements, which even the fascist regime couldn't touch, are now becoming more important than ever - using Catholic strongholds like the University of the Sacred Heart in Milano as their headquarters, it's hard to tell how much of their recent growth is due to genuine conviction or to opportunism on the students' part."

 itaelections66.4.desc:0 "Italy has always been a diverse place in matters of culture and language, and the annexation of vast amounts of land in World War Two did nothing to ameliorate the issue. Now, in every corner of the country, minority populations are celebrating the return of democracy as the end of fascist oppression, that consistently denied them the right to speak their language and practice their culture. En masse, numerous upstart politicians from South Tyrol to Libya are joining the ranks of FD - and new organizations like Val d'Aosta's Union Valdôtaine, led by Séverin Caveri, and Malta' Partit Laburista, led by Dom Mintoff are allying with the leftist coalition, hoping to secure equal rights and government aid for their communities and regions, often neglected by the fascist regime.\n\nA prominent strand of movements, however, often wary of leftism espoused by FD, have begun gravitating towards DC instead. The most prominent of these are the Südtiroler Volkspartei, led by Silvius Magnago, and the Seznam Slovanov led by Engelbert Besednjak - representing the German and Slavic communities in South Tyrol and the Italian eastern marches respectively. Focusing on economic and administrative autonomy, they often represent the conservative and liberal minded upper and middle classes of their respective regions.\n\nOf course, the Italian right wing immediately saw the various minority movements as a major threat. The Blocchi Nazionali are already launching propaganda campaigns aimed at Italian communities in regions like Trieste, Dalmatia and Libya, decrying the encroachment of minorities against the rights of Italians. Throwing fuel on the fires of the somewhat tense ethnic relations, the BN have begun to sway several Italian communities on their side, and they might have strong electoral results in these frontier regions."

As Italy is on the path to the elections, many prominent military figures, especially those in the upper brass, have expressed favour for the BN - a party portrayed by propaganda as the great defender of Italian greatness against the rising tide of leftism and foreign interference. The Blocchi Nazionali are spending a great deal of its campaign efforts towards swaying the military electorate and key people to its side, and so far it seems like their efforts are paying off.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that all of the military is in favour of Almirante and his group. A few among the older and more prestigious members of the Italian armed forces, including legendary general and Marshal of Italy Giovanni Messe, are openly proclaiming their support of Democrazia Cristiana. Wisened by age and experience, these veteran generals and officers are wary of the BN's hawkish rhetoric, especially after all the bloodshed of World War Two and the following conflicts that cost so many Italian lives. Proclaiming the need for the Italian army to be used as a force of peace, not war and aggression, their calls are being heard by more and more with each passing day.\n\nA somewhat similar trend has been developing among the common soldiery and younger officers. Also tired of the seemingly wanton way past governments have put the lives of Italian soldiers on the line, many among the lower ranks of the troops have begun to be attracted by the pacifist agenda sponsored by FD, calling for a gradual disengagement from many Italosphere countries and a reduction of military budget. This tendency is still relatively minor, but it might begin to have greater importance in the future."

 itaelections66.6.desc:0 "The fascist dictatorship harshly repressed independent trade unions, replacing them with state-controlled organizations in which the workers had very little say. Now, as the country democratizes, new unions have risen, usually with a close alliance to one of the electoral coalitions - unsurprisingly, the FD have rapidly managed to make large headways into the working class electorate, and two major unions have now been formed - the Italian General Confederation of Labour, or CGIL, and the Italian Labour Union, or UIL, both supportive of FD. Already gathering a large amount of supporters, CGIL and UIL seem poised to be FD's first line in their struggle for workers' rights.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that the working class has rallied under the socialist banner. The other major trade union in the country, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions or CISL, is openly pro-DC, and has managed to gather strong support among the more Catholic minded strata of the working classes. Its bureaucracy and inner workings closely tied to Democrazia Cristiana, CISL enjoys the Church's support and has begun to campaign for resolving the trouble of the working class through dialogue and mutual understanding, letting labour and capital work together for a brighter future.\n\nFinally, there are also a few minor trade unions, much smaller in size, controlled by the BN - most notably CISNAL, or Italian Confederation of National Workers' Unions. Decidedly controlled by the BN, CISNAL doesn't seem to have gathered much following among the Italian workers - indeed, much of the BN's platform regarding this issue has had decidedly anti-union tones, painting CGIL, CISL and UIL as dangerous dens of bolsheviks and as slackers who do not wish to work."

 itaelections66.7.desc:0 "In a country where the overwhelming majority of the population is Catholic, it should be no surprise that the Church holds a great deal of political influence - this is even more true in Italy's case, as the Holy See itself finds its home in Vatican City, a microstate surrounded by the Italian capital. Predictably, the Church has enjoyed a great relationship with Democrazia Cristiana, the only openly Catholic major party and one which draws its roots into the many Catholic organizations the fascist regime could never quite suppress. Much like the Church itself, DC too oscillates between progressivism and conservatism, as the party has adopted the social teachings of the Church and turned them into a political platform.\n\nDespite the Church's overwhelming support of DC, there are a few dissident members of the clergy that have different ideas. Mostly coming from the lower ranks of the ecclesial hierarchy, priests in major cities of Italy, often those from the most socially and economically downtrodden areas, are more or less openly declaring their support for FD hoping that they will help resolve the many issues of the poorer strata of urban Italian society. As small numbers of Catholic intellectuals also are attracted by FD, it seems like Italian Catholicism might be more red than one could expect.\n\nHowever, the forces of reaction and conservatism are still strong in the Church. In many rural parts of Italy, the local parishes and churches are not merely places of contemplation and worship, but also a focal point of virulent anti-Communist propaganda. Conservatives in the Church, in both the upper and lower ranks, are often wary of DC's reformism and openness to dialogue with FD, and the more national conservative minded areas Blocchi Nazionali are exploiting this wave of reactionary resurgence."

However, given Italy's multiparty system, even a tiny party might be able to tip the scales of the political system. One such party is the Italian Liberal Party, or PLI, led by Giovanni Malagodi. A decidedly pro business party, enjoying close tied to Confindustria and other organizations that represent the Italian industrial and economic aristocracy, the PLI has a largely conservative and centre-right platform - and, out of a shared distaste for FD's communism and mistrust for DC's progressive policies, might be drawn to support the BN.\n\nAnother minor Italian party of some importance is the Italian Republican Party, or PRI, led by Ugo La Malfa. A party with an ancient and noble tradition, including several important names of Italian anti-fascists, the PRI calls back to Mazzini's vision for an Italian state - campaigning with a decidedly reformist and progressive platform, balancing liberalism, rejection of communism, and civic nationalism, the PRI has been drawn towards DC, creating a working relationship with the Catholic party out of overall similar agendas.\n\nFinally, a small but certainly very loud party is the Radical Party, led by Marco Pannella. A strongly liberal and pro-civil rights party, loudly campaigning for women's emancipation, anti-racism, homosexual rights, pro-choice legislation and other hot themes of political debates, the Radicals have been drawn towards the FD because it's the only major political force willing to entertain them on such themes - even if, ironically, the Radicals are a staunchly pro free market and economically liberal party."

The most probable winner, according to early analysis, is the centrist Democrazia Cristiana - a party born out of long-standing Catholic organizations which the fascist regime could never fully dislodge due to their deep ties to the Church, DC is a decidedly centrist party, finding a wide support base among the middle classes, many Italian Catholics, and political moderates.\n\nClosely behind in electoral projections is the coalition known as Fronte Democratico, a leftist big tent gathering numerous organizations to the left of DC. Chiefly formed out of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the Italian Social Democratic Party (PSDI), FD is the direct continuation of anti-fascist exile and underground organizations, which although greatly weakened by the regime, never stopped being active. The FD receives a lot of its support from the lower classes of society, mainly workers and farmers, as well as students and the Italian youth.\n\nFinally, the underdog of the race are the Blocchi Nazionali, a right wing coalition. Largely formed out of remnants of the PNF, the BN oscillate between conservatism, nationalism, and outright fascist rhetoric. A strongly divided movement kept together by the charisma of its leader, Giorgio Almirante, the BN enjoy support from traditionalist minded regions of rural Italy, former fascist bureaucrats and politicians, as well as a small but very vocal minority of young fascist students."

As celebrations are already underway in the many circles and associations affiliated with the party, a smiling King Umberto II has entrusted the candidate of DC, former law professor Aldo Moro, with the position of prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy, asking him to form a cabinet as soon as possible.\n\nIn spite of the DC victory, some internal issues are still to be resolved. The broad voting base of DC inevitably means that numerous different currents have formed inside the party, ranging from moderates and conservatives, tied to the world of the business, finance, and the Church itself, to a much more progressive wing represented chiefly by Moro himself and by his right hand man and ally, Amintore Fanfani. Several issues divide the party, mainly regarding the possibility of a some sort of accomodation or alliance with the Fronte Democratico.\n\nDespite the still somewhat uncertain details of the future Moro government, Italian society has reacted with optimism to the recent DC victory. Confindustria, the Italian confederation of businesses, has expressed their hope that DC will be able to lead to increased prosperity for Italy and its many industries, while everywhere in the country many wonder if DC will be able to keep its promises of improved economic conditions and wages. With all these questions still open, Italy has now entered a new phase of its history - one that is hopefully going to be characterized by peace and democracy."

A congress of the Italian Socialist Party, the dominant force in FD and the party led by Nenni himself, has already been called to find a strategy to solidify the coalition's hold on Parliament. A rising voice inside the party, that of respected politician Giuseppe Saragat, head of the Italian Social Democratic Party, is pushing for an alliance with Democrazia Cristiana, Italy's largest party and main opposition group to FD.\n\nOpposition to Saragat inside FD mainly comes from the leftmost ranks of the PSI, which is rallying around the charismatic Enrico Berlinguer. With various sections of the party threatening to split themselves from FD if their demands aren't met, it is hard to predict what Nenni's tenure as prime minister will look like, but one thing is certain - the Blocchi Nazionali and their affiliated associations have sworn fierce opposition to FD, and have proclaimed their willingness to combat their new government in Parliament and everywhere in Italy.

 ita.1.t:0 "The Situation of the Italian Empire"
 ita.1.d:0 "Italy's great gains in the Second World War seemed to promise a new awakening to the broken kingdom. Along with Germany, Italy would ascend to the ranks of global superpowers, masters of the world, the largest empire known since Rome, spanning Algeria to Syria, the Alps to the Horn of Africa. Yet fate is a wind, a gale that changes course at the slightest provocation. When Germany threatened Swiss independence, the aging Duce Mussolini correctly predicted that the end of the friendship that had conquered Europe, Africa, and Asia was past it's time. The final straw came when the Germans, assailed on what seemed like every side by the resurgent Russians, attempted to force Italy into a war it had no part in. In a fury, Mussolini severed remaining ties with Germany, and as a final insult to Hitler, opened the Empire's borders to Jews, Roma, and any other 'undesirables' hunted by the Nazis.\n\nYet not all was well within the Empire. As the Duce aged, his mind grew more and more erratic, and the Empire nearly fell into infighting as Mussolini privately declared his plans to abolish the monarchy to his son in law, Galeazzo Ciano. Ciano proved himself a hero of the Empire when, against all odds, he convinced the Duce to spare the King, ensuring stability. Not a year later, the Duce died. Galeazzo Ciano was thus sworn in as Duce, and nearly immediately began to liberalize the country, pulling it away from the path Mussolini had taken it.\n\nThough a dedicated fascist, Ciano is an Italian first, and has claimed to recognize the failures within fascism, and promises reforms. Reformists see him as a democrat bringing down a corrupt system from within, moderates see him as a pragmatic fascist doing whatever it takes to keep his home alive, and hardliners, lead by the ideologue Carlo Scorza, see him as a traitor to their ideals.\n\nThe Empire stands on a precipice. Will Ciano succeed in his reforms and bring freedom to the people that demand it so, or will Scorza win out in the end, strengthening Fascism's grip over Italy?\n\nThe winds of fate have left Italy at a crossroads. Whether they take Ciano's road or Scorza's, the country must move forward."

 scorza.2.d:0 "When the war-hero Generale dalla Chiesa was called into the office of Il Duce, Carlo Scorza, he had no clue what he was to be tasked with. After dalla Chiesa saluted his leader and was allowed a seat in one of the luxurious armchairs across the grand desk, he was immediately subjected to a rant about loyalty to Italy and the Fascist Party. He described to dalla Chiesa how as they speak, party traitors are planning a meeting in the city of Verona, a so-called Second Verona Conference, in which they will conspire to overthrow him and push Italy into degeneracy. As he spoke, Scorza went from calm to almost seething with rage as he slammed his fists against his desk. He then gave a simple order to the uneasy general; an order to end this convention through the use of military force by any means necessary. Scorza soon dismissed dalla Chiesa with a proud salute, calling him a trusted friend and loyal patriot.\n\nAs dalla Chiesa left the building, he couldn't help but question the sanity of the order and of Il Duce himself. However, he quickly decided that such thoughts were treasonous, as it was his duty to fulfill the orders to the end. After all, politics is for the politicians and obedience is the role of the army. With that out of mind, he began developing his strategy for eliminating the traitors. After the conference in Verona begins, an armoured military division, veterans of the war with Turkey, will arrive into the town and place it under martial law. Hopefully, they will be able to quickly find the perpetrators, who will be dealt with soon after. Dalla Chiesa sent his plan out to his subordinates that afternoon, while also sending a message to Scorza promising a quick and easy end to the enemies of Italy."

Although they are preparing to go into an Italian city, they see it as no different from the small villages in the Middle East which they so recently ravaged. They are here, not to protect the people, or to keep peace, but to annihilate the enemies of Il Duce and those who dare defy his authority. The false fascists that flock to the city are nothing more than treasonous rats, ready to be exterminated by the heroes of the empire.\n\nAll of a sudden, the orders are given, and the veteran soldiers begin their march into the streets of Verona. They are escorted by the finest tanks and armored cars available to the empire, armed with the most modern firearms, and carrying enough ammunition to last a hundred sieges. As they enter the city, families shut their doors, shops close, and mothers herd their children inside in fear of trouble to come. They are only greeted by a small group of policemen who try futilely to deny them entry, claiming the army was violating their jurisdiction, only to be beaten and arrested. The soldiers soon reach the center of the town, and as if in some statement of their authority, set up their headquarters in Castelvecchio, or the old castle, which acted as a military fortress in the Middle Ages. The mayor of Verona, after receiving a personal letter from Il Duce himself, has given a speech to the residents announcing that the army is taking control in order to promote safety, and must be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nHe was found dead the next day, the official cause being traitors poisoning his wine."

The protesters, who appear to be mostly young adults and students, are against the army imposing martial law in the city. By blocking their movement with barricades and their own bodies, the students believe that they can stall the soldiers for just long enough that Rome would recall them out of frustration.\n\nThey were wrong\n\nBy now, the soldiers were getting annoyed. As they became restless, the officers in command began rationalizing that the protesters were just as traitorous as the men they were brought here to put down, so the students must be treated as enemies of the state. Soon after such discussion, the citizens that were safe behind locked doors gasped as they witnessed hundreds of their fellow Italians being beaten senseless by the aggravated infantrymen. Tanks roared to life, unafraid of rolling over anybody foolish enough to stand in their way and advanced forward. No one stands in their way anymore, and the occupiers are now free to fulfill their duty to Italy and Il Duce."

So it has been decided that they shall march on the college and force the people that consider it a safe haven to see the might of Italy. As the trucks rolled out into the courtyard and the soldiers deployed in the hallways, the students actually attempted to put up a fight! By using stones and sticks, the young adults sought to deter the invasion. The soldiers responded by firing machine guns into the crowds, mowing down all who were foolish enough to oppose them. Even when they started to run, there was no mercy as the soldiers chased them down and either beat or shot them.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the capture, Scorza is said to have turned bright red, for the University of Verona was founded by him just a few years ago. Scorza soon ordered that the actions of the army be covered up by the media, as any knowledge of what happened would surely end with him being thrown out of office. But it had to be done, for the stability of Italy."

At this point, they realized that they were in a warzone, just like the Middle East. They were here to fight and to kill the enemies of Italy, and they were to go about it the only way they knew how.

As the weapons loaded and the soldiers faced the protestors with weapons at the ready, the young rebels didn't flinch. They held banners telling them to go home, and held torches that have began to symbolize the people of Verona who oppose the army's actions in the city. A standoff was taking shape, and as an officer warned the people to disperse, they simply yelled back petty insults. At this point, the officer gave up and ordered the 133rd to open fire.\n\nThe turrets of the tanks fired shells that destroyed buildings, and rifles cut down the screaming rioters. The protesters were cut down like wheat at the harvest. As the army advanced, they began firing at not just those with banners and torches, but anybody they came across. Everybody there became guilty of association, even children, and the punishment was death.\n\nAs news of these events reached the ears of city officials, they realized that the city really was a victim of invasion. As such, a secret order was passed down to muster a militia consisting of policemen, veterans, and young men to try and repel the occupiers. It was clear the military was seeking a fight, and Verona was prepared to give them one."

If and when the army comes to put an end to the conference, they will have to battle the people of Italy who stand against tyranny and oppression. They will wage war with those they swore to protect, and they will spill the blood of their brothers.\n\nAs expected, the military came to put an end to the treason. And when they encountered an armed militia, they didn't even hesitate to put them down, each and every one. If a sniper was in an apartment, the tanks simply leveled the building. When an improvised explosive was encountered, they forced the onlooking civilians to walk through and clear the path. Even as the treasonous rats fired back and killed some of the brave sons of Italy, the soldiers only grew more angry. Entire stores burned, and ancient churches dating back hundreds of years crumbled into dust. The wrath of the 133rd was unmatched, and they slaughtered their way to the building where the true traitors lay, conspiring against Il Duce. There, they wait for the order to end this, once and for all."

The army quickly apprehended them, only to discover that one had a bomb hidden under his coat, ready to deliver one last message of resistance. Luckily, fate blessed us this day and the explosive failed to go off. In order to make sure no such things happen again, the officers decided to forgo a trial and ordered a quick execution. They were left in the building as the soldiers barricaded the windows and exits and lit the building on fire. Forgetting that it was a bar, the army quickly departed as the alcohol caused a rapid combustion, leading to surrounding buildings burning. The flames spread and spread, and eventually most of Verona was aflame. The 133rd evacuated the area before any harm could come to them, and one commander made a remark stating that the burning of Verona was justice for the city's betrayal of Scorza and Italy."

Even the soldiers, now able to see the hell that they have created, can no longer find justice in their actions. In Rome, the few high ranking government officials that have knowledge of the military's actions now see who Carlo Scorza is, and what his intentions are for Italy.\n\nAn anger is burning brighter than the flames engulfing Verona, as everybody who can see the reality of what happened now boil with rage. The false dictator who labels himself Il Duce is nothing more than a coward, and his actions have seen nothing but pain and suffering. His opponents will remember this.

The truth is, they are mostly fabricating excuses and creating stories to justify the disaster and the numerous massacres committed by the Italian military.\n\nRome's official response to the international outcry has been that the city was plotting against the state and Il Duce, and as such, had to be put down. When the army came to enforce the peace, the civilian population rose up and declared rebellion. The military acted justly and with proper authority in handling traitors to the state.\n\nBut regardless of opinions, speeches, or the lies of Scorza, the truth can be found in the hundreds of butchered citizens and thousands of burned bodies buried in the rubble. The orphaned children and abandoned hospital patients could speak of the terrible atrocity committed by their own people, if only anybody would listen.

They instead believe in ideals of autonomy, local rule, and other such liberal nonsense. This absurd notion must be put down immediately, and our ever loyal general dalla Chiesa is the man for the job.\n\nThe plan is simple, land soldiers and tanks in the colonies, shoot anybody who disagrees with our glorious leader, and burn any villages supporting the rebellion. Our navy will stand ready and threaten any foreign nation attempting to support the traitors, and our air force will obliterate them from above. As our brave men move alongside the coast and clear out the rebels, we can replace the incompetent governors with new people entirely loyal to Il Duce. And, when complete, we shall double the local garrison to ensure future revolts never even occur.\n\nAlready, our boys are landing on Libyan beaches and arriving into the dockyards, ready to serve their nation.

Hoping to avoid another Verona, the goal is to eliminate the use of vehicles and tanks and instead use ground soldiers to accomplish our task. By arresting and executing these rats, Scorza will finally be free to rule Italy as he sees fit, without anybody telling him otherwise.\n\nThe opposition has consolidated around many members of the lower house of Parliament, and as such it will be a good move to shut it down and arrest anybody suspected of treason. Special forces have been deployed to handle the delicate matter, and are expected to come into contact with the troublemakers soon. If all goes to plan, this maneuver will be smooth and simple, and little blood will be shed.

It was decided that him and his personal guard of blackshirts will storm the Chamber of Fasci after the soldiers clear out the building.\n\nAs the barricaded doors blew open, Il Duce emerged with his entourage. He moved up to the floor, with the confidence of a Roman general, and gave his speech. He denounced the treasonous activity and gave every member the last chance to declare their loyalty for the Empire and be spared his wrath. All the people there chose not to bend the knee, and instead sat in solidarity, unwilling to give the dictator the satisfaction. In disgust, Scorza gave them one last mercy; a chance to plead their guilt and have the honor of being able to execute themselves. When again, no one moved, Scorza began screaming at them in rage, announcing that they would all be put down like dogs.

Despite his best efforts, however, the Duce was unable to convince them to support him now.\n\nSpeaking to press a few hours after the meeting concluded, Ciano did not mince words. 'These gentlemen seem to be unable to accept that the world is changing around them. What worked in 1921 will not work today, and the solutions needed to fix our immense problems can not be found by looking into the past - but forward into the future.'\n\nCarlo Scorza, leader of the anti-reform block had no good words for Ciano either.

'They are proof we can improve the condition of working people while staying true to our Christian roots and values.' Moro and Fanfani were similarly pleased with Ciano: 'When Mussolini passed away we were fearful for the future.

With five minutes until the countdown clock would reach zero, he observed workers scurrying to complete the launch procedures while his brainchild's upper stages were being filled with nitrogen tetroxide fuel. Two decades ago, he had been a pioneer of the emerging field of rocketry, helping to design the missiles that bombarded Britain in preparation for Operation Sealion. After the war, his future had looked bright. Germany, fresh from an unlikely triumph over the Allied word order, now had turned its gaze towards the stars. But then, less than a decade later, Germany's economy collapsed, and with it fell the German dream. Armin knew where the wind was blowing, and after much deliberation, he and his family fled across the border to Germany's new rival. Il Duce knew that space would be the next frontier for competition between the great powers, and sought for Italy to develop space launch capability of its own. Armin brought with him the secrets of German rocketry, and under the wings of the newly-established Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, he would begin to design a new family of launch vehicles. Now, years of labor were about to pay off. The Europa 1 rocket that stood in front of him was merely a demonstrator, as its three stages could only put a measly ton of payload into Low Earth Orbit, and could not launch payloads to a greater altitude. For now, that would be enough.\n\nSirens blared as the countdown reached its last minute. The workers scampered into the bunker as the Europa 1's stages pressurized. Armin waited as the moment of truth approached. Finally, with a flash of light and a tremor that, from this distance, shook the control room to its core, the rocket lifted off the pad, and ascended to the heavens. In only a few minutes, it escaped the Earth's atmosphere and boosted its payload into a stable orbit, two hundred and fifty kilometers above the Earth. The San Marco A, as the satellite was called, was quite primitive, containing only a radio transmitter and a sensor to measure the concentration of charged particles in the ionosphere. Still, it would be noticed by any ham radio operator beneath it. A day later, the Italian government announced that it had become the fourth nation to launch a satellite into orbit, and proclaimed that even the Earth's gravity well could not stop the flame of the fascist revolution.\n\nBut their work had only just begun."

This launch vehicle was an evolution of the Europa 1 design, having been fitted with a fourth stage that would allow it to boost about a hundred kilograms of payload into geostationary orbit. A small margin, but one that would be sufficient for the mission at hand. This Europa 2 rocket would carry into orbit the San Marco D satellite - the last of ASI's initial forays into spaceflight. Once in orbit, the rocket's fourth stage would boost the payload to an altitude of twenty five thousand kilometers, right in the middle of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts. For Germany's moonshot, they would be easy to compensate for, as it passed through them in the span of a few hours, but keeping a satellite in an orbit that permanently intersected them would be a different challenge altogether. The San Marco D carried instruments to measure the density of the energetic particles trapped within the belts, along with their effects on electronics. The satellite operated for one week before suffering a catastrophic short-circuit and shutting down completely. However, the data it yielded would be invaluable to not just the Italians, but to satellite operators around the world. With this success, ASI continued to the next milestone of its project."

Over the next two years, ASI would use it to test the viability of using satellites to transmit not just radio communications, but television and even cinema. Many futurists had speculated about the possibility of creating a network of communications satellites in geostationary orbit for civilian use, and now, the Italians were attempting to bring one into existence. However, the satellites that would be required to construct such a network required a far higher payload capacity to geostationary orbit than the Europa 2 could provide. A new rocket would be required to complete this project. Fortunately, work was already underway on Italy's next launch vehicle. One that the entire world would take interest in."

 ita.126.t:0 "Debut of the Europa 3"
 ita.126.d:0 "Armin Krüger stood inside the control room of the jackup barge as ASI's latest creation underwent preparations for its first flight. The skies were overcast, though the weathermen believed that the launch could proceed without significant risk. Seven years ago, he had watched Italy's first orbital rocket take off from this very facility, an event that had given hope to the lesser powers of the world. Now, he hoped that Italy could change the world again.\n\nThe Europa 3 that now stood on the launch pad was a radical improvement over its predecessors. Possessing a two-stage core design that could place seven and a half tons of payload into Low Earth Orbit, the Europa 3's standout feature was its modularity, as it could be augmented with an optional third stage and up to four solid rocket boosters. Fully augmented, it could place as much as eighteen and a half tons of payload into LEO or seven and a half tons into geostationary orbit. This upgrade was necessary, as spaceflight had long moved beyond the lightweight payloads that had flown in the early days of the Space Race.\n\nAs the countdown approached zero, Armin waited, fearful of the consequences if Italy's latest venture suffered an unexpected setback. Fortunately, the rocket took off without a hitch, its four RX.2 engines propelling it through the gray layer of clouds above the platform and out of sight. A few minutes later, the Europa 3 finished boosting the Sirio-2 satellite into its geostationary orbit. It was to be the first proper communications satellite launched by Italy, servicing the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Over the next few years, more would follow.\n\nThat would not be the most important outcome of the launch, however. Only a few days after the Europa 3's maiden flight, ASI made a surprising announcement: It would allow third-party operators to launch their payloads into space, and provided a range of prices for the various configurations of the Europa 3. Many nations and commercial satellite manufacturers alike began placing orders for ASI's launch services. This was the beginning of a commercial revolution in spaceflight that would transform it, as for the first time in human history, private entities and second-rate powers would have access to outer space."

The fossil is that of a plesiosaur, an ancient clade of gigantic, long-necked marine reptiles that were the apex predators of the Mesozoic ocean. This new species, named Adriatisaurus emiliani after its discoverer, is thought to be a close cousin of the world-famous Liopleuridon, and prowled the ancient Adriatic about 155 million years ago in the late Jurassic.\n\nThis expedition has excited paleontologists across the world, as it suggests that the Adriatic may contain countless other fossils.

 ita.139.d:0 "Private Roberto gazed at the mountains before him. Growing up in the city of Niza, it would be impossible to not have seen the towering stone formations from a distance, far past the plains and forests which surrounded the city. Normally, patrolling the mountainous terrain was a break from the grueling exercise he would be subject to back at his assigned base - the biggest thing he had to worry about here was carrying the weighty Beretta rifle stored on his back.\n\nNowadays, though, walking the Alps was an exercise in disgust and fear.\n\nIt was no secret that the world was in utter chaos; the Reich had fallen to civil war, and the Nazi empire was quickly crumbling before them. That wasn't what disgusted him. To be honest, he was quite happy that the perfidious Germans, the ones that built the monstrosity of a dam, were once again enjoying sweet karmic retribution.\n\nThe newspaper had been keen to print out issues about the blazing Burgandianian advance into France. It was said that they fell even quicker than in World War 2; that now Paris and swathes of former French territory were now under the firm grasp of the Shadow State. Most people didn't really pay the news much mind: they were more concerned about their latest paycheck, or the most recent news about the state of their local bread prices. Roberta could not enjoy the luxury of not knowing, however.\n\nNow, every day he was assigned to patrol those damned mountains, he would encounter horror on a scale he didn't know was possible. Every day, he would encounter yet another wave of French refugees, most riddled with frostbitten gunshot wounds, barely alive. Those that did make it past the high peaks of the Alps frequently found themselves collapsing near the border, a scant few being dragged to something resembling a medical center, and then subsequently sent further inland for questioning. Most, though, were found gathering flies on the border, gunshot wounds riddling their battered corpses.\n\nEvery day he walked those mountain trails, he would be tasked with burying them in an unmarked ditch."

At this point, he was quite resigned in the face of whatever fate had in store for him. He sighed before donning his wide-brimmed straw hat, unlocked the truck's door gently, and stepped out into the desert.\n\nHe was stepping onto the carcass of the bright blue sea: Mare Adriatico. Often he dreamed of the days he'd spend out alone with the Sea and the Sky and the net, muttering lullabies to the gentle wind. Now, his days fishing in Venice were over and his livelihood came from driving through a desert of broken dreams for hours on end, delivering supplies to refugee camps.\n\nAnd oh, what the past had held. He'd eagerly joined the Fascist party in the 30s and still took immense pride from the fact: A loyalty that was rewarded - in a way - by the new Duce. The Job he held was a government one for which he was thankful. Still, the Duce was not the only man in the Party. Back home his own brother steadily aligned with Scorza's clique, and even he himself was swept away by the man's rhetoric and promises of a return to some glorious past. Yet as much as he enjoyed the debates and thrills of Rome's politics he knew full well that neither man could fill the Adriatic sea.\n\nGiuseppe's clothes stuck uncomfortably to his skin. At the head of the stopped convoy, a small circle of drivers and passengers surrounded the scene, blocking his view. He pushed into the commotion and was greeted with the sight of two corpses - no larger than teenagers, lying in the shade of a well-dusted wooden raft. Two German refugees that were left to rot in the sun after fleeing from the camps of Emanuele."

While the Balearic Islands would prove crucial as staging grounds and forward bases against the enemy, the fall of Algeria would leave the door open to Libya and from there to Sicily.\n\nDe Lorenzo was contemplating what they could do next to regain the upper hand when Federico d'Aquino, who had been assigned to take charge of the defense of Algeria, moved forward with a jerk and raised his hand, \"Excuse me sir, but do we still have the option of pulling our troops still in the region? We had six divisions and dozens of independent units in that theater.\" The umpire rubbed his chin thoughtuflly, \"General d'Aquino, to answer your question: yes, although I must add that two of those divisions are not considered incapacitated and cannot be retreived.\" The younger commander nodded gravely, and with a motion of his hand to two of his adjutants, returned to the war room high command had designated for use in the simulation.\n\nThe umpire quickly conveyed the little of the message that remained and departed while the collection of generals broke into cliques of twos and threes to discuss their tasks. De Lorenzo surveyed them all with a mix of pride and worry, but reminded himself that despite the mistakes that had been and were likely going to be made, there was no better place to make them then in a game.

He had spent the entire day sitting in a hot truck, all to only end up arriving at a tiny village located quite literally the middle of the Algerian desert.\n\nOnly somewhat able to relax on the worn fabric of the seats, he instantly fully alert when the truck jerked to a stop after so many hours of endless sand. Stepping out, even the annoyingly bright sun was unable to obscure the destination of their voyage through Algeria - just under the horizon, a group of small buildings, most no more than simple huts, was seen in the distance.\n\nHe, along with a squad of Italian soldiers, had come this far simply to capture - or kill - one individual: a partisan fighter, named the \"Defender of Algeria.\" A well known resistance member, no more than 30 years old, the terrorist had tormented the Algierian garrison for months. Responsible for organizing raids on critical supply convoys, as well as the ringleader of the sporadic firefights near Italian military bases, the man had been a major thorn in the garrison's - and Rossi's - side.\n\nWhat had led them to his exact location, though, was an unprecedented escalation on the part of the partisan - he had made the grave error of directly kidnapping three Italian commanders after a particularly successful raid on a transport convoy. Through some effort on the part of the local Italian intelligence team, Rossi's squad were able to track the location of both the rebel and his hostages, leading the them to this exact village.\n\nExplaining as such to the small squad of men that had arrived with him, Rossi started his march to the settlement - rifle in hand."

 ita.143.d:0 "After what had seemed like an eternity, Rossi and his squad finally reached the outskirts of the small settlement. The village itself, already unappealing from a distance, was no more attractive from up close. Mud bricks and torn fabric lined the most of the constructions present in the village, cracks showing and wood splintering under the pressure of time. Just before he and his squad were able to enter the village proper, however, Rossi noticed a glimmer of light in the distance. Focusing his eyes, he realized - it was a squad of Iberian soldiers, with vehicles to match!\n\nConfirming that he did in fact see the distinctive green and red of the Iberian flag, he motioned to his men. \"Hold, men. I've spotted Iberian forces\" As per protocol, he was now required to attempt to hale the Iberian forces and inquire as to why they were present in these Italian territory. There had been designated a specific frequency on the radio for this purpose - of course, decided after weeks of back-and-forth between Iberian and Italian radio officials. Unbuckling the radio on his belt, he communicated, \"Unidentified forces present in Talmine, this is the Italian garrison, please identify yourself.\"\n\nQuickly getting a reply, \"This is the Iberian Garrison, what the hell are you doing here? This is Iberian territory.\"\n\nRossi was flabbergasted. Yes, they were near the border, but this was clearly part of Italian Algeria! \"I'm sorry, since when is this Iberian land? This village is harboring an active terrorist, and we suggest you do not interfere in our efforts to capture them.\""

The terrorist in question has directly taken valuable personnel hostage, and we shall do whatever is necessary to return them, regardless of Iberian objections.\"\n\nWith a crackle, the Iberians replied. \"Considering the size of this village, I don't suppose there really could be anyone else.\" Pausing for a moment, the voice continued, \"However, this individual has directly stolen essential supplies from the Iberian occupation zone, and as such, we request you do not attempt to once again interfere with our retrieval of material assets.\"\n\nRossi, stifling a curse, responded. \"Did you not hear what I just said? We are actively retrieving personnel!\" Nearly shouting, he continued, \"We cannot wait for you to finish retrieving your equipment hidden God knows where!\" Thinking for a moment, the cause for the sudden hostility - on Italian territory, no less - dawned on him. Just months ago, Italian soldiers had 'borrowed' Iberian equipment found in the wreckage of a successful partisan-led convey raid, much to the dismay of the Iberian garrison. Despite the Iberian claims that the equipment was \"necessary for the continued safety of Algeria,\" no equipment was ever returned. Turning to his second in command, Rossi postulated his theory. \"They're worried that we'll steal their equipment,\" Rossi explained.\n\nTaking in the thought for a moment, the Corporal gravely replied, \"They're not going to let us through as long as this isn't a joint operation between the two of us.\""

Easily identifying the targeted building, Rossi quickly made his way into position along the brown wall of the structure.\n\nA faint sense of worry in his stomach, he gave the command.\n\n\"Breach.\"\n\nPrivate Romano, clearly excited for the occasion, immediately kicked down the door with a deafening crack and plunged into the room, with the rest of the Italian squad in close pursuit. Expecting a firefight, the group instead were met with nothing.\n\nInside the dimly-lit single room of the building, neither the terrorist nor the hostages could be found, only the misty dust of the recently-destructed door. That is, until the recently-created hole opened just a small bit more. The room, becoming ever slightly more light, revealed the hanging corpses of all three missing officials, illuminated by the faint orange rays that had begun to make their way through the ruined doorframe.\n\n\"Dammit,\" Rossi muttered, shortly before the Iberian soldiers likewise met them in the tight room."

Just years ago, he was the Duce of Italy, the sole leader of the State! And now, look at him. Being sentenced like a common criminal, told he was a traitor! He, as well as his legal team, had valiantly put up a defense against the bogus claims of Scorza, using every trick in the book to get him acquitted, or at the very least, not killed. Alas, such trickery would not save him. A sweat running down his brow, he readied himself for the final sentencing.\n\n\"As such, you are hereby sentenced to 3 counts of life imprisonment.\"\n\nCiano remained silent. What was there to say? He had lost. Everything that he had attempted to improve during his reign - the Triumvirate, the Party, Italy - it would all be erased. His achievements would be struck from the record, one by one, until the only memory of Ciano would be of a failed tyrant.\n\nAs two stern-faced policemen began to handcuff Ciano, he began to laugh. The silence of the courtroom was broke, the chuckles of the deposed Duce echoing throughout. Oh, how ridiculous this was! Jerked forward, the daylight of the outside approached - his laughter only amplifying.

It was one of the best decisions he had ever taken while drunk, Pertusio thought.\n\nIt was a clear morning in Genoa when a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the office of their mayor. Pertusio stood on a stage before them surveying his audience. Those assembled before him were somewhere between bemused and angry. They had all heard of their mayor's break with the PNF by now, and they wanted answers. Though worried about their reaction, he decided to make his defense. As he spoke, his temper worsened as he remembered just how much damage the accursed fascist system had done to his city, and his voice raised in tone and became louder until it echoed through the square.\n\n\"We Italians have, since the establishment of the German hegemony, blamed the Germans for our misfortunes. But you all will do very well to remember that it was Mussolini's repulsive ideology that got us into this mess in the first place. You know that I was never all that interested in fascism - the only black robes I know are those of clergymen. But I can't pretend to care about it to serve Italy anymore, not when its mentally deficient policies have plunged the whole world into darkness, overextended our country, and demoralized its people. I just can't. I won't bow to a fasces ever again in my life.\"\n\nAs Pertusio finished his tirade, he heard applause and looked up. To his surprise, the people of Genoa actually approved of his angry diatribe. A shout came up from one of his officials in the square, a man who to his surprise was now openly wearing a pin of the Democrazia Cristiana. \"What're you going to do now, then, Signore Podestà?\" Pertusio set his chin. \"Don't call me Podestà anymore. I'll not accept that filthy title. If I am to serve this country ever again, it'll be as a man elected by the people, the way it used to be in the good old days. But until that time comes I'll not bow and scrape to Mussolini's lot. Until the blackshirt goons come for me, call me Sindaco or don't talk to me at all.\"\n\nThe civilians started to shout their approval all the more, crying out \"Viva il Sindaco\" and suchlike. Vittorio Pertusio, Sindaco of Genoa, felt a hope he had not felt in years; as he basked in that feeling, he heard a shout. The official from earlier was now handing out Christian Democratic pins, which were disappearing like hotcakes; the mayor rushed down from the dais and took one himself."

Such things would be considered somewhat normal, but there seems to be a pattern in place. At the same time, agents have reported that FD members and supporters have been intimidated or beaten up. We know for sure that the Brigate Nere are no more and that Farinacci's dead, but after frisking a suspicious student outside an university in Milan, policemen found a gun that had been recently stolen and a flyer containing propaganda for an organization or group called \"NAR\". So far, our policemen agree that these groups are probably just a small remnant of the Brigate Nere of old, and it's highly unlikely that they could be in any way connected to the recent robberies. Still, this situation will have to be monitored, if we want political violence to remain a memory of the past."

Or at least that is what we thought, as it appears that the state of Benito has been completely forgotten, meaning that all of our calculations are off and the state isn't factored into the overall election. Even though the desert state has a remarkably low population and is a rather embarrassing part of our empire, its people still have a right to vote for the Italian leadership fairly. How such an idiotic mistake could happen is currently baffling Rome, as it now appears that we will have to completely start the process over from scratch, from the bottom up, to ensure that these elections can be completed with every state having the ability to vote equally. This entire process hopefully won't delay the elections, but it will cost us a large sum of money to fix this simple mistake. Worse yet, many are even considering just abandoning Benito as a cheaper alternative, something that would surely cause massive outrage and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThis is just a small part of a much larger problem, which is that the Italian Empire has very little experience in running a democracy and our bureaucrats are overwhelmed with the stress of putting on elections. The general confusion that has taken hold of the government has left us with a quite disorganized, sloppy mess with problems ranging from non standardized ballots to forgetting an entire state. Even Ciano himself seems to be in over his head as he begins to realize how difficult this process is going to be. These are rather trying times, but if we can somehow make it through these elections we should be much more prepared for the following ones to come.

Determined however to give it his best shot, Visenti has decided to go full throttle and go for the victory. Today, as an attempt to get the people on his side, he has travelled to the University of Bari to give a speech to the students and encourage them to vote for him and his party.\n\nHe delivered his message in a small conference room on campus, with an audience of less than fifty people present and only one reporter, who was half asleep. Not to be discouraged, Visenti spoke with his usual energy, proudly exclaiming that he saw no reason why a little party like his couldn't win seats in Parliament and why even the people in that room could make all the difference. Ever smiling, he even answered questions directly asked by the audience, being caught off guard by how difficult they were. But even when asked why he even bothered running, he exclaimed proudly that he definitely won't win if he doesn't try. After talking for a bit more and making some awkward jokes that didn't quite land, he ended the speech with his new slogan of \"Go we go\", which he tried to get the crowd to chant with him, unsuccessfully.\n\nAs if not embarrassed enough, when Visentini turned around he noticed a portrait of Aldo Moro, his rival leading the Christian Democrats and apparently an alumni of the university, hanging behind the podium he was speaking at. And yet, even though he began to feel discouraged, he kept smiling as he left, unwilling to let down his party and the Italian people."

The results are still mostly being processed and will likely be only available a few days before the elections themselves, but we have discovered one alarming trend.\n\nIt appears that in Sicily, especially in the regions scattered with old people's homes and retirement communities, there has been a shocking number of citizens declaring that they want Benito Mussolini to win in the coming elections. Apparently, the old Duce was still quite popular and even the fact that he was deceased was not enough to keep him out of politics. When confronted about why they would choose a candidate from beyond the grave, the elderly voters either were confused and thought he was still alive or were just in plain denial that he could ever not be Duce. While the numbers were nowhere near high enough to actually influence the election results, this does show one of the very flaws in democracy that ironically the fascists have targeted for decades, in that some people are simply too ignorant to choose their own leaders, and yet these ignorant people seem best drawn to the fascists who most lack respect for them.\n\nIn any event, this odd situation has become quite a joke around Italy, with pranksters making fake campaign posters of Mussolini and newspapers reporting on his popularity alongside the actual candidates. Even Ciano himself is reported to have burst out laughing upon hearing the news, finding humor in the peculiar adoration his father-in-law still contains in the hearts of the people."

This time, it was about the blatant ties between the BN and the former Partito Nazionale Fascista. While if was fairly obvious that the BN was full of borderline fascists or even actual fascists, the breadth and depth of the ties were unknown until now.\n\nAn investigative journalist successfully infiltrated the BN and what they found was \"horrifying\", as the Fronte Democratico put it. Money from the old PNF was put in the BN coffers. Politicians basically swapped parties and stayed in the same seat. Nepotism favoring senior PNF politicians. The findings of the journalist went on and on. While the other scandals were eventually weathered, this scandal has hurt the BN greatly. Some politicians involved in the scandal have resigned, causing special elections that the BN is unlikely to win. Multiple members of the BN in parliament have turned their coat and joined the right wing of the Democrazia Cristiana, and worst of all, the BN is starting to lose members at a steady rate. If the trends are to continue, the BN would no longer be the biggest party in Italy, and they could even lose their majority in Parliament.\n\nAlmirante, surprisingly, has responded to this scandal. He has decried them as false reports, and that the so-called 'journalist' is nothing more than a Fronte Democratico spy! Most high ranking BN members have followed his word on this, especially the members who are implicated in the scandal.

Almirante has been praising the King of Italy in nearly every speech or discussion recently, to the point that Pietro Nenni, leader of the Fronte Democratico, jokingly praised the King himself in one of his speeches, to much laughter. Therefore, when Umberto II has interviewed recently, it was obvious that Alfano had to ask what Umberto himself thought of the matter. His answer, was... surprising to say the least.\n\nUmberto called Almirante's constant praise an attempt to suck up to the monarchy, and then proceeded to say he'd rather talk about his new medals obtained in service to Italy, which he did for a solid 30 minutes, almost half of the interview. This has turned into an incredibly embarrassing event for the BN, as it shows that the King of Italy basically thinks of Almirante as a joke. This has also, predictably by this point, turned into a scandal.\n\nThe scandal that has erupted from this is about the fact that if the King of Italy cannot even vouch his nominal support to the BN, then what right to they have to rule? As is the case, the BN have remained very quiet, and Almirante has apparently remained unfazed, although he does not praise Umberto II very much anymore, much to the sadness of the FD, who cannot make jokes about it anymore.\n\nIronically, many war veterans who have medals have been interviewed about them due to this, and it seems Umberto has gotten in on the joke, and he can now barely be seen without his frankly impressive collection of medals pinned on his clothes, much to the exasperation of the BN."

Not only that, he called it \"a much more prosperous time\", much to the horror of basically everyone who aren't fascists. Furthermore, he stated that \"Fascism did nothing wrong\" which has basically led to his utter ridicule in the media.\n\nThe media, besides ridiculing him, has completely dismantled every part of his speech ana pointed out why every section of it was false or wrong. The Fronte Democratico has finally blatantly called Almirante an \"idiot\", while the Democrazia Cristiana has seemed to support the sentiment of the FD. Even some of the people in the BN have said that \"perhaps it was not such a good thing for Almirante to say\", which is incredibly radical for them.\n\nIn comparison, the openly fascist groups of Italy have declared support for Almirante, as \"he understands when Italy was at its zenith and why\". This has led to a split of sorts in Italian society, as the fascist sections are now in full alignment with Almirante, while the anti fascist sections are in a strong opposition to him."

With fiery rhetoric, Almirante offered his account of the events since the inception of Ciano's reforms, including the creation of the Blocchi Nazionali, and the elections themselves. He admitted that his party often \"did not show fully its commitment to the democratic cause\", but he went on to remark that pride in fascism isn't nostalgia, and that it is not incompatible with genuine love for democracy.\n\nGiorgio Almirante went on to explain the aims and the policies which the Blocchi Nazionali will pursue, and to show that they are merely expressions of the people's will, not a return to the past. Finally, the Prime Minister ended his speech by blaming the political tension experienced by the country on the left opposition. The Fronte Democratico, said Almirante, \"isn't very democratic at all, considering their hatred for the democratically elected government\". Almirante concluded by saluting the Italian people, and by assuring it that with the Blocchi Nazionali in power, the nation is in good hands.\n\nImmediately, it appeared clear that with this speech, Almirante would finally win over the silent majority of the nation. While leftist groups are still staunchly opposed to the government, moderates and centrists are finally convinced of Almirante's good intentions and political competency, there are rumors that Moro's DC, or at least its right wing, could finally openly side with Almirante's BN. Only one thing is certain, that now, the Blocchi Nazionali have the reins of the nation firmly in their hands, but nobody knows if they will steer Italy towards democracy, or back towards fascism."

Hopefully, we will be able to achieve enough support from at least one party to easily pass any and all reforms that we hope to see be put into place.

This pleases our leadership greatly, as we have yet to achieve the majority it would take to pass any bill we wish. Therefore, in order to further test their commitment to a possible coalition government, Aldo Moro will seek to meet with his rival Giorgio Almirante so as to put our squabbling behind us and move forward hand in hand with the intent of efficiently legislating.

As a way to finally become closer with the Blocchi Nazionali, we must dispel these rumors, as they currently drive a wedge in between us. This can be accomplished by a new campaign consisting of the adoration of our motherland and our willingness to protect her and her interests. Moro himself should give speeches announcing his love for his home nation and how he is going to work in every way to keep her great and powerful in this new era.

While our policies and legislation won't be quite what the Fronte Democratico wants, given the choice between moderate reform and no reform at all, we are sure that they would make the decision that most benefits Italy and her people.

With strong showings in both the upper and lower chambers of Parliament, the Christian Democrats have dominant legislative power in Rome, and it is now their turn to lead the nation. Celebrations are already taking place in the streets, not only because of who won, but because they just had their first free and fair elections in a very long time.\n Moro, in response to this great victory, aired a speech on the radio welcoming the election results and showing his appreciation for the trust given to him by the Italian people. In this broadcast, he first thanked the people for electing him and promised to do everything in his power to improve their lives and the state of Italy. Next, he went on to explain how his government would work towards ensuring that the other parties are still given a fair voice and the ability to cooperate in matters of policy. Cheerfully, he went on to explain that this was a new dawn for Italy and for the first time in a long time her future is looking bright.\n After the broadcast, the losing parties gave their concession speeches, and although not nearly as joyful, the public was happy to see them accept defeat with grace. Now it is time for Moro to really reform the Empire to his liking. Having platformed on mostly education reform and social security, it is predicted that he will follow through and let them be his main focus for the time coming. He will also attempt to work with the other parties, even the Blocchi Nazionali, to make certain that this first democratic government doesn't collapse as a result of infighting. This is a historic day for not only Moro himself, but all of Italy and the world."

The Christian Democrats first choice would be the Fronte Democratico, who share their commitment to Italian Democracy and desire for entitlement and education reform. However, early signals from the SD seem to suggest that this course will be difficult. As the price for their cooperation, The Fronte Democratico have demanded that the new educational curriculum include a segment on the \"fascist period\" and in particular, the \"clerical institutions\", who through their \"cooperation\" with the oppressive regime extended its longevity and cruelty. A suggestion that is considered frankly insulting by the strongly Catholic CD.\n\nOf course, the Fronte Democratico are not the only potential coalition partner for the Christian Democrats, there is also the Blocchi Nazionali-- the avowedly nationalist organization made up almost entirely of former Fascist Party members. The NB's leader Giorgio Almirante has declared his parties great willingness to cooperate with the CD, calling them \"our brothers, dedicated to a strong Italian Empire\", and has asked for only minor concessions as the price for a coalition government. However, the Christian Democrats fear polluting their commitment to the new Italy by working with a party that still salutes Mussolini the Patriot besides Ciano the Reformer. During the campaign, the CD had firmly disavowed any possibility of allying with the National Bloc, but the CD's leader Aldo Moro has since walked back this position, claiming that his party is \"open to working with any group that believes in a peaceful democratic Italy\". Some have argued this is just a tactic to pressure the Fronte Democratico to ease their coalition demands, while others believe it prestiges a broad right-wing coalition."

So far, Almirante's party has expressed a willingness to work with the Christian Democrats and this meeting had high expectations attached to it by both parties. It began rather formally, with hand shaking and smiles and the politicians all acting as if they were old friends and not just recently tearing each other apart in the elections. However, as talks began and the Blocchi Nazionali began making their demands, it became abundantly clear that there would be no compromise. To start off with, Almirante refused to negotiate if Moro pursued his policies of education reform and social security, saying that both would end up damaging Italy more than helping it. He went on to counter every single proposition made by Moro and practically inferred that there would be no reform in a coalition with his party. As if that wasn't enough, the final nail in the coffin was when Almirante began to rant about how the Christian Democrats should instead support his policies rather than pursue theirs and that was the only way to keep the Italian Empire alive. Realizing that this was completely futile, the Christian Democrats began signaling that no coalition would be made and that the meeting had come to a close. Not understanding, or perhaps not caring, Almirante only continued on with his insane plans, explaining the political situation as if the Blocchi Nazionali had won the elections and they were trying to make a coalition. About an hour later, Almirante was finally satisfied with himself and let the meeting end. The damage had already been done, however, and it was plain to anybody in Rome that there was no chance of the two parties working together in the future."

It is high time we actually create some legislature, after all that is what we were elected into office to do. The initial bills have been drafted and they are ready to be introduced into the lower chamber. Hopefully, we will be able to get them through with enough support in the coming future through our deals and coalition. Every single representative that has been recently elected is quite excited for these first few steps, and the people cry out for us to take Italy by the hand and lead her to a brighter world, and it is our duty to oblige them. We will make these ideas and reforms into law and not allow anything to stop us in our great quest to bring upon a better world. Hopefully, the other parties can see the same thing and work with us rather than against us, for only together do we have a chance of actually accomplishing anything. Moro himself is perhaps the most optimistic, being described as constantly smiling and always happy to discuss policy with anyone in ear reach. He has even held conferences with individual deputies to both ensure their support and ask their opinions on key issues, never fading in his hope to create a good, functioning administration.

If we wish for the reform to ever come into reality, we must must work tirelessly to convince the other parties to support it. Specifically, we need either the social democrat votes or the fascist votes in order to pass the law. The Liberal Party, while small and mostly insignificant, will likely vote with us without any accomodation, but it is certain that the two major parties will request certain provisions to be added or removed and we will have to negotiate to earn their favor.\n\nThis is still a great step for our administration, and the people will be excited to know that we are actively setting out to accomplish our promises.

All it should take is a little bit of compromising and a sprinkle of smooth talking from Moro to convince at least a few of the idiots to support our bill, right? Of course, nothing is that simple, as many are either making outrageous demands or giving vague responses, leaving us unsure of whether or not they will be on our side. This is troubling, but hopefully we managed to get some of them to vote with us, at least enough to secure a majority when the final vote is made in a few weeks. In the end, the fascists will at least be grateful that we tried to include them in the negotiations, and this could plant the seed for future cooperation when they inevitably get sick of being in a party that can't accomplish get any bills passed.

These demands were handed over with very little formalities or subtly, with the clear assumption that unless the bill had what they wanted, there would be no votes for it from them. The first demand was that of historical revisionism. The fascists are rather afraid of us introducing educational materials and works that would counter what they believe to be indisputable facts. They still see Benito Mussolini as Italy's great savior, and they simply must have him and the Fascist Party be given the appropriate attention and praise that they deserve. While we would never dare enforce anything that challenged Mussolini's fame and importance, this appears to be seeking praise of the very system of government we just abandoned for good reason, and many of the misconceptions that the Blocchi Nazionali would like to see pushed in schools are borderline lies and propaganda. However, the writing is on the wall, and we will have to conform to what they want if we wish to gain their votes when the time comes. Now, our party is faced with this dilemma. If we do what Almirante's party wants, we could secure the support we need while sacrificing many of the values and honest beliefs that we campaigned on. If we fail to gain the votes, our reform's could fail to pass and the children will suffer for our inability to take action. The ball is now in the Christian Democrats court."

Fractures in the party lines now could also lead to more trouble down the line, and then there would be no hope for us to win the next election. We will start with simply reminding the deputies that align with us of the importance of this bill to ensure that they do not get distracted from the primary task at hand. Meanwhile, a renewed advertising campaign will both rile up the public and put the pressure on the parliament to see FEOTA is able to pass through and become law. The public has already shown a determination to improve educational standards in the elections, and forgetting to fulfill that promise we made to them would be fatal for any party member seeking to be reelected. Of course, we are not expecting any resistance from our officials in regards to the situation and are not seeking to threaten them in any way, instead, we only seek to unite them at a time when unity and cooperation are the only things keeping the government, and all of Italy, together. After this shake up, we will be primed and ready to restart our efforts towards converting the votes of opposing parties to achieve the majority we need."

 christdem.13.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has given a televised speech to the people of Italy in an attempt to build support for the Moro Reform. Education reform has been a constant demand by the populace, and Moro is hoping that they will pressure the members of the other parties to join on in support of the legislation.\nHe began simply, speaking about the abhorrent history of Italian education in the last century, how it has lagged behind the other nations of Europe and how even today hundreds of thousands of Italian people don't even have a high school diploma. He then spoke of the wonders of mandatory education and how a simple high school education, while somewhat difficult to attain, would serve the children of Italy for the rest of their lives. This would give the poor the opportunity to become rich, the ignorant to become scholarly, and the lazy to become hard working, only if the nation could unite and pass the bill that the Democrazia Cristiana have proposed. He finished the speech with a plea to the Fronte Democratico and the Blocchi Nazionali, a plea for unity and solidarity to pass the bill that will give young Italians everywhere the chance that they need to succeed in life. Moro explained that this is not a partisan issue, or even a political one, but it is instead a moral obligation that we have to our children and country.\nRousing many, public opinion polls have already shown an increase of the bill, and many party officials are hoping that this translates into political influence and votes from the other parties. At the very least, we put on display our concern and love for the people, and our opponents will have to fight an uphill battle to challenge Moro now."

 christdem.14.d:0 "The more liberal elements of our party have taken it upon themselves to meet with the left-wing Fronte Democratico party in an attempt to ensure they support our education bill when we hold the vote on the issue. Thankfully, we appear to be in good graces with the party and the hopes are that they will help is in this matter, giving us the votes we need and the ability to work closely with them in the future. Of course, we know that they will want us to make changes to the bill and reform the system to a much higher degree, but there is nothing in the legislation itself that the party would find repugnant and it is likely that we won't have much trouble getting them on board. We have even sweetened the deal by promising them future cooperation in regards to other reforms and policies that they find beneficial. The parties response has so far been a bit cautious, but mostly optimistic as education is a pillar of society that we all see is worth mending. It is predicted that they will give us an official response soon regarding their stance, and when they do we will know what must be done in order to achieve that threshold of supporters necessary to secure the bills chance of success. Meanwhile, this meeting has been met with criticism from the Blocchi Nazionali, who sees this move as disrespectful and weak. While their words do not affect us, we must make efforts to keep our independence and not really on other parties too much to achieve legislative progress."
 christdem.14.a:0 "We must keep moving!"
 christdem.15.t:0 "Fronte Democratico Gives Their Reply"
 christdem.15.d:0 "Finally, after much stalling, the Fronte Democratico has given us the answer to our plea for help. Their response, while not a refusal or acceptance of support, is a deal that if we add certain parts to the bill then they will vote for it and back our party. This was to be expected, as nobody in politics ever agrees to anything without some negotiations. It appears that every single one of their demands is simply taking one of our parts of the bill and making it far more extreme in liberalization and practice. For example, while we wish to enforce a mandatory education for all students, the liberals would have us also put in place a common curriculum that ensures the children have a full and regimented education. That is one of the more mild requests, with some even asking that we include funding and resources for completely unrelated areas like subsidies for university students and grants for research. While many of these preliminary demands will be rendered null with a bit of negotiation, the fact stands that we will have to alter and add reforms to the bill if we wish to gain the support of the Fronte Democratico when we vote. Leadership of the Christian Democrat party however is urging caution, as fulfilling their demands too much will both make us look weak and make us lose the support of moderate-right deputies that have so far aligned with us."

 christdem.16.t:0 "Voting Begins on the Moro Reform"
 christdem.16.d:0 "The Chamber is buzzing with activity, as today is the day that the deputies vote on the first major bill to be introduced into a democratic Italy. The Delegated Decrees on Schooling, the bill designed to improve educational standards and general quality of life in the nation, has been highly contentious and many are wondering if it will be able to pass through with enough votes to become law.\nMoro has been in a generally good mood, and while anxious at the prospect of having his first piece of legislation be a failure, is in high hopes and good spirits. Upon being questioned by a reporter as to his expectations, he responded by announcing that he expects many Italian politicians will be able to spot the merit in the bill and will put aside partisan squabbling to pass it, as the common interest amongst them is to help the people, not hinder them. However, it is well known that this bill's death would spell doom for both Moro and the Democrazia Cristiana, and being unable to pass legislation would inevitably lead to them losing the next elections.\nNo matter if the votes are in our favor or not, the populace will be watching us and responding appropriately to the results. Now we can only hold our breath and pray for good fortune."

Of course, I'm not underestimating you or your team, it's just that...\" Volpe finished for him: \"That you expected us to die as soon as we stepped foot in that hellhole?\" Monviso nodded. \"I guess most your success is due to your... requests? A boat, French passports, ten thousand francs and scuba diving equipment are a rather... unusual combination, to put it mildly\"\n\nVolpe chuckled: \"The boat brought us from Genoa to Marseille, where we pretended to be Italo-French coming from Nice to see their families in Paris. At night, we bribed the sewer maintenance personnel in South Paris to let us submerge in the drainage pipes, then followed them to the Seine and re-emerged in Nord-Paris, where men of the slave resistance in contact with the SIM brought us out of the city. From there, it was mostly a matter of not being spotted, though the surveillance inside is less strict: they are so sure no one can get in, that they don't see the need to hide their operation from prying eyes...

The Reich has begun rearming itself. For what purpose, one can only guess: some argue that a reconquest of the rebel Reichskommissariate is near, others believe that they are trying to exert their influence over Eastern Europe once more, while a few fear more... sinister intentions from the new regime in Germania.\n\nIn the end, until more detailed information comes, it's impossible to discern the ultimate goal of the new Germany, but the data is more than enough to understand how they want to pursue it, and devise countermeasures. For each new weapon developed, something capable of rendering it useless, for each new tactic devised, a plan to counter it, for each new division raised, a brigade trained to hold the line.

The root issue was quite basic: there were simply not enough men that fit the extensive requirements for joining the army. There is a potential solution, however. As of right now, many of our colonial natives are barred from enlistment, despite their eagerness to do so. Of course, there is always the choice of simply allowing women into the Armed Forces. A potentially unpopular decision, but certainly an effective one. These proposals, once relegated to the stacks of rejected documents, finally seemed possible with the advent of democracy in Italy. [Root.GetLeader] smirked. Italy would follow the example of the Romans of yore, opening its legions to all of its loyal citizens, so they may share the honor of defending their shared homeland! Of course, it wouldn't be as easy as simply removing the existing legal restrictions; the prejudices that led to these policies being implented certainly still exist within both the populace at large and the Army. Annoying, but not an impassable problem; it would simply require a targeted effort on the part of our government to convince the people, and by extension, the Army, that this is the only way forward."

The Italian delegation was composed of the governor-general of the Libyan metropolitan area, the commander of the oil fields garrison, thirty honour guards of the desert mobile division \"Diavoli delle Dune\", and a valet of the Royal Household sent by the King to celebrate the alliance. Umberto II had been invited by Gaddafi too, but politely declined due to \"very delicate and undelayable State matters\".\n\nThe camel caravan entered the town in a flurry of trumpets, exotic beasts from Gaddafi's own serraglio, and servants bringing gifts for the italians: a bedouin gem-encrusted sword for the King in Rome, a golden dagger for the governor and the garrison commander and a silver-hilted combat knife, shaped like those used by the desert fighters, for each of the honour guards. Also, Rolexes for everyone. Because everyone loves a Rolex. How could he get Swiss watches in the desert? This is why he's getting the office: if he can send agents to Switzerland without anyone noticing, he's an asset worth keeping...\n\nThe ceremony was perfect: Mu'ammar Gaddafi kneeled in front of the valet, who conferred upon him his title, a knighthood of the Order of the Holy Annunciation, and a lump sum of money \"as a sign of good will for the future of Italy and the desert people, forever bound by friendship\".

As usual, the cutlery was already perfectly lined: a couple slaps had taught Margherita that, even in a poor house, order was everything. \"Margherita! Is it ready yet?\" came the usual question. \"Yes dear, I'm finishing!\" but the husband was no longer listening, zapping and finally stopping on the Telegiornale, the news channel.\n\nMargherita brought the soup-filled dishes, but suddenly stopped near the TV, the plates still in her hand. \"By decree of the ministry of defence\" came the anchorman's smooth voice, \"Starting today, women can enlist in the army as auxiliaries, drivers and pilots. Further decrees will regulate the eventuality of fully-female fight-\" the TV went off. \"Bah! Cagate!\" came Lorenzo's voice. \"Margherita! Don't make me come for you!\" he yelled, but his wife was immediately at his side. For the first time in almost two years, a radiant smile was on her face, even covering the latest bruise on her cheek.\n\n\"Yes dear, here is your soup\" and she poured the steamy fluid onto her husband's head. Lorenzo screamed in pain, and made to get up, but Margherita was faster, crushing the empty plate on his face: the rough ceramic broke, as did the man's nose. \"Puttana! Io ti- AAH!\" another scream, this time from the woman's foot coming in contact with Lorenzo's private areas once. Then twice. Then in the stomach. When the man was curled on the floor, holding his head, Margherita Varesini calmly went to her room, took her only bag, and returned to her husband, still on the floor. \"Lorenzo, I'm joining the army.

And now that they have feasted on the corpses of Switzerland and Sweden, they are turning their gaze down to the south. We need to remain calm. Switzerland and Sweden were no Italy, they lacked the overseas empire that we do, the population, the industry, the military strength, and the national will to resist invasion. For as long as we stand strong and unified in purpose, the bloodlust of the Hun will not be slaked on Italian blood. When the eagle enters the wolf's den, it will find only death."

This means training them to think quickly and independently, to excel in close quarters and house-to-house fighting.

We should be reminding the people of Italy that they are united as loyal citizens of the state, and have no reason to fight one another over such superficial divisions as \"class\". Every radio and television broadcast should seek to instill a sense of unity in the people that cannot be overcome by fear and lies. The workers must be reminded that the ideals propagated by violent fringe actors have already been achieved peacefully through our reforms."

The original draft of the Carta del Lavoro gave far too much power to the industrialists and big business executives. They have used this power to abuse their workers, as well pursuing interests that do not necessarily coincide with those of the Italian nation.\n\nDuce Scorza has decided that the time has come to revise the Carta del Lavoro and update it for the present day. This new Charter of Labour shall restrict the powers of the business elite over their workers, so that unbridled capitalism shall no longer run roughshod over the working Italian. Those who put in a fair day's labour shall receive the compensation and benefits that they are entitled to. The average Italian has placed his trust in the state, and the state shall not betray that trust any longer!\n\nNot only that, but all these corporations shall no longer be allowed to solely pursue their own goals, even if that means working against the goals of the state. Given that the state provides plenty of support to these corporations, it is only natural that they should in turn be supporting the state, working towards our goals rather than just their bottom line. The business executives may protest us revising the Carta Del Lavoro, but hard luck on them. If they had not abused the trust the state had in them, this would not be necessary to begin with!"

The people, uncertain about the reinforcement of the fascist system, seem to be ecstatic at the abolition of taxes, and why wouldn't they? More money in one's pocket tends to lead to happiness.\n\nHowever, despite our successes at ending taxation, there still seem to be a few issues. The central problem that we face comes from economists. They seem to mistakenly believe that the Italian Government is too centered around taxation, and that even individual spending can't maintain it. Even more, they think that this rapid abolishment will lead to hyper-inflation and a total economic collapse! What fools they are. It's clear to everyone with a brain that an excess of money can only lead to more spending, which is the driver of economic prowess! The Italian economy will soar to new heights, and not be toppled, as these alarmist economists believe."

The bankers and economists are chuckling from their ivy towers as Inflation spikes, businesses and consumers alike desperately attempt to spend their savings before they become worthless, and the economy as a whole approaches absolute meltdown.\n\nPerhaps we've merely misinterpreted the instructional texts from early Fascism, which are notoriously self-contradictory and vague. Already, the best minds from the PNF are working to figure out a solution in line with Fascist ideology and the glorious thought of the Duces Mussolini and Scorza.\n\nWell we have no doubt that Fascism will prove itself in time, for now it appears to the public like the naysayers have had the last last. As the nation sinks ever further into crisis, and even some within the hallowed halls of the Italian government show signs of doubting the Fascist way, we can only hope that a solution will be found quickly.\n\nOr failing that, an \"interpretation\" which allows us to undo our recent decision making, temporarily of course."

So long as the relationship remains combative, so long as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the Italian nation will always fail to live up to its true potential. It is the duty of the fascist state to enforce a non-combative relationship between the classes. In practice, this means that the factory workers will tend to their gardens, and the bourgeois there's.

Were it just a few of the no-good profiteers taking these un-patriotic actions, we'd naturally send the MSVN to sort them out, but the scale of this subversion makes this dangerous.

The Fascist government has proven to be sadly incapable of bearing the massive burden of management that has been thrust upon it.

Thankfully there's a solution that's sure to succeed: a broad and bold campaign of propaganda to celebrate the Italian \"Warrior Producers\" who boldly sacrifice (the occasional limb) to keep their country great.\n\nWhile a few might see this as just another cynical attempt to make them tolerate ever lower standards of work and wages, most of the workers will no doubt be whipped into shape by this program, and leap happily back to their machines in an instant!"

Just as we ignored these fools in the forging our empire, we ignored them in the implementation of Mussolini's vision, confident that the fascist way would prove right in time.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that we were wrong.\n\nOur attempts to forge a new and more productive cooperative arrangement between Workers and managers has done nothing but alienate both of them. The beautiful future we worked so hard to build appears to have been nothing but a delusion, and all of the blood, toil, tears and sweat that we sacrificed to build it were for nothing.\n\nEven now, as our factories are filled with strikes and sabotage, and the wealthy flee our nation for friendlier climates there are those who still believe in Fascism. Maybe we should too. After all, sending in the Blackshirts to simply solve the problem with blood and bullets might not be the most \"humane situation\" (or the most in line with Fascist doctrine) but it'd certainly be easier than making the painful adjustments to our structures and ideology admitting failure would entail.\n\nOn the other had, perhaps its best to accept defeat, admit that we failed, and change for the better. After all, if Fascism does not serve the Italian Nation and the Italian Worker, who does it serve? We are not some petty despotic dictatorship or extremist empire, Fascism has always been devoted to the Italian people, and they to it.

Blood froze in his veins as he read \"SCIOPERO\". Images started to run wildly inside his mind: his family brought away, himself toiling to death in a labour camp, never to see his children again... Instinct was stronger. \"Anti-fascist propaganda!\" he screamed, and everyone stopped. Immediately, two people dressed like him - but he knew better - were at his side. One of them took the paper: \"Who gave it to you?\" to which Gaetano looked, and saw Marco silently begging him with his eyes.

He remembered being the godfather for Lucia, Marco's daughter, his pride and joy... With tears in his eyes, he silently pointed his finger.\n\n\"Traitor! Scab!

That night, however, was different, as the entire Palace was alive: reports came in every passing hour, and the Duce's desk was littered with empty coffee cups.\n\nUncertainty transpired from all reports on the precious desk: Germany's collapsing economy, Japan's economic war, America's tampering with established order in Africa, tensions in the Middle East steadily rising, the list was far longer than any economist would be comfortable with. The office was silent, the only sound coming from the regular typing of Scorza's private secretary. Sipping from another cup of coffee, Scorza wondered how to protect Italy from the next storm, one which could potentially be even more devastating than the last war and the end of the Triumvirate put together. He felt powerless, like the commander of a besieged castle, unable to do anything other than look his enemies prepare for the final assault.\n\nHis head shot up. Yes! A castle! Perhaps he couldn't influence the way the crisis would start, but surely he could erect walls, shore up the defences so that the country might survive the storm! Italy needed to become an economic fortress, impregnable and independent from foreign influence, and there was only one way to achieve this: autarky, Mussolini's very own invention, would return to the forefront of Italian economics. \"Aldo!\" he startled his secretary, \"call immediately the Minister for the Economic Affairs!

While it will take time to ensure full agricultural independence, we are confident that the new rationalisation reforms, and research on high-yield crops and fertilisers, will give us what we need\" then, he nodded to one of the members of the planning board, who begun to talk in detail about the reforms and their results.

But, he wondered, how was this goal, the refinement of Fascism, to be achieved? The old systems have been rotting away for decades, ever since Mussolini, yes, but what was to be done?\n\nFor Scorza to repair the cracking foundation of Italy and the Party, radical action would have to be taken, and quickly.

The old systems that had defined what \"Fascism\" is were simply untenable, and foundational change would need to occur if Italy was to survive the storm of the Oil Crisis, and the rapidly shifting world around them. Quickly getting to work, he began to draft the ideas that would define this \"New Fascism.\"\n\nThe first order of business: the Electoral System. The people, as so many had tended to find out, tend to be much more content when they truly feel they are represented in their governance. True universal suffrage was impossible, yes, but the \"democracy\" of the Empire could certainly be expanded to meet the needs of the people. Second, of course, was the welfare of the people. Although he would have to create an extensive plan for the welfare of Italy yet, the people must enjoy a basic level of comfortable living standards for them to be content. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the State would be required to subscribe to the pillars of true Fascism in full, and every hint of corruption, disloyalty, and treason purged with overwhelming power. After all, these reforms Scorza was now rapidly fabricating in his mind were constructed with a singular purpose in mind: ensuring that the truest, most best form of Fascism can truly last for a thousand years more, and absolutely nothing can stand in his way.

However, despite fascism's triumph over those two ideologies, the OVRA still operates as if they are a clear and present danger.\n\nScorza understands that this absurdity must end. The greatest threats to Italy are not subversive ideologies, but the yawning chasm of dysfunction, corruption, and self-interest that plagues the PNF and the institutions of the Italian state. Scorza will refocus the OVRA to clamp down on the rot that festers inside Italy, lest it undoes everything fascism has built."

It can be most accurately described as a bloated fossil of an organization that consumes billions of lira every year to monitor millions of ordinary Italian citizens in its pursuit of alleged enemies of the Italian state. This has rendered it deeply corrupt and inefficient.\n\nScorza will end this waste of resources. The OVRA does not need to monitor every Tizio, Caio, and Sempronio to defend Italy. By limiting the scope of its operations to the members of the government and other notables, and firing most of its employees, Scorza will transform the OVRA into an organization that can effectively uphold the interests of the Italian people."

In the years since our triumph over the decadent Western empires, the PNF, in its complacency, has become no different from the corrupt bourgeois parliamentarians that it overthrew. Bribery, graft, and other forms of political profiteering are commonplace. Many of its members view their membership in the party as a means to advance their personal interests, and not as service to the Italian nation.\n\nThis rot is undermining the Italian people's confidence in the fascist project and the PNF's authority, and if it is not checked, it will transform Italy into a mirror of the German Reich. To save the PNF from itself, Scorza will authorize the OVRA to conduct a thorough investigation into corruption in the party.

Over the decades, a seedy network of shady transactions and dark money has enabled special interests to possess vast influence over the state. The web of corruption stretches from the highest ministers to the lowest clerks, and dismantling it will be a tall order.\n\nThere is no question that it must be done.

There are countless members of the Chruch who have engaged in all sorts of corrupt and debauched behavior, from bribery and fornication to even homosexuality or pedophilia.\n\nMussolini always enjoyed it when an OVRA agent would bring to his desk yet another report on a cleric's dirty deeds, and Scorza feels that this practice should continue.

A balance must be struck between the extremes of the Party, so that we may continue unimpeded by this crippling lack of identity in the State.

These policies were implemented despite the fact that it was very rare to see resources being diverted to Italian language education in the colonies and territories, making the whole thing a bit of a joke, a symbolic relic of the idea of cultural supremacy that was prevalent at that time. Times have changed though, and Duce Scorza recognizes that in such an empire as he has, languages will be spoken whether or not they are officially allowed. Removing these outdated bans would just be better for everyone involved."

It is the seat of the Emperor and the heart from which the Empire flows, but it does not claim to be the only part of the empire that matters.

Those who would seek to dissuade us from such a path reveal themselves as either cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Look at what the Germans accomplished! While Ciano persuaded Mussolini to follow more high minded ideals the Reich swallowed almost all of Europe and Africa, leaving us with the scraps.

With our recent efforts to remove those who were already cast as villains, namely the Jews, to other locales some of Duce Scorza's advisors feel it is time for a new foe to be brought to the people's attention. Perhaps the Arabs should be next on our list, or German refugees from the Civil War? Whatever we decide upon, we can quickly begin to distribute learning materials to all of our citizens that show just what a threat to the Italian way of life that group is.

Fascism after all, is a state focused ideology first and foremost, and if the state is being held back by outdated beliefs then it is within the power of Fascism to throw them out. In the circles of the Italian government, it is called the \"Political Absolute\" for it is the one true metric through which everything must be judged through."

However, it seems that the extent to which this subversive slime has infiltrated the political and media mainstream is greater than we knew. While we've already built several \"temporary\" holding camps for such malcontents, these venues, along with the conventional jail system are already overcrowded.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety and well being of the Italian nation, Italian soldiers, the Italian people, and the inmates themselves, we will be massively increasing the number of prison camps.

Just arresting these elements would likely result in a destabilization of public opinion, heavily counter to our short term and long-term goals.\n\nThankfully, there's an easy alternative. Send plain clothes units by night to their homes, and have them safe in a prison camp by daybreak. People may wonder, the neighbors may talk, but at the end of the day this is for their own good.

Groups have fallen, raids have been carried out, men have died. Yet still, the resistance lives on.\n\nBoldrini has been a partisan since 1943. The partisans then were hopeful, thinking that the Americans would come any day now and liberate Italy. They didn't. Once the Axis won World War 2, Boldrini and his men grew desperate. They fled across the country, constantly avoiding government crackdowns wherever they went. And the government didn't make it easy. It seemed as if behind every corner there was a soldier, waiting for the partisans to slip up. And slip up, they did. Boldrini fled from group to group, educating each on his experience. He taught them how to terrorize, how to make the Fascists cower like dogs for a time. Then the Germans invaded. Italy was placed under a puppet regime. The fiercest of Fascists now was a partisan against the new \"Republic\" and the partisans gained many new men.\n\nThen the Germans collapsed into civil war once more. The resistance seized the opportunity and led a revolution against the government. Multiple groups broke out into chaotic fighting across the country, driving the collaborators out of many cities. They contacted each other, soon forming an emergency government for a free Italy. Unfortunately, no one could agree on what type of government should be formed. As such, the groups turned to the only man they could all trust: Boldrini. Boldrini had taught the partisan groups everything they know, and helped them succeed in the revolution. It made sense to have the guiding hand of the partisans be the guiding hand of the revolution as well. Boldrini now sits on an unstable coalition within Italy, united in one goal: defeating the Germans."

Rumours of dangerous subversives, infiltrating in all sectors of Italian society, possibly helped by foreign agents, have already reached the ears of the upper echelons of the party, and Duce Scorza has seen it wise to act.

We must expand and perfect this tried and true system, turning the Colonie into proper concentration camps where we can store hundreds of enemies of the state, rendering them not only innocuous, but also using their labour for the benefit of the fatherland.

Now, the Duce has decided that the PNF must return to be what it was designed to be - a monolithic, indestructible bloc of people who are willing to pledge the utmost personal loyalty to the Duce of fascism. Enforcing mass purges in the lower ranks and solidifying the hierarchy of the upper ranks will restore the lost unity of the party and the nation, demanding nothing short of complete, total submission to Scorza himself."

While useful to repress rabbles, the MVSN is not something we can rely on for more complicated matters - the Regio Esercito, particularly its intelligence and secret services divisions, will be instead put on high alert to deal with disturbances to public order across the empire.

We shall prepare for this by passing a series of laws, making it illegal to leave the household by night except without express permission from above.

We shall do this by solidifying the hierarchy of power in every area of life; whether in the party structure, the military, police, the administration and society generally, we will establish discipline and rank under threat of punitive punishment. By massively increasing punishment for people rebelling against their betters, we will drill into the people a simple truth.

To hold the people of Italy steadfast against atheism and liberalism, to maintain their faith in the natural order of master and servant, and to keep them in submission to God the Father; these are crucial to control the soul of Italy.

We shall let our friends know that we will always have an ear for the concerns of industry, committed as we are to creating wealth and furthering economic growth. Whether this requires us to use words and assurances, or to speak to the industrial bosses in the language they truly understand - suitcases filled with money - is unimportant.

Now that we have prevailed over the petty intrigues of the court, we shall empower our allies around King Umberto even further, purging any remaining liberals and reformists. Shorn of anyone with an inkling of doubt in the fascist renewal, Umberto will fold, as he did all those years ago, and do exactly as our friends tell him.

We know what we must do. There are good men in the middling ranks Army, men overlooked in recent years for being too 'old-fashioned' yet too competent to leave languishing in the lower ranks. It is on these grieved men, torch-carriers for the bellicose spirit of Fascism, that we will remould the Army.

Yet now things will change once and for all, so they can remain the same. In God's name we have built a social order in our country based on piety, hierarchy, unity, and submission to power. For His Glory we will not allow any trace of atheist arrogance, or meaningless talk of individual freedoms, to push us off the path of the faithful.

Now that the liberal spirits of Savoia are dead and buried, we pledge ourselves loyal subjects of the King. So long as Umberto remains true to the ideals of Fascism reborn, a Fascism which will make Italy strong and burn away any branch which would go against us, we will also remain faithful to the Monarchy.

Long life to its Duce Carlo Scorza, to his idea of an Italy which is stronger than ever before, which is good to Italians and merciless with its enemies! For Italy we march onwards against any nation, any group that is foolish enough to block our path. Through the bowed head of a King was Fascist Italy born decades ago.

Italy's sons from all walks of life proudly serve in the Army, which means that there is a high chance of soldiers finding out their bunkmate professes some... interesting political theories.\n\nSuch was the case today in a training camp outside of Napoli, where these tensions came to a boiling point and devolved into physical violence. According to the officers' reports, one of the cadets noticed that someone had moved a portrait of the Duce on the wall so that it sits above that of the King. When he loudly demanded to know who did it, the offending cadet proudly stood up and took responsibility. The argument quickly grew heated, punches were thrown, and their squadmates jumped into the fray. While the military police were quickly called to defuse the situation and arrest the instigators, the story has spread rapidly, with some alterations. Fascists are painting it as a brave patriot standing up to a subversive conspiracy, while monarchists insist it was the work of a treasonous cur with no respect for tradition. The government needs to take a stance on the issue, and soon."

Specifically, the fact that it is the Royal Navy.\n\nA group of very ideologically motivated submarine captains have begun circulating a letter among their comrades, one that descries the monarchist implications of the Regia Marina's name. They accuse it of every single ideological crime under the sun, from undermining sailors' morale to encouraging anti-fascist partisan activity. The letter concludes with a demand that the name be changed \"at the early possible convenience of the Grand Council,\" urging them to \"remember that this is the navy of the Italian people and Empire, not a lone Savoiaard!\" While nobody in the Grand Council has any serious designs to change the Regia Marina's name, some form of response is expected."

When questioned by one of his fellow generals about the action, Borghese replied, \"The Prince is only a colonel. In what world should a counter admiral be expected to salute his subordinates?\"\n\nNeedless to say, this was not received very well by the rest of the officer corps, and Edgardo Sogno, also present at the dinner, has led the charge in demanding Borghese receive some form of censure for his insubordination. Although Borghese will not receive anything more severe than a slap on the wrist regardless of the outcome-he is too strategically vital-an official stance needs to be taken on whether nobility in the military should receive the same honors as those at the top of the normal hierarchy."

Should he focus on building unity in DC and making a stronger, more effective party, even if it jeopardizes future re-election?

Happiness at the newly forged Italian democracy, but most importantly, happiness at the DC.\n\nOur efforts in governance have paid off tenfold, as public opinion towards the DC have skyrocketed to incredibly high levels. The hopes and morals of our rank-and-file are at a similarly high level, as large numbers of people join the DC, and talk to everyone they know about the good they've done for Italy. Our successful efforts have even led to some of our opposition in the BN and FD to reluctantly admit that we are a competent and respectable option for Italy. This infectious optimism towards the DC seems poised to last a long time, and we have every intention of making sure that there will be no reason for it to fade."

But now, it was as though a metamorphosis had occurred. The room was spotless. The formerly bare bookshelves were now filled with books! Even the desks for pupils, which had been falling apart before, looked like they could actually support the weight of a child!\n\nPietro walked up to the teacher's desk. \"Mr. Cirulli,\" he asked, \"where did all this come from?\"\n\nMr. Cirulli beamed from ear to ear as he looked down at the young boy. \"Why, Pietro, it came from the Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori! They have been doing a grand campaign to provide underprivileged schools like ours with the supplies they need to give young Italians like you the education you deserve! Where do you think your parents got your new shoes and books? They certainly couldn't afford to buy them themselves!\"\n\nPietro looked down at his shoes. It was true; the shoes were brand new, well-made, and even somewhat stylish! Considering his previous shoes had been falling to pieces at the seams, it was a most welcome surprise when his ecstatic parents had presented him with the new shoes. And the books in his backpack were certainly too expensive for his working-class parents to afford on their own.\n\n\"The CISL did all this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, my boy! That's what motivated me to join the CISL myself! I'm sure your parents feel much the same themselves!\""

Elena did not like the mayor very much, but she could agree with him on that. Ever since she had gone round the building and roped in all of the neighbours, the Condominium B7 Administration Group had become the talk of the entire neighbourhood.\n\nShe had always been outspoken, even as a girl, but only in the past year or so had the neighbours become so as well. The Group, composed mostly of the women living in the building, had been scorned at first by many of the husbands. Then the Group organised a few lunches, solved the problem of waste disposal outside the condominium, convinced the owner to shell out money for maintenance of the property and received the mayor of the district, twice. The husbands stopped complaining.\n\nElena knew the change that had come over her lady friends was neither sudden nor random. Even under Ciano they would not have dared raise such a fuss or involve themselves in politics, however minor. With democracy, however, they had been free to take much of the everyday 'policymaking' into their hands. There were still whispers in neighbouring buildings that she had nothing better to do with her time, but Elena didn't care. She had discovered that organising her peers gave her purpose, and she would not give it up no matter what anyone said. Maybe when the children were slightly older - who knows - she could replace the district mayor and do his job better."

 CD.11.d:0 "Sundays were a dual disappointment for him now. Paolo's routine was known to all in the neighbourhood. After looking after the small garden he had improvised with his wife behind the house, he would go with her to the morning Mass before they parted ways; she to her friends in the grocery shops and he to his at the small cafe in the church square. After speaking with them for a while he would buy his two usual newspapers, kept aside for him behind the counter, and sit down absorbed in reading for the rest of the morning.\n\nHe had stuck to this routine for years, but things were no longer the same. The parish priest he remembered since his childhood was old and approaching senility - the poor man sometimes stopped, confused, in the middle of his sermons and seemed lost. His sermons used to rouse Paolo's faith, but now there were only the awkward silences until an altar boy led the old priest mercifully away.\n\nPaolo had expected, with the DC's victory in the election, that politics would be made with the religious fervor he still carried in his heart. He voted for Democrazia Cristiana because he believed a party of the real Italy - Italians raised, like him, in the bosom of Azione Cattolica - could carry the day. But everyday now he read that Aldo Moro - the deceitful coward, Moro - was working with agnostics and socialists. Today the paper spoke of 'Iniziativa Democratica', an alliance Moro had just announced with the Left of the party and whoever he carried with him from the centre. Paolo was angry not only at Moro, who had sabotaged Catholic politics, but at the 'men of values' in the party who let him get away with it.\n\nHe left the newspaper on the table and went back to his house. He had not given up on Democrazia Cristiana yet - who else could he vote for? But the fervor with which he spoke for them in the past had withered away long ago."

And ever since childhood, he had dreamt of making films for Cinecittà himself.\n\n\"Oi, Giuseppe! Where's my coffee? Muoviti!\"\n\nGiuseppe jolted out of his daydream as the sharp voice of Federico Fellini struck across the studio. \"Y-yes, sir! Coming right up!\"\n\nGiuseppe had never thought this day would come. That he would be working in the same studio as the great director Frederico Fellini, on a sure-to-be great film, Satyricon! Alongside such great actors as Salvo Randone! It was truly a dream come true.\n\nWhilst it was true that Giuseppe was mostly just fetching coffee and doing other grunt work, that would not last forever. He was young, and his time would come. For now, he was just happy to be able to work alongside directors and actors whom he idolized, on films that he adored. Even if he was just a peon for now, it was a toe in the door, made possible by the subsidies to Cinecittà. If they had not had those subsidies, would they have had the money to hire him?"

His brow could not help but furrow as he put the notes in his wallet.\n\nMario was an economist. He had already been skeptical of the government's plan to introduce new denominations of 500 lire banknotes when the government had announced the plan. He claimed that this plan would only lead to, at best, further inflating the already-inflated lira. At worst, he claimed, it could lead to an economic bubble.\n\nAnd all bubbles must eventually burst.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the skepticism expressed by economists such as Mario, the government had decided to go ahead with the plan and print the new banknotes. Now that they were being widely circulated, it seemed certain that they were here to stay, and the lira would be further inflated. Whilst this had increased spending and consumption, could it continue like this forever?\n\nMario did not want a bubble. He honestly hoped he was wrong, and that this project would be a success like the government claimed. But he could not shake the feeling that it was inflating a bubble, and that the bubble would inevitably pop."

We're celebrating! Now that the government has abolished metayage, we are now free men! No more sharecropping! We can keep our produce! We own our land! And it's all thanks to the government! Now take a seat, and celebrate!\", as he ushered the child to the table.\n\nGiovanni had long been a farmer in the Calabrian village of Stilo. Long had he slaved away under the metayage system, being forced to give his hard-grown crops to a landlord in exchange for the privilege of being able to use their land.\n\nHe had never dreamt that this day would come. The day where this accursed system would be abolished, and that he could keep his own crops, grown on his own land.\n\nAs he sat down at the head of the table, ready to dig in to a succulent meal, he made sure to remember who it was who had made this happen.

I'll be able to get the conservatives to support our programme one way or the other. You just need to give the green light, and without restraints I will be able to herd them into supporting us, by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Moro responded, \"but that will undoubtedly make it harder for our party to be re-elected if your plan of coercion and implied expulsion from the party goes ahead. I want to keep this in-house as much as possible too, but we must think of the future elections. Working with Nenni on a common reform programme will certainly make it easier on that front.\"\n\n\"Aldo, come on. You and I both know that if we constantly fret about not rocking the boat for the sake of the next election, nothing will ever get done. We both know the threat from the north necessitates action NOW. Just give the word, and I shall make it happen.\"\n\nMoro's brow continued to furrow as he stopped walking to ponder Fanfani's words. Whilst Fanfani was certainly speaking both their minds, it was his duty as party leader to ensure his party's electoral success, just as it was his duty as prime minister to ensure Italy's future.

That island is Democrazia Cristiana. As the other parties bicker both with each other and with themselves, our party holds firm. We are strong. We are unified. We are above such petty squabbling and factionalism. The average Italian can trust us to stay the course and steer the ship through these turbulent seas, without any of this bickering and factionalist nonsense.\n\nThat isn't to say we don't have our own divisions and factions.

 CD.18.d:0 "Aldo Moro stepped up to the podium and looked over his people as the Speaker called the House to attention. A sea of Democrazia Cristiana's representatives looked back at him, men of every shade of political persuasion, from reformed fascists and monarchists to those different from the moderate socialist bloc only by their chosen affiliation. Moro could not suppress a twinge of pride in this wide tent they had built, and then his eyes met those of Giulio Andreotti. Guilio smiled at him and nodded, encouraging, demanding. Democrazia Cristiana was by far the widest of the coalitions present in Parliament, but - Moro exhaled slowly and steeled himself - today it would become narrower.\n\n\"I am proud because I am a Christian democrat,\" he began. \"Our fellow representatives in the other parties are divided between themselves and speak only for parts of the society. This is their right.\" The usual heckling, sounds of approval from every DC faction represented. Moro continued speaking. \"Christian democracy is a representation of the whole of our society. Before God we build a politics, every day, founded in our religious and social values and which will better the life of every Italian family. Some of our opponents, looking for something to attack us for, say we compromise excessively and do not stand by what we claim to be our beliefs.\" Already the Parliamentarians started to react accordingly, but Moro kept going. \"Yet we know what our beliefs are. Democrazia Cristiana is..\" He almost faltered. \"A party for democracy, unity and values, and opposed to the destructiveness and division of the Left.\"\n\nAs the Parliament broke out in whispers, Moro narrowed his eyes at the paper laying before him on the podium. Mentally he made immediate adjustments, crossing out 'a malicious atheist attack on the family', 'assassins of democracy', substituting 'against our families' beliefs', 'misguided beliefs which can only harm democracy'. Aldo Moro looked up and threw a surveying glance around the room. Andreotti and the Primavera group nodding approvingly, the left faction looking angry and whispering while shooting daggers with their eyes. The Fronte Democratico representatives, ready to stand up and start shouting but curious to see how the speech would develop. The PSDI, sitting among them, looking more intrigued than angry. And across from the leftists, Almirante, flashing him a full toothed grin which sent a shiver down his spine. Moro kept going.\n\n\"We stand against the Fronte Democratico, against the Left, because their beliefs are against our families' beliefs. They are not what Italy wants or needs, and whilst there are good men among them,\" Another edit, a slight grimace from Andreotti - \"It is clear that their beliefs are badly misguided, and will only do harm to our young democracy. Perhaps they will call us conservative for saying so, opposed to reform, but we are the true reformers. Democrazia Cristiana represents the true centre of Italy, the soul of tens of millions of Italians and their families. Based on our values, and their values, and willing to fight the Left on the political battlefield, we will change Italy for the better and give its children a life better even than what we ourselves will enjoy.\"\n\nUproarious applause from Andreotti's corner, with every conservative member of the party on their feet clapping. Almirante and his fascists whistling and applauding, only half mockingly. The members of the Fronte Democratico jeering, calling him a Big Business puppet, an enemy of the worker and a fascist, while Saragat's moderates whispered quickly to one another. But Moro did not have eyes for any of them. He looked only at the leftists of Democrazia Cristiana, and noted how they sat there sullenly with anger in their eyes. Betrayal. Moro left the podium and went back to his seat, shaking hands and smiling absent-mindedly. Andreotti clapped him on the back and said, into his ear, \"We have won a great victory today.\""

However, there is a way we could neuter the threat posed by them.\n\nThere is a significant contingent of monarchists in the BN, who like their conservatism and authoritarianism, whilst caring less about the whole fascism thing. Though obviously, their primary concern is the preservation of the Italian monarchy.\n\nWe can use this to our advantage and sow division in the ranks of the BN. We shall spread rumors (which may have merit, for all we know) that the BN seeks to restore fascism, and abolish the monarchy in the process! We could say they seek to do this as 'revenge' against Umberto for his part in the democratization of Italy.\n\nBy planting this rumor, true or not, in the mind of the monarchists, we will wreak havoc on the BN unity. We can exploit this division to prevent the BN from interfering with our government - or democracy for that matter.

There was something defensive in the gesture. \"We're both socialists, Tano, but you know in your head that the Democristiani have done good for us.\" To this, Tano's eyes widened - Guido could see it from where he stood. \"The Democristiani have done good for themselves!\" Tano was speaking at the top of his voice. \"The problem with 'socialists' like you is you're only too willing to bend over for the establishment!\" To this the other man, face redder still, shouted something about bending over his colleague's wife.\n\nGuido shook his head and lowered his eyes to his work.

There was a silence for some time.\n\n\"I knew Giulio to be more decisive,\" said one of the men, finally. His voice was burdened, and he met with murmured assent. \"Yet we must wait, as he said. We either act correctly or we do not act at all, and even the Military cannot move unless the politics is in place.\" To this more murmurs, and not all of them assent. One of the men suggested sending a reply to the DC office the letter had arrived from, but the first one to speak shook his head.\" We must trust that our friends know what they are doing,\" he said with finality. \"Do you think any of us must enjoy this, being insulted everyday by a Government which spits in Italy's face? But we must endure it. And once we have endured enough, then and only then will we proceed.\" The room stirred somewhat, placated.

After the unification of Italy in 1861, the administrative divisions were kept small, consisting of Comuni (municipalities) and provinces (groups of Comuni).\n\nThis was all well and good, but our glorious nation has grown tremendously since then. This has necessitated more Comuni and provinces, and it has lead to the national government having to micromanage hundreds of different divisions, which is frankly nightmarish to administer. Hence the introduction by the Democrazia Cristiana government of a new administrative division: Regioni.\n\nThese regioni will consist of groupings of provinces that share a common history and/or heritage. It will decentralize a small amount of power from the national government to the regioni, but it will minimize micromanagement and allow the government's laws to be applied uniformly. It's not quite full-on federalism, but by devolving some powers to the regioni it will strengthen our country.\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy about this. The more authoritarian-minded forces in parliament are outraged at the idea of devolving even the tiniest bit of power to regional governments. The Blocchi Nazionale in particular are beside themselves, with their leader, Almirante, filibustering parliament for a record eight consecutive hours!

 FD.1.d:0 "Enzio sat hunched over his desk. His notes laid out scattered all over the finely crafted wood, spilling over onto the polyester carpet. He had collected a copious amount of material on the two ideological giants battling it out for control over the Fronte Democratico. If he were to read them all off in succession, even the long-gone and long-winded Duce himself would keel over from boredom. All the same, Enzio knew he had to at least try to make something out of his literary collection.\n\nIn his interactions with Saragat, Enzio was taken back by how approachable the man was. His whole demeanor was very calming. He didn't yell or scream or shout ideological dogma at Enzio. Whatever question Enzio had related to the party's platform Saragat was more than willing to explain, in great detail, his outline for the future. From Enzio's perspective, he saw a man committed not only to himself, like so many other politicians. Saragat was committed to democracy and to the Italian people. An honorable man in a cut-throat field.\n\nNenni however, what a contrast. If Enzio felt a sense of paternal comfort around Saragat, Nenni represented a father's rage. Rage against the injustices still present within Italy and its government. Nenni also had no qualms preaching to Enzio about how socialism, and socialism alone, would save Italy from backsliding into fascism. While Enzio was not fully convinced by the rhetoric, he couldn't help but be inspired by Nenni's commitment to his ideals. A socialist Italy still seemed unimaginable, almost impossible with a gentleman like Saragat. But with a firebrand like Nenni at the helm...\n\nEnzio went back to peering over his notes, determined to finish his column before morning."

Giuseppe Saragat had prevailed in the factional struggle for control of the Fronte Democratico, and was named Secretary of the group, with Pietro Nenni to act as President.\n\nA moderate man, both in character and in his politics, Giuseppe Saragat had in the past years fostered a reputation of ruthless calculation. Having prevailed, members of the Saragat faction now exposed their internal disagreement in presenting two plans on the way forward to Nenni.\n\nThe first path was the more moderate one - working with Democrazia Cristiana directly, pooling the energy of the moderating forces in both the FD and the DC, and forming a social democratic government supported by Aldo Moro. Despite his willingness to sit with conservative and monarchist members in his group, Moro was a known compromiser, and a Nenni-Saragat-Moro pact could well achieve much for social democratic politics. Such a pact would also help reduce opposition from conservative elements in Italy, and strongly increase our ability to deliver an effective programme. The clear downside, however, would be the reaction in the Fronte Democratico. An alliance with Moro would be seen as a capitulation by many voters, badly damaging the FD's chance at reelection.\n\nThe other option was purer, and carried more risk. The path of socialist unity would have us form a government made only of the FD, creating a moderate left bloc which could implement our vision of Italy without any alliance with the Christian Democrats. This policy, for obvious reasons, would make our re-election far more likely - it is what people voted for, after all - and the healing of rifts in the socialist front would allow the government to work in stability. Yet the risk would have to be kept in mind. After all, conservative elements in the country would be disturbed by the prospect of a socialist bloc in power.\n\nWith the FD's factions waiting impatiently, Nenni finally came to a decision:"

Nenni was the first to speak: \"Not everyone in the party is happy we're meeting you,\" he said gruffly, and Moro met him with a small smile. A test? Then Nenni laughed, and they got to business.\n\nThe next few hours went by in a consistent manner - Nenni talked a good deal, Saragat talked less and said more, and Moro talked enough. By the end of it everything was as clear as could be and a coalition agreement was on the table. Moro was pleasantly surprised to note his interlocutors did not agree on everything. They all came away with something they could sell to their people, and parted with an appointment to meet again very soon.\n\nIt had gone well, Moro noted as he left the café.

In a quickly arranged vote, the party ousted him as President and elected Ugo La Malfa in his place, with the latter immediately approving the PRI's entry into the coalition.

Now all that remained would be to pack everything up and wait for the phone to ring.\n\nParri was not so cynical as to think the phone calls from Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat were dishonest. Both men, despite their differences, respected his struggle against fascism and had told him so in person. But he was not so naïve as to think this was the only reason they were calling. Depending on their beliefs the former members of the party would flock in two directions, the more radical to the PSI and the more moderate to the PSDI. Parri knew that the Left would be stronger, all in all, in having one less faction within it to compete with. But there was also something to mourn in the party's demise.

While Enrico Berlinger was not available for comment, many of his supporters, led by other party deputies who were also expelled, have taken to the streets in protest against the \"political puppets of the bourgeoisie\". Police units have been mobilized and are conveying at the scene of the largest protests currently taking place. Although they have been ordered to only watch and ensure the protests do not spiral out of control, it is clear that the Socialist's Party's decision to expel the radicals may not have had the stabilizing effect they were hoping for.\n\nPietro Nenni issued a statement on the matter, ensuring that these protests were made up of mostly foolish students with too much time on their hands and their irresponsible ringleaders; the expelled party members. He went on to express his confidence in the Party and made it clear \"...in no uncertain terms... the party shall not split over the ravings and poutings of a few radicals.\" Time will tell if the rest of the party feels the same way..."

For days Nenni made sure every page, every paragraph, every sentence, and every syllable of his speech was perfect! He refused to recite nothing but his most truthful and analytical thoughts when speaking, especially on the topic of politics. If he was to secure Italian socialism against its political enemies, it was imperative Nenni built his support among the working class. The workers had to be made to understand the important role the PSI played in empowering them. Once they were made to see this, no doubt due to his impeccable oratory skills, the workers would unilaterally fall in line with the PSI party program. So when this crowd of workers gathered in the TV studio audience returned nothing more than a few whimpering whistles and scattered applause, Nenni could only stand aghast. Frozen in shock, like a deer in headlights, he regained enough courage to gather his papers and exit frame before the feed cut.\n\nNenni could not comprehend how his speech and charisma failed to inflame the workers' passions. Thankfully, Giuseppe Saragat made an appearance on the very same program and was able to win over the crowd's affection. Nenni pondered how Saragat, much more moderate and soft-spoken compared to himself, could have captured the hearts and minds of the working class assembled in the TV studio. And not just there either. All over the nation it seemed his fiery prose, meant to set hearts on fire, was overshadowed by Saragat's gentler and straight-talking attitude. It slowly dawned on Nenni that he was slowly but surely becoming an accessory to the real rising star of the party, Guiseppe Saragat."

Sheik Mujibur Rahman, in his address to the congress, seemed to summarize Roberto's more pessimistic feelings on the matter. \"It's not over yet.\"\n\nThe Japanese delegates, of all the attendees, were the most optimistic about the gathering. Roberto found their speech, about hope for a freer world and their country to atone for its shameful and brutal past, a truly inspiring moment for the congress. It was, however, topped only by Oliver Tambo's bombastic speech. Roberto was moved by his stories of resistance against the reichskommissariats and the struggle of liberation his people fought for everyday. If a man like Tambo can so vigorously fight on against the fascisti, then maybe this truly was the beginning of the end for them.

From Britain Hugh Brock, a journalist, and from Spain Llorenzo Vidal Vidal, a writer. Many of his countrymen he recognized himself - Ernesto Balducci, a dissident priest, had come up to him and shaken his hand. Whilst the relative lack of politicians of much import stung at first, Nenni would see it later on as a blessing. The people in this room would talk freely, caring for the best ideas and not for national interests, and just perhaps, the seed sown here would be the beginning of a wider legacy.

The improved employment was nothing but a sham, an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Italian people.

But they had been shut down, and thank God for that. Now Maurizio was to oversee this construction, one of the largest automobile factories in Italy once it was built. He had not been surprised when they chose him, since his experience in the construction industry was well known, but was grateful nonetheless to-be given this, his biggest project so far. He supposed, in a moment of wry reflection, that he was a public official now.

He was happy with the extra hands, which would speed up the factory's opening, and it was good when something like this created more work. God knew work was not something which could be taken for granted, even in good times for the economy such as this one. So when one of the new builders made a very stupid mistake and cost them some of the construction materials, Maurizio had stood up for him and saved the man his job. Even as they grumbled, he could see the men respected him for it. Now morale was better than ever, and the kid who made the mistake learned quickly. All was well.\n\nA more economically minded man would have pointed to a larger pattern, saying that complex merging policy decisions had made the current building boom, with IRI opening worksites all over the country and creating prosperity wherever it did.

Only, things were not quite the same as he remembered.\n\nThe streets were cleaner and the buildings had a gentler shine to them. It reminded Matteo of that old American movie his father showed him so long ago. The one with the tin-man and the long windy road. Matteo noticed more of his neighbors out-and-about as well. Never in his life could he recall anyone daring to walk the streets beyond going to work or taking a quick trip to the grocers. And even then, it was best to be quick about it, to avoid any trouble. Such fears seem so misplaced, the way people were carrying on. As Matteo made his way to his front door, he overheard so many lighthearted conversations. People chattering about how much better their pay is now compared to before. How a few months ago everyone was barely meeting their rent, let alone paying off bills like electricity or utilities. Now, it seems that those troubles have passed. One could even believe, though they would be wrong, that these hardships might have never even existed for Matteo and his neighbors.\n\nMatteo, with a quicker step than before and standing tall, made his way into his apartment building.

In building on the momentum of this victory Nenni's task now was to choose between two approaches, with differing degrees of radicalism.\n\nThe first approach would, whilst radical itself, see us working within the bourgeois system. Focusing our political efforts against the fascists of the Blocchi Nazionali, appealing to workers directly, and using the tools afforded us by the Constitution, we would forge socialism in the Italian way. If even this was too far for Saragat and his social democrats, who had been grumbling darkly since their loss, then Saragat be damned. This approach would keep the party's voting base behind us and strengthen our government, even as conservative elements in the country would do everything to undermine us.\n\nYet there were those who say this would not be enough, and Nenni is inclined to listen. The enemies of socialism in Italy would be against a Nenni-Berlinguer government no matter what, and could step in to destroy the socialist project. We could, then, seize the moment, and wage a revolution won through the ballot. By weakening the King and the armed forces, and rallying the people behind us, we could outwit the enemies of socialism and destroy their power over Italy forever. Only then could our beloved country be free of the fascists once and for all, so we can create a better Italy with no one holding us back!\n\nWith the party's intrigues complete, Nenni called Berlinguer to him to discuss his decision."

While the recent election results did not turn out the way Luca was hoping, he was sure that the Democratic Front would surely collapse like the pitiful house of cards they are.

Standing in front of the parliament building he condemned the \"immature and baseless acts\" of a \"few overzealous students.\" In the same speech, Nenni quickly pivoted to condemning recent provocations made by the Blocchi Nazional, going so far as to blame the party for the recent acts of vandalism. He stated that if they were not so \"pig-headed\" and \"aggravatingly obtuse\"; such \"spontaneous undertakings\" would be far more \"sporadic and restrained.\" This has upset the Blocchi Nazional to no end; calling for action to be taken against Nenni for his remarks and dismal condemnation of the students."

The purpose of the rally was to celebrate the programs established and laws passed by the newly elected government. While the plan was to have the rally be attended by several unions and political organizations, including known radical Enrico Berlinguer and his supporters; word of the demonstration quickly spread. By the night of the event, several student orgs. And thousands of workers spontaneously demonstrated their support by holding rallies of their own, or joining in on the official assembly. The tone of the rally quickly shifted to a more militant one; due to the influx of extremists at the event, spurred on by Berlinguer, who radicalized the crowd. Soon, workers were shouting pro-socialist slogans and demanding further major reforms to be implemented by the government; while still praising and honoring Fronte Democratico for its success so far.\n\nPolice units were called in to break up parts of the rally and to reign in the radicals who were inciting the crowd. This led to several altercations; many of them turning violent. One such including a young student being subdued and detained by an officer, before several workers shouting anti-police slogans assaulted the officer and freed the youth. Still, such cases were extremely limited and the rally was mostly unaffected by the police presence.\n\nBy the end of the assembly, Pietro Nenni made an appearance; humbly accepting the \"groundswell of popular support\" he and his party members had \"graciously earned\" from the Italian people. He stood atop a makeshift platform constructed for the event, along with several other Fronte Democratico members. Enrico Berlinguer was also present among the celebrated party members.

The sudden call to the palace didn't sit well upon his mind: when he passed the law for the first, failed, referendum on the monarchy, nothing had transpired from the Quirinale, not even the smallest rumour or whisper. Dead silence. Therefore, it came as a great surprise that, now that he had passed the law for a second referendum to be held, the King had summoned him with all due fanfare.\n\nWhile he waited in front of the closed doors, he thought about it. Did he want to bargain? Was he going to abdicate? Yes! That was it, he wanted to officially recognise the right for the Italian people to choose its fate, free from crowns and shackles. The doors opened, and he entered the room. Umberto II, King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia, stood behind his ornate desk. \"Welcome, Prime Minister, please have a sit\" the King said, a kind smile on his lips. Nenni opened his mouth to speak, but the King was faster: \"Your Ma-\" \"There will be no new referendum\" The politician's eyes went wide. \"That's impossible! The parliament has voted!\" Umberto's voice and expression became hard: \"With the powers given to me by the Albertine Statute, I refuse to promulgate the law, and hereby remove you from your office\" \"But wha-\" \"Did you ever consider the implications of such an action? Did you ever think about the consequences of turning from a fascist dictatorship into a socialist one?\"\n\nNenni tried to explain, but suddenly two armed commandos entered the room. The King spoke once more, his voice strained by barely contained rage \"You are a small man with an even smaller intellect: you may have spent months preparing for this political charade, but I have spent ten years preparing for democracy to return to Italy, and I will suffer no interlopers\". Then, he looked at the soldiers: \"Bring him away. Tell general De Lorenzo to commence execution of Piano Solo\".

What made them finally take notice was when, the next minute, dozens of Carabinieri in mimetic uniform stormed Italy's political heart. No shots were fired. There was no need: politicians and party officers are not known for their military training, after all. When the first screams echoed in the corridors, there was at first surprise, then worry, and finally, panic.\n\nEveryone started running, to what they didn't know, but surely away from the men in camo uniform. Some, still remembering the days of the underground resistance, quietly slipped into secret corridors littering the ancient palace, but most weren't that lucky. Half an hour later, with Palazzo Chigi and the Parliament secured, hundreds of Carabinieri in more ordinary uniform came in dozens transport vans, filling them with ministers, MPs, party officers, bureaucrats, some still in formal dress, crowded like common criminals and sent to pre-selected reclusion structures. Some MPs from the DC, strangely untouched by the mayhem, protested with the officers now patrolling the empty corridors of what was once the beating heart of democracy, but all got the same answer: \"The parliament is closed until further orders, we are not authorised to disclose confidential information\".\n\nLess than an hour after Nenni's arrest, the operation was complete, but the true plan had just been set in motion: the gears of an ancient engine, rusted and rigid after years of stillness, suddenly jumped alive as if electrocuted, shedding the rust and revealing the cold, merciless steel beneath it."

They weren't soldiers, but much worse, for the SIM, the feared Servizio di Informazione Militare, had their headquarters there.\n\nThe nearer one got to a certain room on the fourth underground floor, the tighter the security became: that room was the heart of the SIM, filled with knowledge so terrible it could never become public. The gravitational centre of all activity was a small table where a single man, dressed in high uniform of the Carabinieri, held a sealed folder in his hands: the man knew it, for he had sealed it personally years ago, at the behest of the last Duce of Fascism. \"Ciano's final legacy\", he thought, but the name on the old label was much more mundane, nine crudely stamped letters which would change Italy forever, to protect the young democracy from extremists and traitors.\n\nAn operative brought a telegram, awakening him from his reflection: \"King secured. Activation order given. Parliament stormed. Communists arrested. Some fleeing. FD offices stormed. Unnecessary losses avoided. Non-hostile personnel spared. Requesting further instructions\". The man in high uniform nodded, and returned his gaze to the folder: once opened, there would be no turning back, for orders, no matter how old or terrible, are still orders. Giovanni De Lorenzo broke the cover's seal, the letters glinting under the artificial light: \"PIANO SOLO\", because when De Lorenzo had asked who would participate, Ciano had answered \"Solo i Carabinieri\".

After years of fascism, though Dante knew he never suffered like his parents did under the tyrant Mussolini, the country had transitioned to democracy. Due to the further liberalization of the government and its laxing of political restrictions, Dante and thousands of his fellow students were exposed to ideals they had never heard of before. Ideals like the works of Karl Marx, Amadeo Bordiga, and Antonio Gramsci. Contemporary figures such as Enrico Berlinguer were, miraculously, able to capture Dante and his compatriot's newfound radicalism and channel it into a more tightly honed expression of discontent. But it seems, despite all the political education and organizing on the part of the students, it was all going out the window. But Dante didn't care. For the triumphant moment of the working class had come. Or at least Dante hoped. Because just as easily things could go south, really fast. Hence, the ever overcrowding lobby full of socialist radicals of all-stripes. What was taking them so damn long? And then as if on cue, the screen flashed and the two men Dante was expecting appeared on screen.

The disparagement political parties now under the single commanding banner of socialist liberation! With a leap out of his seat, Dante gathered his friends around him.\n\n\"Now is the time! It is our duty to aid comrade Berlinguer and the working class in ushering in this new era of Italian Socialism!\" Dashing out of the building, followed first by a few, then a whole swarming mass of fellow students, Dante made for the nearby town square. There, right in the center, stood a 7.62 metered flagpole. The flag of the old order flying limply in the air. Dante, with all the vigor he could muster, climbed to the top. As he was climbing, he called out for a plain red banner. With the banner of working people in one hand, he tore off the old Italian flag, and replaced it with the banner of the future. Clinging to the top, Dante could see for miles around other squares and poles, the lowering of the old flag and the raising of the red banner. Yet some, if not more, still flew the old national flag proudly along with the banner of socialism. Truly, the peoples' will was ascendant in his country. And Dante couldn't be more pleased."

Perhaps it was unavoidable; after all, when one only knows one system for year after year, all problems are naturally ascribed to the dysfunction of that system regardless of the true cause. Naturally, we know the truth, but the people will be resistant to any attempts to reverse the popular democratic reforms.\n\nThat being said, the people do not necessarily need to know our true intentions all the time. So we can extol the virtue of the democratic process, and we can welcome the challenge of other parties for the soul of the people, but only insofar as we have to.

There are two major options that have been proposed by the various blocs within the party.\n\nThe first option is that we go alone, and attempt to balance out the various factions of the BN. This would help maintain our electibility, but there are fears that party infighting could lead to such a government being ineffective. On the other hand, we could form an unofficial alliance with the DC by moving more in the conservative direction as compared to the fascist direction. While this would lose us popularity from the far right, it would also appeal to more of the Italian population, and likely assist us in governing. This choice must be made deliberately, so that we can get down to the business of actually governing Italy."

The truth of the matter is that the good Count has far more in common with us than with any of our immediate rivals. Perhaps he may not agree with all of our more... zealous members, but such is the benefit of being a big tent party. Our alliance with several monarchist groups has given us a good standing amongst those with aristocratic backgrounds, among whom the second Duce is a prominent voice. Asking Ciano for a public show of support would therefore stand a significant chance of success and would hold large potential rewards."

This may seem like an odd choice, but it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe middle classes are usually the most economically-minded members of society, and they vote primarily on who'll be best for the economy, and, in turn, their own livelihood.

With the electoral victory of the Blocchi Nazionali, the high-ranking members reunited to discuss what should be the next steps. The moderate wing argued that the BN should respect the new democratic institutions to consolidate its own power, while the hardliner wing argued for a return to the glory days of fascism without any kind of compromises. After many accusations of \"defeatism\" and \"lack of vision\" on both sides, it became clear that there was no real plan or political agenda to follow the victory at the elections. \"The political landscape has changed. I stand for the fascsist principles like anyone in this room, but we need to adapt to this new reality. Pragmatism is a necessary evil for our movement to survive.\" De Marsanich argued.\n\n\"Nonsense. The movement is strong by itself. We need to crush these weak socialists and restore order like we did decades ago.\" answered Rauti passionately.\n\nLauro eventually joined the feud. \"I understand that sometimes compromise is necessary but we can't sell our ideals like this. Democracy is the enemy of fascism not its friend!\"\n\nEventually, everyone started to scream at each other without coming to any agreement. Rauti even requested Almirante to expel the moderates from the party for \"treason to the fascist cause\". Growing increasingly tired after hours of loud noise in that hot small room, Almirante slammed his fist into the table. \"Enough of this! We are supposed to be the vanguard of fascism, not a bunch of screaming animals.\" Silence invaded the room, as Almirante finally made his decision. \"I already made up my mind about what is the best course of action for fascism and I hope you'll respect my decision as Prime Minister and head of the party.\""

Almirante planned for a more informal reunion at the sauna with his colleagues to relax a bit and laugh about the old times. But for a fascist, the duty always comes first. The congress of that day had the objective of reconsidering a coalition with the Democrazia Cristiana, discussing the possibility of a joint legislative agenda.\n\n\"While our party still remains strong after the last elections, we may need support from the Democrats for our next projects. Besides, the Socialists could represent a threat and everyone in this room can agree that we don't want them to push their libertine agenda. Right, Mr. Andreotti?\" De Marsanichi exposed.\n\n\"Uh, sure. Our party appreciates that the Blocchi Nazionale was willing to approach us in the first place. If we can compromise on our... small differences, I'm sure that this coalition could work.\" Andreotti answered. The two gentlemen engaging in a civilized discussion was a breath of fresh air for Almirante compared to the loud madness from a couple of days ago. \"However, the final decision is up to our leader. He'll decide if we move forward with this.\" De Marsanich said looking at Almirante with a smile. Almirante knew that De Marsanich was probably just licking his boots because he favored the moderates, but for once it felt good that his party recognized his rule.

The Duce would be so ashamed to see his beloved party capitulate to the whims of the liberals. Walking on the streets, he reflected on how fascism has reached this low point.

Possible confrontation with the enemies of fascism. Logistical and military support needed if fight escalates.\" Borghese chuckled at the request. It was obvious that Almirante was actually planning to use full force to bent the government to his will.

As he was preparing to leave his small cabin outside the capital, he tumbled with an old photograph of his family: his wife, son, daughter-in-law and his grandchildren all posing happily on the beach. Tears started to come down his cheeks. How did his family end like this? His beloved Stella left him ten years ago, after losing her fight with breast cancer. His son gave his life in the desert to keep up the fire of fascism alive in the Middle East. And how his grandchildren thanked his great service to the proud Italian nation? The male one became a lawyer, defending the rights of the deviants and communists that are threatening the fabric of society with their subversive actions. The younger female one became an actress, working at the den of degeneracy that is the cinema industry. And their neglecting mother does nothing but enable their corruption, so it was no surprise to him that they became like that even with the best fascist education. As far as he could tell, the three were dead to him. All these years, he felt like he was truly alone in this world. But there was a time when he was truly happy.\n\nAfter returning from the First War bitter and resentful, he joined the Blackshirts with the hope that he could make a difference in saving his beloved Italy. That fateful day of October, he marched in Rome with his fellow Blackshirts to demand the King to end the weak democratic government and put a true patriot in power. With the appointment of Mussolini as Prime Minister, he felt like he was part of something bigger. It was the happiest day of his life and he loyally served the Duce for the next thirty years. Full of confidence, he was ready to save Italy from the abyss that was in it because of the traitor Ciano. Democracy won't corrupt the minds and souls of the children ever again. Italy will rise from the ashes with another march on Rome! With a smile on his face, Pietro closed the door to make history once again."

All were ready to execute the plan: storm the Quirinale and force the King to declare the state of emergency and suspend parliament. \"Are you all ready to make Mussolini proud?\" he said, raising his arm in salute, and all nodded. The group followed the slight slope of the hill, a light, continuous noise in the distance further masking their movements, until they reached the Palace's entrance, guarded by two Fanti dell'Aria of the Honour Guard: with a silent signal, one of the fascists, a decorated veteran of the Russian campaign, knocked one unconscious, while another put a hand on the second one's mouth to silence him. The light noise became more pronounced.\n\nWhile the Blackshirts bound and gagged the two men, the rest surrounded the gates. Almirante made to speak, but suddenly the noise became deafening. A helicopter appeared, bathing the square in artificial light, and dozens of windows opened to reveal the snipers lurking behind. One of the fascists tried to fire, but screamed in pain as he was hit to the shoulder. All others surrendered immediately.\n\nAn officer in high uniform came out of the Quirinale and went to the now-handcuffed Almirante. \"Prime Minister, in light of your treason, His Majesty relieves you from your office\" he said for everyone to hear. Then, he whispered into his ear: \"You are a small man, with an even smaller intellect. You might have spent months preparing this little charade, but the King has spent 10 years preparing for the return of democracy, and he will suffer no interlopers\" Almirante looked up, and saw a familiar face looking at him from a protected window. \"DAMN YOU!\" he screamed at the King, but Umberto didn't react. Then, the officer spoke to one of the soldiers: \"Bring him away, perhaps he will enjoy confinement in Ventotene. By the King's order, activate Piano Solo\" The soldier saluted: \"Yes, commander!\" and led the traitor away."

They had barely reached the gates, when their leader, a young man who had impressed Almirante for his strong faith in fascism, felt something was off as he saw the entrance unguarded, and then he noticed something round and small rolling towards him. \"STUN GRENADE!\" he screamed to his men, but he had no time to react before it exploded, filling his eyes with white, and deafening him. He stumbled blindly, barely taking notice of the arms throwing him to the ground, but he definitely felt the handcuffs cutting into his wrists, and the shame coming with it.\n\nThe other teams met a similar end: the Fourth Blackshirts \"Amba Alagi\" couldn't even reach the Prefecture before they were seized by more than a hundred Carabinieri, the Sixth Blackshirts \"Eroi di Legnano\" took heavy losses when they tried to fight their way out from being encircled near the parliament, and the Eighth Blackshirts \"Duce\" suffered the same fate when they underestimated the enemy forces defending the armoury of the Polizia Municipale. All across Rome, gunshots could be heard, and the people ran to the windows, only to see dozens of police vans unloading hundreds of Carabinieri, and replacing their cargo with men in black shirts and camo uniforms, some limping, others holding their injuries, but every one of them shared the same expression: shame.

They had been so close: when the fascist supporters had attacked Forte Braschi, one of the fifteen old brick forts protecting Rome, they had merely wanted to storm a lightly guarded armoury. How could they suspect that, under the façade of an obsolete fort, was a maze of heavily protected bunkers housing the HQ of the Servizio Informazione Militare? The fools didn't even have the time to load their guns...\n\nWhen he returned to the command room more than twenty meters under the ground, an aide took him from his reflections: \"General! A dispatch from our field operatives!\" and gave De Lorenzo a short telegram. \"King secured. Activation order given. Government buildings stormed. Parliament secured. Traitors arrested. Some fled. Non-hostile personnel spared. Unnecessary losses avoided. Requesting further orders.\" The general knew this was the moment he had been preparing for. He went to a secluded archive, one where none had set foot for at least five years if the dust was true: there, he looked for a folder he had personally sealed more than a decade ago, on the orders of the last Duce of Fascism. His hand brushed the rough cardboard files, reading names he would have gladly forgotten, until he found what he wanted: the letters were a bit faded, but still clear in their simple, rough characters. Such a boring name for something so important: \"PIANO SOLO\", because when De Lorenzo had asked Ciano who should have participated, he had answered \"Solo i Carabinieri\". He broke the frail seal and took the first, yellowed paper sheet, titled \"Azioni indifferibili per la sicurezza dello Stato\", and returned to the command room. All noise stopped, everyone looking at him. \"All men! Commence execution of Piano Solo!\" and noise filled the room once again."

 christdem.35.d:0 "The second ever Italian election after the end of Fascism in Italy have yielded a decisive result: the decidedly centrist coalition of various Christan and liberal parties have secured a majority of Parliament. A formally-dressed King Umberto II could be seen designating the small-statured Amintore Fanfani as Prime Minister, and instructing him to create a new cabinet. The new Prime Minister, who had previously overtaken Aldo Moro as the leading figure of Democrazia Cristiana, has shifted the party somewhat leftwards, promising cooperation and collaboration with the Fronte Democratico on the pushing of their agenda. This significant move has angered many of the more conservative members of the coalition making up the new government, but the dominant position Fanfani holds in the DC has allowed him to maintain this new direction the party has chosen to go down.\n\nIt now lies on Prime Minister Fanfati and his government to guide Italy through the increasingly-tenuous situation in the Middle East, along with the accompanying domestic unrest from the rapidly worsening economic situation Italy finds itself in. Needless to say, the new government faces many problems as it enters Parliament, but that has not swayed Fanfati's promises of success - one characterized by peace, liberty, and democracy."

The many wings of the party looked back at him, their faces calm but their eyes betraying the uncertain hope they held in him to guide Italy through turbulent times. The political left could offer words of support where they agreed, and plenty of condemnation when they didn't. The political right sent him the nicest letters, when they could be stirred to bother sending them. Such was the price of attempting to chart a center course.\n\nIt had taken nearly five minutes to calm the assembled delegates before he was finally allowed to speak. His prepared speech lay written in cards in his suit pocket, but with the worried glances being shot into him from all sides of the room, it was quite obvious that taking it out would only further fracture the party. With a forced smile and a wiping of his brow, he attempted to speak on how the party could bridge the growing divide both within Italy and indeed within itself.\n\n\"Compromise,\" he began, \"Compromise had led to the end of fascism, to the end of political tyranny and uncertainty within Italy. The voters selected me for this office not because of radical ideas and bomb throwing populism, but because all Italians knew that whether they agreed with us or not, the Democrazia Cristiana offered practical, functioning solutions.\" He wiped his brow again and gave another forced smile. Some delegates even returned it. For the next thirty minutes he continued to offer his hopes for the future of Italy and its democracy, his hopes for party unity and confidence, and his hopes for an end to uncertainty and panic. Perhaps the delegates did not truly believe him, but as long as they could say that they did, it was good enough."

The camera flash echoed across the room, immortalizing the Prime Minister and the politician beside him within the finite medium of film.\n\nOn the left side of the photo stood the Prime Minister, dressed in a fine suit and tie, extending his hand out towards a local member of the Democrazia Cristiana. On the right side of the photo stood that local member, a former farmer and always pious catholic turned local politician for the city of Salerno. Captured in the back of the photo, behind Fanfani and the local politician was the Prime Minister's entourage, a motley assortment of baby faced university graduates turned interns, grizzled party operators, and trusted aides. If one could look close enough, they could see the relief in their eyes at another successful meeting. Few had suspected Fanfani's move to reconcile the Party's left and right would succeed, but all within the party would be glad that it had.\n\nGlancing at the photo, the reporter scowled when he saw that the lighting was off.

He stands on the stage and smiles, the lighting and editing effects ensure that he appears more photogenic than usual. \"Good evening to the viewers both in the studio and at home, I am thankful that across our humble nation the vast majority of not only Democrazia Cristiana voters, but in fact all voters are watching.\" he begins, still maintaining his composure, \"It is undeniable that times have been better, and some have even begun to question the very founding principles of our democracy. To these rioters and criminals within our streets, I can only offer my most sincere condemnation. If you truly wish for change then you can institute it like a normal, civilized member of the population and not as a bomb throwing barbarian. My government has embraced a wide ranging platform of simple, commonsense solutions to the crisis at hand and I will, if you give me just an hour of your time, explain them to y-\"\n\nThe speech cuts out suddenly, as the store owner changes the TV's channels to last night's football game.

The Catholic Church and its Pope, Paul VI, for example, had been more than willing to meet with the Prime Minister when asked. It didn't take a genius to figure out why. Fanfani could ask the Pope for stability and peace within these troubled times to shore up his government, and the Pope could use the photo opportunity to stress the unity of being both Italian and Catholic, two ideas that had once seemed almost irreconcilable.\n\nThe meeting itself was, to put it bluntly, almost benign in its content, both men clearly occupied elsewhere. The Pope would ask for guarantees of the government to maintain peace and ensure religious freedom, and the Prime Minister would agree. The Prime Minister would ask the Pope to make sure his flock would remain peaceful and equitable even in the face of violence within the streets, and the Pope would of course agree. At the end of the meeting came the most important part, where the two emerged from Saint Peter's Basilica and embraced.\n\nTomorrow, a photo of that embrace would be on the front page of every newspaper in Italy, and accompanying it would be the newest editorial from the Pope, requesting peace not just for the sake of the government, but for the sake of humanity everywhere."

 christdem.56.d:0 "It had taken every year of political experience and grit that Fanfani had to accept the reality that no matter how many flowery speeches and calls for unity he gave, the simple reality was that the Democrazia Cristiana would not unite around him. The Party Right was too apathetic, and the Party Left too divided to ever build the coalition that Italy needed if it was to push forward through such troubled times. With a heavy heart, he had picked up the heavy phone on his desk and placed a call to an unlikely ally. Giuseppe Saragat, leader of the Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano.\n\nAs the two men sat together in the Prime Minister's office, a strange and awkward silence stood between them. In better times it would have been easy for them to talk the night away on topics of policy and politics, but the reality was that Fanfani was the Prime Minister, and the other was only an embattled party leader.\n\nWith some difficulty, the silence was eventually broken, and they began discussing how a middle ground could be formed. Saragat made sure to not let his surprise at the news of Fanfani's decision to move away from his own party show on his face, and Fanfani maintained his composure even during the diciest moment of their negotiations. In the end, a compromise was reached.\n\nThe foundations for Fanfani's most ambitious political gambit were laid."

To say that the Democrazia Cristiana had been critical of the decision would be... an understatement. The press had been vicious, the voters savage, and his own former allies within the party the most critical of all. It didn't take much to imagine how they would react once tomorrow's paper broke the news of his recent meeting with the King.\n\nMeeting with the King under normal circumstances would have, at best, raised one or two eyebrows from the most radical members of the political spectrum. For years his Majesty had conducted himself with an aura of dignity, one that could only be formed through years of dedicated public service. Under normal circumstances, Fanfani would have had nothing to worry about when meeting his majesty.\n\nIt was a shame that these were not normal circumstances.\n\nHis intentions when meeting with his majesty, especially in light of the meeting with Saragat, were obvious. The BN, no matter how their ideas dispersed, could all still reliantly maintain their faith and support for the monarchy. Attempting to pander to them was a dangerous proposition for the Prime Minister, but one that had to be done. He had no idea how his legacy would look, how his supporters would react, and how his own party would fare at the next election. Whatever happened, it did not matter, for with a triumphant shout, he finally finished crunching the numbers. If everything panned out as it should, he would have his majority."

Through the speaker system placed on top of it, excerpts of a recent speech were played one after another, with Fanfani's words mixed in with the words of various prominent union officials. For the assembled factory workers, the campaign truck was either an interesting afternoon diversion or an annoyance distracting them from their food, depending on who you asked.\n\nTwo workers in particular, brothers from a small town outside of Naples, listened intently to the truck, even as it pulled away to drive to another factory. Turning to one another, the oldest spoke first, commenting on how glad he was to see the union bosses and the Prime Minister collaborating. A patriotic military veteran who served with distinction in the Levant, he stood as a polar opposite to his left minded younger brother. His younger brother folded his arms across his chest and listened intently, considering what to say. When at last he finally spoke, it was to the surprise of his older brother.\n\n\"Despite what misgivings I have,\" he began, \"I must say it is good to see the Prime Minister refusing to blame the violence on the unions. It would be terrible to have the actions of a few bomb throwing radicals put us all out of a job.\" As he finished speaking, the factory bell rang signaling the end of their lunch break.

Following an intense period of review and investigation by a specially appointed commission, the reported findings had long been suspected but not confirmed. Until now. The Confindustria, an employers association and long a pillar of the Italian economy, was hopelessly inefficient as currently run.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, no obvious easy solution presented itself for remedying this issue. Within the report, the commission had offered two possible solutions, each one equally flawed in its own right. The first solution, written by the commission's more left leaning members and idealists, proposed to simply place greater government controls and regulations on the body, in order to ensure greater efficiency. Without a doubt the leaders of the Confindustria would fight such regulations as hard as they could, and it was questionable whether allowing the same corrupt bureaucrats to continue to run the organization would fix anything at all. The other option, written by pragmatists and the commission's old guard, proposed a simple fix. The Confindustria had been fine up until the democratization, they argued, all it would need to get back on its feet was the return of its old runners who knew the ins and outs of the economy. The only problem: that same old guard had been removed for being fascists without remorse. It is certainly doubtful that the population would simply accept such individuals regaining their old power.\n\nAs appalling as the options presented are, a choice must be made. We can only hope that we make the correct one."

A man dressed in a formerly fine suit, one now caked with dust, debris, and other bits of clutter stumbled into the Church. The clergy looked on with grave concern as he entered, unsure if the man should be in the church or in the hospital. To those present's imminent surprise, the man did not move to pray. Instead, he took the hat off his head and placed it in the center of the Church's foyer, and next to it he placed a simple picture of one of the victims. Out of respect, the clergy placed several candles to mark the spot and assumed nothing more would come of it.\n\nOver the next couple months they would be proven dead wrong.\n\nAt first they came as a trickle. Survivors, family, friends, and anyone else involved. With each visit, the shrine slowly grew. Soon it turned to a flood, as many who had no connection to the tragedy other than a shared sense of hopelessness came and added to the shrine. It grew steadily, soon attracting the intention of not only the press, but even the prime minister himself. In a photograph shown across the world, Prime Minister Fanfani visited the shrine, personally lowering his head in solidarity with those lost.\n\nWhile the shrine eventually was taken down and cleaned up, and for some, even forgotten, the clergy present would never forget it. Decades after the bombing and its aftermath, not a single member of the clergy had even once thought about throwing away the photo taken of them with the Prime Minister."

He begins speaking. \"Now I am sure many of you are less than pleased to have me interrupt your football game or television drama, but if you'll just lend me a minute of your time, I'm sure you will find it worthwhile. There has been much uncertainty and fear recently over the growing terrorist attacks and violence within our nation's streets. I am here to assure you that the government is doing everything possible to protect our citizens and find the cause of this rampant lawlessness.\"\n\nThe image changes, and now several clips begin playing in succession of one another. The Polizia are seen on patrol, each one dressed in an impressive uniform and brandishing a rifle. Next an Italian family is shown enjoying a midday meal outside, the children smile and play as the parents look at eachother free of worry. Finally, several successive scenes are shown of various investigators and detectives working, each one carefully and analytically completing their investigation.\n\nThe scene changes back to the Prime Minister who is now smiling at the camera. \"As you can see, the government has everything under control. I can promise that we have already begun to get to the bottom of this and it will not be long before we return to normalcy.\" The screen freezes on his smile, and a small signature appears on the bottom left corner of the screen."

If the reporters could have seen their thoughts, perhaps tomorrow's paper would have been quite different.\n\n\"No matter how I think about it, I can't help feeling just a little disgust with that man to the right of the Prime Minister. Isn't he a friend of the last Duce, Galeazzo Ciano? Surely such a man's hands can not be completely clean in this whole ordeal, I wish Fanfani would stop associating with him.\" Saragat thought to himself.\n\n\"This entire gesture is ridiculous, we're campaigning for unity when we should be crushing those protesting reds in our streets. If only I had won the last election... I'm sure Saragat must be thinking the same thing.\" Thought Lauro to himself.\n\n\"At least they were both willing to do this. I can only hope the political blowback from the rest of the party won't be too severe... oh, the press wants a photo.\" The Prime Minister thought to himself.\n\nLeaving their own thoughts behind, the three men all smiled for the camera, but not one of their smiles reached their eyes."

The many banks that compromised Italy's financial sector had, no matter how many promises of potential benefits and concessions offered by the government, stringently refused to work with the Prime Minister's platform of catholic capitalism on his terms. Rather, they continued to demand the right that if they were to work on it with him, it would have to be on their terms.\n\nAs the Prime Minister sat at his desk after another day of fruitless negotiations, his gaze fell on the calendar on his desk. He had known the date when he had woken up that morning. He had known the date when he had gotten lunch with his aides before the next round of negotiations with the Banks. Only now, at the midnight hour, did he truly recognize the significance of the date.\n\nHis term, one which had opened with promises of stability and prosperity and had stuck through thick and thin, was slowly nearing a close. The fight with the banks was clearly not going anywhere fast, not with the next round of lawsuits and ad campaigns they had threatened to kick up. And all the while he was losing what hair he had left dealing with this, many more important issues lay on the back burner. He had never been one to back down from a fight, but surely now was as good a time as any. As he finally broke his gaze with the calendar, he knew what to do."

Expanding on such programs is not only a good way to build Italy's future today, but it is also a good way to boost Fanfani's stagnate approval numbers.\n\nWith every bill passed increasing funding for these widely popular programs, Fanfani has ensured that he will be the face of it. At the opening of new school's he will cut the ribbon, at the graduation of new university students he will clap in attendance, and at military parades for new cadets he will be there to salute the soldiers. It is important that every person who has benefited from the program will know firmly that it was the Democrazia Cristiana who made it all possible.\n\nWhile some may look at this with the disgust of a cynic, the people will know in their hearts that it is for the best.

At a podium in the center of the stage, a professor carefully vetted by the man's aides gave a gripping speech to the students in attendance. He spoke of the virtues of moderation and Catholic modesty in the face of soulless communist materialism and hateful fascist nationalism, every syllable going over the head of the thoroughly bored student body. In the back, reporters gathered to snap a photo of the moment of the Prime Minister cutting the oversized ribbon and bow placed before him, a symbolic ceremony to celebrate the opening of the campus's newest building.\n\nFar in the corner of the assembled students, under the cover of an old tree, two of the school's more left leaning students sat observing the spectacle. They joked together and mocked the speech being given, each one equal parts amused and agitated by the professor's dry speech on the evil's of an ideology he clearly knew little about. For them, it was all in all a pleasant enough way to spend half an hour.\n\nEventually the professor stepped down from his podium and the band present struck up the national anthem. With a broad smile, the prime minister received an oversized pair of scissors and moved forward to cut the oversized ribbon. As it split in two, the stage was covered by an outburst of camera flashes as the reporters finally had their shot. When it was all over and done, the two student's before remained seated under the tree. To the annoyance of one, his comrade in mockery had remained completely silent through the entire ribbon cutting.\n\nIt took some pressing, but eventually the man gave his answer in a low voice, not even daring to meet his friend's gaze. \"I... I was already to mock it as well, but then I thought about my younger cousin. They don't have enough money to go to university on their own, not without the help of the government. I despise that pig Fanfani but... I can't despise the good that may come from this.\""

On the left sat the other man, a rising star within the party and a committed Fanfanite. Perfect symmetry.\n\nThe Prime Minister spoke in a jovial tone, his voice free of the usual stress that had dogged him ever since he had assumed the office. \"I'm glad you agreed to meet me for lunch Arnold, you've certainly made an impression with the rest of the party. When you speak of my ideas to them, they all swear that it is like they are hearing them from myself for the first time. You certainly have a bright future ahead of yourself in this party, perhaps when my term ends it will be you who ends up taking my spot as PM.\"\n\nForlani smiled and looked down at his food, the Prime Minister's words echoing around his head. He had long been swayed by the man's ideas of Catholic capitalism and Christian democracy, without a doubt, and hearing such praise from the man himself was a dream come true... but...\n\nHe had the strangest feeling in the back of his mind, a sort of unease that refused to present itself into view. A most cowardly, traitorous thought ruining an otherwise perfect afternoon. As he looked back up from his meal, he looked over the Prime Minister's face, daring the thought to present itself. When it did not, he sighed internally, and did his best to reenter the moment. Extending a hand, he shook hands with Fanfani."

As to be expected by such radicals, rather than helping the dismayed old man, they begin to play and frolic with the spilled pamphlets.

As they laugh, the camera once again freezes on the even more dismayed face of the oldman, and another prompt is put on the screen. \"What the Democrazia Cristiana voter would do in this situation:\"\n\nAnother group now enters the empty square, each one dressed respectfully and modestly in clothing fitting for a formal occasion. Even the youth among the group are dressed modestly, with one of the girls present making the sign of the cross before going over to assist the old man.

It felt good. Damn good in fact to hear those foreign correspondents choke on the same words they had lambasted him by. It was a moment that called for a drink. Taking a small bottle out of his desk drawer, one he was sure would cause quite the fuss if the press found about it, he poured himself a drink. Raising the glass up to the television, he made a toast, to himself.\n\nOn the other side of Italy, another man watched the same footage, a slowly burning anger building up in the back of his mind. With every word of praise given by that foreign correspondent, he felt it crash against his own experiences, against the way the government and the corrupt bureaucratic fucks who ran it had screwed him over at every turn. \"Enough!\", he wanted to shout, \"Enough lying, enough spinning and sugar coating!

Economic growth was decent, the international position was alright, and for the first time in a while, the constant protests and social unrest was beginning to flow away. Years later, looking back at that day and those that would follow, Fanfani felt like he should have known something was off.\n\nSometimes, when he was alone at night, the man would play the events over in his mind, attempting to detach himself from his own seat and see the full picture clearly.\n\nHe sat in his chair facing the aide, a fresh faced youth just out of university who had been the most dedicated Catholic he'd ever met. Down the hall from his office, a man was sprinting towards it, his face coated with shock, an urgent message he had been told by the uniformed men downstairs to deliver to the Prime Minister lay crumpled in his white knuckled fist.\n\nA minute out now from the news that was to be delivered. His aide was checking his watch as he idly told the Prime Minister about the recent demonstrations in Palermo, the Prime Minister wasn't listening as he instead thought about what to have for lunch.

Italian students can be seen celebrating in the streets, and King Umberto has personally entrusted Giuseppe Saragat as the Prime Minister. In the years after the inceptive election of Italian democracy, Saragat, the head of the more-moderate Italian Social Democratic Party, has steadily garnered his party a leading role in the leftist coalition. With more radical socialist and communist parties reduced to mere coalition partners or expelled from the leftist bloc entirely, and Pietro Nenni, the previous leader of the coalition, seemingly beginning to recede from the once crowning public position, the leftist coalition seems to be more united than ever.\n\nThe question now lies on the newly-formed government to manage the increasingly-deteriorating situation in the Middle East, as well as the ensuing domestic unrest, and to guide Italy once more towards the path of their agenda. In a move that surprised little, the Blocchi Nazioonali and it's related partners have pledged fierce opposition to the FD and all related activity. However, in a much more significant statement, the Democrazia Cristiana - likely because the more-moderate wing of the Fronte Democratico has taken control - has announced that they will be collaborating together to pursue an agenda that accommodates both of the coalition's agendas."

Ever since the Hot Autumn strikes a year earlier, Italy had been embroiled in the worst turmoil it had seen since the end of the war. Violence and terrorism were the order of the day, from both leftist and rightist agitators across the country.\n\nRestoring order to a deeply divided nation seemed like a Herculean, if not insurmountable task.\n\nBut whilst Saragat seemed like a meek, soft-spoken man, there was a hidden resolve beneath his spectacles. Now was his time. Time to not only restore order and heal the rifts of a deeply divided nation, but also to, as a result, create a fairer, more just Italy.

The government could not get to the bottom of the atrocity without the SIM's cooperation, after all.\n\nMany from both politicians and the general public criticized the government's decision to reshuffle the SIM. Some said the government was trying to stack the deck in their favor. Right-wingers and the BN in particular claimed that the government was 'politicising the SIM', and that it would abuse it in order to persecute them and their supporters.\n\nIt certainly was not a good look for the government, with newspapers and broadcasts across the country condemning it.

However, we agree on the biggest issue facing Italy today: this violence and terror has got to end! The FD has our support in stabilizing our country!\"\n\nIt would be too much to expect the DC of Armintore Fanfani to join the FD-led government in a grand coalition. But it was clear that Saragat's olive branch to DC was not without fruit. Both in public and in private, Armintore Fanfani made it clear that the FD and DC had broadly similar goals for the situation: to stabilize Italy and safeguard Italy's fledgling democracy from those who would do it harm.\n\nWhilst many of the more radical elements of the FD grumbled at the fact that Saragat was open to working with DC, at the end of the day, it was necessary to put country over party.

In other words, a far cry from the mild-mannered, down to earth Saragat. One would think that the two would have clashing personalities, and that they would be like oil and water.\n\nAnd yet, that was not the case.\n\nFanfani, whilst a firebrand, was also a great compromiser, just like Saragat. It stood to reason, after all, considering DC was a big-tent party with many factions. But meeting with him one-on-one, Saragat soon realized that the two men actually had quite a bit in common despite their differing personalities.\n\nThe meeting of the two men lasted quite some time. But by the time both left the room, both had smiles on their faces. Perhaps it was because they were able to get a lot of business done, or perhaps the two men just enjoyed each other's company.

In some ways, he was a modest man quite similar to Saragat himself. That said, the man certainly was not wanting for charisma. He was a heartthrob for leftists across Italy, even those who weren't necessarily fans of the communists he was associated with. Perhaps it was because he gave off the aura of an honest, genuine man, who wanted to make life better for Italians. None could ever doubt the sincerity of his intentions on that front.\n\nWhilst Saragat would never be able to claim Berlinguer was a bad person with a straight face, he nevertheless needed him on board during these trying times. The problem was that Berlinguer is a very outspoken man, and he has had some biting criticism of Saragat's government, and its 'inaction' on the issues ravaging Italy.\n\nNevertheless, he was an integral part of the FD coalition.

It was largely the same platitudes about unity in these trying times, and how it was important for every Italian to look out for one another. What mattered was that it was received well, and that the crowds cheered. That was it. To show that support for the government was still there, even as Italy was in flames.\n\nAs Saragat's speech wound down, before closing it out with a fervor that one would be surprised to see from the mild-mannered gentleman, there was silence... at first.\n\nAnd then the clapping started.\n\nThe crowds were cheering.

Attended by notables from all the parties of the FD, the rally made it clear that, whatever divisions there may seem to be, FD was a united front. At least, on the issues that mattered.\n\nThe rally was a roaring success! It was widely reported throughout the Italian media.

As one party, and only one party. The PSI and the PCI, along with their many allies, no longer exist; its members, and elected officials, are now simply members of the Fronte Democratico. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSome people from across the FD's various factions were not happy with this development. But the leaders of the FD argued its necessity. Both for making it easier to contest elections, as well as showing to the Italian people that the era of the fractious left was over. Italy needed unity now more than ever.

And drag through the mud the media did. It seemed like the FD could do nothing at all without being raked over the coals by the media.\n\nBut that did not perturb Saragat and the FD. They would not let broadcasters with chips on their shoulders dissuade them from doing what was right. For the party, and for the country. Even though the media seemed to be hellbent on slandering the government and tearing it down, there was no choice but to press on, no matter the cost.\n\nFailure was simply not an option."

To some, it's associated with fundamentalism and traditionalism.\n\nNot so for Saragat and the FD. Of course, they obviously supported 'family values'. But to them, it meant more \"taking care of the family\" than about traditionalism or morality.\n\n\"Excellent healthcare for every Italian! Generous pensions for elderly Italians in their golden years! A thorough education for young Italians so that they may become productive members of society!\"\n\nThese points underscored the FD's messaging on 'family values'.

It was for this reason that Berlinguer and Saragat increasingly began to voice their support for each other and increased their cooperation. After all, no progress could be made for Italy when the government could not agree with itself.\n\nSome of the moderates in the party were wary of working with a noted communist like Berlignuer, but they ultimately kept those doubts to themselves.

It was a simple speech, meant to shore up support amongst the students for his government. A speech about how he supported the students, how the FD was tackling the terrorism crisis ravaging Italy, the economy, and so on.\n\nThe response of the students seemed to be positive!

So what was going on?\n\nPeople in DC and FD were growing increasingly frantic as the hours passed with no trace of Moro to be found. Increasingly, the fears that this was a kidnapping grew steadily, which further added to the pandaemonium amongst the parties.\n\nSuffice to say, the investigation was immediately diverted into a manhunt for the missing Moro.

The conservative coalition, including members from both monarchist, post-fascist, and more moderate right-wing parties, has undergone a series of transformations since the first election since the revival of democracy in Italy.\n\nIn a telling display of the conclusion of the death of Fascism, the moderate bloc of the BN has ultimately began to take a commanding lead over the coalition, and the radical extremes of monarchism and those advocating a return to the Fascism of old have slowly been phased out of the mainstream.\n\nAs a stern-faced King Umberto II appoints Achille Lauro - the leader of the moderate wing of the BN - as Prime Minister, they are now faced with a challenging task: managing the rapidly worsening situation in the Middle East as well as on the homefront, while also preserving the democracy some in the coalition seem so eager to once again destroy."

It must be stated these people are but extremely patriotic friends of the state, nothing more.\n\nThrough a wide array of phone calls, letters, and backroom deals the press started printing just what Lauro wanted.

Amintore Fanfani and Arnaldo Fortani, the kingpins of the Democrazia Christiana. The three of them were some of the most powerful men in Italy, and they were going out for brunch. Eventually, they parked outside of some quaint cafe amid one of the busiest areas of the city. As they sat down to eat, they realized they hadn't actually any idea what to talk about. So, they turned to the absolute centrepiece of any conversation, sports! It turned out that Amintore was a fan of soccer too, and watched the same teams Lauro did.\n\nOver the course of the meal, the tensions surrounding them melted away, and they were well into conversation after the eating was done. Political discourse, small talk and of course the odd joke about their own parties made the hour. It seemed that Amintore was a nice guy, and Arnaldo was interesting, as quiet as he was. Lauro had finally enjoyed his job for once, and got some erstwhile friends out of it too. He chuckled to himself, what else to mend political rifts than mediocre food and slightly better talk?"

The Fronte Democratico, a primary rival of the Blocchi Nazionali, has come under soft pressure. Many in the BN have taken it upon themselves to criticize those that have not called out the perpetrators, especially socialist groups. Despite the fact no clear evidence even proving the bombers are socialists, this has made a convenient route to demonize socialist groups that could serve as threats to the BN's rule.\n\nThe FD itself is included within this ring of parties, but no outright statements have been made against it, for fear of the press picking up on it and spreading the BN's blatant usage of the situation to further their own agenda. They may eventually concede, but for now, Lauro laughs knowing his rival bleeds."

Those original followers of Almirante and even Scorza have been taken aback to these actions and now some even leave the party. Public demonstrations, letters of resignation and complaints all show clearly the frustration present in the party. Despite all their crying and shouting, Lauro likely couldn't care less. In his mind, the more his section dominates, the better. He is even now purposely pushing these members to leave, and outright removing others. Regardless of how detrimental to short-term stability it may be, it will run out smooth, just like the plan says."

His past. Or, at least, that was the story he wanted to present. Why people didn't like him wasn't a concern, only how he can change their minds. After some excruciatingly long strides, he reached the podium. Looking out across the sea of reporters, a barrage of lights assaulted his eyes. The press was always eager to take pictures. He looked away quickly, lest he go blind. Shuffling his neat collection of papers, he laid them out across the thick mahogany stand. The bleaching white lights that operated above him illuminated only his position in the large dark room. Unlucky, he thought, because he must've appeared quite nervous. Adjusting his collar and clearing his throat, he began.\n\n\"...and that, the fair people of Italy, is why you must trust me! For the good of this nation and for the good of its citizens, I am the one who will lead you. My associates, and my own past, must be put aside. I am another son of Italy, as all of you are, and I share your struggles. That is why I must appeal to you for your trust so that our great nation may prosper.\"\n\nWith those closing remarks, his speech was done. Almost immediately, a wave of questions knocked aside the quietness of the room, asking him to respond to this accusation or that one, some scandal he must solve. He didn't have time for it. Rushing off the stage, his plea would be spread across the empire. For better or worse, Lauro cannot be viewed as an extremist, only as a friend of the people."

 marsanich.8.t:0 "A Most Royal Meeting"
 marsanich.8.d:0 "Another day, another meeting. Lauro had met so many faces, and shook so many hands at this point that it all started to blend. But today, this one was special. This time he would be meeting His Majesty Umberto II, King of Italy. Lauro, like any good Italian politician, is at his heart a monarchist. What else is Italy if not a monarchy? But, he also understands the power the King wields in government, and now must make a good impression. Pulling up in the limousine to the Quirinal Palace, Lauro just had to take a moment to admire its grand architecture. Its magnificent spire sat outside, triumphantly soaring into the sky. It was evident much meticulous effort was put into the construction of such a building. But now was not the time to gaze at carved stone, now, Lauro had to conduct politics. Entering through its grand doors, he was ushered into a finely decorated room without much reception. After some 20 minutes passed, the door opened.\n\nIn stepped the King, followed in close stride by a servant. Lauro hastily stood and bowed. The King, in truth, cared not for such pleasantries and wanted to get down to business, much the same as Lauro. The servant was waved out of the room on a mission to bring the two men tea. The King casually sat down on the couch across from Lauro, forgoing much of any greeting but a cold handshake. Lauro didn't entirely know what to do, but took a seat regardless. There was a still tension in the room for the longest time as the two men eyed each other. Eventually, Lauro broke the ice by talking about the building itself, the furniture of the room, whatever else to get things going. By the time the servant had brought the tea, the two started to indulge in small talk. And, of course, they eventually reached politics. In Umberto's mind, Lauro associates are perhaps an antithesis to the democracy he has helped construct, but he is tolerable. And so, the conversation went on, and so did the cups of tea. The talking only truly ended when the kettle was empty."

 marsanich.9.d:0 "Lauro was really starting to get sick of all these meetings. How many people did he have to talk with, eat with, shake hands with just to get what he wanted? A lot, apparently. And so it went on. Every week, he picked out the nicest suit he had, rode around in the limousine the government gave him, and met somebody of varying importance within the Italian hierarchy. And when it was done, he still had an entire day of work left! Madness, he thought, madness. If this is how frustratingly difficult being prime minister was, he would've never done it. At least today, he got to meet someone a little interesting.\n\nRiding into the Vatican is, technically, entering another nation. But, at the same time it is like crossing the street. Entering through the old and glorious marble structures, he finally received a warm reception. Bishops, cardinals, priests, all the like, greeted him. However, much like many of his other meetings, he was brought into a room and told to wait. The room he entered was not very quiet, however, cameras and their crews stood off to the wall and awaited the entrance of the man of the hour, the Pope. If the Pope liked the prime minister, it would be a comfort to much of Italy, being a catholic nation after all. And so, he entered, followed by a possy of different men in robes and suits. They both put on a good show for the cameras, discussing topics Lauro was told to talk about exclusively. And, at the end of it, perhaps the Pope really did like him, and with it the blessing of God."

In Rome, the BN had decided to organize a rally for its members in wake of new tensions throughout the city, being the hotbed of politics within Italy. At the rally, there was more than just the average political guy who joined for something to do. Columns of BN \"affiliates\" lined the square, the very same affiliates which have been stirring up such a fuss for the past few weeks. Mostly what the average Italian citizen would consider an extremist, the groups caused a racket just getting to the parade square. For Lauro, managing these people was a nightmare, and standing on the stage above them he felt powerless. It is why he must get rid of them, eventually.\n\nA few blocks away, more activity was going on. Differing political groups had taken to the streets in an attempt to decry Lauro and his associates, regardless of their actual relationship. Polizia were dispatched to set up road barricades and control the protests' ever growing intensity. But it was for naught, and all they could do was sit by the side as the mob marched around, destroying cars, getting into fights, everything that makes a good protest. Lauro could hear their shouts, even from so far away, and worried about this rally of his. The current circumstances would have to do, so he thought. He had persisted through worse, and this will be no different."

Every day, police officers were pushed to the brink with constant calls about an attack somewhere or the other. Lauro's desk was being tested by the countless reports of political terrorism and underground movements. Many feared to leave their homes, what if they became the next target of some violent paramilitary? It was clear the situation was only getting worse, and that the fires were only being stoked by some unscrupulous groups.\n\nThe reality was that Italian politics had changed, and changed very quickly it had. Now in part dominated by illegalized movements and paramilitaries, the wars of politics are no longer just fought in parliaments with words and paper, but also in the streets with knives and guns. It was something many refused to believe for a long time, but now every decision made must have its repercussions considered even more."

Laying a wreath of flowers at its base, it would serve as his commemoration to Piazza Fontana. Making sure to have a camera following him, there was an effort to publicize the event and make him more sympathetic in everybody's eye. But, deep down, Lauro truly did mourn the event. The atmosphere of years past had now clearly faded, replaced with one of violence and bloodshed in the name of political gain, and Piazza Fontana was the hallmark of it. When once you could walk the streets at night without fear, families now cower in their homes before it is even dark. Where you could interact with practically anyone without dread of their intentions, now many avoid even locking eye contact with others.\n\nYes, on that day, a piece of Italy died with the many in the explosion. It is now up to Lauro to try and restore that, or at least try. The deaths of those on that terrible day would not go forgotten under his watch, not for a long time."

Everyday, somebody claimed to have finally exposed him for the extremist he is, or that he has been working with some group the equivalent of the Nazis and wishes to bring down hell on Italy. But today, it was different. The morning's timid quietness was suddenly broken by the cry of a paper boy.\n\n\"Read all about it! Prime minister orders riot put down! Several injured in fight with police!\" And so repeated these words many times, in many parts of the city, and eventually many parts of the nation. The day previously, one exceptionally large protest was getting too close to parliament for comfort. In a manner of minutes, riot boots were on the ground and tear gas canisters were being shot. Panic and chaos ensued, as it usually did, and rioters engaged the police in a brutal battle. Screams and shouts, punches and batons were thrown out across the street. By the end of the short lived carnage, the riot had dispersed and those unlucky ones were left on the street with several broken bones. And as Lauro slowly read the lines of the paper, he felt a mixed bag of emotions. The riot was suppressed, and the battle was over with him having won. But, any action always has its aftershocks. Anarchy is a springtrap always loaded, one wrong turn could be the one that opens it."

And so it went on. Today, he must make another plea to the people for their trust. Despite all his actions, or misactions, many still see him as an extremist, one that wishes to tear down everything Italy now is and spit on Ciano's work.\n\nOf course though, this couldn't be farther from the truth. But the reality of politics was that the truth isn't always what is believed, and Lauro knew this all too well. And so, as it was, he would host yet another press conference. The words he said were not as important as the message they conveyed, and sometimes getting the message through to the press is a nigh-on impossible task. He told them of his undying support of democracy and the values he and his predecessors have held up, of how much he loves the ballot box and not the will of dictators. Perhaps people did listen, but then again, they could very well have just not bothered. Maybe someone would read the speech on page 2, but others would be too busy flipping to the other channel or doing the crossword. He would get his message out, somehow."

You can't exactly fund a rally without the stuff, and you can't run a campaign if your bank account is negligible. So, if Lauro needed some extra cash, where could he find it? With the corporate fat cats, of course. And so a back alley meeting was organized, men from the government and guys from corporate.\n\nWalking into the old car park, Lauro felt as though he was about to be mugged. A sickly dampness wafted around the deteriorating concrete, and it was as though it could fall in on them at any given moment. At the center of the floor, a black van was parked, with three men in suits leaning against its side. To Lauro, this all seemed rather illegal, but whatever paid the bills. Meeting with the businessmen was an entirely different venture. The men themselves were the definition of sleazy, and their business reflected it. Fat cigars rolled around in their mouths, and they wore greasy suits with even greasier hair. The word crime just oozed from these guys, but they were cooperative. After some tense words were exchanged, they reached a mutual deal where Lauro would get his money and big corporate would get their power. Regardless of how these people were, Lauro could and had to look past it, for any of his plans to work."

All of these events, he was closely followed by a camera. The point of all this after all, was to make him be seen as strong, relatable and valiant to the Italian people in these trying times.\n\nWhether people actually bought it was an entirely different story. News reels and pictures of the prime minister's visit to a summer festival in Tuscany could be skipped in favour of yesterday's game. But, regardless, Lauro followed the close advice of his public opinion board; who could possibly just be feeding him bullshit while they collect a hefty pay cheque.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The two men entered, both exquisitely dressed, and both controlling shares in some of the most important sectors of the Italian economy.\n\"I'm glad you made it! Come, have a seat, take off your coat.\"\n\nThe businessmen were evidently in a relaxed mood, taking their good time in sitting down. Lauro was quite the contrary, finding difficulty achieving even a modicum of comfort in his chair, fidgeting with his thumbs as he formed the words in his mind.\n\n\"I'm sure you know the government appreciates your time here today, as do I. I was hoping we could try to come to some sort of ag-\" Lauro was cut short by the man sitting to his right.\n\n\"Yes yes, to make a deal. Do you think we come into these things without previous knowledge of what we're doing, Mr. Lauro?\" The man was clearly quite rude, but Lauro needed his cooperation.\n\n\"Err.. Yes, well, I will be giving you the land rights to a few profitable Algerian oil fields for your support in a number of contracts.\" Almost immediately after he said this, the man to his left spoke up.\n\n\"Of course, we'll be happy to.

His people hate him more by the day, and even his own government seems to have lost their trust in him. And everytime he reads an article about some kid gunned down on a street corner, or the police engaging with rioters, he loses a bit of trust in himself.\n\nIn the Italy of today, it is built as a house of cards. One little breeze, a protest suppression gone wrong, or a scandal sent out of control, is all it takes to knock it over. Lauro knows this, and the situation is pressed into his mind every time he has to meet with his advisors, or the police chief, or god knows who else. All of them will give him bad news.

Lauro realized that people like this would never listen to words, no matter how many documents you shove in their faces, no matter how many speeches you make asking them to stop. No, you have to make them stop. And so it was, on a bright, sunday afternoon, that the call went out across the nation.\n\nPolice vans rumbled to life in every major city in Italy. Roadblocks, barricades and boots on the ground were placed in every intersection. Protests were contained and shut down. Almost in the blink of an eye, the riot police were marching triumphantly against a crumbling tide of protesters. The brute force of the Zhdanov cocktail and fist could not best kevlar gear and sturdy batons.\n\nBy morning, a strange sense of momentary calm had washed over the nation.

Lauro himself could now for once sit back and relax in his office, without being barged in on by a frantic intern with seven new letters from the chief of police.\n\nPublic reactions to the sudden change of atmosphere have certainly been varied. Some respect Lauro finally putting his foot down and teaching those no-good kids a thing or to. Others, not so much. But Lauro was used to it by now.

Radicals and extremists are being hunted like wild game, cornered and brought to extinction.\n\nAll those who ever dreamt of threatening Italy, all those who dared to try it, have been served the answer to such acts. Never again will such things happen, not so long as Lauro is alive and breathing. Never again will citizens be afraid to leave their houses and never again will terrorism haunt Italy's people. It turned out that determination really would see the plan through, just as Lauro envisioned it."

But, as with all good things, it must end one way or another.\n\nLauro was awoken with a jolt as a subordinate slapped a newspaper onto his desk. He almost wanted to lambast the man there on the spot, but his eyes instinctively drew to the headline. \"Aldo Moro reported missing, political scene in shock!\" Really. Would the work never end? Lauro got up from his chair with a haggard sigh.\n\n\"I want a full investigation conducted on this, bring in the chief of police here, we need things to move fast.\" The subordinate seemed to understand well enough and nearly hopped out through the door, not wanting to catch the prime minister in a bad mood. Lauro tossed his suit on hastily and strided out the door. Much more work was left."

They couldn't be farther away from the truth - merely, we are patriots who wish for nothing but the greater good of Italy. With Lauro now at the helm, we can strive to isolate the more fascist elements of the coalition by empowering Lauro's own party, the Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity, and the moderate elements of the Movimento Sociale Italiano - significantly reducing Almirante's importance in the movement."

Amintore Fanfani, current leader of DC, is notoriously a pragmatist and savvy politician - if we hold talks with him, we could be able to broker an agreement between DC and Blocchi Nazionali in order to make our hold on Parliament much more stable."

This menace to established order can only be countered by a wide front of anticommunist forces, and we are the only political force strong enough to make sure that coalition happens. By presenting ourselves as the only alternative to Italy falling into the throes of chaos and revolution, we can sway DC and minor parties into working with us, thus ensuring our hold on parliament is unbreakable."

These opposition groups were largely tolerated by Almirante, as they tended to represent the younger wing of the party, brimming with fascist revolutionary fervor - but now we simply don't need them anymore. We have gathered a list of prominent names of MSI politicians and party members that will be booted out of the party, and forever condemned to political irrelevance in the fringes of the Italian far right."

While our respect for the monarchical institution is unending, we do believe that a King, especially a King like Umberto, is meant to reign, and not to rule. Much like Mussolini was able to strong arm Vittorio Emanuele III into submission, so shall we make sure that His Majesty Umberto poses no threat to our government."

Especially in rural areas, the Catholic religion can be an important part of the lives of individuals and entire communities - however, much of the strongly Catholic electorate in Italy has been monopolized by our rival party, the Democrazia Cristiana. If we ever hope to further expand our support base, we must drag away Catholic votes to DC - by making significant political ouvertures to the Church, promising to uphold the Catholic doctrine in issues such as divorce and abortion, and other such concessions, we can start making a dent in DC's hegemony over Italy's Catholics."

Despite its flaws, excesses, and little mistakes, under the reign of Mussolini Italy achieved the greatness which it had always been denied by other nations. We should make sure that textbooks and historical divulgation always stresses the importance that the fascist regime had in making our country what it is now - dissident voices, such as those of upstart historians who demand to rewrite our own national consciousness by criticizing fascism, will be silenced and dragged away from universities and academia, so they won't be able to poison young minds with their leftist drivel anymore."

The sheer size of both of these conflicts means that even today in the country there are many veterans of one, sometimes two, world wars - and veterans are one of the main pillars of our electorate. By creating a single, state sponsored organization for retired military people, we'll be able to further reinforce our hold on this vital electorate, while at the same time use them as a mouthpiece for patriotic, nationalistic propaganda."

Now that it finally happened, we should make sure that his vision is not betrayed and that the flame of nationalism continues to shine over Italy - but to do this, we must adapt to changed situation. By professing our loyalty to democratic institutions and reassuring the Italian public that we plan to continue safeguarding Italian democracy, we can ease other political forces in the country into working with us, and thus enforce our agenda in an easier way."

However, the truth is that we don't have much control over the organization - and sometimes, there have been regrettable instances of FUAN members being engaged in violent acts and publicly espousing ultra-radical and frankly disturbing political positions, ranging from praise of Nazism to admiration for the SS. It is imperative that we get rid of these hotheads and lunatics inside FUAN, so we can reign in the organization and make sure that they're the blossoming flower of national youth, rather than violent, unpredictable extremists."

All these people, who don't necessarily have any sympathy for fascism, can still be responsive to our nationalist message - and by dropping the more overt callbacks to fascism, and substituting them for a more moderate rhetoric, we can massively expand our support base and lead the charge for national reaction against the communist advance."

The Piazza Fontana disaster has profoundly scared our society, so it was no surprise that the people chose us to resolve the situation and restore order. However, it is first proper to publicly and solemnly mourn the deaths of the victims - turning funerals into political rallies to convince the people that we shall find the culprits, bring them to justice, and ensure the safety of Italy. Some would argue that mourning innocent victims is something that should be kept as distant from politics as possible, but we would argue that those who died in Piazza Fontana would be happy to know that their memory is entrusted to us."

However, said cells can be quite loud, distributing their propaganda and annoying the average citizen. These dangerous radicals would probably absolutely start escalating from loudspeakers to bombs if they could: we have no concrete evidence they were behind Piazza Fontana, but a few people in a Milanese anarchist circle have already been connected by the local police to the recent terrorist attack.

Everyone is placing the blame on them, and we barely had to do anything to convince them. Now, what we must do is continue throwing fuel on this fire - as long as we're all united behind a common enemy, the Italian nation will be strong and cohesive under our guidance. We still have no real evidence that the anarchists had anything to do with Piazza Fontana - but the tentative scraps and hints will be enough to drive the people into a fervor just enough so that they'll keep supporting the government."

The Italian citizens have associated prime minister Lauro to reassuring figures, like those of our brave Carabinieri patrolling the streets - we are the only ones that can protect the average person and their family from the lurking threats of radical ideologues and other assorted fanatics. While the anarchists we are investigating for Piazza Fontana keep denying their involvement and no concrete evidence has yet turned up, we can drag on the processes more and give them more publicity, in order to truly convince the people that we are their best hope to restore order and peace in the country."

This notion of organic unity is something that every person in their right mind can recognize as just - except for troublemakers, rabble rousers, and other opportunists who undermine the unity of the nation for the sake of their own envy and greed.

It has also been one of the most proactive unions in the recent labour agitations, demanding for improved working conditions and better contracts. Much like us, CISL is also opposed to communism and socialism, but it has worked with leftist unions such as UIL and CGIL in the past. If we open up negotiating table with CISL and CISL alone, we can divide the labour front - and all we'll have to do in exchange will be agreeing to a few concessions from their agenda."

Communist organizations are radicalizing unionized workers, and the recent disturbances of the Hot Autumn have reminded everybody how harmful unions can be when out of control. In order to regain a firm control of the situation, we must place our men directly inside the major Italian unions - undercover policemen and secret agents will infiltrate the major leftist labour organization, reporting any suspicious or unpatriotic activity directly to the government. Sure, this is extremely illegal, but that's merely a small detail."

So far however, the movement has failed to attract any real following among the Italian workers, and has been nothing more than an appendage of the BN. By throwing more funds to CISNAL and make it appeal to right wing, middle class workers around the country, we can begin the struggle to defeat our enemies on their own turf."

Since then, INFPS and its successors have helped millions of Italians lift themselves out of abject poverty while at the same time cementing consensus for the government thanks to extensive welfare programs. We shall reform and reintegrate this system into a new, centralized welfare organization, the ENPS - inspired by the original INFPS, it will coordinate efforts to help the poor, the elderly, and the other weak strata of Italian society, while making sure to widely propagandize these efforts. Of course, we can't just give handouts to everybody - those who are helped must prove their worth in the eyes of the Italian state, and ethnic Italians should always come before native subjects of the Empire."

Expanding cultural and social associations while at the same time controlling the media to propagandize our message, we will do our best to uplift the people's' consciousness while instilling them the values of patriotism, devotion to work, and large families. Giving tax cuts and handouts to large families, encouraging mandatory labour shifts for government programs, and churning out more and more nationalistic propaganda will surely be effective in ensuring the Italian people's devotion to a greater good."

Homosexual and feminist propaganda, anti-Italian rhetoric presented as anti-imperialism, and outright communist and anarchist ideas are being spread by these cells and groups, undermining the unity of the Italian nation.

It is imperative that we send a strong message - a proper display of force in the streets. By deploying tanks, armored cars, full squadrons of riot policemen, helicopters, mounted police, and other such bombastic shows of strength, we will not only reassure the average Italian that we are really out to protect him, but most of all we will make any future would-be rebel think twice before challenging us."

We just need one final push - a dramatic increase in the budget allocated to our military and police, which will ensure our work isn't stopped just short of finishing by financial needs. Restoring order is of the utmost priority, and we're closer to achieving this goal than ever before - soon, Italy will once again be united under a common purpose, one no fanatic or ideologue can destroy."

While this inevitably exposes us to the risk of the value of our currency fluctuating alongside the price of oil, the relative stability of the oil prices, ensured by ENI, meant that our currency remained stable and strong in the past.

Thus, this State of producers must be organized along corporativist lines, allowing for the control of the productive forces and processes.

Several currents, cliques, and wings dominate its inner workings, and the party keeps itself together as a result of a delicate balance between all these different components. In order to truly dominate Italian politics, Fanfani must first dominate DC - and the Prime Minister has two ideas as to how to do that.

Whenever they turn on the TV or open a newspaper, Italians will find the calming smile of the Prime Minister - whenever they listen to the radio, they will hear his reassuring voice.

Taking it slow might work, but we now have voters who hold us accountable. Our experts have already begun drafting initial proposals for our first phase, namely devaluing the lira. If we manipulate our own currency just right, our exports should explode.

The only major difference in how we conduct trade compared to our Roman forebears is that we possess the power to soar through the blue sky like eagles in our steel airplanes.\n\nIf we want to have an export industry that rivals the major powers, then we will need to pour all the funds we can muster into our roads, airports, and docks. Of the three, the airports should have the highest priority. After the damned Atlantropa forever destroyed our access to the Atlantic our seaborne trade has decreased significantly, only kept alive by our control of the Suez.

A particular issue the DC has been forced to grapple with it the fact that capitalism often promotes behavior that is decidedly immoral from a religious point of view.

Plaques will be set up, portraits of those who died in the bombing will be hung on the walls of the prime minister's residence in the Palazzo Chigi and the President's at the Palazzo del Quirinale. There will be time for changes and debates soon enough, but for now, the people of Italy stand side by side in the wake of tragedy.

Piazza Fantana had made it clear that the growing tensions between political groups was becoming a clear danger to state stability. If communists and fascists pushed each other too far... Fanfani didn't need to spell it out for the two gentlemen. As the night wore on it was clear that nothing concrete had been established, but, Fanfani thought to himself as he watched the cars pull away, they had agreed on a second meeting.

Or see the many new neighborhoods of government-funded housing programs that now dot cities from Sicily to Lombardy. We have even given incentives that allow even our poorest citizens to pull themselves into a better life. Of course, the people remember the good we have done when it matter, we will make sure of it.

Rather than presenting ourselves as brutes only interested in our own gain at the expense of all others, Italy shall now strive to find its place in the world standing beside its partners in trade and diplomacy. Diplomacy and trade are not zero sum games when played correctly; they can lead to the benefit of both players when one is willing to play honorably and amicably.

The Americans have a very market-based system compared to ours, and while we are certainly not socialist, even we balk at allowing private corporate interests so much influence and power.

Private industry is both tolerated and promoted by DC, so long as it does not hurt others, but leaving something as vital to the people as fundamental as this is in the hands of profit driven men, however well intentioned, is unacceptable.

The current tax system is not a successful example of this balancing act, but it can be with enough tweaks. We aren't communists, we have no desire to redistribute wealth, but that doesn't mean we have no need for revenue. On the contrary, our social policies will require some tax increases in some areas.

The ANM has cut all ties to the Italian government, nationalizing colonial assets after a long-winded denunciation of Italy's neo-colonial ambitions and fascisitc government.\n\nThe ANM's rule is hardly secure. Both Jewish and conservative Arab paramilitaries remain in active revolt against the government in Jerusalem, and sectarian violence has been all but exacerbated with the introduction of new ideological currents to the region. Thus far Habash's response has been ill-defined at best and non-existent at worse, in fear of further splintering his own base of supporters. It appears that increasingly authoritarian measures will need to be taken in order to return the region to any semblance of stability, measures that Habash himself is unwilling to enforce as of yet. If violence continues to escalate, however, there is no telling as to what the ANM regime will be forced to do to stabilize the region once and for all.\n\nWhatever happens, this is certain: Italy has lost its last vestiges of influence over the Levant.

With Ankara on the offensive, the balance of powers across the middle east had shifted significantly, and Italian authority needed to be reinforced and unquestioned. Under his firm hand, Dubai would be turned into an anchor of the Empire's authority. He had served his country well at sea, and now he would have to serve it from the office: His discipline and dedication unchanged.\n\nGiuseppe Oriana spent the rest of his day in various meetings. With the Emirs, with the ENI, and with the Admiralty. He had scarce time for the mannerisms of the first, could not bear the second, and barely felt at home with the third.

ENI leadership conferences breezed by as symbolic confirmations to every decision Mattei put on the table, and even the Admiralty offered a confused sort of approval of the vigor with which the man conducted himself and his governorship. Regularly conducting talks and meetings with members of all three factions, Mattei somehow managed to tell each and everyone one of them exactly what they wanted to hear. The natives would see more rights gained and restored. The Dubai project would finally be materialized to its potential and beyond. The Regia Marina would reign dominant east of Suez. Best of all, the man knew that it could all be reasonably accomplished with drive and with capital.\n\nRelocating from his office as Chairman of the ENI to the rather drab government outpost nearby to the port was simple enough, and the man managed to maintain his sense of style in the cramped office building he was offered with the job. What he truly missed, however, was the sight of the Persian gulf greeting him from behind shimmering windows.

There, he rose through the ranks, climbing the company's hierarchy before becoming its head just after the end of the war. Yet, Mattei's ambition was far from being satisfied.\n\nAs the Empire grew massively during the war, it found itself in control of a staggering amount of rich oil reserves. A new situation required new methods, new technology, new organization, new trade deals - more wells, more refineries, more workers, more money, more oil. AGIP grew under Mattei's direction, until it was finally reorganized into ENI, an industrial and financial behemoth capable of standing toe to toe with Japanese Zaibatsu. From his new headquarters in the Gulf, Mattei watched his own empire grow, becoming the main architect of the Dubai Project - a shining city in the desert, which began as a pet project of fascist colonialism and turned into a capital for Mattei's oil kingdom.\n\nAfter the Italian victory against Turkey, Mattei made another grab for power, and pushed for his nomination as Governor of the Gulf. As the oil king's rule was recognized, his plans for reform in the country are already becoming reality, as he brings the local emirs into the colony's government, while at the same maintaining a cautious friendship with the Saudis - something his critics often point out.

Eventually, Rome found the perfect place to employ Oriana's talents, one as far away from Italy as possible: the Persian Gulf.

With the Italian defeat against Turkey, a shockwave of instability spread across the Middle East, and as the local emirs become more and more intolerant of Italian rule and turn to Riyadh instead, Oriana was named governor of the Gulf, as his Fourth Naval Division is the only force strong enough to provide stability in the region. With the Dubai Project now coming to a crashing halt, Oriana must do whatever necessary to maintain order - quickly understanding that the emirs' tyrannical and petty rule is the greatest obstacle in his path.

Naturally, if all of those inspected have nothing to hide, then they have nothing whatsoever to fear."

More particularly, we're struggling to find volunteers who see military service as a sacred duty, and not just a means to make a quick buck or an outlet for vicious desires.\n\nRectifying this issue won't be easy -- the lines at military kiosks grow ever shorter, and the number of body bags returning from the colonies has a tendency to dissuade even the most fervent of recruits. However, with a wide-scale propaganda campaign, we have no doubt there'll be more soldiers than uniforms to clothe them or guns to arm them with in no time! Which might be another problem we need to address."

In order to transform the Regio Escrito into a military truly worthy of Rome, we must find those who are truly possessed of a fighting spirit, and meet rigorous requirements for mental and physical fitness before hand. They will not be easy to find, but within crooked alleyways and ramshackle hovels, we will find them nonetheless, these sons of the New Italy, our diamonds in the rough."

Once more the streets are festooned with the tricolor, and buildings with the portraits of the three heroes, Mussolini, Ciano, and Almirante.\n\nHowever admirable, this patriotic zeitgeist does us no good unless we make use of it. Our government will begin a program of promotion for the military, especially the recently expanded special departments. The airwaves, radios, and billboards will be blanketed with the sounds and sights of brave young men in uniform, valiantly defending their homeland.

What was once a poorly motivated army of conscripts is now a truly professional fighting force, which can stand equal in equipment (if unfortunately not in size) with the greatest nations of the world.\n\nAs the next step in this program, our government has launched an initiative to create a \"special forces\" unit, made only of the best and brightest culled from elsewhere in the military. While the commanders of those units complained bitterly, we don't need them. What we need is an army that can fight the conflicts across the Balkans at the same time, an army that can win the battle and the people alike, an army worthy of Italy."

With the ADRA on the field, no enemy bridge was left standing, no airfield intact.

Mountain warfare provides unique challenges and opportunity, and it's the only situation where infantry still holds the upper hand: with no armoured forces, only a fraction of air support, and only light artillery - often still horse-mounted since not even trucks can climb such inclination - capable of providing any help, it's a priority that we train our mountain troops to the highest degree.\n\nLuckily, our Alpini are among the best mountain infantry in the world! Tested in fire and blood, on the Alps during the First World war, and in icy Russia during the Second, they still serve with pride and loyalty.

This results in an airforce of old men and toadies, more interested in faking battle reports than actually fighting.\n\nWe will slash through these outdated ideas with vim and vigor, and replace them with a system of carefully calibrated rewards that assures that new ideas are actually incorporated into the Airforce, and the best pilots have the opportunity to spread their capabilities to others.\n\nSoon the rot will be purged, and the Italian nation will rule the skies of the Mediterranean as it does the sea and the land."

Unless these problems are immediately rectified, we risk losing what capable talent our nation does possess\n\nThankfully, the BN has always been committed to proper reform, and so we shall implement new standards and regulations to keep our Ace's doing what they do best.

 ITA_scorza_ending.1.d:0 "It had been 8 years since Scorza had become the Duce of Italy. 8 grand years, since the triumphant victory over the forces of old, of the rot that had afflicted the Empire for too long.\n\nScorza gazed upon Roma, perched on an eloquent marble window frame. He knew one thing: the galvanizing victories; the crushing defeats - they were his. For 8 years, he guided Italy, for good or bad, through the hardest times it has faced yet. Although it had only been less than a decade since that fateful day in Verona, it felt like more than a lifetime.\n\nOne constant struggle marked his time in the seat of power - a constant war, between those who wanted to change Fascsim to adapt to the modern times, and those who wished to ensure it returns to its roots. This battle was all-encompassing, all-important, and perpetual in its entirety; such unwavering tension will tire even the most strong-willed of men.\n\nHe took just a minute to enjoy the glittering cityscape of Rome, lit by a bright array of light in the midst of the inky black that had descended oncemore with the sunset. A particularly large skyscraper - constructed in the years following his ascension to Duce - caught his eye. Scanning the imposing edifice from bottom to top, it was clear to him: Fascism had borne such bountiful fruit, such wonderful and awesome gifts to the once-destitute Italy. Those who had been swept by the wayside in the pursuit of this goal - unfortunate losses, of course, but nothing in comparison to the greatness Italy now possesses. There was one issue, a thought interjected: What is Fascism? Was it the show of the popular might, a shared will of the people? Was it the glory of the State, the Duce above all?\n\nOnce again, Scorza confirmed to himself, it had been his will alone that came to dominate what Fascism had become.\n\nHad he made the right choices - the best choices - in perpetuating Fascism's glory? Overcoming his doubt, he knew that yes, of course he had. When Scorza stepped out of the grand hall in Verona, he knew that he would ultimately lead Fascism down the right path. The Oil Crisis, the Church, the Army, even the Party - all were dealt with, all were aligned to the path of Fascism that would truly lead to the betterment of Italy, forever and always.\n\nAs he leaned on the eqsuite frame of power, he knew:"

In an old chair in front of the fire sat an old and tired king, a cup of tea in his hand. He sipped it as the wind outside caused the window's to creak and moan, little frost angels appearing and just as quickly melting away by the heat emanating from the fire.\n\nA door creaked open and his son entered, slowly taking a seat next to the king in order to not derail the old man's train of thought. As he gazed at the man's tired and unfocused gaze, the Crown Prince without even thinking reached out and took his father's hand. \"Come to bed father, it's getting late. Whatever is troubling you so, I'm sure sitting here and staring off into the fire isn't fixing it.\"\n\nThe old man didn't react for an uneasy couple of seconds before slowly, he turned his head to look at his son, a tired look in his eyes. \"I can't... I haven't managed to have a good night's sleep since that man, Scorza, survived the latest round of protests. He's planning something, I can sense it, and I... I feel as if I'm playing chess against a man who I can't even see the pieces of. No matter what I do I... I... need to get some sleep...\"\n\nWithout another word, the old man got up from his chair and made his way to his room, leaving his son alone with the dying fire."

It is undeniable that the civil, political, and economic victories given to you by my leadership have made the Italian people the bane of the world. From the decadent dance halls of New York to the poverty ridden slums of Bangladesh, all silently wish that they could have had the good fortune to have been born an Italian. Tell me, are these fruits something that a decrepit and fixed dogma could have produced? The answer to that is of course, no.\"\n\n\"Fascism is a living, breathing idea, one that has changed for today's generation just as it will change for the generation after us. Fascism can not die for it is eternally living. Fascism can not be displaced and rejected by the future for it is the future. Fascism is an ideology that will never falter, never stumble, never be replaced. It is the only ideology that can truly guide Italy to the destiny she deserves.\n\nI will end this letter by promising that the best days are still ahead for not just us, but for fascism itself.

 scorzaseventies.3.d:0 "When the rumor had first reached his hotel room in Rome, the New York Times foreign consultant who received it had skimmed it, written it off as a prank, and then proceeded to crumple the report up and toss it into the trash. The very idea that report had suggested was, to put it bluntly, completely and utterly fucking absurd. An authoritarian fascist state such as Italy, one that refused to leave behind the 1930s like much of the world had outside of its Duce's often strange reforms and proclamations about fascism was a consistent actor, a rational actor. The idea of such a state changing its entire system so radically by implementing something as ill defined as term limits? Total poppycock.\n\nSeveral days had passed without any updates to suggest such a policy was truly to be implemented and, much to neither his future shame nor pride, the foreign correspondent had more or less written off the rumor. And then, at only a little past eight in the morning, he was awoken to the sounds of students marching and cheering in the streets. Opening the blinds, he peaked through to see a mass of young fascists and veteran blackshirts, some carrying portraits of Scorza and others waving around letters. As he stared at this demonstration, amused, he picked up his hotel room's telephone and dialed the correspondent for the Washington Post.\n\n\"Morning Jack.\"\n\"Morning Steve.\"\n\"Hey, do you know what the demonstrations are for today?\"\n\"You haven't heard yet man? It's the strangest thing I've heard in all my years of working this beat. Scorza himself went on the radio this morning and announced that he's putting a limit on how many years someone can be Duce, it's got the youth all abuzz with hopes for further reforms.\"\n\nThe foreign correspondent was silent for a long time before speaking again."

 scorzaseventies.4.t:0 "Greeting the Future"
 scorzaseventies.4.d:0 "The old man stood at the back of the rally, his grandson excitedly cheering the man taking the stage in front of them. A new generation of Blackshirts stood in front of Il Duce, ones who had never known the struggles of the earlier days, experienced the first march all those years ago which brought Il Duce to power in the first place. It filled his old heart with joy to see the youth follow the same light that he had all those years ago.\n\nHis mind began to drift as he thought about it, images appearing in his head as he did so. 1922, the year it all began, Blackshirts marching proudly through the streets of Rome as the radios played news of the King's capitulation. Fourteen years later, the triumph in Ethiopia. His mother had been so proud to see her boy returning as a war hero. Another nine years later, the victory celebrations in Rome, Mussolini raising his hands in triumph as he declared Italy victorious. On the stage, Scorza raised his own hands in victory, and unnoticed by the old man, his grandson cheered.\n\nSeveral years later, Il Duce had died, Ciano was in power now. Chaos in the Mediterranean, uncertainty for the future of the movement he had dedicated so much to. More rallies, more bombs, war in the Orient as the Turks stabbed us in the back. He was there at his son's funeral, the other members of his squad and old blackshirts in attendance with him. Another year later, the triumph of Scorza fills his heart with hope once more, more marches, more victories, more pride in his homeland with every passing day. On the stage, Scorza calls out to the youth, who enthusiastically cry back, swearing their allegiance to fascism.\n\nEven more years, his grandson becoming active in party politics much to his quiet pride. The years begin to blur as the man thinks through it all. He looks up at Il Duce on the stage. He looks frail, so frail, just like him. His Grandson, God bless his soul, had gotten so excited by Il Duce's declarations that he had pushed through the crowd to cheer on the Black Shirts. A smile crept onto his face as he watched this, a single tear running down his cheek."

Similar envelopes had, over the past week, been sent to nearly every household in Italy deemed \"politically palatable\" by the party bureaucracy in line with the directive sent down from the top. Some of the bureaucrats who compiled this had, naturally, been bewildered by the implications of the order but, it was not their place to question the wisdom of Il Duce.\n\nWhen anyone would open the envelope, they would find a simple pamphlet folded in half. Unfolding it, a simple introductory message was present, informing them that they had been selected to help influence the future of fascism within Italy. Several rows of questions were present, each one offering a different proposed policy and a scale going from \"Very Unfavorable\" to \"Very Favorable\" in order for the person filling out the pamphlet to offer his view on the matter. Questions had, of course, been carefully drafted in such a way to ensure a \"desirable\" response from the voters while also not appearing to be clearly biased towards any position. It had taken quite a few frustrating nights to achieve this, but as they say, nothing good can be produced without a little elbow grease."

 scorzaseventies.6.d:0 "It had been a busy week for his squad, far busier than even during the riots and upheaval of the oil crisis. Every Monday a new letter was delivered to an unmarked post box with a list of names, most of them no name minor bureaucrats and officials within the PNF. Each name would be underlined with one of three colors, the number of colors oftentimes corresponding with any other equipment given to his squad with the letter.\n\nIf a name was underlined in red, the order was to find and intimidate the person. Couple bruises, maybe even a broken bone if they were being stubborn. Just enough to get them to shut up and follow orders. If a name was underlined in gold, the order was to try and bribe them, usually with auxiliary funds provided for the mission. Course, some people weren't interested in being bribed with money, so if necessary additional names would be provided for prostitutes, drug dealers, and anything else that's exotic. Finally, if a name was underlined in black... well, it didn't take much to figure out what that meant.\n\nLooking at the list he had received today, he saw five names. Three were underlined in red, a group of local politicians who hung around at the same cafes and smoked the same cigars, each one more conservative of a fascist than the next. Next name was underlined in gold, some local stockbroker. A few gold coins had been provided with the letter, ones that looked like they dated all the way back to when Venice had a Doge, so that seemed self explanatory enough. Final name was underlined in black, some local policeman and hardline fascist. He pitied the poor man as he drew his gun and loaded it. Policing could be such a dangerous profession."

 scorzaseventies.7.t:0 "Dual Meetings"
 scorzaseventies.7.d:0 "At exactly six in the evening, two cars departed from two different residencies on two different sides of Rome. In one car traveled Junio Borghese, a close friend and ally of Il Duce, and in the other car traveled the Crown Prince of Italy, a look of worry on his face. Both had vastly different reasons to travel to meet their respective confidants, yet like most things in politics, it would be lying to say that they weren't connected. As they traveled, both men were left to their own thoughts as their respective drivers navigated the often busy and twisting streets of the capital.\n\nBorghese, an old man who still burned with passion and love for Fascism, considered every angle of the plan he had been sent last night in a letter. It was bold, to be sure, but such boldness was necessary to push Italy forward onto the world stage. It would take much effort to build the web of networks the Duce had asked for, but for him, no effort was too large to protect the ideology he truly loved.\n\nFor the Crown Prince, his trip was much less pleasant. Every mile of it he was left thinking about his father and his state of mind, and the letter a servant had slipped to him when they were sure any prying eyes weren't watching. It was from his father to a certain general -which one he couldn't tell due to the name being written in code- requesting an urgent meeting with him at once. He had no way of knowing for sure why his father had done such a thing, but he had a pretty good guess.\n\nScorza. That damned rat was constantly scheming and plotting something, and whatever he had cooking this time, it certainly could not be good. He had succeeded all those years ago to shut the page that was about to turn, and he would be damned if he was going to allow him to do it again. Leaning forward, he told his driver to step on it."

 scorzaseventies.8.d:0 "It had taken every ounce of skill the party bosses had to force through the new directive sent down from the top. Many had felt almost helpless when first reading it, unsure exactly how they were to so fundamentally change decades of passed laws and indeed, the very constitution itself in the time allotted to them. Still, it was quite clear that failure in this matter was not an option, especially with the number attached to the notice. \"1-49\", or as some quickly recognized it to mean, January 49: the month Caesar crossed the rubicon.\n\nWith an iron grit of determination, the party bosses set to work implementing the directive. Every favor earned through years of service was called in, a virtual media block out was carried out to ensure the King's allies would be blindsided when the announcement was made. Eyes were kept on every individual member of the team responsible for the entire operation, as even the slightest slip up could mean the failure of the gambit. A couple close calls were made, perhaps the closest being when one of the bosses had gotten careless with a secretary at lunch and had spilled the beans. It took a new wardrobe, an all expense paid trip to New York, and a bonus to her elderly father's pension for her to agree to keep quiet on it.\n\nFinally, after much hard work, it became time to step up to the plate. In a shock media announcement, Il Duce made it clear that in an unprecedented move, he had amended the constitution to strip the royal court of all direct ability to influence policy. Within minutes, the Bosses' work came into effect. Local challenges to the change were strangled in the crib before they could get off the ground, embarrassing media challenges were silenced, and protests were kept at a minimum. When it was all over, they drank a toast to themselves and a job well done."

By 10:20, the news had reached the office of Il Duce, setting off a frantic series of searches and phone calls to members of the military brass across the country. By 10:45, the news had reached the now isolated royal court, catching the already irritated and gravely suspicious King off guard. By 10:58 his son, having received an urgent call from the man, arrived to find him lying on his side on a sofa. Initially panicked by it, it took until 11:02 for his father to calm him down enough for the two to talk. This is the conversation they had, as later testified by them:\n\nUmberto II (U): \"Thank you for coming as I requested my son, I'm not sure I could face the coming trials without you.\"\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (VE) \"Please father, it was nothing. What is it that you need from me? I can not lie to you, I have been very concerned of your health recently.\"\nU: \"My Son... you are truly loyal to me and your country, far more than I could ever have expected. It is my great shame to admit to you that I have lied to you and deceived you. The letter you showed me several weeks ago, addressed to that General? I sent that to General Sogno, to discuss taking action against Scorza-\"\nVE: \"Father, you should have told me!\"\nU: \"And for that I am sorry, I should have trusted you then as I do now. I have been informed that the General has now gone missing, and I do not truly know if that is a good or ill omen for us.

Eventually, even they had to face the truth, as many other Italian conservatives, anti-Scorza fascists, and other dissenters would: no one was coming to their rescue. With a dejected sigh, the Crown Prince drove home from his father's residence, a lingering dread in the back of his throat.\n\nFor several decades after the fact, the Sogno Incident as it would come to be called remained an intensely debated topic for not just the usual conspiracy theorists and crackpots, but for many mainstream academics as well. Some would come to claim that the obvious explanation was the best one: Scorza had simply found out about the man's plan and arranged for him to disappear into one of the regime's many black holes in Africa and the Balkans. Another favorite explanation would come to be called the Brazil theory, claiming that Sogno had, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, simply fled to South America to live out in peace there away from the power games being played in Rome. Still, even more wild explanations would come to be offered as well, claiming things as wild as a plan by the Japanese Tokumusoukan, the involvement of New York Mafia Dons, and at the very fringes of the movement, alien abduction. It remains impossible to say what truly happened, but the fact remains that for the dissenters against the Fascist orthodoxy enforced by Scorza in Italy at the time, Sogno's disappearance simply became one more addition to a long list of disappointments."

 scorzaseventies.11.t:0 "The Answer Revealed"
 scorzaseventies.11.d:0 "By the dawn of the next day, it had become obvious to the King and his Son that whatever had happened to General Sogno, it was almost impossible to imagine it had been anything pleasant. Despite this, for several more days they still held out hope, waiting on the off chance that their worst fears would be proven wrong. They were at the end of their wits when the garrison in Rome rebelled alongside several others across the country. The Golpe Sogno as it would come to be called surprised nearly everyone across the political spectrum, the King who requested it most of all. Scorza and his allies attempted to fight it off with everything they had, to the point of even calling on the students to rise up and fight for them in the streets but ultimately, with the army rallied behind him, Sogno's success was inevitable.\n\nIt was as a triumphant hero that Sogno was received by the King at his residence, a virtual army of bureaucrats, aides, and guards accompanying him to the meeting. The two sat together in the king's parlor as reporter after reporter snapped photos of the two together for papers across the globe. As it slowly began to calm down, the King turned his head and spoke to the General. \"So General, what is the next item on your agenda?\"\n\nThe general looked back at him, a hint of surprise in his face as he smiled. \"You don't seem to understand the situation, your majesty. I am just a general but you are the very king of this nation. The question isn't what are my orders for you, the question is what are your orders for us?\"\n\nAs he listened to the man speak and the sounds of protesters in the distance, a frown began to form on Umberto's face."

 scorzaseventies.12.d:0 "The elevator slowly descended down to the first floor, several guards standing within it along with Il Duce, their faces steely and their weapons prepared as always. Scorza himself stood behind them, his face and hands wrinkled and saggy with age, but his uniform and eyes as bright and burning as always. The entire elevator was, to put it simply, at a loss for words with everything that had transpired in the hours prior to the ride. On the side of the elevator, a speaker chimed in to announce that it was 5 in the afternoon, and before it had even moved on to its next announcement, Scorza's mind had begun to wander to everything that happened.\n\nIt started at the beginning of the day, the big announcement and press conference where they had announced the long suspected final step in his plans for fascism. Evidence had been found, he claimed, proving the King and certain members of the general staff had been in cahoots for a plan to forcibly remove the legitimate government from power and institute a policy of slavish obedience to the Germans. It was clear then, he continued, that Italy could not prosper under such circumstances, that something had to be done. He paused then for dramatic effect before dropping the long expected bombshell. \"The Italian monarchy, a reactionary and anti-fascist institution, must go!\"\n\nThe news had polarized Italy like he had expected, and it had taken every previous precaution taken to ensure no mass upheaval would occur. For some time he had felt the very tension in the air itself, constantly wrapping itself around him and his allies and squeezing them for dear life. It was just when he was about to lose hope that the good news had come to him: the King and the royal family had boarded a plane and left for Washington.\n\nThe breaking of that news had finally cut the tension, and with a triumphant look, he had greeted the crowds from the same balcony Mussolini had stood on all those years ago to announce the creation of a new nation: the Italian Social Republic. As the crowds roared with approval and patriotism, he knew that somewhere out there, his predecessors in the party were looking down on him with pride in their eyes.\n\nAs the elevator finally reached its destination, he reached up and wiped a single tear from his cheek. He was an old man now with not much time left, that much was obvious, but he had accomplished everything he set out to do. Fascism had won its victory over Italy itself."

 scorzaseventies.13.d:0 "He sat alone in his office, a small glass of wine and ashtray his only accompaniment for the dreary hours of the early morning. Despite the great triumph he had overseen with the creation of the Republic, Scorza hadn't had a good nights sleep since, an unknown feeling weighing on his mind. As he moved to pour himself another drink, a gust of wind shook his window, turning his attention towards it.\n\nWalking over to the window, he made sure to secure it, while at the same time, he gazed out at the landscape of sleeping Rome. The streets were mostly empty, the houses dark, and the markets silent. Only an old man and his dog walked the streets at this hour, the man's face and hands weary but his clear love for the dog obvious. As Scorza watched the man, he felt a strong desire rising up within him, a will that he and the man could switch positions. He had accomplished so much in his tenure, he was sure of that, but in this moment he was just an old man, one who's youth had long faded away. He closed his eyes to break his gaze at the old man, but the idea refused to go away.\n\nWhen he returned to his desk, he opened a drawer and took out a sheet of stationary and a pen. Part of him screamed for him to stop, to turn back and face the power and wealth surely ahead of him, yet even more told him to finish what he had begun. The party had been hinting at it for years, and he had resisted them. Now, he was not so sure if he would.\n\nWith lingering doubt, Scorza began to write his letter of resignation."

 scorzaseventies.14.d:0 "Just because the OVRA was set up to investigate anti-fascist activities, does not mean they should be restricted to hunting partisans. After all, just as there is the enemy without, we know that there is an enemy within. The would-be reformers of Italian Fascism, no matter how much they claim to love their country, are a threat to national stability. Their whispers of change and promises of everything to everyone can be as destabilising as any number of car bombs planted to sow terror. Enough! Once the OVRA investigates every one of the reformers, and all their contacts, we will find something to pin on them for sure. And if we do not, there are always letters to be planted and signatures to be forged."

Yet even as the party higher-ups and the rank and file alike pledge eternal loyalty to Carlo Scorza, we can not run any risk. It was less than a decade ago that Ciano stuffed the party with his reformers, and if the worst offenders have since been displaced, we must act now to ensure the instability plaguing Italian minds does not enter the party as well. There shall be no ideological divergence, no doubt within the Partito Nazionale Fascista. And should anyone be foolish enough to stray from the party line, they will soon find themselves outside the party. All that remains then is to take care of the weeds they will have left behind."

 scorzaseventies.16.t:0 "The Army is With Us"
 scorzaseventies.16.d:0 "To a man, the Army must be with us. In the Fascist regime and its overseas colonies, the Army is the first and the last line of defence; by mobilising them now and intensifying their preparation for combat, we can make sure that every soldier's bullet is prepared to find the skull of an enemy. There will be no complacency. If we must impose martial law, then the Army will be ready, and if it comes time to bash in the chests of their kinsmen, the Army shall carry out the order. Every rank will respond with equal faithfulness to the command of the Duce, and every soldier will feel fortunate to kill in his name."

Whether they shall work to cut down on the petty criminality that comes with instability, or to chase down terrorists and their informants in the alleyways of the country, the Police shall want for nothing. And if an incident goes wrong, and a person in custody is found beaten or deceased, then we will not trouble the Police for an explanation."

In the pulpits of the most prominent churches in the country, those of our friends among the servants of God will tell their flock of the importance of humility and subservience to Caesar. Instability, insurrection and disorder are not merely the actions of sinful men - they serve the Prince of Darkness himself, and the partisans act as the perverted lapdogs of the enemy of Christ. These words will do much to give faithful men with an axe to grind pause. If they will not submit out of love to the Duce or to Fascism, then maybe they will submit at least to the fear of God and their desire to serve Him."

Yet nothing could be further from reality, and Carlo Scorza will prove them wrong. Not only are Fascism and Christianity compatible - we must emphasise to all Italians that Italy is a Christian country, that the ties between the State and the Church are important and unbreakable, and that much of Fascism's strength is derived from its work to further the glory of God. Italians must also know that the Duce is a God-fearing man, and whatever demonstrations must be staged to show this, then they will go ahead. In this way they will see that all enemies of Fascism are atheists as well, and will earn their punishment in this life and the next."

 scorzaseventies.20.d:0 "The Duce is the supreme ruler of the Italians, but even he is a subject of the King of Italy, that enduring institution of continuity and hierarchy which is so important to our cultural life. In rallying behind the King, Duce Scorza will demonstrate his loyalty to the unchanging sources of power and wealth in the country. This should do much to reassure not only the King's traditional allies among the landowners and the industrialists, but also the Government and the civil service itself. For if Carlo Scorza is committed in full to the cause represented by the King, then how could he be expected to do harm to Italy? And how could any member of government, any wealthy or powerful person who guides her affairs, act against the Duce without also acting against the King himself?"

 scorzaseventies.21.t:0 "Above All, Italy"
 scorzaseventies.21.d:0 "There is no need to beat around the bush. The Italian civilisation is the greatest one that the world has ever known, and the Italian people the fullest and most genuine expression of the potential of the human race. No one has ever cast doubt on the nationalist credentials of Italian Fascism, but now Scorza must turn to the people themselves and call on their support as brothers and sisters of the same Nation. He must remind them, as they sometimes forget, that Italian dominance is the basis of everything they hold dear; that the appeal to pride in Italy is no mere trick, but the fullest expression of their deepest desires; that without Italy and without the Italian Nation they are nothing. If Scorza must speak for hours on the subject until this is drilled into Italians' heads, then he will do so."

 scorzaseventies.22.t:0 "The Anti-Fascists Have Tanks"
 scorzaseventies.22.d:0 "\"They have tanks, Duce.\" Extensive shelling and street fighting in the province of Cosenza, Calabria, where Scorza himself was born, have shattered the defences of the local Fascist garrison. Elsewhere, reports from a village in the North describe partisans with assault rifles, and threats that the entire village will be destroyed unless it provides food and equipment to the anti-fascists.\n\nThe worst fear of the authorities, from the intelligence services to the soldiers, has been realised. Already commerce grinds to a halt in the worst affected regions, and there are entire chunks of the Italian mainland where the security of our forces cannot be accounted for. Despite Carlo Scorza's promises, he has failed to ensure stability and peace. For if the anti-fascists have tanks, God knows what else they possess at their disposal, and how far they will go to achieve the destruction of Fascism in Italy. For the honest breadwinners amongst our population, who spend their energy everyday to earn a better life for their children, the worst thing is not knowing. Not knowing what tomorrow brings, not knowing how long the economy will continue to function, not knowing who will rule them the day after tomorrow. The Government will spill as much blood as is necessary to put down the partisans. But whilst the blood pools quietly in street corners..."

 nscorza.3.d:0 "Across Italy, the newsreels were putting out the word en masse. Every paperboy made more than enough change by the day. Duce Scorza proclaimed the time had come to congregate at Verona once again, to finally decide just how to bring Italy back to the glory it so rightfully deserves. Already, politicians and government officials are reaching the Agide by plane, boat and rail much like they had done not so long ago. News teams are sent and arrive long before any delegations do, and the whole of Italy sits in waiting to see in what way Scorza shall lead them.\n\nFascism has always been a fickle thing, and there is no doubt it needs defining. Fears have been gathering regarding exactly what will happen at the conference, as tensions were so high in the last. But currently, attitudes are high and expectations are lofty. Scorza will lead Italy to its predestined place as hegemon of the Mediterranean, one way or another!"

 nscorza.4.t:0 "The Roots of the Tree"
 nscorza.4.d:0 "Fascism has some of its earliest roots buried in the ways of Sansepolcroismo, perhaps the original building blocks of Mussolini's fascismo constructed during the early 20's. While it may be seen by some unenlightened members of government as ludicrously out of date, Duce Scorza has proclaimed that Italy shall look upon the original teachings of Mussolini to find guidance during such troubling times, to wash away the detritus and corruption of decades of straying from the party baseline.\n\nThe founding words of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento shall be read over and revered as the teachings of Mussolini in their purest and uncorrupted form. Italy will return to the way it was always meant to be, and through it, be better! And yet, some still hate these actions, seeing them as running back around in a circle instead of moving forward. Only time can tell if fascism can still hold through."

 nscorza.5.d:0 "Fiume is regarded as the cradle of fascism, the first testing ground of such theories. Propagated by Gabrielle D'Annunzio, widely known as the John the Baptist of Fascism. It is because of this, Scorza has made a visit to the old city on which the Adriatic once sat. Showcasing to the Italian people the rich history their nation has in its ideology alone, it has reinvigorated a sense of national pride amongst a percentage of them.\n\nOf course though, some groups that would see Scorza fall detest this as a poor propagandist effort that fell flat on its face, and with their words they carry support. Scorza has decried this as unwarranted hate on the \"righteous path\" he is bringing Italy on, yet it still brings up the question as to what he is really doing."

 nscorza.6.t:0 "Minds to Fill"
 nscorza.6.d:0 "The youth is our future, and never have such words been so true. Despite a period of time where thoughts of removing fascism classes existed, they have now been entirely reinstated indefinitely by decree of Scorza. Fascist literature such as La dottrina de fascismo, by none other than Duce Mussolini, is being taught for hour long classes on a daily basis, hammering home the ideology into the heads of Italy's impressionable children.\n\nOther factions have detested this as entirely unnecessary, pandering to children who cannot yet think for themselves, and as the extraneous extension of the school day. Scorza, like he has many times before, pushed off their words as nothing but \"idiotic attempts to stop Italy's march to glory\". How well these classes are working to the benefit of the government is yet to be seen, but it is doubtless some effect will come of it."
 nscorza.6.a:0 "Get them started young."

 nscorza.7.d:0 "The PNF has been in the control of the same people who were indoctrinated during the March on Rome for almost 40 years now, and it is best kept that way. The youth of the party, believed to be too revolutionary, have been purposely and covertly kept away from attaining any upper positions in the political hierarchy so that the status quo may be maintained. Frustration and confusion now rule the lower party, but they are all but unbeknownst to the true reasons as to why they cannot achieve what they want.\n\nThe upper party has become gratuitous for Scorza's actions, and not only will the PNF remain in its old ways, but it will also be more loyal to the state and the government it services. An unbridled success for Scorza's party line, and his enemies know nothing of it!"
 nscorza.7.a:0 "The old know best."

 nscorza.8.d:0 "In every classroom across Italy, a new book was in play. \"The Struggles of Duce Mussolini\" read on the cover of the chronicle which was held in every young Italian's hands. Mussolini's rise to power and the development of fascism was meticulously detailed by Scorza's scholars, meant to show the youth the glories of the \"greatest leader Italy has had\", as said on page four.\n\nThe effect of the new literature course has been varied, yet this is not the only measure being conducted. Posters, pamphlets and announcements help to wedge in the idea into the minds of Italy's children. The legacy of Mussolini will be remembered, no, must be remembered, for better or worse."

 nscorza.9.t:0 "Sycophant Incarnate"
 nscorza.9.d:0 "Despite Duce Scorza's many, many efforts to persuade the Italian people into following fascism once more, success has been less than expected, suffice to say. Because of this, strings have been pulled to try and stir up discussion amongst the public crowd. Yesmen and yuppies have been selected and posted to positions of prominence amongst the lower class, to try and softly persuade them into the doctrine of fascism that they had followed closely decades before.\n\nAnd yet, people will still try to believe what they want to believe. No matter how many are pulled into the fold, it appears that there are always dissenters remaining. Frustration is beginning to rule in government."

And now, Italy has forged for herself a new empire with new glory. Yet, this is not enough. Propaganda efforts have been made across the entire Italian domain to use classical Rome as an example to what Italy is today, as well as something to strive towards. As Duce Scorza put in an announcement earlier this week, \"Rome may be dead, but her legacy is eternal. Let us secure this legacy as ours, once and for all!\"\n\nComparisons have been drawn to every faucet of Italy's power projection. Infantry divisions marching through the sands of Africa to legions treading in the forests of Germania. Proud battleships sailing throughout what remains of the Mediterranean to triremes doing battle with Carthage. In general, the public have adored these contrasts and a renewed interest has been found in Roman history and the wellbeing of Italy's empire as a whole. Truly, if Rome is not eternal in reality, then it will be in legacy."

 nscorza.11.d:0 "The Blackshirts have always held the most loyalty to the PNF and Il Duce, never straying away from partylines, never disobeying orders. In sharp contrast, the Regio Esercito has time and time again turned away from the powers in Rome in favour of supposedly democratic politicians like the traitor Ciano, or the King who wishes to see his own nation corrupted. These being the thoughts of Scorza have inevitably led to the MSVN, or Blackshirts, being favored heavily for conducting operations within and without Italy, becoming a sort of second army in their own right. After all, what better to exercise the will of the state than a tool of the party?"

Nobody but the men present behind those locked doors knows what went on during it, but at least plans can be put into motion now."
 nscorza.12.a:0 "Suspicious."

 nscorza.13.d:0 "The Carabinieri serve officially as the gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Italy, or military police. As a result, they hold most of their loyalties towards the monarchy and reformist factions, but this is currently acceptable. A detachment of these men will be sent into Verona to suppress protests and cover up the failed Second Verona Conference, and best of all, without any bloodshed! Duce Scorza clearly knows how to play these factions against each other."

 nscorza.14.d:0 "Once again, Italy was in a present state of extremity and panic, something the nation had become used to by now. However, this time, there wasn't much to actually panic about. Scorza has declared a state of emergency country-wide due to recent protests at Verona and political failures currently ongoing, which is seen primarily as an overreaction. Many say there is a deeper level to this decision however, an attempt to take administrative action and root out dissenters within the PNF itself. Of course, anybody who says this mysteriously disappears by the next morning, but it is probably nothing to worry about."

It seems the Carabinieri have gone far from our expectations. Damage control and information suppression is now in effect.\n\nScorza and his administration has declared that 4 protesters have been killed in riot control at Verona by military police. Instead of decrying these actions, they have instead declared blood on their hands this early is simply indicative of their willpower to see Italy's destiny through, unlike Ciano. People are outraged, but it is doubtless Verona is cleansed. Scorza has shown he means business."

Inevitably, more soldiers are required to contain the situation, but today it proved too much. A detachment of the 4th Infantry Division Livorno was overrun by an onslaught of rioters after a brutal melee battle, resulting in even more deaths. The army was forced to retreat to the city outskirts and lick its wounds as the riots devolved into somewhat of a siege. 3 infantrymen and 5 rioters have been reported dead, bringing the grand total of dead to 12. The actions being conducted at the city have become notorious throughout the world, and by connection, so has the Scorza administration for its brutality.

Bribes and threats, back alley deals and murders. Everything is being done to stop the flood of information, every track covered by the OVRA and paper trails leading to dead ends.\n\nThose who remember the chaos of those short few weeks keep it to themselves, or face the brunt force of Scorza's regime.

The shambles of an economy which barely crawls along, bruised and beaten by the horrors of Atlantropa. The many social issues that plague the everyday lives of Italy's sons and daughters, women's rights, minority recognition, and much more.\n\nDomestic problems, political and not. Divides which tear apart at the very fabric of the Italian nation and consciousness. Italy's prominence on the world stage, her empire and influence. And, of course, the issue that is the European continent. The hungry wolf of Germany baring its teeth to her north, a reckless and delinquent Balkan peninsula to her east, treacherous and backstabbing \"allies\" challenging her dominance of the Mediterranean. Italy surely has many problems, but Scorza shall see her through them, one way or another."

But Duce Scorza sees the issue inherent within this form of thought. For Italy to function as a united nation, its population must share control amongst themselves, equal opportunities so everyone may bring Italy to her full potential.\n\nUnfortunately, and inevitably however, there are those who disagree. Those who wish to maintain the patriarchy which Mussolini held up. Scorza will go along with either, it is simply a matter of deciding once and for all what role women will play in society. One option will upset the other, as always."

Fascism has always been built around the prominence of a single figure in the middle, and in this situation it is no different. To propagate the further empowerment of women within Italy, there must be a leader of their movement, a female face of fascism, as some have said.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that there is no real person to fill this role. While there are of course female figures that have spearheaded certain divisions or individual movements, there is not yet one that can be agreed upon to lead the entirety of \"feminist fascism\". This problem must be rectified quickly lest any momentum built up thus far be lost."

Shortcomings, mishaps and a lack of public support have seen the movement stopped in its tracks by the powers in place and their wide conservative support base. The idea that the entirety of \"feminist fascism\" is infact made up and never had any bearings in reality has been pushed to every informative faucet in the nation.\n\nThose that still remain on the sinking ship bicker and fight as leaders jump and funding moves away, specifically Carlo Scorza and his administration, who have conceded and moved to support the patriarchy.

New propaganda posters and brochures have been printed and posted into every major city throughout Italy. All are attempts to push the new and successful feminist rhetoric which has dominated the Italian social and political atmosphere for weeks on end.\n\nThese words speak of the Italian woman, brave in the face of everyday challenges and the patriarchy, pushing forwards to bring glory to Italy. \"The new face of fascism\" have become words famous, the catchphrase of the feminist movement. Few ever expected the women's rights movement to pick up traction in an ideology so far right as fascism, and yet here we are. Beyond the obvious propaganda benefits of this, this also opens the door for interesting military and economic avenues not possible before. Perhaps, eventually, women could march alongside men on the battlefield or work hand in hand on the factory floor. A whole new world has opened up, all thanks to Duce Scorza!"
 nscorza.25.a:0 "That was unexpected."
 nscorza.26.t:0 "The Modern Housewife"
 nscorza.26.d:0 "The history of the dynamic between man and woman has, for the most part, always been one of dominance and subservience. Husband and wife. There have been concessions when necessary to keep up war industry or the smooth pace of society, yet things have always stayed relatively the same. Recent developments have attempted to change that, with support unseen before in modern history. But still, it has all failed. The patriarchy remains in place, and will for much longer to go.\n\nBecause the patriarchy remains, so must its ideas. The wife is meant to obey the husband, as such has been the way for centuries, and so must be the way it is. Public announcements, propaganda and demonstrations speak these words, demanding the train of progressive change be stopped, and so it has. Been blown off the track, it seems. The wife will stay home and tend to the familial unit, and the husband will work his job to provide for the family. It mustn't change."
 nscorza.26.a:0 "Some things stay the same."
 nscorza.31.t:0 "Teachings of the Past"
 nscorza.31.d:0 "Italy is the way it is today because of the actions of men since dead or driven to old age. Now a proud eagle spread across her rightful domain of the Mediterranean, without them she would've stayed an irrelevant continental power playing second fiddle to Britain, France and Germany. There are those however that have strayed from the light present within the teachings of these men, the detritus of decades of decadence taking a toll on the psyche of the Italian population.\n\nThose that would wish to see all Italy has been built upon, all that was striven for in the Great Wars destroyed shall be silenced and buried as they deserve. Soldiers will parade through the streets, stamping down on protest. Tanks will roll in grand columns, crushing dissent beneath their mighty tracks. Disrespect towards the modern founding fathers of Italy, and as a whole the nation, will receive no tolerance."
 nscorza.31.a:0 "Patriotism is not optional."
 nscorza.33.t:0 "The Ways of the Future"
 nscorza.33.d:0 "The youth of the nation will inevitably rise to lead it, and with it come their ideas. The old guard cannot stay in power for eternity, and succession must be aligned before all is too late. The youth of the party hold many thoughts on how to better fascism to fit the modern reality, and as a whole ready Italy for the challenges ahead of her. Theirs is a noble cause, and one we have ignored for too long.\n\nOld and tired leaders shall be replaced by those more keen and fit. The minds of today will power the engines which drive forward administration and keep things on track. Failing theories will be buried and in their place those prepared for the modern day. The legacy of the past must be kept sacred and remembered, but decrepit fossils cannot manage a young state."
 nscorza.33.a:0 "Out with the old, in with the young."
 nscorza.34.t:0 "If It Ain't Broke"
 nscorza.34.d:0 "Italy is great, and always has been. The same practices which were born after the slaughter of the First Great War saw Italy through the uncertainty of the interwar period, and claimed for her an empire of gold in the Second Great War. These practices have kept Italy the way it is for decades on end and show no discernible signs of failure. Those reckless younglings that would see Mussolini's legacy torn asunder in favor of untested, untrue theories mustn't be allowed anywhere near an administrative office.\n\nThe men who run the PNF shook hands with Mussolini, were the ones that forged fascism in the flames of the March on Rome. They were the ones that sent brave men to fight and die in the hills of Greece, the plains of Yugoslavia and the sands of Egypt. They, and they alone, know how to run Italy, and how fascism is intended to be. Notions of reform and change are overrated and childish. The current course will be stayed and bring us through this storm, as it had many before."
 nscorza.34.a:0 "Why fix it?"
 nscorza.35.t:0 "The Man in the Vatican"
 nscorza.35.d:0 "Scorza's administration and fascism as a whole has deep rooted support within the Catholic Christian population base of Italy, but much of this support is based around a single man, a single city.\n\nThe Pope, the ruler of the Vatican City, has always held a distaste for the authoritarian tendencies of fascism and as a result his beliefs have spread throughout Christianity. Whatever the Pope says is liable to be followed in close stride by all of Christendom, and Italy is no different.\n\nOf course, the Pope cannot simply be assassinated and it be covered up as a fall down the stairs. We must convene a meeting of the minds and figure out a method to deal with him. Perhaps it's time to finally finish 1870. Maybe not."
 nscorza.35.a:0 "Those siege walls can't stand up to bombers!"
 nscorza.36.t:0 "A Crumbling City"
 nscorza.36.d:0 "The Vatican is always working in the benefit of the Pope. Never professing the truth or working for the Italian people, or Christendom itself. The Pope is a liar, cheat and most importantly a scam artist! Him and his city cannot be trusted, not by Rome and not by Italy.\n\nSuch were the words of Scorza as he made a public address earlier this morning. Years of building tensions between the Vatican and the Italian administration have finally come to a head as Rome has severed most ties with the Holy See and declared the Pope untrustworthy. All of this comes from a fresh campaign to pull apart Italian Christianity and the Pope in light of the realization that the Pope wields much influence over the population, and any hateful rhetoric directed towards fascism will inevitably wash over the people of Italy.\n\nA campaign like this is audaciously ambitious at best, but Scorza and his administration remain confident they can pull off such a monumental societal transformation."
 nscorza.36.a:0 "The Pope and Christianity are one and the same!"
 nscorza.37.t:0 "The Concordat"
 nscorza.37.d:0 "The relationship between Italy and the Vatican is one born in the short but chaotic War of 1870, which finalized the unification of the Italian peninsula. The Pope, once upon a time presiding over central Italy, is now limited to the Vatican City, in reality a \"state\" the size of a palace. Hiding behind the city's massive stone walls until 1929, the Pope eventually conceded to signing a deal and maintaining the stability of the church.\n\nThe Lateran Treaty, better known as the Concordat was created in Rome and finalized the borders between the Papal State and the Kingdom of Italy. Since the rise of fascism, a tense but amicable existence has continued to exist until now. Scorza's attempts at pushing at the Pope have brought things to a breaking point. It is decidedly so then that the Concordat shall be reviewed and the next few decisions taken based upon that. The Papal relationship must be preserved, for the wellbeing of Christianity as a whole."
 nscorza.37.a:0 "The church is nothing without the Pope."
 nscorza.38.t:0 "A Nation of Many Faces"
 nscorza.38.d:0 "Italy, as it stands now, is a very diverse nation in every way imaginable. Arab Muslims buy from Italian Christians in bustling street markets. Agnostics marry devout theists, Chinese traditionalists converse with Alpine pagans! Italy is a nation that holds many different beliefs, many different ethnicities and many different people. To consign itself to a single following would be dismissive towards the many other citizens who serve under the Italian banner.\n\nAnd so, as it is today, Italy is a secular nation by decree of Duce Scorza. A move considered radical by many more conservative elements in Italy, it will serve as an unexpected solution to the current Papal crisis. By not playing to the Pope's games of religion, Scorza will inevitably win either way! Of course though, this has placed quite a few divides within the nation, but it is hoped time will mend any differences and bring the whole country onto a brighter future. After all, we are all sons and daughters of Italy, why not act as such?"
 nscorza.38.a:0 "Is this the right move?"
 nscorza.39.t:0 "Servants of the Flag"
 nscorza.39.d:0 "Every one person who lives and breaths and dies in Italy has swore a silent oath to the flag, to serve the nation forever and always, till death ends their duty. The state, the nation, is the one that controls everything, not the church. Every citizen of Italy exists under the watchful eye of the PNF, not the Pope. Our policy should reflect this truth. Devout religion is a thing of the past, nationalism and service to the state is the present! The bible shall be replaced with the manifesto, the priests' robes with uniform and medals. This entire Papal charade is nothing but the death throes of an increasingly irrelevant church, one being smothered by the boot of the state. Everyone will be a part of the PNF, not everyone is a part of the Catholic Church."
 nscorza.39.a:0 "Why didn't we see this before?"
 nscorza.40.t:0 "Conceding to God"
 nscorza.40.d:0 "The reality of our situation is that the church is and always has been a staple of Italian culture, society and nation, and is liable to be for many more years to come. We cannot simply wash away its grand influence over the population, or replace it with another following. It is the unfortunate truth that we must come to terms with the Pope, and find a solution beneficial to both our parties, lest more chaos be wrought from this little dispute.\n\nA meeting has been scheduled in the mountainous village of Foce between representatives of the government and the Vatican. It is expected a deal will be reached, as it was in 1929. A deal must be reached for the greater good of all Italy. We do not need to like them, and they do not need to like us. We simply need to coexist, and uphold our own dues to the Italian people. Once all of this is cleared up we may move on to greater and better matters."
 nscorza.40.a:0 "A middle ground sometimes must be met."
 nscorza.45.t:0 "Back in Rome"
 nscorza.45.d:0 "A silent bird followed just outside Scorza's view for the whole car ride from the airport. Swooping and diving under, between and beside street posts, canopies, people and cars it followed on. Not a single chirp could be heard from its beak the whole way through, but Scorza knew it was there. A black bird. One with a sharp, vantablack beak and ruffled feathers. Piercing beads sat in its eye sockets, jumping back and forth between people and objects.\n\nScorza knew what the bird was. He was never a very spiritualistic man, but he knew it was a sign. A herald. A messenger of things to come, events to follow and the path to be tread. So many things were left to be completed, and he had only begun. He would see Italy through them all, swooping and diving under, between and beside war, famine, crisis and death.\n\nAnd yet, there was a solemn feeling to it. The bird did not sing, the bird did not cry. What was it trying to tell him? Had he done everything right? Was everything truly going to be okay? He had conquered so many problems by now. The women's rights movement, the youth of the party, the church. Everything was solved by him, everything was solvable to him, unlike Ciano. But, there was still a longing for those times. When the urgency was not there, where they dined on fine wines and fat meats every night knowing the next morning would be good. When everything stood still, and just for a moment, it remained outside a blur.\n\nWhere the car screeched to a halt in front of parliament, Scorza's mind did not. Stepping from the car to the pavement, a silent brush of the air could be heard overhead. The black bird soared and flew into the sky, flapping against the breeze, desperate yet determined to go on. And over the parliament's arch did it fly, disappearing from sight. There was so much left to do, and so little time."
 nscorza.45.a:0 "We'll see it to the end."
 nscorza.90.t:0 "Pieces to Pickup"
 nscorza.90.d:0 "Ciano's administration had many blatant and evident failings, but perhaps one of his greatest lies within the catastrophe that was his economic management. Failing to rise up to the horrors of Atlantropa, Italy was plunged into recession by his refusal to take action. Of course, this is just what Scorza would like people to believe. In reality, the economy began to stabilize shortly before the end of Ciano's tenure, but still it is in shambles.\n\nDuce Scorza has drawn up a plan to pick up the pieces left over by the previous administration, but it still needs review and further agreement before it is put into place. A meeting will be convened between the biggest whigs of the economy to decide just how to push Italy forward on the inevitably rocky road ahead of her."
 nscorza.90.a:0 "The market is a funny world."
 nscorza.91.t:0 "Shifting Pieces"
 nscorza.91.d:0 "The Italian bureaucracy is one mired in sluggish processes, limited decisions and all too blatant incompetence. It is no wonder the Italian economy runs at a pace so terribly slow, the men running it likely had their education in the 19th century! These old men will finally be put to their retirement and new, young and ambitious bureaucrats brought in to fill their seats.\n\nNot only the economic echelons will be receiving such swapping either, bureaus of information, police and administration will also receive some light overhauls to push for a better Italy overall. Out of date processes are the stuff that make nations collapse, and Italy will not be a collapsing nation!"
 nscorza.91.a:0 "Young men to run a young empire."
 nscorza.92.t:0 "Overflowing Pockets"
 nscorza.92.d:0 "Those in charge are in charge for a reason, and that is because they are good at their jobs! Regardless of if they are old or prepared to drop dead from their chairs at any moment, they simply need more funds to carry out their work. Any efficient bureaucracy requires a lot of money to stay well oiled, and this is no different. More extreme funding will be transferred to administrative departments so that starving programs may finally get some cash.\n\nIf those in charge do not have the money to do what they must, all of Italy is lost to chaos. It is what makes the world go round, after all. And yet, there are those who protest these actions. They say the system must be overhauled, but their mewling shall be silenced. The only thing Italy needs is a little more \"greenery\" and all will be good."
 nscorza.92.a:0 "Just throw money at any given issue."
 nscorza.80.t:0 "The World Stage"
 nscorza.80.d:0 "The Institute of International Political Studies, or IIPS, has brought up a very important topic relevant to Italy's modern dilemma. Her standing on the world stage, the way the other powers look at her: as a strong and proud empire, or a second rate pawn. The institute itself, mostly just college kids who never figured out what they want to do, has brought forward legitimate choices.\n\nIn olden days, Italy had created a balance of relationships between foreign powers, powers which could make or break Italy's rise to prominence. The Entente and Central Powers in the First Great War, France and Britain in the interwar. The Axis and Allies in the Second, choosing definitively a side only when convenient. The situation Italy faces now is not too different, simply another balance of power between the superpowers of the world. Italy must just nudge the powers off each other to get what she wants.\n\nThere is another proposition however, one more radical. Italy does not need outside help anymore, for she is a powerful empire with domains of her own! Our foreign diplomacy should be modeled directly around what Italy wants and what Italy demands, her sphere and her influence. No more playing second fiddle, no more answering the wishes of other nations. Italy will stand on her own legs.\n\nEither option has their individual merits and inferiorities, but a choice must be made, and be made soon. The vultures are closing in around Italy, and a path must be carved to get out of the chaos to soon ensue."
 nscorza.80.a:0 "Italy is a sovereign empire! On her own! The new school!"
 nscorza.80.b:0 "We must play the superpowers' game. The old school!"
 nscorza.81.t:0 "Distant Wildlands"
 nscorza.81.d:0 "The colonial empire of Italy is one that stretches across many hundreds of miles, through harsh mountain colds, raging desert sands, lush river deltas, ancient cradles of civilization, sea chalets and deepest jungle. At times, it can feel as though there is no real way to manage all of it from Rome. But, such thoughts must be dispelled. Italy's empire first must not be thought as overstretched for it to cease being overstretched.\n\nAs such, colonial administrations and vassal governments have been ordered to start integrating their processes with Italy so operations may be run closer and most importantly, smoother. From the towering Alps, to the ruins of Athens. From the grandeur of Rome to the most holy land. From the ancient pyramids of Giza to the sea slums of Mogadiscio, the Italian eagle stretches, and proudly does so. The legacy of Italy will be one to last many millenia, one to rival the glory of Rome, so is the way Scorza shall have it."
 nscorza.81.a:0 "If not an empire, what else is Italy?"
 nscorza.82.t:0 "The Key in Cooperation"
 nscorza.82.d:0 "Italy's empire would not be able to substantiate itself if it was not profitable, which is why it retains some of the largest oil reserves, mineral deposits and richest farmland in the world. The unfortunate reality of the situation however is that we cannot take full advantage of the resources present within the empire unless our colonial administrations tie their economies even closer with us.\n\nAs such, more departments will be merged and more administrative cheques marked as defunct. Italy will slowly but surely encroach into the colonies and reap what is hers."
 nscorza.82.a:0 "It is our empire, after all."
 nscorza.83.t:0 "The Imperial Committee"
 nscorza.83.d:0 "Despite attempts to tie the colonies together more closely, it is still evident Italy's empire is overstretched and pulling itself apart at the seams. To rectify any issues inherent with the more autonomous nations which live under the Aquila, a new administrative entity has been formed: The Imperial Committee.\n\nThe committee will work to bring tandem between all of the nations which reside within the Italian sphere, and hopefully develop a more mature sense of cooperation, for the betterment of the entire empire."
 nscorza.83.a:0 "Didn't the British try this?"
 nscorza.84.t:0 "The Imperial Economic Community"
 nscorza.84.d:0 "Besides geopolitical relations, the empire must also cooperate fairly on its economic endentures, not just signing over resources to Italy. As such, the Imperial Economic Community has been created to assist in economic relations between all nations of the Italian empire. Talks will be held regarding a mutual support basis between all of them so any one nation failing may receive the support of all others, and so forth. Some have called the front a scheme for Italy to just take up more influence within those which reside in her sphere, but this is nonsense, surely!"
 nscorza.84.a:0 "We're equals here, I assure you."
 nscorza.85.t:0 "The Travel of the Lira"
 nscorza.85.d:0 "The lira, the primary currency of Italy, is what upholds most markets and companies based within Rome and abroad. As such, it is only fitting for the entire empire to share the one currency. By making every nation in the Italian sphere trade the same banknotes, many of the processes which circulate money and resources throughout the empire will be much easier. Some have drawn comparisons to the perfidious German's attempts at sharing the Reichsmark, but they are ludicrous. The lira is a strong currency, and the empire will bend to it!"
 nscorza.85.a:0 "Are we sure something won't crash?"
 nscorza.86.t:0 "The Truth in the Numbers"
 nscorza.86.d:0 "The reality of our empire and the situation it faces is that mutual cooperation is nigh-on impossible. It is Italy's empire, and as such, the colonies which reside under its banner will be exploited by it. Rocks and oil will be dug up and transferred to the Apennine peninsula for use in the corelands. If Italy was not willing to, and had not been exploiting its vassals it wouldn't have gotten to where it is today. There is no fairness in imperialism, only crown and vassal."
 nscorza.86.a:0 "It is all our resources to take!"
 nscorza.87.t:0 "Mask Off"
 nscorza.87.d:0 "The numbers were showing something, but what they were showing wasn't all that pleasant. Throughout Rome's government buildings, a panic had ensued. Despite all their attempts at being independent, the market was still in the gutters. A hasty meeting was convened between the highest members of administration and Scorza himself.\n\nThey had come to the inevitable conclusion that Italy, by nature, needed outside support to subside itself. While of course the nation is not ready to die entirely, it does not hurt to maintain a few friendly connections with the outside world. Pride and patriotism would have to be put aside just this once for the wellbeing of the economy. Scorza never wanted to look at a market report sheet again!"

 itapartyunity.2.t:0 "Unity is Everything"
 itapartyunity.2.d:0 "Politics is a game of balances, of compromises, and where necessary of ruthless betrayal. Above all it is a game of unity, and of coming to an agreement with the right people so that the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The coalitions making up the Blocchi Nazionali and Fronte Democratico contain a diversity of personality and thought which may appear surprising to the uninformed outsider, who may expect a more cohesive identity to linger behind the surface. Even among groups as ideological as the BN and the FD, however, the importance of convenience and compromise remain central. A man in another country once said that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and whatever we think of the person who said it, it is hard to fault the words."
 itapartyunity.2.a:0 "Differences must be overcome, for the greater good."
 itapartyunity.3.t:0 "The FD Collapses"
 itapartyunity.3.d:0 "After De Lorenzo implemented Piano Solo, ousting the government led by the Fronte Democratico from the halls of power, it was difficult to imagine any outcome other than this. Torn by internal disagreement over what to do now, with previous ideological and personal gaps bubbling to the surface, the Fronte Democratico has collapsed under the weight of its own inflexibility. The leftist coalition's demise is a heavy blow to socialist and social democratic politics throughout Italy, and indeed much of Europe, as a leading flame of the worker's movement is snuffed out."
 itapartyunity.3.a:0 "The working man bows his weary head."
 itapartyunity.4.t:0 "The BN Collapses"
 itapartyunity.4.d:0 "Ferocious arguments, desperate midnight conversations and open recrimination have led to the inevitable. After being ousted from power by De Lorenzo, the Blocchi Nazionali has collapsed, and with it a hope for post-fascist unity in the new order augured by the transition out of old-style fascism. Although some demagogues attempt to rally their troops, saying that the fascist ideal embodied by the BN is not yet dead, it is difficult to imagine the disparate and fiercely competitive elements making up the grouping coming back together."
 itapartyunity.4.a:0 "Out of power and out of time."
 itapartyunity.5.t:0 "The Fronte Democratico government dissolves"
 itapartyunity.5.d:0 "After endless ideological squabbles and factional backstabbing, the Fronte Democratico coalition has proven unable to withstand the strain. The coalition is no more. A new government must now take charge of Italy's destiny, whilst the architects of the coalition's failure lick their wounds and attempt to pick up the pieces.\n\nCarried for a while through sheer stubbornness, the political press will look to interpret why the FD coalition fell at the moment it did, and what could have been done to prevent it. No doubt this will prove an interesting thought experiment for those who treat party politics as a sport. The actual consequences, on Italy's workers and businesses, will no doubt unfold in the longer term. On that front many will give their perspective, but one thing is clear. The fallout of the FD's failure will appear far beyond the claustrophobic halls of party politics."
 itapartyunity.5.a:0 "Perhaps the next government will do better."
 itapartyunity.6.t:0 "The Blocchi Nazionale government is no more."
 itapartyunity.6.d:0 "Despite the impassioned appeals to national unity and calls to a higher cause made by the Blocchi's party men, the BN coalition has as of today ceased to function. The government's collapse will be answered by a new government taking charge, whilst those who failed to uphold the outgoing administration recriminate and apologise in equal measure.\n\nAs the successors of the fascist legacy in democratic politics, the Blocchi Nazionale have always had a fine tightrope to walk. How harshly they will be judged for failing to hold this coalition together is for the historians. Nevertheless, the immediate consequences are clear enough. The incoming coalition will have to pull together, if not the enthusiasm, then the grudging consent of the segments of Italian society which put the BN in power (and if not, to pretend to do so). Meanwhile the Blocchi attempt to move forward, and to figure out what went wrong."

Uncertainty in the markets, coupled with rapidly rising oil prices, and unrest in our sphere of influence has slowed the economy to a crawl.\n\nAs long lines begin to appear around gas stations, and shareholders sell off stocks, the first cracks have started to appear. It is evident that the current crisis in the Middle East must be dealt with, and soon before it sends our Empire crashing into the doldrums of an economic depression."
 ITAOIL.10.a:0 "Just keep the pumps flowing!"
 ITAOIL.11.t:0 "Emergency Measures Propaganda"
 ITAOIL.11.d:0 "The oil crisis has severely hit our country's economy. Therefore, the government is proposing emergency measures to balance the budget. This, of course, won't be popular with the people. The government is therefore launching a propaganda campaign to garner support for these messages. Posters are already being printed and commercials are being produced as we speak. Let's hope these measures work."
 ITAOIL.11.a:0 "We need the people on our side."
 ITAOIL.12.t:0 "Gaining The Upper Hand"
 ITAOIL.12.d:0 "The situation in the Middle East has finally gone awry and order has all but collapsed. The government has decided to get involved in all this unrest so that we can come out on top of this crisis. If it does not, this can seriously harm Italy as the 4th greatest economy, and for that matter power, in the world."
 ITAOIL.12.a:0 "Let's hope for the best."
 ITAOIL.13.t:0 "Protests Begin"
 ITAOIL.13.d:0 "We are currently involved in a number of proxy wars in the Middle East, whether directly or indirectly. This is needed to stabilize the region and get the top suppliers of oil in the world running again. In the first few months of these proxy wars, we have seen little domestic opposition to these interventions. However, we are starting to get reports of protests around the country, advocating for no more intervention. We must end these conflicts quickly, or start dealing with these protests. If we do not, the country might turn against us and we can no longer try to reassert our control over the Middle East."
 ITAOIL.13.a:0 "Worrying developments."
 ITAOIL.100.t:0 "A Propaganda Coup"
 ITAOIL.100.d:0 "For a while now the best minds in our propaganda departments have worked to justify Italy's involvement in what is, at its heart, an oil war. In doing this we have used every trick in the book - arguing for national interest, for doing the right thing, and for getting involved before our enemies can. These efforts have paid off, and we are seeing a general mobilisation of public opinion in favour of Italy getting involved in the war. Having the people behind us will be crucial in the days ahead."
 ITAOIL.100.a:0 "Fine work."
 ITAOIL.101.t:0 "A Propaganda Stalemate"
 ITAOIL.101.d:0 "Our best minds in the propaganda departments have worked to justify Italy's involvement in the Oil War, but for whatever reason, barely a ripple has been felt on the public consciousness. Arguments which work have been met with arguments to the contrary, and while Italian are not against our involvement in the war, they are not really in favour of it either. In short, our propaganda efforts have had little to no effect, and should we go to war, we will do so in the name of an apathetic nation whose imagination has not been captured."
 ITAOIL.101.a:0 "Don't they understand the importance of this venture?"
 ITAOIL.102.t:0 "A Propaganda Failure"
 ITAOIL.102.d:0 "We have attempted to mobilise the public in favour of involvement in the Oil War, but these efforts have more than failed - they have actually done significant harm. Our public opinion czars now tell us that Italians are more cynical than ever, seeing involvement in the war to be a waste of lives, resources and time which harms them directly. We need not necessarily act according to this, of course, but to go against the public will not be without cost. Perhaps it would have been better to keep quiet altogether."
 ITAOIL.102.a:0 "The people do not understand, they must be led."
 ITAOIL.105.t:0 "Their hearts and minds are ours"
 ITAOIL.105.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit. After an intensive propaganda campaign aimed at spinning the narrative in our favour, showing the people that our cause in the war is just, we are informed that the Italian public has rallied in favour of war. Whether they believe the war is glorious or a tragic necessity is another thing, but as we have so forcefully explained, we are in the right, and that is enough. Those who decry another imperialist war or claim that peace would be better are ignored or treated as fools. What is important is that the facts on the ground are known by all, and that the just war goes on - why argue with lone voices in the desert?"
 ITAOIL.105.a:0 "We fight because we must."
 ITAOIL.106.t:0 "Their hearts and minds are lost"
 ITAOIL.106.d:0 "Our efforts have been in vain. After an intensive propaganda campaign on the matter of the war, aimed at showing the people that our cause is just, we are informed that the Italian public simply does not believe we are in the right. Whether they say so in the street or behind closed doors, Italians are largely united in seeing our effort as yet another imperialist war. We shall continue trying to show them they are wrong, but now their mind is made up, there is little we can do. We must grit our teeth and carry on, despite our people's cynicism and their pig-headedness."

With the ENI in crisis, and the domestic situation growing ever more tenuos, malicious actors within Italian society have seen fit to begin their plots against the Duce!\n\nRegardless, these unfortunate circumstances shall not break what we have worked so hard to acheive! Italy have weathered greater crises in their proud histories. Foreign doomsayers sounding the death-knell of the Italian Empire are missing one vital element about the Italian people: our unique perseverance that let us build our towering Empire in the first place.\n\nWe will drive back the chaos and instability of the Middle-East. We shall weather the ever-worsening Oil Crisis. Most importantly, no matter what, we shall emerge from it stronger than ever before! This is what the Duce commands, and it is what we shall accomplish, regardless of the dificulty!"

Now, with the situation in the Middle East, it falls into their hands to prepare to endure a time of austerity. The Italian people, after enjoying the sweet desert of success, must now tighten their belts for this final showdown. Across Italy, there is an overwhelming feeling that everyone, no matter their background, will have to sacrifice for the strength of Italy. Should the people of the Empire remain steadfest in their strength throughout this crucible, Italy shall come out scarred, but ultimately unscathed."

 scorzaoil.3.d:0 "The Lira in freefall! Runs on the banks! Layoffs at record numbers! Every day brings a new panicked headline on the economic situation. Our national currency is teetering on the brink of total collapse, with confidence in the Lira evaporating and no man going to work in the morning sure he'll still have his job come noon. Those who can, avoid using the Lira as a medium at all costs. Even the barter system has made a dramatic comeback.\n\nThis will not stand! The government and the banks must do something - anything! to save our precious Lira. Whatever the public thinks of it our sovereignty, wellbeing and very identity as a Nation depends on it!"

 scorzaoil.4.d:0 "The economic crisis has been devastating. But with Duce Scorza captaining the ship we shall weather the storm, come what may. There comes to mind an old joke about two men, who find themselves trapped in a jungle with a leopard - why do you put on your boots, asks the first, you shall not outrun the beast. Yet of course the second must only outrun his fellow, not the beast. With strength and tenacity we shall be able to outrun our enemy, and when we do so this crisis will come to an end. For now, one sole option remains to us."
 scorzaoil.4.a:0 "Keep running."
 scorzaoil.5.t:0 "Throw Dead Weight Overboard"
 scorzaoil.5.d:0 "Economics is a dismal science. Sometimes to save the economy, you have to spend money where it is needed, and not where it is most desperately desired. Our decision to leave civilian matters as the last priority may appear callous. Yet in saving the economy and our vital industry first we act for all Italians. If they must starve now so that they will survive later, instead of slowly wasting away to a certain death, then this is what they will do. They will thank us in the future. Perhaps."
 scorzaoil.5.a:0 "Cut costs everywhere."
 scorzaoil.6.t:0 "Assurances And Reassurances"
 scorzaoil.6.d:0 "Italy's economy runs on oil. With industries ranging from petroleum companies to car manufacturers, it's safe to say that Italy's economy would grind to a halt without it. With the oil crisis grinding on the government has noticed an increasing number of pessimists complaining about the government's policies supposedly harming the Nation's long-term economic well-being.\n\nWhile the number of pessimists is still insignificant, Il Duce still found it prudent to call a conference explaining the situations to all major companies related to the oil affair. There government officials explained that the government was dealing with the situation. That any disruption in the oil situation was expected to be temporary and that the government was already enacting its plans for the crisis. Any followup questions were, of course, met with the response that the government had the situation well in hand but that state secrets regarding military affairs in the Middle-East were, for obvious reasons, not up for disclosure. The conference ended with a series of rousing speeches imploring Italy's industries to have faith in the Party's plans for the sake of the Nation."

 scorzaoil.7.t:0 "The Saudi Sphere"
 scorzaoil.7.d:0 "As the Saudis show themselves to be the real enemy worth fighting, we must stand against their sphere with everything we have. Fighting the Ba'athists is no longer a priority. Until the House of Saud and its dependents in OPEN has been put down, we can forget any prospect of a stable Middle East conducive to our interests. Whilst many of the men we could corrupt are too rich to be bought, all of them have a glaring ambition, and we can perhaps use this to corrode the Saudis alliance from the inside."
 scorzaoil.7.a:0 "Offer them anything they want."
 scorzaoil.8.t:0 "Peace with the Dawa?"
 scorzaoil.8.d:0 "The Iraqi Dawa Party aims to establish an Islamic state in Iraq, but several of its leaders according to our intelligence are level-headed, pragmatic men who will not throw away a small advantage if one is offered. In seeking to reduce the burden war places on us, we could establish links with the Dawa Party and offer them a ceasefire, with guarantees that we will not seek to obstruct their political mission in Iraq so long as they refrain from any and all attacks on our interest. Most of our diplomatic experts believe such a deal could be workable, yet a good number of them are skeptics. However pragmatic the Dawa leaders are, they remind us, these men view no step as too far in achieving their objectives. As such, if they see our ceasefire as an obstacle to the enactment of Islamic law in their country, they would not hesitate to betray us at our moment of greatest weakness. Having listened to the arguments, we must make our decision."

 scorzaoil.11.t:0 "The Ayatollah Spurns Us."

 scorzaoil.14.t:0 "Peace with the Ba'athists"
 scorzaoil.14.d:0 "War often drives you to do things you do not wish to do. The Ba'athists, with their rabble-rousing Arab nationalism, are in the long-term a destabilising force in the Arab world. In the short and medium-term, however, they are less of a threat to our interests than the Saudis, who have the capacity to truly be kingmakers throughout the Middle East. We should make the Ba'athists an offer of peace, therefore, which will give us both breathing room and allow us to focus on the House of Saud. We can always turn around and stab them in the back down the line, when the situation is more secure."
 scorzaoil.14.a:0 "Make the offer."
 scorzaoil.35.t:0 "Kingmakers in Egypt?"
 scorzaoil.35.d:0 "Egypt is the key to the Arab world, and its single most important country. Our history there and our control of the Suez Canal have demonstrated to the whole world the importance of a stabilising influence in Cairo. The oil crisis we are embroiled in now has only intensified the reasons we took control of Egypt in the first place. Now we must decide whether our resources and political will allow us to take the next logical step. Shall we formally push our claim over Egyptian rule, allowing us to become kingmakers in Egypt at this crucial juncture? Or shall we restrain ourselves and find a time which is more opportune?"
 scorzaoil.35.a:0 "Push our claim."
 scorzaoil.35.b:0 "The time is not right."
 scorzaoil.37.t:0 "Watching Nasser"
 scorzaoil.37.d:0 "Gamel Abdel Nasser is an icon of the Pan-Arabist movement, and if his ideals seem like foolish dreams for now, he has proven himself a resilient player in the game of Arab politics. Worsening the situation have been attempts, reported to us by our spies in his camp, to forge a common ground with Ba'athist groups across the Arab world. To counter this we must ourselves speak to the Ba'athists and convince them to drop their links to this dangerous man, lest he becomes the leader of a general Arab renewal movement (which he openly styles himself as being). Having done this we will watch Nasser like a hawk, and remain wary as ever to the threat he represents."

 demitaly.40.t:0 "An Address to the Grand Council"
 demitaly.40.d:0 "Galeazzo Ciano smiled with his mouth, but not with his eyes. He had come into the chamber with King Umberto, and as the men present stood to attention Ciano paid notice to the way they addressed the monarch, bowing their head slightly as they shook his hand or making eye contact. Their respect for the King, or lack thereof, would make a big difference in their opinion of what Ciano had to say. At best, everyone present would go along with what was said, and at worst they would leave the room with reservations, which would set things back significantly.\n\nThe Duce spoke at some length, going over the talking points presented to him by the King. Democratisation would be complex and fragile, even with the systems and handover to be put in place, because to his knowledge no country had ever transitioned from Fascism to democracy. Verona had changed things for the better, Ciano said to the men present, trying to will himself to believe it. He had the full support of the King in saying this. To continue as things were before would be to risk a continuing stagnation and the dissolution of Italy's status in the world, rendering it a second rate power forever to be picked at by greater nations. Something had to give, and that something was the Fascist system designed by Mussolini for a time long past. Ciano scanned the faces of his audience. Amintore Fanfani's eyes gleamed as he listened. The man's smile was unnerving. He was not alone, and many of those present nodded solemnly. Others looked on unmoved, with faces which betrayed disappointment but not surprise. Yet no one interrupted.\n\nOnce he was finished, and had given a few curt instructions, the Duce followed King Umberto out of the room. Out of earshot of the others, the King grasped his hands in his own. \"Well done,\" he said simply, beaming. Ciano returned the smile. Yet once more it was in his mouth, not his eyes."

Everything indicates that this coalition, a moderate grouping of centrists, democrats and conservative elements bound by an idea of Catholic politics, will win power once the election arrives.\n\nThe Duce is not entirely pleased with their ideas, seeing them as too conciliatory to moderate leftist voters, but King Umberto is reportedly a firm supporter. Whether they will manage to push their advantage and implement their ideas remains to be seen."

 demitaly.42.t:0 "Meeting with the Parties"
 demitaly.42.d:0 "Umberto II was tired, but happy. As he sat down to have something to eat - dining alone for the first time in days - he reflected on the meetings with the political factions of the past few days.\n\nAll those who came to meet him had been respectful and, with a couple of exceptions, seemed intelligent enough. The Monarchists were, as expected, almost embarrassingly earnest in their professions of undying loyalty. The Christian Democrats were particularly interesting conversation partners, genuinely soliciting his views on a number of issues and then providing their own ideas. Aldo Moro had something of a radiant quality about him, with the quiet confidence of a man who knows he is the favourite to lead his country into democracy. The socialists were more courteous than he expected, with Pietro Nenni speaking at length and then observing the King carefully for his reaction. Umberto was under no illusions as to the republicans among their ranks, but Nenni artfully steered the conversation elsewhere whenever the King raised the issue. Of Almirante, with his ties to the PNF and his known views, he did not know what to make entirely. Yet the man was charismatic, even if he was the quietest of all the politicians he had spoken with over the past days.\n\nUmberto could be proud of what he had achieved. Italy would democratise, whatever the regressive elements among the PNF had to say about it. And he would be there to see it through."

 demitaly.43.d:0 "The left bloc is ready. For forty years they have survived on nothing but the hope of eventually abolishing Fascism and establishing a worker's government in Italy, and now that Fascism is withering away, they see this as a matter of fate. Their leader, Nenni, has moderated his socialist views to become more acceptable to the middling body of the Italian electorate. Time will tell whether this strategy will pay off, and whether the renewed hopes of the socialists, some of whom have only returned from exile recently, will bear fruit."

 demitaly.44.t:0 "A Roundtable of Parties"
 demitaly.44.d:0 "Ciano rubbed the tiredness from his eyelids and looked up. \"If there is nothing more to add,\" he said. \"I propose that we bring this meeting to a close. And thank you, gentlemen, for agreeing to come here on such short notice.\" But someone cleared his throat, and Ciano raised his head wearily. \"Would you like to speak?\" The person who interrupted did speak, at length, and Ciano actively stopped himself from nodding along. It was a grand old man representing the PNF interests, though not a party man himself. The democratic leaders that, at this meeting, only parties intending to run for election and civil servants of importance could attend. This had led to the awkward situation of a group of nominally independent civil servants speaking in defence of the PNF.\n\nIn any case, the PNF's man rambled on. He spoke about the threat to stability, of moving too quickly and throwing out the good of Fascism with the bad, and of letting down the hardworking members of the civil service through an imperfect democratisation. Ciano remembered the King, and held his tongue. He was here to mediate, and was determined not to give any of the Blocs - the right wingers, the Christian Democrats or the Left - cause to say he had been unfair. Ciano was sympathetic to the gentleman's points, he said carefully. Certainly democratisation would not occur at any cost and would not throw away everything of use. He was certain the party leaders agreed also on this - Ciano felt them getting angsty, with Nenni bursting to speak. Yet they should not be afraid, added Ciano quickly, to strike forth. No democratisation process could be perfect, and that should not strain their will to make the necessary change. With respect to the esteemed gentleman, who he knew to be an excellent leader of men and servant to his country, there would be no change to the plans. Ciano felt an audible shudder as he said this. He was starting to sound like the King.\n\nThe King himself congratulated him after the meeting, through his private secretary. \"Do not let the short sighted hold back what is best for your country,\" said the man to him before slipping away. The Duce returned to his office, fighting the lingering uncertainty in his gut, and shut the door."

 demitaly.45.t:0 "The Gift of Democracy"
 demitaly.45.d:0 "It was almost complete - the project that would be Umberto's legacy and that of Ciano, whether the latter was proud of the distinction or not. A workable democratic system and carefully planned out methodology for the transition had been plotted out. Now all that was left was to wait, in the unbearable silence that moments such as this carried, and hope for the best. The King had decided he would spend the moment on his own to the best of his ability. When he managed to get away from his hangers-on he lingered in a balcony, looking out over his Rome as the lights of the evening began to turn on. It was always beautiful, the most beautiful city on earth - thought the King - and today it would change for the better, although you would not know to look at it. Despite Ciano's doubts, which he continued to express to His Majesty even today, Umberto had faith in his people. Forty years ago his father had given Mussolini the keys to power, and now the son would return those keys to the people, to do with them whatever they chose. Perhaps they would choose wrong, but Umberto had more faith in them than that. They had received the gift of democracy, and whatever happened next that meant something."

 hotautumn.2.d:0 "In the days following the proclamation of the strike at FIAT, many began to realize that Turin was merely the first spark in the tinderbox. Soon, similar strikes were announced in the other major industrial centres of northern Italy, Milan. The working class district of Bicocca, in the northeast of the city, home to numerous important factories such as Pirelli, became the location of numerous strikes and worker protests. The strikes were so prominent and widespread that even the most reluctant trade union, CISL, was tentatively forced to support them for fear of backlash, and the central committees of UIL and CGIL have released a statement giving full support to the strikes.\n\nThe emergency isn't limited to Milan either - Genoa, Florence, Rome, Taranto, and every other industrial city in Italy, even smaller towns, are beginning to flare up with strikes. Every working class sector is involved, from steel mill workers to railway workers, and even other categories such as schoolteachers and nurses are beginning to set up strikes of their own, as the snowball is rapidly picking up speed and size. Their demands are as varied as the many groups they come from, ranging from more stable contracts to better wages and reduced work hours.\n\nWith the police deployed at most locations where the strikes are taking place, the government is confident that no other direct intervention is necessary, and with the trade unions now regaining control of the situation, it's only a matter of time before negotiations begin between the unions and the employers. While they will of course be forced to make concessions, a deal will surely be found in the end, and while many in government are worried about communist or extremist infiltration, a direct intervention from the government could easily do more harm than good."

Workers' control of the factories and workplace democracy are only some of the demands and slogans that are starting to be chanted - in Milan, workers attempted to violently occupy the Pirelli factory and were stopped by a police cordon, and in Turin, clashes with the police began after the workers started to accuse the police of being \"fascist dogs\". The most worrying development of all, which has exacerbated the situation further, is that it seems like communist agitators coming from universities and other youth movements are infiltrating and becoming influential among the striking workers.\n\nCommunist red banners are being raised in marches and protests, as students and workers march together. Universities are once again becoming inflamed with riots of their own, and frequent police sweeps barely seem to amend the problem, as law enforcement forces are starting to be stretched thin in numerous cities. Communist groups are once again starting to occupy classrooms and even entire buildings of universities, and the reaction from fascist groups has infallibly caused numerous clashes among students, some of which resulted in serious injuries and deaths.\n\nPolitics is, as always, divided and torn on how to deal with the issue. Representatives from Democrazia Cristiana have argued that the government should act as a mediator between employers and trade unions to quickly resolve tensions, while the Fronte Democratico has proposed enforcing the demands of the trade unions to safeguard the Italian worker. Finally, the Blocchi Nazionali have warned about the ever present communist menace, and have demanded a hardline stance against the red snakes that crawl in the underbelly of the Italian cities. With the government so bitterly divided, the situation seems more unstable than ever, and with no hope of a quick and peaceful resolution in sight, the Italian economy has started to suffer too."

Following a major clash between right wing and left wing students, the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, Italy's major right wing student organization, has attempted to occupy a few classrooms in Milan's university, the Statale. Barricading themselves in, the students of FUAN have employed their advantageous position to repel the assaults of their left wing counterparts who attempted to dislodge them. In response, various left wing student groups have declared occupations of their own, and the Statale has been turned into a warzone.\n\nClashes have been violent and relentless, with bottles and rocks being flung by both sides and bloody confrontations happening with crowbars and wrenches being used as weapons. The university's rector has attempted to negotiate with the students to attempt to calm things down, but it appears like his efforts are going to be fruitless. The police have already cordoned the university, and an intervention might be only hours away.\n\nNo comment has arrived from the leaders of FUAN and the representatives of the Blocchi Nazionali, the coalition FUAN is associated with - this leads many to believe that the situation has deteriorated because of radicals within the organization acting independently from their superiors. The chaos at the Statale is only yet another step of Milan's descent into chaos, and many worry that anarchy will soon spread to other universities of Italy, as it did during last spring."

With any semblance of negotiations breaking down, the police charged into the university, flushing out the students from the university and its surroundings using copious amounts of tear gas, batons and water cannons. Both FUAN and left wing students have been targeted by police, leading to some condemnation coming from many political representatives regarding perceived brutality.\n\nNumerous students have been gravely wounded following the police action, with dozens of them taken into custody by police. Numerous dangerous weapons, including makeshift bombs and a few guns, have been seized, but this new crackdown has done little to defuse tensions - both sides, leftists and neo fascists, accuse the other of collaborating with the police, and the political debate is only getting more heated, as leftist politicians accuse the Blocchi Nazionali of harboring neofascism and radicalism in FUAN while BN politicians accuse the Fronte Democratico to allow communist infiltration in student groups close to their coalition.\n\nWhile the university has been pacified for now, the streets of Milan remain chaotic. Numerous students from leftist groups have now left the universities and are actively agitating the striking workers, spreading communist propaganda and calling for unity between workers and students to change the system. Meanwhile, the city's right wing has not sat idle - local sections of the BN have expressed their condemnation of communist violence in the city and have announced that they won't stand idly while the reds attempt to overtake Milan with the police and the politicians' complacency."

Everywhere in the country it feels like a subterranean fire is rising, its excruciating heat boiling the atmosphere from the very depths of the earth. An entire town in Campania revolted over a factory being closed; Padova's university has become the theatre of occupations and clashes; numerous left wing associations and local party headquarters in Milan have been firebombed; fascist students have been attacked and given a bloody beating by communist ambushes; and the strikes, all over the country, are only getting bigger.\n\nThe Hot Autumn is upon us, a grand opera of tragedy and conflict. Many are those with stakes in the struggle, and many are being swept into this hot, searing wind that is blowing over Italy. A worker, striking for a fairer job that will let him care for his family in peace; a representative of a Catholic trade union, who sees the world around him slowly consumed by flames; a young idealistic neofascist, who with his fellow students hope to bring Italy back on the right track; and a police officer, standing on the thin line between anarchy and repression.\n\nAll of their stories intertwine, meeting and abandoning each other, as the threads of human lives do. But each and every one of us can only follow one thread in our mortal lives - and so a choice must be made between one of these four crossed destinies."

 hotautumn.7.d:0 "The news arrived like a blast of icy wind. Written in a cold, matter of factly language, the same communique was delivered to dozens and dozens of workers and employees at the large Pirelli industrial complex, a behemoth of smokestacks and work sheds dominating the Bicocca suburb of Milano. The job contracts that were supposed to last for at least another two years had been rescinded, and will be renegotiated - numerous workers were being laid off as the industry was being restructured - pension plans might be in jeopardy - wages will be rediscussed, and likely cut.\n\nMario Calabrò received the very same letter from the hands of a foreman. Reading it in the dim light of his apartment, his wife by his side, as the kids were already asleep. His family, his house, all were now at risk. If he were to be laid off, there was no other option - they would have to move back to Mario's home town, in the deep South. Milano was a mirage - a promise of work for everyone which had attracted many people like him, hoping to escape the poverty of the rural Italian south. Milano was an alluring monster - chewing people and devouring them whole after a lifetime of backbreaking work in the factories.\n\nIt didn't take long for a reaction to blow up, especially with strikes already underway in Turin. At first timidly, labour associations and trade unions announced their intention to protest - the first banners were hanged, the first strikes began. The leaders of Pirelli, captains of finance and shining examples of Italian industriousness, reassured that everything would turn out fine and that contracts would soon be renewed. Still, the situation was already largely out of Pirelli's control, and when the vast majority of factory workers in Bicocca crossed their arms in a strike, Mario was among them."

 hotautumn.8.d:0 "In all truth, Mario Calabró had never intended to be part of the demonstration in Bicocca that night, although it was also true that his sympathies were firmly on the side of those assorted laborers, students, and even teachers who made up the bulk of the group. He had previously joined similar events over the past few weeks after learning just how precarious his employment situation was. All the same however, on that cool night Mario Calabró, long-suffering factory worker, was only interested in returning home to his family as quickly as possible. That was why he, in a decision that was made so quickly the man himself did not even consciously process it, chose to take a route home that was supposed to be ever so slightly shorter. That choice to shave a few minutes off of his nightly commute would prove to be the most significant of his life.\n\nHe started hearing the shouts two blocks out after leaving the factory. At that moment, he could have changed his mind and gone his regular route, or he could have made another detour using some third way to avoid any unpleasantness. He chose neither option because, as he reasoned to himself as he walked along the sidewalk with his lunch pail dangling at his side, it was likely a noisy but relatively small gathering of his fellow workers and he could easily cross to the other side of the street and continue unimpeded. He wanted to catch his children before they went to bed, and to do that, he needed to move quickly. He had been working longer and longer hours recently with the economic troubles and he was seeing his family less and less. To a devoted family man such as he, such an arrangement was frustrating to the point of maddening but he had no alternatives if he wished to keep his job.\n\nHe ought to have been tipped off to the reality of the situation when the noise kept increasing the entire time he walked, but his concentration on arriving back to his home as soon as possible was damoening his perception of the outside world. That was why he was stunned to discover that instead of the few grizzled factory workers and fresh-faced students he had been expecting there was a veritable horde of angry protestors choking up the street. It only took a single sweep of the grim, determined faces for Mario to realize that he had just walked into the beginnings of the kind of riot that can shake the course of a nation."

However, he never expected that college students would join them spontaneously. In almost the blink of an eye, Mario went from being surrounded by his fellow workers to being surrounded by strangers who waved communist banners and sang revolutionary songs.\n\nIt was almost surreal, having communist university students walk side by side with men who had fought the USSR. Mario found himself talking to one of the students, a girl from Torino named Anna, and found something surprising. Unlike how the communists seemed to be portrayed, the girl was surprisingly eloquent, and she did not constantly speak about the bloody murder of all the bosses in Italy. It was a stark contrast from the communists at Biocca and Pirelli, who tended to be much more aggressive in their methods.\n\nHowever, before Mario could ask Anna to elaborate more on some of her views, they were separated by more groups joining the strike. While this strike had once merely included factory workers, it now held nurses, teachers, students, and so many more different types of people. Mario felt inspired. People from completely different walks of life were joining their strike, people that Mario would've never interacted with otherwise. They were all united, chanting slogans, waving revolutionary banners, and singing songs which undoubtedly made old Mussolini turn in his grave. Maybe there was hope after all for him and his family."

 hotautumn.11.d:0 "Throughout his whole life, Mario had never attended political meetings. He'd never been the most political man, so attending a meeting of communist students, of all things, was a brand new thing for him. Mario felt out of place, to an extent. While there were a few people there his age or older, the majority of the attendees were in their 20s - some seemingly even younger. Red flags and banners calling for proletarian - student unity were draped on the walls, as scrawny kids sporting red handkerchiefs and wide smiles exchanged talks with big, brawny steel mill workers.\n\nSoon enough, one of said scrawny kids, wearing a big pair of glasses and an eskimo jacket, took the floor - but his words were soon enough to convince everybody in the room that he was no ordinary youth. \"We are here today because we are united in a common struggle. The Italian working classes and the Italian students share a common goal, but moreover, they share a common enemy - the ruling classes, the padroni. Your bosses are the same people who, a few scant years ago, gloated at the sight of blackshirts marching in the streets, saluting them as they beat up, incarcerated, and tortured the proletarians who dared raise their heads against the regime.\"\n\n\"Now, the same thing is happening once again. All over Italy, the working class is once more locked in a deadly struggle with their bosses - with the only slight change that this time, your bosses hide under a facade of democracy as they beat up, incarcerate and torture those who defy them. The politicians representing you used to be fascist bureaucrats and supporters! Do not be deceived, my comrades - ours is not a democracy, for democracy cannot be handed down by those who rule from above. Democracy is won in a struggle - a struggle we must be organized, prepared for, a struggle we must win at every cost! Democracy is a rifle on the shoulder of the worker!\""

He had always brushed them off as radicals who should be ignored. However, Mario saw it all in a different light now, for he had seen the possibility of a future where the world could truly be free. He had hope of a time where there would be no more nights where he went to bed hungry, no more times when him and his family were destitute. That glimpse of a possible future, however small it may be, was worth pursuing in the mind of Mario.\n\nThe dream of revolution grew not only in Mario's mind, but in the minds of many members of the Fronte Democratico. The communists, once only a small subsection of the party, grew like wildfire. The rank and file grew more and more attracted to these radical ideas, and the moderates of the FD were drawn into more and more bitter conflicts with the radical leftists than ever before. These conflicts, as the Hot Autumn raged on, would only weaken the unity of the party."

Armored vans, horses, shields, batons, guns. \"They're going all out on this one\" said a kid who couldn't have been older than seventeen, spitting on the ground. \"They're scared.\" Calabrò looked to the other side of the square - what seemed like a ragtag assortment of striking workers, angry students, even a few women. Some carried signs wishing death to the ruling classes, others hid zhdanovs under their coats, possibly with the hope of giving a bit more credibility to that threat.\n\nThe standoff lasted for around four hours. Bottles and rocks were hurled at the police - the police fired back with tear gas. Calabrò felt the burning rise up his nostrils before he was handed a handkerchief soaked in water, and he wrapped it around his mouth and nose as he saw a young girl climb up the barricades and throw a rock at a cop who had advanced a bit too close. Hit on his head, he fell to the ground before being carried back behind the ranks as the policemen regrouped. When the police charge finally happened, the protestors all fled through side alleys, leaving battered barricades and a few burning cars behind.

Political and social equality sounded great, but actually achieving these goals would be nearly impossible, especially considering that the Italian government would fight tooth and nail against communist revolutionaries. The idealism of the students was infectious, but Mario had inoculated himself. He would strike, yes, but he would strike only for bread, and not anything more.\n\nMario's rejection of communism and radicalism was not unique. All throughout the Fronte Democratico, the moderate leftists and the rank and file workers rejected the call of communism, and the voices of the radicals were isolated more and more as fewer and fewer people listened to them. The revolutionary ideals of the communists gave way to the rational pragmatism of the moderates, unifying the party under the cause of bread."

Calabrò took part in this wholesome endeavour - he shouted and shouted like the others did, and yet nobody seemed to answer. Even the long cordons of police seemed bored, and rather annoyed at most.\n\nAt the end of the day, a representative from a union, perhaps CGIL, addressed the workers. \"Workers, comrades, what we are pursuing here is not utopias - we are building the foundation for a better life! A fairer pay! A safer workplace! And as we exercise our hard won democratic right to protest, we are assured that the government will need to heed our requests! Soon, things will change!\" Calabrò, like the others, shouted and cheered at the news.

Steel workers, farmers, miners, nurses, teachers, soon enough association after association announced they'd show up. Finally, the big ones - CGIL, CISL and UIL all announced they would take part in the rally, likely out of fear of losing every little crumb of credibility they had left. And soon enough, everybody seemed to be heading for Rome.\n\nThe government had been cautious - some urged for letting the protest happen, others demanded it shut down. Eventually, to ease tensions, the mass strike was allowed to happen, with an extraordinarily large police and military deployment. Milano, Torino, Taranto, Genova, the centres of insurrection had seemed to slow down - as everybody was busy preparing for what was to come. Signs were made, bigger than ever - new slogans were crafted, catchier and more appealing - meetings were held, speeches written, fists raised.\n\nCalabrò was not enthusiastic about the idea of the rally at first. The train ticket was costly, but then a friend of his, with contacts in CGIL, offered him a free one. He was afraid his wife would complain, but she actually encouraged him to go, even tentatively smiling. All his friends and colleagues were planning to go.

The Fori Imperiali echoed with the cries of the downtrodden - and the ancient stones answered with silence.\n\nIn response, the state was not afraid to flex its muscles. Tanks, APCs, armed soldiers, entire phalanxes of policemen and Carabinieri armed to the teeth, even some helicopters circling the skies of the Eternal City. There were many moments in which the crowd was about to erupt into violence - as if a spark would be enough to set Rome ablaze. But that spark never came. The rally came and went, shouting its cries into the halls of power - and the halls of power answered with silence.\n\nIn the end, politicians climbed their stages, as they always do. Promising solutions, promising that the people's voice has been heard. A few years ago, when the country was hopefully looking at a new future, this would have worked. Now, one crucial thing changed - once silenced, the Italian people were allowed to have a voice, and it was learning to use it too. Now, many were starting to learn that a voice wouldn't be enough, and more incisive methods were needed to make a point. Young leftists were ever more disillusioned. Frustrated. Angry."

Instead, he just felt silly, sitting at this desk in front of these suits.\n\n\"I assure you, Mister Calabrò...\" The head suit reassured the steel worker as he already had so frequently in this conversation. \"It will be most beneficial, to both the union and to the workers who make up the union..\" He gestured towards Mario. \"Such as yourself.\"\n\nMario Calabrò had his arms crossed over his chest in quiet, but weakening defiance. \"There's more important things going on. What would a debate solve? Much less a debate between union boys. Just... Have your debate, why should we care?\"\n\n\"Transparency, Mister Calabrò. Transparency, participation of the workers in the affairs of the union, expanding your perspective... You ask why you and people like you should care, I ask you instead, why shouldn't you?\" The representative leaned back in his chair at the end of his explanation.\n\nThe two sat in silence for an uncomfortably long amount of time, though the Union Suit sure didn't seem all that disquieted as Mario mulled over the offer in his head.

Really, it was enough to put the most politicized laborer right to sleep, that is, until the topic of reaching out to the other unions came around.\n\nThe CISL might be considered radical by Italy as a whole, but they were nothing compared to the outright socialists and communists in the CGIL. There was bad blood between the CISL, who looked to reform the system, and the CGIL, who advocated tearing it all down and starting anew. So, the yawning and droopy-eyed audience began to blink and sit up straight when the mediators asked the fancy suit men as to whether or not the union should join forces with the CGIL.\n\n\"We broke off from the radicals for a damn good reason!\" The suit sitting furthest to the right was making a real show of this. He might not have, had his compatriots seated on the other side of the forum admitted to understanding some of the benefits of such an alliance. \"If they'd had their way, they'd have forced us into this crisis long ago!\"\n\n\"The need for solidarity and unity supersedes individual political disagreements in times like these!\" One of the other speakers- the most eager among them to work with the communists, notably- rose to the defense of the idea. \"If we back down and negotiate with the corporations now, they'll think that the working class can be easily bullied! Pushed around!\"\n\n\"So you would sell the worker's soul to the rabid communists instead?\"\n\n\"The only soul on sale here sir, is your own.\"\n\nThe crowd listened, and as the voices lowered and the fire and fury cooled, a prevailing attitude took hold of the crowd.

The speaker who railed against an alliance with the CGIL took one last look over the crowd who had been swayed significantly in the other direction.\n\nMany workers had walked into that meeting hall without much of a mind to the upcoming Union elections, but by the time he left, he had decided. He'd stop by the union offices next week, and the CISL would hear what he had to say.\n\nWhat made them so different from a CGIL auto worker? He didn't join this Union for the politics, for the purity of its ideologues or any of its particularly high-minded ideals beyond what they said they stood for. The rights and privileges of the average worker, and how could that be achieved if they refused to work together?\n\nAnd so, when the time came to vote, he'd vote for solidarity and not division. A united general strike was a strong general strike, and the parliament up in Rome would certainly have to listen to them. Social Democrat, Christian Democrat, Socialist, Communist, what difference did it make when wages were low for all of those workers, regardless of their personal political inclinations? This fight was the fight for all workers, for all laborers, and he was part of the whole, weren't they?\n\nFrancesco's debate appeared to be a success, and Mario walked away from the debates with a greater sense of solidarity with his fellow worker than ever before. Should CGIL agree to it, they and CISL would stand, linked arm in arm, and the unions would in turn lock arms with the workers they represented, both those unionized and otherwise."

They were revolutionaries- both of the violent and voting sorts- and revolutionaries were hot of head and quick to anger, everyone knew. Would they react favorably to the offer? Would bad blood get in the way of progress?\n\nFrancesco Inceli leaned forward, hands steepled together, foot tapping rapidly on the ground. He was already running disaster scenarios through his head. CISL had been less than eager to join in on the General Strike than CGIL was, and even the UIL seemed more enthusiastic about it than CISL had been. Could they go to the UIL if the CGIL refused them? Or perhaps they could spin a refusal to earn the attention of their workers somehow... If only...\n\nMario Callabrò sat back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. It was time to see just how dedicated to the cause these Socialists were. Would they put aside their personal grievances to join forces with him, and men like him? He didn't see any harm in their alliance if it went through, but why should it bother him- or anyone like him- if the communists would not work with them? They could do this on their own, but it would be better to do it together, even a blind man could see that.\n\nThen, the doors opened, and three figures stepped into the room, practically flying on their feet. The first figure had a CISL pin on his chest, and stepped to the side with a wide smile on his face. The second, a pin with the CGIL symbol proudly placed on his own chest, practically swept into the room, walking right up to Francesco who was still standing up. The third entered at a much more relaxed pace, leaning against the doorframe.\n\nOnce face to face with Mister Inceli, the CGIL representative wasted no words, instead he grabbed the man's hand with a firm grip, and pressed his lips to Francesco's cheek, a display that caught the CISL rep off-guard, much to the amusement of the workers that filled the room behind them. \"We are told that you are the man to thank, Mister Inceli!\"\n\nFrancesco blinked as he recovered his senses. He looked around the room, and then past the Communist representative. \"We?\"\n\nThe last man stepped through the door frame, his UIL pin becoming visible in the light of the room.

Francesco never thought he'd see the day. He never thought he'd want to be part of it either, he recalled- with a little bit of shame admittedly- how he'd rail against communism and socialism when he was younger, when Virgilio was still just a tyke. Oh, he never thought that the people were anything more than idiots duped into a system that was incapable of standing up to pressure of any sort. But then he spoke here today, he spoke of the disparity of wealth between the working man and the rich man. He spoke of safety regulations and the insane expectations placed on workers for their productivity. And when he looked among the masses gathered before him, he could not tell who was a Socialist and who was not. When he waved his goodbyes to the crowd to make room for the next speaker, all of the workers made their approval known. Mario Callabrò had never thought he'd see the day, but not only was it here, but he was standing here, in the midst of it. Many of the CISL faithful had not attended the rally, something of an ironic striking of the strike, out of political convictions, but many more workers found their sense of worker unity and allegiance when the call was made. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw some of the fellow rally attendees stumble and fall, some shouts and harsh words were said. By the time Mario made it over to help the fallen man to his feet, the stumblers were already gathering themselves.\n\n\"Some jackass was shoving their way through the crowd towards the exit.\" The fallen worker muttered as he rubbed his head. A bump, nothing more. \"I can't see him anymore, he must've been in a hurry, I suppose.\"\n\nNone of the men recognized the man as someone from any of their unions, but the matter soon gave way to introductions and banter, as men of all three unions continued to mingle and build bridges."

Any man would be exhausted.\n\nShaking hands once more with the representatives of the CGIL and UIL, he accepted the cheek kisses- socialist fraternal kisses, he was told- begrudgingly before waving his farewells. He stepped down from the stage, and into the crowd that still filled the block even as many of them were filtering out to leave. He was often sidetracked, shaking hands and accepting rough-handed pats on the back from the workers as he made his way, slowly but surely, towards his car parked behind the stage.\n\nThe silence and stale air of the interior of his car was welcome. He'd never liked driving much, the car was too small, too restraining, and always smelled too much like an old man. Tonight though, those features brought him a strange sort of comfort. He leaned back, and allowed himself a moment to stare up at the moon and rest.\n\nIt simply wouldn't do to fall asleep here, though. Home was't far, and more than anything else, what he wanted was his bed, and some real, actual, restful sleep.

It was clear to all in the building what direction this debate had swung the decision in, and it wasn't what Francesco had intended at all.\n\nThe vote came just over a week later, and while generally agreeing on most of the proposed policy changes, the results made it clear that any attempts at aligning themselves with the other Unions would not be tolerated by the workers themselves, voting a crushing eighty-five percent to maintain their own policies at the expense of solidarity.\n\nThe skies might have been clear outside, but a shadow still seemed to loom over Francesco. What more could he have done? Why was he so stupid as to put it to a vote? The individual worker didn't know the big picture, and you can't explain something like that over the course of an hour. There was no time to dwell on the past though, he had to plan for what would come next.\n\nPlanning that Mario was already beginning. The debate stirred something in him.

For the past couple weeks, he had been speaking to union workers and advocates all over Milan, claiming that the Communists not only tried to infiltrate the CISL, but that they attempted to manipulate the vote. Mario Calabrò was no fan of communists, but he was no wackjob either.\n\nThe accusations were at first met with suspicion and skepticism. It sounded like a fascist conspiracy theory, but an idea repeated often enough and with enough conviction eventually takes on a life of its own. What if the Communists really did have the CISL suits in their pocket? What if they really were plotting to subsume the Union into their own for political gain?\n\n\"I was like many of you at first. I didn't believe the rumors, the gossip, the mutterings about Communist influence and manipulations. Wrote it off! After all, I even had friends in the CGIL, why would they ever turn on me?\" He was a gifted speaker, and with this dramatic pause, he had the gathering of workers practically standing on their toes, eagerly anticipating the rest of the speech.\n\n\"But it was fortunate I'd have those friends! For one of them, conscience won out over ideology, and he told me of the plan that was being whispered between them. I still didn't believe him, until he took me to their headquarters and had me listen in on a conversation! It was true! Now that they've failed to open the door into CISL through the vote, they are making plans to infiltrate our ranks and spread their revolutionary ideology!\" Mario could feel his own blood rising involuntarily, as much as he knew this man was speaking nonsense, he was still an effective speaker, and there was something about his message that he seemed to want to believe, but he couldn't put his finger on it.\n\n\"Well, what about it then, men?\" He held out his hands to either side. \"Are we going to roll over and allow them to use us for their own ends?!\" An open ended question, one that was answered with anger and frustration from among the crowd.\n\nBut then, something he didn't expect. They were red-faced in their rage, and they began to filter out of the room the speech was taking place in. A stunned Durante and Mario alike watched them storm out of the room and into the streets outside. The mob certainly wasn't about to allow any of that, and they were going to let the CGIL boys know that..."

 hotautumn.27.d:0 "Shouts and insults flew between the two crowds gathered outside of the CGIL headquarters. A small mob of CISL union workers had arrived mere moments before, hurling small projectiles towards the offices of the socialist union. When the CGIL workers walked out to meet them, they did not hold back.\n\n\"Commies like you ought to learn not to stick your noses where they don't belong!\" One voice said, his demands punctuated by a stone thrown to land at the feet of the opposition, doing nothing but eliciting a reply from the other side of the aisle.\n\n\"Perhaps you should heed your own advice, suckling little pigs!\" Came the reply from somewhere amidst the gathered Communist workers. The supporting shouts and follow-up jeers were interrupted when the CISL workers rushed the aisle to attack the CIGL workers head-on.\n\nWhere once insults and jeers were being exchanged, fists and feet took their place. The communists fell back at first, surprised at the sudden ferocity of their assailants. But with their numbers and their indignation, they rallied quickly, and met them with as much gusto as workers could muster.\n\nThe fight had only barely begun- and without any side gaining any seeming advantage in the short duration- when the flash of lights and wail of sirens interrupted the brawl. Like cats caught fighting in an alley, the workers scattered and rushed away from the arrival of the police officers, who rushed onto the scene with batons raised.\n\nA small skirmish, in truth, but all across the North of Italy, such suspicions and tensions flared up in isolated cases such as these. Workers stand as opposed to one another as they do to their supposed enemies as the Hot Autumn blazes on."

 hotautumn.28.d:0 "News has come out of the parliament in Rome, in the midst of the General Strike across the North of Italy. While members of Parliament skillfully avoided directly crediting the Strike itself as the primary catalyst for the passing of a recent bill, the Italian people were not fooled. This was a victory for the Workers, not a gift from a benevolent ruling class.\n\nThe breadth of the bill was expansive, covering most of the most pressing issues that the leaders of the striking Unions cited as their primary purposes for the strike. Poor wages and deteriorating infrastructure, inadequate social safety nets and even worse safety conditions, the list was long, and the proposed bill couldn't possibly cover it all. Now union leaders will need to decide if the government's response to the crisis is adequate.\n\nUntil then, the workers will remain on strike, and they, along with the protesting students and police, will remain active in the streets. In spite of the news, tensions are still high across the country, and few have much of any hope that any unenthusiastic legislation is going to put an end to the crisis any time soon."

 hotautumn.29.d:0 "Work was as always, a nightmare. The phones rang, his supervisors yelled, and the day dragged on slowly. A mixture of arguments and conversations tore through the CSIL office like a knife through butter. Francesco Inceli eyed the list of names and numbers across his desk, and gave a sigh.\n\nThe union was large, and it was a target. Allegations of corruption were common as were the occasional threat from many groups. The left wanted more entreaties, the right wanted them to bash Bolshevists- and the phones never stopped ringing. It was in times like these that Francesco did his best to remain calm; for he had calls to make.\n\nSpecifically there were three things on his mind, though he had enough time to do them today.\n\nA call to Milan, where a roundtable would be offered and workers negotiated with.\n\nA call to Rome, where investigations were being made into the unions.\n\nAnd finally, a call to home. His son and he had several disagreements, but there was always the possibility that the two could reconcile. There was hope."

 hotautumn.30.d:0 "\"I'm telling you, Francesco, they won't go for it.\" The voice on the other end of the line sounded exasperated, tired even. They'd been arguing in a circle for going on eight minutes, though it sure felt longer. But neither Francesco Inceli nor Timoteo Sartor could exactly just hang up the phones and do their job without coming to an agreement of some kind.\n\n\"Then the strike's going to peter out if we can't organize this damn thing. The companies will come back in once one Union settles and leverage us back down into the pavement.\" Inceli's rebuttal was weak, he knew, but it was all he had, and he wasn't wrong either. His point just failed to address the opposing point. Inceli replied, leaning over his desk with a desperate expression that bled into his voice.\n\n\"You overestimate how much trust they have in us.at the end of the day. Any agreement we come to with the Communists will be suspect. They'll think we've sold them out if we make any kind of accord in private rooms and phone calls.\" The grumbling came through on the other side, entirely right in his assertions too. \"They don't trust us, Francesco.\"\n\nFrancesco fell silent for a long time, allowing the quiet to dominate the line for nearly an entire minute. Sartor was about to speak up when Inceli suddenly broke the silence. \"What if it wasn't up to us?\"\n\n\"You mean we lie to them and say that we were approached first? Or...\"\n\n\"No, I mean, make it a broad union vote, rather than an internal decision. There's a few issues the Union's voting on in a few weeks, why not make opening up lines of discussion with the other Unions one of those issues?\"\n\n\"And what happens if they don't vote for it?\"\n\n\"We can try to convince them. They're good men, by and large, and should listen to reason when reason presents itself. Maybe we have a rally beforehand, or a debate, perhaps? Let them make up their own mind, and pray to God that they make the right decision.\""

 hotautumn.31.t:0 "Call Rome"
 hotautumn.31.d:0 "Even when they happened through a cable, discussions with the leadership of CISL followed a sort of liturgical ritual. After a bored telephone operator redirected his call, Francesco waited patiently and devoutly for a voice to answer him. As the responder demanded to know who the caller was, Francesco answered - and then he had to wait again to be redirected to the proper office, with a buzzing hum ringing inside the phone. Finally, a booming voice, with a very distinguishable Roman accent, rang out - \"Ah, I've been expecting your call!\"\n\nAfter the ritual small talk about the foggy weather of Milano and the sweltering heat of Rome, as well as an exchange of completely irrelevant news about the respective families, Francesco heard the question he was expecting - \"So, what can you tell me about the situation at Bicocca?\" What could be told about an entire district in open revolt, where brutal riots are becoming the norm and blood dirties the sidewalks? For once, Francesco decided to be extraordinarily blunt. \"Well, the situation might be somewhat inconvenient right now, but I'm sure everything will soon be under control.\"\n\n\"That's what I wanted to hear!\" said the bellowing voice of his superior. \"See, I was right when I noticed you. From now on, you can consider yourself in charge of the CISL section for all of Pirelli - and if any of those other boring Milanese pansies try to stop you, just tell me and we'll shut them up!\" Francesco swallowed, the noise he made covered by the laughter on the other end of the line. \"Now I have to go, I'm terribly busy these days - apparently a bunch of goddamn communist students set fire to a factory shed in Roma Nord and they're trying to pin it on us! Can you believe it?! Anyway, good luck in Milano - and remember, don't disappoint me! Buonasera, ciao, ciao, cia-\". A click was followed by silence - and the liturgy ended."

 hotautumn.32.t:0 "The Rotten Union"
 hotautumn.32.d:0 "Originally founded in 1918, the Italian Confederation of Labour was the first major Catholic inspired trade union in the country - and was quickly shut down by the fascist regime. During the Italian transition to democracy, it was reorganized as the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions, or CISL for short, and quickly rose to prominence as one of the major unions in the country. Unlike the other major unions, suspected of being dens of socialists or, God forbid, communists, CISL has always been the union for the upstanding, respectable Italian worker and foreman - a man such as Francesco Inceli.\n\nCISL has always been openly and unapologetically closely affiliated with DC, and some of its critics say that the habits of the party were quickly reflected by the union - some of its other critics say that this is in fact because CISL is nothing more than a DC sock puppet. Many workers, even those who shared the views of the union, felt that CISL was not acting in their interests, but in those of the party. Combined with the somewhat embarrassing instances of corruption going on in the union, this severely harmed the legitimacy of CISL in the eyes of those people it was meant to represent. Despite this, CISL was still one of the biggest unions in Italy, and was often able to dictate its line to other, smaller unions such as UIL.\n\nThese and more facts roamed around Francesco's head as he sat at his office desk once again, staring at his phone, while the white bakelite box stared him back. Corruption was an issue that could be too hard to tackle, and doing it in this delicate situation could be counterproductive - but it would go at great lengths to rehabilitate CISL's image in the eyes of workers, and possible ease tensions as workers will be more willing to let CISL negotiate a solution to the crisis. Another, much safer, option would be to instead use CISL's political weight to convince a smaller union, such as UIL, to work in tandem with CISL and safeguard the latter's position as the main anti-socialist trade union. Two phone numbers, hastily written on a note, sit on Francesco's desk, waiting for a decision."

Demotions and expulsions became the norm, and quite a few prominent names in the local section of CISL received a visit from the Guardia di Finanza. And amidst all this, Francesco Inceli sat content in his office, taking the chance to fill the spots left vacant with men he trusted.\n\nA ring filled the hot, humid air of the office. Francesco picked up the phone, greeted by the voice of one of his colleagues. \"What the fuck do you think you're doing?!\" The man on the other side of the cable was talking faster, and breathing ever faster. \"There's goddamn Fiamme Gialle in my office! They're taking my papers! This all started because of you! You're just trying to get us all in trouble so you can fill our positions with your friends, don't you?!

Tucked in a little corner of the Corriere della Sera was, however, a small but somewhat interesting announcement - a joint statement released by UIL and CISL announcing their official intention to collaborate for the entire duration of the crisis.\n\nFrancesco had a busy day at work that day - shaking hands, making promises, having meetings. Representatives from DC and even some members of FD spoke in front of an audience of CISL and UIL bureaucrats, reassuring the people that a peaceful resolution to the current crisis would be found through dialogue and mutual understanding between labour, businesses, and government. A victory against radicalism, for sure - and as the glasses of the politicians touch each other in celebratory toasts, the riots in the streets of Italy show no sign of subsiding."

He always had an uncannily clear image in his head of the desk jockeys just sitting and staring at the phone as it rang, it was an open secret that the UIL liked to employ such little bits of pettiness when dealing with other unions.\n\nEven still, he got through eventually. \"Francesco Inceli, I'm with CISL. I'm calling to speak with Representative Diolo?\"\n\nAnother waiting period just long enough to be irritating, but not long enough to actually be inconvenient, and then the line was picked up, answered by a voice hoarse and whispery. \"Nestore Diolo, UIL.\" Representative Diolo sounded older than he was, but he was still an old man by union standards.\n\n\"Nestore. It's Francesco. Again.\"\n\nThe silence on the other end of the line was deafening, but eventually, Nestore did respond. \"Mister Inceli. How can I help you?\" He spoke in an even, cool tone, one tinged with suspicion- well-earned suspicion, admittedly.\n\nGod above, Francesco hated doing this. He'd have to veil his disgust for the time being though. \"I have, erm, found myself in charge of the local offices for this branch of the Union, Nestore, and it's come to my attention that your own Union's branch here is having some... Funding problems, is that correct?\"\n\nHe was met with a silence more telling than any audible confirmation could be. Idly scratching down a note, he nodded to himself before clearing his throat and continuing. \"If, maybe, you and your union would be willing to do something for us, we could help with that.\"\n\nAnother long silence. Francesco could practically hear the walls of ethics built up around the old Union Man crumbling in that silence before he rasped out his reply. \"Very well then Mister Inceli. Let's hear it...\""

 hotautumn.36.d:0 "Workers' Solidarity only goes so far these days, it would seem. Francesco Inceli was enjoying his morning mug of coffee while looking over Le Conquiste del Lavoro, and the news within was somehow the more bitter of the two. It was good news, if you stood far enough back, but it did not sit well with the Representative regardless.\n\nThe story was about the Communists in the CGIL accusing the UIL of corruption with regards to recent negotiations with Fiat, where they adopted an uncharacteristically conciliatory stance towards the company. Of course, UIL was corrupt, but not in the way that the Communists were accusing them of. If you listened to CGIL, you'd believe that the UIL was taking bribes from either Rome or Fiat, to moderate their position, but in reality, it was CISL they were being influenced by.\n\nIt took a few more private conversations, and of course, promises of financial and political support should UIL adjust a few troublesome policies in order to be more in line with that of CISL's. They had overestimated how much the results of the deal would satiate the workers, the bribe money had gone to good causes, most of it anyways. The UIL was able to keep its various worker programs and its newsletter funded as of late, but that seemed to matter little and less for their own workers, who saw the recent compromises as a stain upon the Union's name, and suddenly, their support of the union was wavering.\n\nThere was a joke somewhere in the workers revolting against the Union, but while that wasn't the intended effect, CISL would benefit. UIL would never admit to bowing to another union, that may not be enough to kill one of Italy's largest unions, but it would absolutely test its limits. So in effect, while the other two largest unions in Italy bickered, CISL could stay, aloof and seemingly focused on what the union was founded to do in the first place.\n\nAll he needed to do was strongarm innocent and hardworking men into taking the fall for his politicking. Maybe another cup of coffee would distract Francesco from that fact..."

While the crowd may not be the teeming masses of CISL's workers, they were many of the local and regional leaders of CISL, among the brass of the union, no men were closer to the pulse of the average worker- and there was no one in the union they trusted more to be honest.\n\nHe stepped out and stood behind the podium and put on a solemn, serious expression. \"Friends, let me firstly thank you all for taking the time to meet with me today. I know many of you had to drive a long way, your labors have not been overlooked.\" The appreciation did not seem to elicit much of a reaction, but it was there more for sincerity's sake anyways.\n\nHe continued. \"I understand- we, understand- that the union, is not perfect. It cannot be perfect, for despite all our lofty rhetoric, we are only human at the end of the day. I know, it must be shocking for you to hear a man in a suit admit that out loud.\" That at least gathered a few isolated chuckles. He was winning them over, but slower than he'd hoped.\n\n\"But... We didn't sign up for perfection, now did we? Perfection is something that only exists in fantasy and dreams. This is why perfection is the domain of the revolutionary, and not the reformer. We know you have heard the recent news, and we want to reaffirm, with all of you, our continued commitment to constant ceaseless improvement. Not just in the workplaces and in conditions for the workers, but also in our own conduct, our own management, and our own effectiveness as a Union.\"\n\nThere were no smiles, no cheers, no enthusiastic applause, but they were nodding, nodding! There was still plenty of speech to go, but he was already through what he expected to be the roughest patch.

Things have only gotten worse for CGIL and UIL in the weeks following the start of the Strike, and they certainly didn't seem to be improving, or even in much of a position to effectively negotiate.\n\nCISL on the other hand? Business as usual, really, and not only that, but they were able to take advantage of the chaos and grow as a union, continuing to entrench themselves as the dominant Union in Northern Italy as the Strike wears on, grabbing more and more of the Government in Rome's attention as they did so. If there was going to be anyone who could bring this strike to an end in favor of the working man, why not CISL?\n\nThe General Strike was far from over, but slowly but surely, many opinions began to turn.

He'd heard the news of the barricade at the Statale and how the situation had grown more volatile since it began, but he- as much as he was ashamed to admit it- was too distracted with the General Strike to check on his son Virgilio, a student at that very university.\n\nAnd more distressingly? A member of the gang that had occupied the campus and was running that barricade. He needed answers, and could feel his own desperation mounting as he dialed the college's number once more, and sat in tense anticipation as the phone rang... And rang...\n\nAnd was actually picked up this time. He practically gasped as the voice of a young woman came on the other side. \"This is Gia, with the Statale, who is this calling?\"\n\n\"Francesco, uh Francesco Inceli. I'm calling after a student, Virgilio Inceli?\"\n\nSilence for a moment, save for the distant muttering of \"Gia\" with others that she was apparently standing with. After a moment of this, her voice returned to the line. \"You're in luck, Mister Inceli. Virgilio was seen leaving the campus, he was going to the train stations, it looked like. No one knows where he-\"\n\nThe phone hit the cradle at what must have been record speed, and within moments, Francesco Inceli was in a dead sprint, jacket, hat, and briefcase held close against his chest with the same arm.

The other sporting a leather jacket, a shaved head, and a fasces pin.\n\nFor a moment there was silence. Father was the first to break it.\n\n\"Are you alright? I heard what happened at the Stalale.\"\n\nOf course. He had seen what had happened on the TV and wanted to make sure if his precious little boy was okay.\n\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\nThe silence returned, colder and emptier than before. This time, Virgilio spoke.\n\n\"I came to see if you had changed your mind.\"\n\n\"About you joining that group of Nazi performance artists? Of course I haven't.\"\n\nThe words came out faster and harsher than Father first had intended. When he spoke again, there was a quiver in his voice.\n\n\"But you're still my son.\"\n\nThe silence was deeper than ever, an abyss between father and son like a thousand boxes of emptiness in a forgotten warehouse.\n\nThen Virgilio spoke once more."

On the other is a national restoration for us and generations to come! If only I had a father who fought to push the nation towards restoration with me!\"\n\nHis father tried to speak up, he reached out to put a reassuring hand on Virgilio's shoulder, but the youth slapped it away, stepping forward in turn with an accusing finger to poke into his father's chest. \"It's not too late.\" He whispered, a voice trembling with emotion. Rage? Sorrow? Who was to tell? \"Come with me, to the barricades. We'll destroy the socialist threat, we'll save Italy, father.\"\n\nAnother chasm of quiet emerged between the two, even as they stood close together, eyes locked, neither of the two willing to blink first. It would only be an exhalation from Virgilio's father that broke the stilled air.\n\n\"No matter what.\" He whispered, stepping back, eyes cast meekly to his feet. \"No matter what Virgilio, you are still my son.\" And then he turned on his feet, from the balcony, back and into the home.\n\nThere would be no time for tears. No time to rage or shout. With trembling fists and burning eyes, Virgilio turned from home and began the trek back to the barricade. This was good, he decided. After all, in the fight against evil, there is no greater weapon than anger. Unfettered, righteous rage burned in like a fire in his belly, and he'd be all the greater a warrior for it, and all Italy would bear witness, he knew."

A herd of animals might act erratically, but it's always a response, you can always tell that there's something pushing them in one direction or another, at the end of the day. But when the situation gets as crowded and the tensions rise as high as they did at the barricade tonight, cause and effect leave the realm of the material and become something arcane, ought not be understood because it cannot.\n\nAnd like the force of nature it was, the protests and the barricade broke the tension. Did someone throw something? Did the shouts and insults finally strike a nerve? Did someone move too erratically, too suddenly, and unleash the cascade of violence? Was it the fault of the left, or that of the right?\n\nDoes it matter?\n\nIt was all consuming, the suddenness and completeness of the outbreak. All at once, the masses of protesting students rushed forward, with little else but fist, branch and stone to wield against their foe in the barricade. Chants and shouts erupted as the sides clashed together in a violent cacophony.

Among the broken and trampled lay Virgilio Inceli, with eyes wide in shock and a neck snapped back in an unnatural manner, half-buried beneath the debris of the palisade.\n\nIn short, it was no way for Francesco to find his son. but it was still about what he had expected. Walking over to his son's corpse, he removed the detritus and wreckage from atop his smashed form and freed his body from the rubble. Sitting down, he placed his son's head on his lap and sighed, closing his own eyes even while his own hand closed the eyelids over Virgilio's.\n\nHe looked like he was sleeping when his eyes were closed. That made it a little more bearable at least. With a trembling hand, he reached over and took Virgilio's own blood-soaked hand in his own, trying to ignore the slight feelings of splintering bone and battered flesh as he held his son's hand for one last time.\n\nAnd there he sat, tears falling like the rain from eyes squeezed shut, interrupted only by an occasional gasping sob, extinguished the last embers of the fire that once raged in this place.\n\nWhen the police and the doctors came to take his broken boy away, he whispered quietly in his son's ear, the last thing he had said to him before he'd stormed off for the last time. \"No matter what, Virgilio. No matter what.\"\n\n\"You are still my son.\""

Don't know if I deserve it.\" He admitted, quietly, with a choked voice and downcast eyes.\n\nNeither party was quite sure when they had transitioned into an embrace, or who stepped into the other first, but with a face buried in his father's shoulder, Virgilio let out a scream, muffled by the suit and shoulder. It was a scream of years lost, a scream that expelled and breathed out his hatred he held deep inside, a scream that banished the rage and violence that he had allowed to permeate to his core.\n\nHis father hugged him all the tighter in response, and after a few seconds that lasted an eternity, he slowly led Virgilio into his home- their home. After leaving the pale-faced, tear-eyed youth on a chair, his father prepared a kettle of tea for the two of them, and they continued to speak.\n\n\"I don't know where to continue from here.\" Virgilio admitted, staring at the steam rising from his cup. \"I feel as though I unleashed a monster, and now all I can do is watch as it destroys that which I tried to save.\"\n\nHis father sat and nodded as his son spoke. \"As always, your trail is your own to blaze. But if you want my advice...\" He began breathing in deep as he set aside an empty cup. \"Follow some of your own.\"\n\n\"I... Don't underst-\"\n\n\"Back before you left.\" He interrupted, leaning over the table emphatically. \"Back before you well and truly lost your way, we'd often argue, and you often told me that when evil rose, it was the duty of good men to stand against it, that anything else only abetted such evils, yes?\" He leaned back. \"If you unleashed this beast of hatred, of rage and violence, then if you are to start being a good man, it is up to you to stand against it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I can, the barricade is still up and there are many more of them than there are of me.\" Virgilio rubbed an arm uncertainly as he spoke, in spite of the heat.\n\n\"Words, Virgilio, are action.\" His father declared emphatically. \"Violence does not cure violence, so perhaps it's time for you to give the strength of words instead of fists.\"\n\nVirgilio mulled that over in his head a few times after hearing that, and his brows knit in determination as the vision grew clearer. He knew what he had to do."

Slogans and chants were being thrown across between the Socialist protesters and the fascist barricade, threats of violence and denunciations filled the air, and what once sounded sweet to the ear had a harshness to it that he couldn't detect before.\n\nA deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, Virgilio steeled himself as he snuck his way around the protesters to return to the barricade, where he was greeted with shouts of approval and ecstatic greetings from his comrades.\n\n\"Virgilio! What took you so long? We had thought you might have fled! Glad to see we are wrong!\"\n\n\"The reds are growing agitated out there, have you heard anything that can help us?\"\n\n\"What is the nation saying about this? Are they rallying behind our example?\"\n\nVirgilio tugged at his shirt collar for a moment, and spoke slowly and with a measured tempo. \"The nation remains as divided as ever.\" He admitted, glancing at the faces of his compatriots. It was clearly not what they wanted to hear, they wanted to hear of a fascist nation, reinvigorated by their actions here. He'd have to lay it on thick. \"Some think what we are doing here is admirable, while others scold us for our defiance and belligerence.\"\n\n\"But surely, we are doing good work here, right Virgilio? The ones who stand with us aren't sitting idle, right?\"\n\nVirgilio's silence struck them more severely than any words could. Where once fiery, impassioned eyes once glared hatefully at the enemy across the way, now they glanced uncertainly between one another. They were looking for that fire, that fury that up to a few moments ago, they all shared.\n\nThere was none to be found."

They looked to Virgilio for guidance, and he spoke with a resigned voice. \"There's nothing for us here. When the sun sets, we can slip away, we can pretend like-\"\n\n\"Pretend like nothing happened, Virgilio? When did you turn so craven?\" A voice piped up from behind him. He didn't recognize the man, but evidently the man recognized him.\n\n\"I... Yes. I think it's pretty clear that-\"\n\nThe man interrupted him, stepping between Virgilio and the other students. \"Pretty clear that your belly is weak and your spirit quails in the wake of challenge. You want to know why no one has rallied? Because all we've done is hide behind wood and stone!\"\n\nOnce again, Virgilio could feel his blood rise and the bile build up in his throat. But this wasn't like before, it was different on some level he couldn't quite identify. \"And what would you propose instead?\"\n\nThe provocateur shot a fist up into the air. \"We take the fight to the Communists! We rush the reds, prove our valor, and drive them off before us! Then all Italy will see that she still has strength!\"\n\nIt was strange. He'd said much the same before and often, had he sounded so deluded before? How many people must have written him off as a madman? How many people might have been right to do so?\n\nVirgilio glanced over towards the rest of the students and sighed. \"This was a mistake. All of this. Those of you with something to live for, come with me.\" He turned and began to walk, and could hear the meek shuffling of feet, about half of those gathered, he reckoned.\n\n\"And those of us with something to fight for will stay! Go home you old women, to your knitting and rocking chairs! Us men will fight for you even still.\" The remaining half turned and went back to the palisade."

For now, they had no choice but to hide their shame and the humiliation of their failure here.\n\nBut that was only for the time being. The fascists would hide their face, they'd slink off, but they'd go home. They'd reflect on their defeat here, and if their spirits didn't quail, it would be a source of rage, of fury, fuel for the fire in the belly.\n\nThey'd take that with them to their dorms, to their homes, their villages and their communities. It would burn inside of them, and it would serve as a hundred beacons for those with a similar spirit, a familiar rage as the bloodied Fascists.\n\nLet the reds celebrate for now, they can have their repetitive songs and girlish dances.

Of course it wouldn't matter if there was any money in the school budget for some half decent air conditioning, but there wasn't. The school probably had wasted all the money on keeping the union workers happy, and the economy had been in the trash since the democratic transition anyway.\n\nHe got dressed, and walked to his first class, History of Italian Politics. The professor was a degenerate, a coward, probably a secret communist, and worst of all, a woman. Inceli thought about her, and he felt hateful.\n\nOn his way, a group of radical students was holding a demonstration in the main university thoroughfare. Their proud red banners caught the sunlight as they strutted back and forth, and they had a partisan sort of bravery about them as they chanted slogans. If Virgilio had been with his friends, brave companions of the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, they would have chased the leftists back to their hidey holes. But they were busy, and he was alone, so he slunk away and proceeded.\n\nIt wasn't that Virgilio Inceli was reluctant to join in the struggle for national redemption-- it's just that he was indecisive. Many of his fellows were meeting with the national organization, trying to persuade the Blocchi Nazionali to find its balls. They had asked him to come, and he had demurred. They had had high hopes for Almirante. He had been a rising star in the PNF before its dissoltion but now he seemed nothing more than a tired old man... Others were at the new front, fighting the new battle with sticks and rocks against the communists and their police collaborators.\n\nAs Virgilio Inceli joined the class, his thoughts were still on the strikes, the meeting, and the future of the nation. But they strayed from this as well, and moved on to other things. Feelings he had half forgotten. A home, a father who didn't understand. Having comrades, but not friends. And as the class came to its end, and Virgilio Inceli stood at the building's threshold, struggling to make a decision, he felt lonely."

This was, it must be noted, not entirely to his detriment, as the FUAN was the sort of organization where furious agitation paid silver. Gold, if it was particularly insipid furious agitation, rooted in the general angst of everyday life and directed at the \"enemies\", whoever that might be at any particular time.\n\nFUAN, or at least the significant portion of its central committee present that the meeting, was a place of speeches, a place of rage and rabble rousing, a place of daring political maneuvers against the vile enemies of the Italian nation. These usually ranged from the traitors and cowards in Rome, vilified from a safe distance in the organization's weekly newsletter, to the on-campus radicals and leftists, enemies of all decent people and positively destroyed and eviscerated regularly by the scathing cartoons drawn by second-year Mario Salvini, often accompanied by Inceli's scathing editorials.\n\nBut the FUAN was more than just a group of noisy kids. They were the forefront of the national revolution. They were the Italian future. Their actions were more than just pranks and name-calling, they were bold moves to defend the people.\n\nAnd they were more than just pranks and name-calling. More often than not, when a strike escalated into violence, it was FUAN on the front lines. When heads needed to be kicked in, FUAN was the steel toed boot that did the job. There were whispers that some of their radical members had bought arms illegally, and were willing to use them.

 hotautumn.52.d:0 "In the city of Rome, birthplace of European civilization, there was a building. The building was owned by the Blocchi Nazionali, a party that stood for the defense of Italian civilization, nationalism and democracy hand in hand, and definitely not Fascism.\n\nIt was not a grand building. On the outside it wasn't nearly as impressive as the concrete behemoth that served as the party's headquarters near the cities center. This building was made out of cracked brick, and graffitied heavily by all varieties of dissident ne'er do-wells. The inside similarly lacked the many creature comforts of the BN headquarters, being notably devoid of the in-house bars and smoke rooms that the BN's main locus' spartan exterior hid so well.\n\nStill, it was a building that the party put to good use. There were leaflets not yet ready for release that needed storage, certain items devoted party loyalists which were...inappropriate to store in a public place, and meetings that might be best kept out of the view of the commons. It was for this purpose that the building was used one warm fall day, as representatives from the BN's central committee met with the \"grand council\" of the Front of National Action of University Students.\n\nThe room was uncomfortably warm, and with great reluctance the students removed their black jackets. A few of them had sewn in small Fasces or depictions of Mussolini onto the breast pockets, and they grew glum as they discarded the wonderful attempt to challenge the BN's transition to non-fascism.\n\nThe BN representatives were, for the most part, exactly as Virgilio Inceli had expected. A bunch of old men in suits who harrumphed at the most mild suggestions of direct action, and wrung their hands in response to the FUAN's zeal.\n\nThe meeting also went about as well as he had thought it would. The FUAN proposed a direct series of counter-demonstrations against the counter demonstrations, and the BN looked shiftily from side to side. The FUAN demanded permission to openly use the words \"communist\", \"bolshevik\", \"traitorous\", and \"bourgeois\" in referring to their mutual enemies. The BN fiddled with their ties. The FUAN wanted the BN to formally support their right to use violence in self defence, the BN declared that it was time for a lunch break.\n\nWhen they returned, Inceli decided he had enough of this. It was time to bring matters to a head, and find out where the party's true loyalties lay. He cleared his throat and began to speak."

As the silence following Virgilio's pronouncement grew, they glanced at his hands, his feet, anywhere but his eyes, wide and scared, or the red pouring into his face.\n\nThen the uncomfortable silence was broken by applause.\n\nFrom the far end of the BN's side of the table there was one man, who while equal to the others in age and demeanor, differed from them radically in appearance. He wore a tight black turtleneck, somehow more imposing then the student's black leather. On his lapel, he wore not just the fasces but also the knife and skull. it was he who applauded, his hands meeting in sarcastic enthusiasm, the cruel lines of his face wrinkled in enthusiasm. When he spoke, the other BN reacted with curious mixtures of exasperation.\n\n\"Absolutely! These youngsters might need some guidance, but they've got the right idea! The nation has gone to hell, and we need their vigor to bring it back. Believe, Obey, and Fight, that's what we need! We need to meet violence with violence.\"\n\nThe stunned silence returned, but before the students could react, one of the suits spoke in a tone of crisp dismissal.\n\n\"The meeting is done. We appreciate the work of the FUAN, but we must ask you to vacate party premises immediately.\"\n\nMoments later Virgilio Inceli and the others were outside the building, a few of their jackets left behind in the haste of failure. The morning heat had evaporated, and fat mournful droplets had begun to fall from the sky.\n\nInceli supposed that he should feel angry. That he rally his compatriots against the weak and traitorous BN and their hollow bourgeois democracy they supported. But he felt only sadness of failure, and only disappointment in their eyes."

The contrarian lunatics who cling to every patriotic organization like mussels to a whale. The ones who spoke admiringly of Farinacci, of Hitler, even of the \"discipline\" of the SS. A few of them had somehow wormed their way into leadership in the FUAN, and when they received the letters no one spoke out, because after all, they were lunatics. Then it was the spineless. The ones who sought ever greater power for themselves, and were willing to ally with anyone and say anything to increase their own power. They would in one meeting make bold claims of the violence necessary for the restoration of Italian strength, and in another wring their hands about every scrape and bruise the FUAN meted out to its bolshevist rivals. When they received the letters of dismissal no one spoke out, because they were weak. Inceli had let himself hope then that the BN had some potential afterall, that they were merely acting to refocus its sister student organization, and that any day now they'd apologize for their conduct at the meeting and invite the remaining leadership back for further planning. But then it was the honorable. The true scions of Italian Nationalism, the ideological heirs of Mussolini, who sought to once more raise the people's patriotic consciousness and shephard in a return to glory. When the letters came for them, there was no one left to speak out. No leadership council to speak of except for the BN's puppets and toadies.\n\nVirgilio read the words one more time, his vision blurred with tears of rage. \"While the leadership of the Blocchi Nazionali appreciates your contribution to the nationalist student movement, we have decided it is for the benefit of the movement for you to vacate your leadership position immediately.\"\n\nHe threw the letter aside. He would fight them. He'd go around the city, find all the representatives of past and present and rally them to action. FUAN's ex-leadership was rapidly accumulating an alphabet soup of splinter groups. Inceli would be their unifier. They'd go to the BN's offices and MAKE them see the way.\n\nIt would fail.

A free Italy. A strong Italy. We have made mistakes -- I am the first to admit it. But our enemies outnumber us ten to one, and have foreign support as well. If we are to triumph, it must be all of us together. It is either unity, or death.\"\n\nHe had them. A few of the oldest and slimiest representatives writhed in their seats, but they were by far a minority. One member of the party -- seated on the edge of the table and wearing the famous black turtleneck and pin of the MSVN went so far as to chuckle appreciatively.\n\nThen the center most delegate spoke: \"Well... I think we should be able to arrange a meeting with our senior leadership. We'll let you know when.\"\n\nPart of Inceli wondered if this might be a trick, if the call would never come -- but it did.\n\nThe meeting was late at night, and at a mansion not a dodgy, crumbling office. The best the party had to offer. It was roses and chandeliers for the FUAN this time, not cracked streets and broken windows. They filed past well equipped security guards and into an office decked with splendor, complete with marble pillars and plush leather chairs.\n\nAnd there in the middle, Almirante.\n\nInceli had had doubts about the BN leader's sincerity before, but seeing him in the flesh, he knew that they were mistaken. The chairman was somehow wise as well as bold, kind and yet fierce. When he asked, softly but firmly for the FUAN's loyalty, Inceli was only too willing to give it.\n\nItaly would be strong again.

When he saw that the man was perspiring a great deal, he put it down to some fair weather cold.\n\nHe didn't notice when the recruiter stopped haranguing non-members about the \"Bolshevik menace\" and \"red terror\"; he didn't notice when the district representative began to extort the position of the BN men and began to turn on his former allies, branding them, \"Extremists who threaten to besmirch our message.\" He had no way to see how much healthier the representative's bank account had suddenly become, no way to see the bruises on the recruiters' sides.\n\nHe took notice when, almost overnight, the secretary for the FUAN branch of the city of Rome changed his position on working with the BN. Where he had only a few hours ago railed against the proposed rollback of aggression against suspected and known communist groups and individuals, he was now delivering a speech on the benefits of working with the established party to convince the people that Communism was not the answer to their problems. With horror Inceli began to remember every small hint, every change in behavior, every temper that had recently seemed to cool. He had taken it for granted that the last true believers of FUAN would hold firm against those who wished to use the name and legacy of fascism for their own selfish ends. He had been mistaken, and with every day passed, he could see that the rot of BN was ensnaring more and more prominent members of the leadership.

Inceli quickly found himself surrounded by a crowd of admirers and a bottle of wine pressed into his hands as they urged him to recount the details of his trip to Rome. In the haze of good drink and companionship, the details of the trip began to change in his mind. The BN's attitude was not defeat -- it was merely a setback! The FUAN was not broken, it was merely reorganizing to rise again!\n\nInceli listened to his friends and spoke to them in turn.

He didn't like it any more than he did at the start, but he had to admit that the plan had some merit. Not a great deal, but some.\n\n\"I'll... Bow to your collective wisdom. So, what's the plan then?\"\n\nThe speaker practically beamed as he was allowed to continue. \"I was just saying that I've spoken with the police. They'll form a perimeter to-\"\n\n\"The police?\" Virgilio's voice betrayed more of his incredulity than he'd meant to.\n\n\"Yes, the police. As we said, we're trying to appear legitimate and law-abiding. They can both protect us if the communists try to antagonize us. They'd be willing to fight us alone, but riot cops with shields and batons? They wouldn't have the balls.\"\n\nHe went back to detailing the intricate details of their little protest, and Virgilio was left slinking further into his chair."

The only thing that was missing was a war and an enemy to fight.\n\nIt would only be a slight exaggeration to say that the FAUN students were as heavily armed as their protectors that day, batons rested lazily in their hands as their helmeted heads looked up towards their speaker- the second of the evening- in a manner that reminded one more of soldiers standing at attention than students listening to a speaker at a political rally.\n\nThe speaker moved and spoke with a kind of energy and bombast that seemed familiar to many, including most of the police who served as the rally's protective cordon. As he continued, Inspector Ovidio turned towards Inspector Constantini and whispered with all the subtlety of a tank.\n\n\"Where'd the kids find this one anyways?\" He remarked, narrowing his eyes skeptically towards the stage. \"He's good. Looks professional too. I had kind of assumed one of them would be up there, not someone who looks like he could sit in Parliament.\"\n\nConstantini tilted his head and tapped his own chin lightly with his own baton. \"I've seen him before, I think.\" He muttered idly. \"He does a lot of these speeches, I've walked by him before on my way home.\"\n\nThey were joined by an unexpected third voice, that of one of FUAN's student leaders, Virgilio Incelli, had moved his way towards the rear and apparently overheard them. \"That's Pino Romualdi, he's from the BN, try to show a little respect.\"\n\nOvidio shrugged nonchalantly, seeming to not even notice the student's aggressive body language and tone. \"He's just a speaker. Trying too hard to look and sound like the old Duce too. Someone should tell him he has a microphone and doesn't need to yell so loudly.\"\n\n\"Well... Maybe it's inherited.\" Came Incelli's sullen retort. He was about as eager to explain as they were to ask, which wasn't at all. So he pivoted quickly. \"Besides, maybe if you two listened to his words instead of his volume, you'd learn a thing or two about strength.\"\n\nConstantini felt an eye twitch involuntarily. \"Maybe he could use some of that strength to tell us before he shows up unannounced next time. The speeches were supposed to be over by now.\"\n\nHe felt an instant sense of regret for having said that, but that was nothing compared to the look of abject hatred that young Incelli offered him instead..."

He stormed up to the Inspector, and shoved him backwards. \"And what do you care? Huh? Go up there, go stop him.\"\n\nThe Inspector was caught off guard by the display and wasn't prepared to respond when two more officers from the cordon stepped forward, placing themselves between the student and Constantini with their batons brandished.\n\nBy now the scene had captured the attention of all of those gathered, the speaker was talking to part of his own personal security, while the fascist students stood behind Virgilio, who stared between the two officers. One of them held out a hand and simply demanded that the young man hand over his baton.\n\nIt all happened so fast, the sound of a baton's crack against flesh and bone, the immediate roar of approval from the fascistic students, the cries and shouts of dismay from the officers, the sound of rushing boots across the cobblestones and the sidewalks. The officer who had demanded the baton clutched his snapped forearm against his chest, but soon enough, there would be too much going on to help the poor man.\n\nAll across the square, Incelli's comrades surged forward and followed his example, the police had expected some hostility, but quickly, the situation spun out of their control. On all sides, students and police officers wrestled and charged with batons in hand, the sounds of violence as varied as it was bloody spilling into the streets around them."

Only a small number had fallen, most often to head blows and arms struck by batons, while they continued to hold against their assaulters.\n\nAs for the students, for all of their ferocity and their zeal, they were still students and not fighters. As soon as they had rushed the officers, some were already falling back, while others had rushed the exact opposite direction, towards the stage that the politicians and speakers had already vacated. Few paid them any sort of mind, however, as the battle raged, and the tide began to shift.\n\nThe better-equipped and more well-prepared forces of the police began to, one by one, drive off their attackers. The handful who had fallen to blows to the head, arms, and bellies were dragged behind the cars, and now it was starting to become the police who chased the protestors and not the other way around.\n\nAs if the situation hadn't gotten bad enough for the FUAN, the din of the fighting was quickly drowned out by the roar of engines, the pressure of tires on cobblestone, and the rumble of armored vans storming into the square.\n\nThe panic quickly mounted among the students, but to their credit, they did not merely flee and disperse. Instead, they turned and they rallied, back to where the students who had turned back earlier had run to. When they emerged from behind the stage, they had discarded their batons and now their blood-caked knuckles carried pistols and rifles in their steads.\n\nSoon, the streets would ring with the song of gunfire."

Scattered among the buildings in the square, behind trees and within bushes, the rebellious students held their rifles and pistols close to their chest. From their hiding positions, they watched the semicircle of armored vehicles and waited, fingers and feet drumming impatiently against walls, cobbles, trees, and their weapons.\n\nTheir patience frayed. Plans came to fruition. The silence of the square was filled with tension and unease, and both parties waited for the other to make the first move. The silence was first disturbed, but not broken, by jeers, shouts, and insults from one side to the other, but still, the tension did not break. That didn't happen until the first gunshot.\n\nIt was impossible to tell whose gun fired first, but the result was all the same. The boots of the law stormed the square, and the amateur shots of the students filled it with the song of gunfire. Lead cracked and splintered against the road and sidewalks, as officers fired back against students and into the shadows.\n\nIn groups of two and three, police moved through the square and the storm of bullets that filled the air around them. The fight would need to take place building by building, tree by bush by shrub. The work has only begun, and already there were grunts and shouts of pain as the bullets found their marks regardless."

 hotautumn.64.d:0 "\"Stay close.\" Ovidio muttered as the two of them proceeded cautiously deeper into the alley. The Inspectors had their pistols drawn and held at the ready, pointed down by their legs as they tread further and further from the safety perimeter. \"Don't want to fuck it up in the final moments, right?\" He offered Constantini an unconvincing smile.\n\nThe operation was in fact, wrapping up. The absolute overkill that the police forces had brought into the square meant that the poorly armed and untrained students couldn't hold out forever. Rather than facing arrest, most of them had fled, though it was noted that there were a number of students who were staying and taking potshots at the officers who remained.\n\nInspector Ovidio had sworn up and down that he'd seen a shape rush from some of the brush and into an alley straddling the square that the broken-up demonstrations had taken place in. So far, there wasn't much to suggest that anyone had been down this way, but if there was one thing these militant students were good at, it was hiding. Maybe Constantini would have a joke for that if they weren't also armed. \"Keep your voice down. Echoes.\"\n\nConstantini's eyes scanned the walls and windows above as he proceeded, now alone against an unknown for. Slow, measured movements from one windowsill caused the Inspector to jump, turning his pistol skywards.\n\nThe cat on the sill stopped in the middle of its grooming, its leg high in the air and feline eyes glaring judgmentally down to the officer. Constantini lowered his pistol, and gave a slight chuckle. He must be losing his-\n\nThe sound of the gunshot and the crack of a bullet against cobblestone blended with one another, but he didn't have time to consider that before the sharp, shattering pain struck him in the side of his knee. He fell with a shout that must've been audible as far as the Vatican. He could just barely register the pain when his head struck the wall.\n\nOvidio was saying something as he cradled Constantini's collapsing form, but he couldn't quite hear it. Even as blood ran from his head and onto Ovidio's leg and the cobbles beneath, Constantini couldn't keep from chuckling.\n\n\"It was just a cat, Ovidio.\" He laughed, his voice weakening by the moment. He got the last word in, \"Just... a dumb cat...\" before his chuckles faded into a rattle."

Eventually, the man's speech would run its course, and while he offered one final call to action to his steadfast audience, there was a sense of palpable relief that washed over both Student and Officer.\n\nQuickly- with perhaps a bit more haste than considered polite- the police went into formation to provide an escort for the FUAN students to leave the square. Curiously, however, the students didn't only take their time getting ready, they didn't seem to really be moving or preparing much at all. The gathered audience, even as Romualdi and the other speakers prepared to go on their way, just stayed and milled about listlessly in the square.\n\nInspector Constantini peered at the sun that threatened to set behind the horizon, and then back to the formed line of officers. Letting his shoulders slink, he nodded to himself before walking up and towards the gathered students. He reached out to tap the shoulder of the nearest one, and once again, was met with the scornful gaze of Virgilio Incelli.\n\n\"Mister Incelli.\" Constantini maintained an even, diplomatic tone to his voice, though he suspected his face betrayed how tired he was at this point. \"The cordon is ready to escort you and your compatriots out of the square, we were wondering when-\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary.\" Came the curt reply of Virgilio, cutting off the officer and leaving both silent as the Inspector processed what had just happened. Virgilio gave a brief glance back to his fellow students who didn't know what game Virgilio was playing. Not that he could blame them, he didn't know what he was trying to accomplish, save for stepping on the pig's toes.\n\n\"Not necessary?\" Constantini tilted his head towards the youth. A way out if he wanted to take it, but the offer only emboldened young Incelli.\n\n\"Entirely unnecessary. We're not leaving. Our point has not yet been made.\" He crossed his arms and maintained eye contact with Constantini. \"Feel free to go home yourselves, however. We can handle ourselves without you.\"\n\nWith a deep sigh and a shrug, Inspector Constantini turned back towards the cordon. He was going to require a few more opinions on this..."

 hotautumn.66.d:0 "\"They're students. Practically children. If they don't want to move, then make them move. You're police, act like it damn it.\"\n\nThat response wasn't what Constantini had wanted to hear from headquarters. He had hoped that the chief might be willing to negotiate with them, but the terms were clear. This disorderly behavior went beyond the protections of their right to gather together and right to protest, and they would just have to obey.\n\n\"Well, they came prepared. If we're going to force them to go anywhere, we're going to need some backup...\"\n\nThe FUAN on the other hand, was not of a mind to negotiate, nor were they of a mind to obey. It had taken a bit of time, and more than a bit of reinforcing, fiery rhetoric to sway the other members of the FUAN over to his side. But in spite of their general spinelessness, Virgilio Incelli would gain ground.\n\n\"It is about time we practiced a little of what we preached. It's time we showed these corrupt officials what Italian strength and spirit looks like in action!\" Came his final rallying cry, met with the scattered shouts and hoots from the rest of the student body. He turned, and with the helmets and flags of the FUAN standing behind him, he faced the baton-wielding police officers.\n\n\"Any chance you'll rethink this insanity?\" Constantini offered one last time, an empty hand extended in a gesture of goodwill towards the man on the other side of the gap. \"If you go now, there won't be any consequences. It'll be as if we parted ways the way we were supposed to.\"\n\nThis was met only with a shake of the head from Virgilio. \"We will not back down.\" He opened his mouth to speak further, but was interrupted by the hum of engines and the sound of tires over cobblestone as armored vehicles moved in to surround the square.\n\nThe gathered students took a tentative half-step back at the sound of the armored cars, but before Incelli could reply to the display, he was interrupted again by the whirring of rotors.\n\nConstantini squinted up towards the heavens, and muttered to himself with great incredulity in his voice. \"...The machine gun might be overkill...\""

The only problem now was that the helmet, flag and baton stood across from armored cars, a helicopter, and machine guns.\n\n\"Virgilio. Please.\" Came the last plea from Inspector Constantini, he had set down his own baton, though the gesture was awfully futile seeing as his words were still backed up by machine guns. \"Just stand down.\"\n\nVirgilio looked towards the Inspector, and then back over his shoulder. He looked towards the rest of the FUAN, the fear on their faces as they watched the helicopter hover in the air, and the officers began to take cover behind the cars, discarding batons for firearms.\n\nConstantini looked back over his own shoulder, towards the questioning and uncertain faces of the security cordon. Would they have the bellies to fire on these students? Would the students actually be stupid enough to fight? He watched a man silently remove the magazine from his pistol, thinking that no one was watching, and he watched another consciously move to the side to create an avenue.\n\nTension filled the air, and all that it waited for was a single twitch, an errant movement, a single spark to set off the entire scene. But what it got instead, was the clatter of a stick against the cobbles, at the feet of Virgilio Incelli.\n\nHe had made a big show of casting down the weapon, before turning back towards his compatriots, who all at once filled the square with the noise of dropping wood, and the furling up of flags and banners. Some who stood without their weapons chose to cast down their helmets or throw off their gloves and armbands instead.\n\n\"I think...\" He began, projecting his voice to the gathered students. \"We have made our point. The sun is setting, let's go home, before the keepers of the peace escalate the scene further.\" The venom in his voice could be felt throughout the square, even as officers backed off and away."

 hotautumn.68.d:0 "The mood in the FUAN headquarters was noticeably depressed when the rest of the leadership slinked in and found their chairs. Virgilio had been there for a short time, though he exaggerated his lounging position to make it look like he had been waiting for much longer. When they walked in, he slowly lowered his boots from the desk and leaned upright, hands folded over the table.\n\n\"To say that did not go according to plan would be an understatement.\" Virgilio began, to the lukewarm mutterings of agreements from the rest of those in attendance.\n\n\"Our image is going to take a while to recover.\" One of them replied.\n\nAnother spoke up as well. \"And there's no way the police are going to allow us any more public gatherings after that display.\" He shook his head, practically trembling in anger. \"And the media is already slandering us, as if we had been the ones responsible for-\"\n\n\"What has happened, has happened.\" Virgilio sighed, placing his hands on the desk and rising from his chair. \"We can't change it, whether the demonstrations were a bad idea from the start or a good idea simply turned ill is entirely immaterial. What matters now...\" He pointed a finger to the desk to emphasize his speech. \"Is where we go from here.\" The gathered leaders fell silent as Virgilio did. They glanced between each other, and eagerly searched the ceiling and floor for the ever-elusive answer to the question, the question that was eventually vocalized. \"So... Where do we go from here?\" Virgilio stood up and looked around at the sullen faces of his compatriots. \"The way I see it, there are only two directions we can go. Either we can keep doing this... participation thing that the democrats want from us, until we fade into the margins of history books and soon, off their pages entirely...\"\n\nHe paused for effect, and to allow the chance for the darkness on their faces to lift, replaced by rage and frustration, that twisted their visages. He held up a fist as he continued. \"Or we can change our tactics. They want to use guns? We'll use guns. They want lead? We'll fill the streets with it. If Italy must bleed so she can live, then so be it, but we will not allow our nation to perish under the faltering gaze of limp-wristed bureaucrats and vampiric politicians.\"\n\nAll at once, depression gave way to anger, and anger gave way to resolve. As one, the leadership of the FUAN stood and gave a Roman Salute. For Virgilio. For the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale. For Italia."

Communists, fascists, united by their hatred for you. The adrenaline mounting, the heartbeat pounding like drums, the charges, the batons falling, the smell of tear gas and water cannons, shouted orders, the intoxicating miasma of violence.\n\nLiving like this is not easy, and the downtime can be the hardest part sometimes. Showing up at the local commissariato at the break of dawn, exchanging small talk with coworkers over a cup of coffee, the endless stashes of paperwork. And while Milan burned, its police officers slaved away at paperwork, like nothing of note was happening outside. The units of the police and the Carabinieri were stretched thin across the city - Bicocca, the industrial area, is still ablaze with constant strikes and small scale riots, while the Statale, much closer to the city centre has been recently pacified, but trouble is still brewing under the ashes.\n\nInspector Adriano Constantini looked away from the papers, out of the window on the streets. The sky of Milan had that soft azure hue, so typical of the Lombard landscape. Adriano picked up the cigarettes from the desk, right next to his badge, and lit up one, smoking in long, slow drags.

He started awake, almost tipping over his lukewarm coffee at the sound of the paper meeting desk.\n\n\"Oh, the strike?\" Ovidio muttered, adjusting his glasses and wiping something from his mouth with a sleeve.\n\n\"It says here that it's a uh... A demonstration.\" Constantini pointed out. \"Why did we get switched over from the Pirelli?\"\n\nOvidio shrugged as he looked over the dossier. \"They can't call it a strike I guess, because they're students, not workers. Dunno who would panic about the books going unread for an evening, so they gotta give it a different name.\" He leaned back in his chair and handed the dossier back to Constantini. \"They asked for a cordon last-second. I guess we were the only unit they could send.\"\n\nConstantini glowered down at the dossier and shook his head. \"You'd think that a bunch of Fascists proclaiming their strength or whatever would handle their security themselves.\" Though as he spoke, he realized how glad he was that they weren't taking such matters into their own hands, for once.\n\nOvidio's reply mirrored his own internal dialogue. \"Better us doing it than them. They're Nazis in all but name, they'd be certain to overreact if any of the Union men confronted them, and we'd have to go in anyway.\" He kicked his feet up on the desk, risking that lukewarm cup of coffee once more, and relaxed his hands behind his head. \"Better we be there to keep the children from hurting themselves, am I right?\"\n\n\"I'm a police officer, not a babysitter.\"\n\n\"You act like there's a difference.\""

Days like these were boring, but a welcome moment of quiet after the chaos of the last period. As the inspector prepared to leave for home, the phone on his desk rang, echoing through the almost empty corridors of the local commissariat.\n\n\"The orders have been changed, inspector Constantini\" the voice on the other end of the line said. Receiving a direct call from the commissar was not a common occurrence, especially at such a late time of the hour. \"Your men won't be needed at Pirelli tomorrow.\" A major strike was planned, and Constantini with his unit was supposed to be part of the security cordon. \"Also, all documents regarding the Pirelli situation have been placed outside your clearance level.\" The call abruptly ended, and Constantini stood with the phone in his hand as it beeped, without even having the time of saying \"yes, sir.\"\n\nThis was far from ordinary. The Celere Unit was never one devoted to investigation, and instead was the rank and file of the police - the grunts who do the dirty work. And yet, something went off in Constantini's mind. Why would the plans change, all of a sudden? And why remove dossiers that were commonly circulating until only hours ago? As Constantini was walking home, his mind raced. Perhaps it's nothing, but it might be worth asking around tomorrow at the commissariat."

And yet, his mind was racing, echoing with the voices he heard in the last round of phone calls. San Donato, Rogoredo, Sesto San Giovanni - from his colleagues and friends in almost every single working class district of Milan, similar news could be heard. Orders changing suddenly and seemingly with no rhyme or reason - experienced officers replaced with new people from outside the city - and the plans to contain the disorders, carefully crafted by the local commissars of the Polizia, being scrapped in favour of much more dubious ones.\n\nThe upper command of the Polizia proved its lack of competence or knowledge of the situation on the ground many times before, but such egregious mistakes were simply unprecedented. Constantini looked at the large map of Milan hanging in his office - a pentagon shaped mass of a city, apparently twisting and turning, its roads and streets intersecting at strange angles to mark where the many different overlords of Milan started to shape it in their image during the city's long history. All around the city centres, the districts where the strikes and disorders were most prominent, all marked in red, stretching like a ring of fire around the white blot in the city centre - the Duomo, San Babila, the Statale.\n\nThe current plan to deploy the police forces was a tragedy waiting to happen. The Celere units were ordered to take positions in bottlenecks and narrow streets, where there'd be no way to effectively contain the riots and a violent, head on clash would be inevitable. Somebody upstairs was doing his job outstandingly poorly, and something had to be done before the inevitable happened."

And yet, there were few other explanations to the series of egregious mistakes the police command of Milan was committing, and none of them very plausible. Somebody, somewhere, was consciously and deliberately setting up a massacre in the streets of Milan, presumably with some sort of other goal.\n\nPolitics and police are a pairing which often made its appearance in some shape or form - but for the first time, inspector Constantini was directly involved. His men were on the front line in Milan - they would likely be the ones forced to kill, or be killed. And yet there was very little Constantini could do - the only things he had were rumours, conjectures, not conclusive evidence. And even then, what could a lowly inspector do against something happening above him in the chain of command?\n\nStill, another question was how and why somebody was trying to cause a violent escalation of the already tense situation in the city. The most obvious culprits would be the communists - by making violence increase, they could paint their own dead as martyrs and further gain popularity among the masses. But the police was not exactly known for its communist sympathies, and it could also be that some sort of right wing organization was attempting to cause the death of a policeman or two, in order to justify a harsher crackdown on leftist violence. It could even be organized crime, attempting to cause further chaos in order to keep the police busy, leaving them free to do their business. Or maybe it was all a complicated ploy by the police command, who was hoping to gain a martyr in order to be able to ask for more funding from the government. Constantini's mind buzzed with possibilities and conspiracies forming and dissolving in the span of seconds, against the backdrop of rising frustration, anger, and fear."

Newspapers, from L'Unità to the Corriere, and RAI broadcasts over radio and televisions all told the same story. In the evening of yesterday, the police clashed with rioters and protesters in Sesto San Giovanni. Zhdanov cocktails and rocks were being hurled against the police like drops of rain, as what seemed like entire legions of angry, dispossessed workers, university aged would-be revolutionaries, and even women and children from the poor parts of Sesto pressed against the police. Eventually, the police was unable to contain the riot, and ordered a counter charge to repress the chaos.\n\nIt was like fingers snapping, and then for one second it was silence. Water cannons, tear gas, screams, batons falling on skulls - the police charged. Finally, gunfire. Policemen had opened fire on the crowd with live ammunition, leaving several people lying dead or wounded on the streets - and then, someone fired back. A policeman dropped to the ground, a puddle of blood forming around him as he wheezed his last breath while his comrades tried to remove him from the streets. More policemen were wounded, but at least the crowd was dispersed, as in what seemed like seconds the people fled in all directions, into buildings, narrow roads, and some seeming to vanish into thin air. Soon, only the macabre spectacle of a devastated street, with smoke, bodies, and burning cars, was left to the eye of the policemen, and of the press.\n\nAs predicted, the scandal was huge. Politicians from even the most unsuspectingly moderate parts of the political landscape were lamenting the deaths of so many people, and calling for more funds being directed towards the police and more extraordinary powers going their way. The most respectable members of the upper echelons of Italian high society were disgusted at the awful display of violence Italy had become a theater of, and wished for a return to orderly and quiet life in which workers and students would just behave like good citizens of the kingdom. The right wing was starting to openly remind the Italian people that things like these didn't happen in an earlier, more orderly time.

Under their stony visage, many had several emotions agitating their thoughts - anger, sadness, and a remarkable feeling that their friend's death was entirely avoidable.\n\nInspector Constantini was also present at the funeral, in his uniform, but far from the first rows of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie - going unnoticed among the crowd as Milan's archbishop delivered his somber sermon. While saddened by the death of his colleague, Constantini did not attend the funeral out of a desire to pay his respects, but for a more personal reason. He wished to meet an old friend of his - also an inspector, attached to the police unit present at the riot in Sesto San Giovanni. Perhaps he could give more answers.\n\nAs the archbishop gave his final blessings and the coffin was escorted out of the church, the crowd started to slowly disperse, piece by piece, in the busy, crowded streets of Milan. In the noise, Constantini managed to reach his friend, who had a stern look on his face. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, fitting for two old acquaintances meeting at a funeral, Constantini began asking questions - who gave the orders that resulted in a senseless death, and why? The answer he received was sobering, but not entirely unexpected."

 hotautumn.77.t:0 "The Fires of Biocca"
 hotautumn.77.d:0 "In normal times, the Bicocca district of Milan was surprisingly calm despite its industrial nature. It was filled with bustle but never raucous; echoing with thousands of the footsteps of laborers, young and old, but never so obnoxiously that it brought the storied city any shame. As the dawn began to shine upon the many steel and concrete beasts that housed the beating heart of the city's economy, there was, as usual, a fair amount of noise, but it was not the pleasant kind that indicated work was carrying on as usual. Instead, shouts of rage and the crackling of flame consumed this national center of educational and economic achievement. Such riots were all too common in these uncertain times, Inspector Constantini reflected as he deliberately adjusted the holster containing his standard-issued firearm for maximum visibility, but what worried the seasoned officer was the sheer scale of the conflagration that was currently consuming most of the quarter at the moment. The entire city's police force had been mobilized the previous night, and he had heard from a friend in the security ministry that special riot units were being deployed from as far away as Calabria to help suppress the riot before it became an even bigger embarrassment to the nation.\n\nNot that it would probably help much, the Inspector thought grimly as he stepped into a waiting car with a fellow inspector and a beat sergeant who explained that he had been called up to help direct the out of town reinforcements to their designated locations.\n\nThe trip to the edge of the riot was spent mostly in quiet, which was fine as far as Constantini was concerned, he wasn't really in the mood for talking. Only two incidents of note interrupted the drive. Above the background din of riotous jeers and the broadcast demands of the city and police officials, the crack of gunfire pierced through the morning air. The inspector vaguely remembered having been told that the rioters did not have any firearms. It seemed that supposition was now out of the window. The second incident did not involve gunfire, but was far more worrying in its own way. As the car began to slow down as it approached ever nearer to the blocks where the rioters made their voices heard, the sergeant related an uncomfortable piece of office gossip: several known anarchists and radicals who had been under the government's watch had all seemingly slipped off their handlers and were, at present, unable to be found."

 hotautumn.78.t:0 "The Shot"
 hotautumn.78.d:0 "A raging mass of rioters surged once more against the line of police that, while determined and substantially armed and armored, was growing more outnumbered by the hour. Most of those facing off against these enforcers of order were laborers native to industrial Bicocca who had finally broken under the backwards labor policies still common in factories across the nation. Some were young, well educated students, believers in the theories of Marx and Engels, idealistic rebels against the system they had grown up into, the system they were certain was a broken mess. A few key figures, dispersed throughout the sea of discontent, stood out starkly from the older men in working clothes and the students in the fashions of the day. These gentlemen were grim, grey faced and dark-eyed; some bore distinct scars and all wore outfits as badly worn as the most overworked of the factory men. The police, blind as they were to the happenings within the riot's territory, had no idea that it was these determined and militant pugilists who were at present building up the rioters' fury and passions with their denouncements of the rich and powerful.\n\nDespite the tough talk from the hardliners within the crowd, the general mood of the assembled discontented citizens seemed to be cooling as the sun progressed in its upward journey. At least, so it seemed to Mario Calabrò as he watched one cluster of students trickle out from their peers and surrender to the waiting police. He could hardly fault them, they were hardly more than children after all, and even his deep commitment to the protest he had willingly joined couldn't stop him from worrying for the safety of his young comrades who were not much older than his eldest son. Still, it seemed as if not everyone felt the same way, and his heart sank at seeing how this small defeat had engaged the greater mass once again into anger and action, only this time it was not righteous fury directed against the capitalist and fascists bastardi but towards some youths who had made what was likely a sensible choice for their own safety. Men like Calabró had nothing much left to live for, but those students still had a future if they were smart enough not to waste it. One of the apparent ringleaders of the rioters hurled particularly vicious insults at the departing deffectors, and before he was given a chance to remunerate the scoundrel, the agitator drew a pistol and fired a single shot."

 hotautumn.79.d:0 "Inspector Constantini felt a splatter of something liquid slap his face with enough force to make his eyes shut involuntarily. When he reopened them, the riot officer he had been conversing with mere seconds ago was on the ground and bleeding uncontrollably from a wound in his shoulder. The mass of police and rioters turned slowly, almost apprehensively, as the inspector's urgent calls for medical attention began to sound through the packed street as everything seemed to grow ominously silent. As the inspector waited tensley for any sight of responding medical personnel, something caught his attention from his peripheral vision. A group of rioters who had up until that point been almost up against the protective shields of the police were now backing away, slowly and without any fanfare, but they were backing away. Perhaps the rioters were coming to their senses, and maybe, just maybe one incident of tragic violence would prove to be a blessing in disguise. The Inspector was considering this as one of the officers across from the falling-back rioters took a slow, deliberate step forward.\n\nHe could see exactly what was about to happen, see it as if it had already happened and there was nothing he could do to prevent it. He could prevent it though, if he could only get there in time. The only problem was the man bleeding out in front of him. Leaving him unattended to cost the officer his life, and it would be Constantini's fault. The choice was painfully clear, and the answer, unfortunately, was equally so.\n\nHe was running as fast as his legs would carry him to the advancing officer, waving his arms, calling for him to stay put, but in the end he was too late. A brutal shove from the officer's riot control shield sent one of the rioters sprawling on the ground, blood pooling from the back of their head where it had cracked against the street. Another long moment of silence followed, and then with cries of mingled rage, resentment, and even fear, the line of police disintegrated into a counter-mob hell-bent of punishing the riot with any means necessary to avenge their fallen brother. Adriano Constantini could only look on in horror at the unfurling violence."

 hotautumn.80.d:0 "Inspector Constantini never imagined he would hear such sounds outside of the Final Judgement, although at that precise moment, he was half convinced that that was what he was witnessing. Any semblance of order was rapidly dissolving as the riot police charged with the reckless abandon of rage and fear. They were met with an ever-increasing amount of gunfire from previously concealed firearms. If the rioters had not premeditated such violence, it was clear to the inspector that they had been prepared. The shots, however, were not all coming from the side of the rioters. Constantini looked to the rooftops of the surrounding buildings and spied at least half a dozen police sharpshooters, all of them either firing or picking targets.\n\nConstantini turned in the direction of the mobile headquarters, preparing to sprint the few blocks separating him from a chance to find someone able to restore order. The sound of an explosion and second later a chorus of cries to rival the damned stopped the veteran officer where he stood. Pale, he turned slowly around to face the source, and was met by flames rising from a score of buildings, creating a corridor of fire surrounding protests and police alike. Of course, the inspector realized, the protestors had been armed from the beginning, and guns were not the only weapon a rioter would come prepared with. He caught the glint of light as another Zhdanov cocktail sailed in an arc that seemed almost lazy, like it was no more a tool of chaos and death than a football. It flew into a storefront window and the facade was alight almost instantly. The gunfire had slowed for a fleeting moment after the first few buildings went up, but it was now starting up once more in earnest. The pops of small pistols from the rioters and the cracks from police rifles created a terrible harmony of destruction and violence. If anyone had the power to stop this, the window to do so was closing quickly. Trying not to think about the pain and death he was essentially fleeing from like a coward, Constantini took off for the headquarters unit. Maybe they would have an answer he told himself; maybe they would have a contingency already prepared; maybe; maybe; maybe. The word rattled around in his mind as he pushed his legs to move faster."

 hotautumn.81.t:0 "No Good Deed..."
 hotautumn.81.d:0 "At first, Mario had not believed that the police would allow the block to burn. Surely, he reasoned, they would call off the mob, and the police really had descended into a mob by this point, and allowed the protestors to disperse without further violence to allow fire teams to save what they could from the conflagration. He soon realized how naive he truly was. The police were by this point in no more control of their emotions than the rioters had just before the officer was shot. Mario Calabro was a peaceful man, a family man, but in his deepest heart he had to admit to himself that if he had the chance to get ahold of the scoundrel who fired that deadly shot, he would not be responsible for his next actions. Despite the not insignificant desire to exact justice upon the guilty man, all Mario was really focusing on was finding a way to escape the chaos and return to his family.\n\nThe police seemed hellbent on making that as difficult as possible however. He could faintly see through the smoke and to the tops of several of the non-burning buildings farther back. There were at least half a dozen sharpshooters perched atop them like gargoyles, and every few minutes one would fire a shot in the direction of the riot. Most of the time the shot cracked pavement or road. Most times. The way he had come into the street was in hostile hands as it were, and so Mario scanned in the opposite direction. While free of snipers, that way was no less anarchic with the masses of fleeing protestors who were attempting to make a desperate stand against the better armed police away from the fires. Dangerous as it was, Mario had little choice, and he began moving as quickly as he could without inviting unwanted attention onto himself.\n\nDown at this end of the street there was no fire or smoke, but that only meant that those with firearms had clearer sights to kill with. Bodies already littered the ground and wounded men and women roiled in agony on sidewalks or slunk into alleys only to collapse alone. Mario saw just this happen to a boy no older than sixteen, and his fatherly instinct compelled him to step in. He had made it within a few meters of the alleyway entrance when the screams began to intensify. Shots and canisters of gas whizzed by Mario's head and his resolve faltered, a nearby building's open door seemed to invite him in to weather this storm, but that would mean abandoning the injured young man."

For a moment, or perhaps several for Mario could no longer sense the passage of time, there was an all encompassing blackness. Muffled shouts, muted crashes, and even the sound of gunshots from what felt like blocks away assailed the ears of the ill-fated laborer. From a foggy corner of his mind, Calabro wondered if it was due to the almost guaranteed concussion or if the violence had actually moved, and he began to wonder which option concerned him more, but the complex thought proved impossible to keep and it dissolved.\n\nHe opened his eyes when he felt the warm metal touch his cheek, and with his first sight since falling to the ground, Mario Calabro witnessed a vision of hell. He was not the only one lying on the ground, there were at least a dozen others. Some were groaning and attempting to crawl away or squirming meekly like birds with broken wings. Several, however, lay still and showed no signs of consciousness or even life. With an effort, he cast his eyes around his immediate surroundings. He saw several spent bullet casings strewn around the area, and realized it had been one of them that had hit his face. An empty gas canister lay near his feet, a blood-splattered dent clearly visible.\n\nHe thought about his wife, who would have to somehow navigate life without a husband. He thought about his children, who would have to grow up without their father. What had he or his family done to deserve such punishment? He wondered if he would receive any answers in the end, or if all would be consigned to oblivion. His hand felt heavy and numb, but he managed to place it into his pants pocket, and trembling, withdrew a worn photograph. Mario Calabro looked intently at this precious image, smiled weakly, and died."

By the time the youth fell, already beyond saving, to the ground, the crowd had discerned the location where the shot's effect had landed. However, as far as Mario could tell, none besides himself had actually seen the shooter from his obscured position. It occured to the unlucky worker that without a clear idea of the real culprit, the already agitated mass of protestors would naturally rally against... He spun, and began to wave wildly around in an attempt to alert the others as to what he had just witnessed but things were already moving out of anyone one person's control.\n\nThe frustration and anger that had already been pent up inside the people from not just this protest but countless others and behind that, the economic uncertainty forever looming in the dark like some boogeyman, finally seemed to be spilling out. Clusters of the riot control officers were being faced down by dozens of approaching workers and students armed with sticks and pipes. Rocks began to pelt the protective shields which were the only thing protecting the officers from the enraged crowd. Things were going to get ugly, and get ugly very soon.\n\nSome of the police seemed ready to hold their ground to the bitter end, insane as the idea seemed to Mario, while others were already buckling under the pressure and giving ground quickly. He watched from the entrance to an alleyway, unwilling to directly participate but equally unwilling to leave before seeing the conclusion of such dramatic events. It was clear enough to him that the police were taken completely off-guard by the shooting and were in total confusion as to how to respond. He prayed silently that they would just retreat before any more blood was spilled."

 hotautumn.84.d:0 "The Inspector had no intention of letting things advance any farther than they already had. The protest was quickly devolving into a riot with the death of that young man and there was a real possibility that major violence could erupt at any minute. The police had to pull back, Constantini was convinced, if there was to be any hope of a cool-off happening. That was why he ran down the blocks to the temporary headquarters with an intensity he hadn't displayed since the academy all those years ago. He had handled situations of life and death before, it was true, but he had never been so sure that the fate of hundreds of lives were hanging in the balance as he did now. There was no time to spare.\n\nThe mobile headquarters unit had changed in the relatively short time he had been away at the front lines of the protest. Several portable barriers had been erected blocking easy access to the tents and armored command vehicle that had been borrowed from the army. Around the perimeter, armed officers stood at the ready with rifles and at each tent entrance there were two sentries posted with machine guns. Apparently the brass was getting mighty paranoid, but given the situation Constantini had just left, he could hardly blame them. The tent farthest back was likely where the police chief and his aides were coordinating the response. The inspector jogged up to the tent's guards and flashed his identification before disappearing inside without waiting for their response.\n\nThe chief looked pale and exhausted, and for Constantini, seeing the normally resolute and unflappable man reduced to this state frightened him more than any mob ever could. When he had entered, the head of Milan's police was in rapid fire conversation with one of his subordinates, but the Inspector's sudden appearance in the tent halted that conversation as all eyes turned toward this newcomer. Not wanting to waste any of the precious time he had, Constantini took advantage of this and began to address the chief directly. He had one shot to convince the man that pulling out would prevent further escalation, and he would need to speak quickly."

 hotautumn.85.t:0 "The Silent Stand"
 hotautumn.85.d:0 "Constantini watched from a distance as the line of officers, once more adhering to their discipline and bolstered by the men on either side, reformed the tight shield wall that they had begun this fiasco in. He silently thanked God for giving his tongue the power to persuade the chief that this was the right course of action. He had been met with initial resistance of course, none of the brass had been happy at the thought of appearing to retreat in the face of a riot. He had, luckily, been able to persuade them that keeping the police where they were would only allow the mob to encircle and destroy the riot officers and that would look even worse for the city.\n\nFor a group that had just been surrounded by scared, angry rioters eager to exact vengeance, Constantini thought the men were doing a damn good job of keeping it together. Most of the protestors, for their part, were letting the police pull put unmolested. Most of the mass had been young students and workers with families to feed, not exactly the picture of zealous fanatics willing to risk life and limb for an already finished battle. Still, there were some shady characters peeking out from the front of the crowd. They looked like they could be trouble if left unwatched, so Constantini motioned a nearby lieutenant to make sure that didn't happen. He paused long enough to make sure the instructions were relayed properly down the line -- he didn't want a trigger happy sniper getting the wrong idea and ruining everything -- and then he began to walk briskly but calmly back to the site of the mobile headquarters.\n\nThey had packed away the tents when he arrived and were beginning to load the last of the equipment into the armored vehicle. The car he had rode from the station was nowhere in sight, so the Inspector pulled himself into what seemed to him to be one of the most uncomfortable seats ever devised by man. It reminded him, he realized, of the days he had ridden in another machine quite like this one, back during the war. He was a young man himself then, no older than most of those students. He wondered, idly, if those kids would one day reflect on this protest as merely a half forgotten piece of some long, grueling war."

Except, the offices were not quite empty, not yet anyways. Inspector Adriano Constantini took another sip from a cup of black coffee as he attempted to fight off the oncoming fatigue. Only a little bit longer, he thought to himself as he pulled another piece of paper from the pile sitting atop his desk like some ancient Roman temple. Only a little more and then that will be it for tonight. Having been heavily involved in the incident the papers were now almost exclusively referring to as the \"Bicocca Fire\", it was to be expected that the Inspector would have a good deal of paperwork to work through. Expected, and annoying as hell.\n\nStill, the mountainload of reports he was being forced to fill out were probably going to be helpful in the very near future. As officials all over the country from Sicily to Venice were discovering, stamping out one flame would not be enough. Given that tensions in the country were running so high they could be cut with a knife, perhaps they should not have been surprised when similar demonstrations began to pop up in most major cities with industrial centers. Even when those were put down, some more peaceful than others, things did not improve. In fact, the riots and protests were merely the beginning. The political factions of Italy were mobilizing for something big, he was sure. The socialists cheered on such displays of disobedience while the remnant fascists and conversative blocs railed against the 'death of civilization' and the foreign saboteurs some claimed were behind it all. The moderates were having their own hell of time in even trying to figure out what message to put forward. It was, in a word, chaos.\n\nConstantini looked at the clock and blinked, then rubbed his eyes before checking again. He had spent almost an hour in his own thoughts all the while doing nothing to reduce the number of unfinished reports still on his desk. The old cop sighed and glanced at the empty cup. As if in response, a yawn came to his lips and passed unheard by anyone except himself. There was no use staying any longer, the papers would still be there the next morning.

And with East Africa stretched to the breaking point already, it is clear Italy will have to step in once again.

But here he was regardless, stumbling around in the Ethiopian desert, keeping a peace that didn't exist.\n\nAs Enrico was mulling over his decisions in life, suddenly a crack rang out across the valley. The man to his left dropped to the ground, a bullet puncturing his gut. A horde of black men in peasants' clothing came rushing out from the ridges surrounding the road. A pitchfork came flying from the crowd, piercing the corporal to his right's chest. Confused and disorientated, Enrico pointed his rifle at the attackers, shakily aiming down it's top. His sights locked onto a man's head, he closed his eyes and took a breath.\n\nBang. Bang. Bang. The shooting went on for what seemed like minutes, screams of men assaulting his ears. He could not see the carnage, but he knew it was there. In a moment, a sharp blade came down onto Enrico's shoulder. Everything went pitch black.

The overall conclusion being drawn is that overnight, extremely well-coordinated native partisans had sabotaged and destroyed many a marina imperative to the stationing of Italian naval assets in the region. This has also cost costly damage to destroyers, cruisers and battleships alike. It seems the partisans fled before the sailors or anybody for that matter knew what was happening, and no leads have been found regarding the case.

Thoughts raced through their half-awake minds. Is this a training scenario? No, impossible, they were just a peacekeeping force. They forgot how to fight, if they knew at all, many pondered the notion of running, but there was no time to act out such fantasies now. Over the hill, more cries went out. But not of fear, pain or desperation. This was a war call. And over the hill came battalion after battalion of partisans, rebels and traitors alike\n\nThey were just a peacekeeping force.\n\nMany tales like this came to their tragic ends throughout East Africa today. Confirmative reports now state that the colony has collapsed into an all out civil war between rivaling rebel factions, attributed to the months of continuous crumpling its administration had faced since the death of Prince-Viceroy Amadeo.

 empiremanagement_IRQ.1.desc:0 "\"To the office of the Duce.\"\n\nCiano gets a lot of letters at his desk each morning. Whether it be from an Italian farmer in Sicily, expressing his opinion on how things in the country should be run, to a government official, requesting a signature on a new bill. This letter however, was a bit different. The envelope carried a seal of the Dawa party in Iraq. Ciano was curious what the envelope would contain, so he swiftly took his opener, and started reading the letter.\n\n\"My dearest Duce,\n\nI write to you to express my gratitude in the warm relations between the Italian Empire and the most humble faith of Shia Islam. We can run many parallels between the Shia faith and the PNF, which further helps us in connecting Iraqi people with their benefactors in Italy. Furthermore, your influence in the Islam world has greatly helped the Shia faith to gain more influence in the Middle East. The Dawa party is honored to have such a benefactor for our cause. We hope that these relations continue to flourish between the Dawa party and the PNF.\n\nMay Allah protect you.\n\nRuhollah Khomeini\nMember of the Dawa party.\""
 empiremanagement_IRQ.2.t:0 "The Deceiving Feast"
 empiremanagement_IRQ.2.desc:0 "It was a very impressive hall. Three magnificent chandeliers were hanging from the ceiling, a long table with incredible amounts of detail in the center stretched to the outer edges of the hall, fancy cutlery lay on the table and behind each very comfortably looking chair, a butler, preparing it for the guest that would take its seat there. The Italian diplomats truly were in awe at the setting that lay before them.\n\nOf course they weren't just invited here for a nice evening of wine and dine, they were brought here for a reason. Qasim had something to tell them. It must be something very important if this huge banquet had been organized. As the evening progressed, and people were enjoying themselves, several members of the Italian government were quietly requested to be joined by Qasim in a separate room.\n\n\"This was it.\" Several of them thought. They were going to find out what was so important that they were gathered at this grand feast. Once the door to the private room was closed and everyone got their seat around a modest table, Qasim spoke.\n\n\"Gentleman, as you may have heard, my country is currently in an unstable political situation. For this reason, I will require more funds to stabilize the situation. This will result in decreased revenue from the petroleum industry in the country. That is all, I hope you will continue to enjoy your evening here.\"\n\nAs he stood up and left the room, the members were all a bit perplexed by this sudden announcement and were not able to put up a protest. However, there was nothing they could do, a collapsed Iraq would result in no oil at all and no sane Italian would want that. Therefore, they all went back to the main hall and would enjoy the banquet for the rest of the evening, now with troubled minds of what may come."

 empiremanagement_IRQ.4.desc:0 "The Kirkuk-Haifa pipeline has been in operation for over two decades, carrying black crude from Northern Iraq to the refineries along the Mediterranean coast, where it is then shipped to markets in Italy and beyond. It has been the target of numerous sabotage efforts before, during, and after the Second World War.\n\nIt appears this newest effort, conducted by suspected Ba'ath party terrorists, and the latest of several sabotage attempts have been successful. Reports indicate that an explosion of significant size was detonated on the pipeline route near Tirbil, leading to an oil spill and sparking a large fire. It will be several weeks before the pipeline can resume operation.\n\nLocal Iraqi security forces have already promised to hunt down the perpetrators of the attack. Nevertheless, given their history of lousy results and the risk of Ba'ath sympathizers in their ranks, we will likely need to increase security, adding additional costs to our operations in Iraq. Alternatively, we can take charge of the investigation and cordon off the area until we find the perpetrators using both local and Italian forces. A more effective option to be sure, but also one that would also require us to release additional supplies for use in the region."

One of these parties is the so-called July 14th Movement, an organization of students, liberals and reformers that advocate for democracy and liberties in the country. Their leader is Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz, an influential speaker.\n\nRecently, al-Bazzaz has been giving several very generous donations to Italian groups with similar causes to his. For this reason, the Italian upper class has invited him to several lavish banquets to discuss his policies and to get to know him.\n\nal-Bazzaz has taken this opportunity and now has some powerful friends in Italian high society. This has allowed the July 14th Movement to gain some significant influence in Italy, Iraq and the world stage.

Its lands have been passed between several owners, and the Italian Empire stands as its current controller. We have provided Iraq with all sorts of economic benefits that have helped develop their country. However, these benefits haven't been for free, and Iraq is now in quite a bit of debt to us.\n\nLuckily however, the oil deposits around the country have massive potential for huge economic gain and a new influx of money. A few months ago, construction started on new oil fields in the southern part of the country. After some initial delays, due to negotiating with the Italian government for funding, the oil fields are expected to be completed this week.\n\nThese new oil fields, located near the city of Basra, will kickstart the petroleum industry in the region, becoming a new source of income. After acquiring enough funds, they shall be sent off, allowing an influx of cash to enter the Italian treasury."

 empiremanagement_IRQ.7.desc:0 "Italian-Iraqi relations, which have already grown steadily more tense since the end of the War, have seemingly hit rock-bottom today. In a surprising twist, a recent seemingly-innocuous routine decision of the Banca d'Italia to raise interest rates on a number of Iraqi loans has briefly done what decades of national diplomacy could not: unite the Iraqis against a common enemy.\n\nIn a rare display of unity, disparate groups ranging from Liberals to Socialists to Baathists have organised a joint wave of protest decrying Italy's \"national robbery\", while Imams across the country cited Qur'an passages on the evils of Urury. The Iraqi government has been remarkably slow to deal with these protests. Observers have even described vivid scenes of Banca chairman Guido Carli were being burned in effigy while police look on.\n\nIt's clear we've struck a nerve with the Iraqis. Several experts have already pleaded for an immediate end to the interest rate raise to salvage relations. However, an annoyed Banca d'Italia is adamant that the measures are necessary for the national economy and have asked us not to give in to the \"mob\". They state that the move is fully legal by the terms of the loan and that Iraq would have to pay whether they like it or not."

Expanding this effort to include all non-essential personnel would drastically increase costs, but it would also reduce the strain on our overstretched security forces. Furthermore, if things deteriorate, it would make a withdrawal from the colony significantly easier.\nOn the other hand, we could simply expand our security detachment to preserve the safety of our citizens and assist in maintaining order, if at the cost of expanding our presence during this time of instability."

However, we would be wise to carefully consider sending equipment to Iraq. We may find that one of the... other political movements will be more friendly to our cause instead of the current government. Or we could intentionally let the situation escalate to give ourselves a reason to reassert control over the country. In any case, sending equipment would help out the current government and improve our relations with them, while not sending anything can be riskier, but could benefit us more in the future.\n\nNow that we have these options in mind, we just need to make a decision."

For this reason, it has been considered to get involved in the conflict to bring it to a quick resolution so that the oil can start flowing again. This decision must be weighed carefully however, as involvement can spark international protest and, if our supporting side loses, could get us in serious trouble on the homefront.\n\nRegarding the options we have at hand, we can do three things. Firstly, we can send over a team of advisors and strategists to train soldiers and help plan strategies. We will have less to lose if our side loses, simply because we didn't get directly involved. However, we will still need to rely on our side of the conflict to pull the weight and win this for us. Secondly and more drastically, we can choose to send over our own troops and get directly involved ourselves. This will greatly enhance our chance of winning, since we can send in our elite troops against the several poorly trained Iraqi armies. However, it will also be extremely difficult to save face on the international stage and on the domestic front if things somehow get awry. Lastly, we could choose to do nothing, hoping that our side wins this war. This will of course be very risky to do, since we have a big chance of losing our oil supply. However, keeping our hands clean might be the best thing to do in certain situations.\n\nWhatever we will do, it will have lasting consequences. What is our best course of action?"

Frankly, Ermete didn't see the strategic value of this patch of scorching hell over any other, but he does as he's told.\n\nThe two men eventually came across some native Algerians, toiling under the sun. As they approached, Ermete could not help but to feel tension already building in the air. Both parties greeted each other politely, although poorly concealed looks of contempt betrayed their veneer of manners.\n\nLelio spoke first, \"We're on the lookout for dangerous men, would you happen to know anything about Iberians in the area?\" Lelio's tone was formal, and cold. Both of the Algerian men looked at each other in confusion, before looking back at Lelio.\n\n\"Madha?\" asks the man on the left. Lelio seemed frustrated at their lack of Italian, although it made sense to Ermete why they wouldn't know it out here. This would precede a half hour's worth of weak translation and signals, in a sad attempt to get through to each other.\n\n\"God I'm sick of this,\" Ermete finally blurts out miserably. The Algerians seemed to take this as an insult, and their tone turned quick and sour. Something inside of Ermete broke, and as he was being yelled at, he screamed, \"I don't speak Arabic you bastards!\" There was a stunned silence, and before things could get worse, Ermete could feel Lelio pulling him away."

 empiremanagement_ILG.2.desc:0 "The most recent headache to our administration arrived via a brief telex document from our administration in Tunis. Laconic in essence, the message vaguely detailed a sudden spike in tensions between our colonial apparatus in Algeria and the French-speaking Pied-noir communities that form a sizeable minority of Algeria's coastal urbanities.\n\nIn short, (for the message was) Pied-Noir communities in Bona, a key city on the Algerian coast, petitioned for additional representation in local government. Usually, this would not be considered a major issue, were it not for the local garrison officer (whose name goes suspiciously unmentioned) deciding that they had taken one step too far, and resorting to a show of force to get the petitioners to disperse. This has naturally caused quite an uproar within the Pied-noir community across Italian Algeria. Tensions remain high between leaders of the community and our own military command, mostly levied from the Libyan provinces, and used to regular crackdowns as a means of keeping native organization perpetually on the backfoot. Needless to say the Pied-noirs do not agree with that point of view, and thus far peaceful protests and minor riots have been their answer, but god knows how long it will be before someone finally fires a shot in anger.\n\nOne thing is clear to us, the protests are no longer about minor petitions. Whatever we choose to do, we must keep in mind that it will have effects on Algeria as a whole. The French Algerian population remains an important political force in the Algerian colonies, and we must carefully determine how we will proceed."

His superior had sent him to quell it, so he gathered his best soldiers and proceeded to the location of the protests. When he arrived at the scene however, it wasn't a small group of natives, but quite a massive crowd. Armed with flags and banners, they were protesting for increased autonomy in Italian Algeria.\n\nItaly's strip of the Algerian lands were run by a military government, due to the skirmishes with Iberian presence in the region. Protests for autonomy were not uncommon, however, a protest of this size has never occurred. Of course the protest couldn't be allowed to continue, a sudden change in government could be disastrous for the stability of the country and therefore could endanger the outcome of the border war.\n\nUsually these protests were handled by the local police, they resolve these kinds of issues with little unrest but could come across as soft and could therefore inspire natives to keep up their protests. A protest of this size however could also necessitate a military arrest. This would send a clear message to any other protestors, but could end up in riots and even bloodshed if we aren't careful.\n\nIt was the captain's call to make.

His division's equipment had never been the best in the Military Governorate, but for most of the usual conflicts he faced in Algeria. it sufficed. There had been a noticeable change, however, in the quantity and quality of the supplies he would get since the beginning of the war. Bruno was lucky enough to receive a firearm made after World War 2, but many others were not so lucky; they ventured off into the endless desert with nothing more than an ancient Carcano Rifle and a few half-empty clips.\n\n\"Fucking broken equipment.\" Bruno muttered. With a last tug on the slide, the gun simply refused to work. Defeated, he began to look for a new firearm among the Algerian wastes.\n\nGovernor-General Castellano had read many such tales of equipment shortages in Italian-Algeria's standing army in the last few days. Receiving reports of soldiers with faulty equipment, whole platoons left without communication tools as basic as a radio, and ammunition becoming as rare as the sights of anything other than the unwavering sand dunes of the Algerian desert was becoming a common occurrence. His previous pleas for weapons, armor, aircraft, anything at all meant to help the war effort were met with nothing but vague promises of \"additional support,\" from his Libyan superiors. That is, of course, if he wasn't outright ignored. He knew that the current situation was unsustainable: every gun lost to the scorching desert sands was one that wouldn't be fighting against the advancing Iberian forces, or repelling the ever-increasing bandit hordes targeting his scant supply convoys. Appealing to his superiors just hadn't been working; he needed a new strategy. Dialing a number of senior officials in the PNF, he was prepared to explain the situation and make yet another plea for supplies - suddenly, the phone line connected.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing, Castellano?\" The voice on the other end was, surprisingly, of one of his superiors he especially disliked, \"You know that all communication to Roma has to go through us first.\" The Governor-General had barely time to start talking before the Libyan official started again, \"Is this about that damned supply issue again? Listen, the only answer I can give you is that we're working on it. Don't try to go around me, understood?\"\n\nCastellano could offer nothing more than, \"Understood.\""
