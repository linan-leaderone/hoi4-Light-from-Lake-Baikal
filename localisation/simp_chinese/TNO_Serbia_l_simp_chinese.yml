 POLITICS_VLADA_ZECEVIC_DESC: "Vladimir Zečević, better known as Father Vlada, is a man who has been many things. After joining the clergy, he served as a parish priest in a small town among the hills and woodlands of western Serbia, living a simple and pious life. It was only when the winds of war swept over the Balkans that Zečević left his church and flock to join the Chetnik resistance against the Germans. Despite rapidly rising through the ranks of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, he quickly grew outraged with Mihailović's policy of collaborating with the Nazi invader against Tito's communists, defecting to the partisans with five hundred of his men in 1942.\n\nHis newfound communist loyalty not at odds with his faith, Vlada simply pinned a red star under the cross on his cap, and continued to fight. Despite increasingly desperate odds, the partisans resisted in face of the invaders long after the end of the war, striking at the Nazis and their collaborators before disappearing again into the forests and mountains of the Serbian heartland. And throughout all those years, Vlada was always there, in the midst of the action, inspiring his comrades with his sermons and his deeds.\n\nAs tensions rose between Rome and Germania, the Serbian-Croatian border became heavily militarized on both sides, de facto cutting off Serbia's partisans from Tito's headquarters. Rapidly, ASNOS descended into political squabbling, and soon enough Vlada ended up in command of the armed wing of the liberation movement, as he was largely detached from such political struggles. Now, after so many years, the NOV has decided to launch its final, all out assault - but it is yet to be seen if Serbia will finally be liberated, and if Father Vlada will be allowed to return to his parish for one last time, resuming the simple life of a pious priest he was forced to abandon so long ago."
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDAR_RANKOVIC_DESC: "Sometimes known by his nom de guerre, Leka, Aleksandar Ranković is the foremost member of the partisan old guard in Serbia, and for many, one of the few remaining symbols of the Yugoslav dream. Born into a poor family in the outskirts of Belgrade, Ranković joined the Serbian workers' movement at the age of 15, soon entering the Serbian Communist Party. A dedicated and indefatigable organizer, Ranković was arrested and imprisoned for six years by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and upon being released immediately resumed his political activity, playing a vital role in the early strengthening of the Party in Serbia.\n\nNot even the war was able to stop him - immediately joining the partisan movement as Serbia was invaded by Germany, he was again arrested in 1941, but this time by the Gestapo. Surviving torture at the hands of the Nazi criminals, he was rescued by a daring partisan raid. In retaliation, Gestapo agents executed his wife and his mother. Ever more determined to fight on, Ranković would later go on to become a major leader in the communist leadership, founding and directing OZNA, the partisans' secret police and intelligence bureau.\n\nIn his role as president of ASNOS, Ranković was entrusted with keeping the flame of Yugoslav communism alive. An entire generation of Serbians grew up barely remembering Tito and his comrades, but Ranković was there to remind them - to remind them that through the people's struggle, a new Yugoslavia would be reborn from its ashes. As the red star has once more risen in the skies of Belgrade, a new light shines in the Balkans - destined to either lead the Serbs to the liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, or to be once more stamped out by the vile servants of fascism."
 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KAVAJA_DESC: "Patriot, criminal, freedom fighter, bandit, rebel, terrorist. Nikola Kavaja is a man whose name is whispered with terror in all of Serbia, by his allies, his enemies, and his victims. Born in 1932, Kavaja witnessed as a child the deportation of his family by the invading Nazis - and then he killed for the first time, pushing a wounded German soldier into a well. As he grew up, his hatred for the occupiers grew with him, as did his fierce nationalism - and soon enough, Kavaja gathered around himself a disparate group of Chetnik remnants, disgraced collaborators, and common criminals, founding the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement, or SOPO.\n\nAssassinations, kidnappings, sabotages, hijackings, bank robberies and bombings - with every action, SOPO grew more feared. Modeled after the Black Hand, SOPO compensated its relatively small numbers by mastering the arts of terror and brutality, striking Nazis when and where they least expected it. Even the partisans soon learned to fear Kavaja and his ferociously anti-communist gang - and yet, even when the two groups agreed to a truce before the offensive against the German garrison, nobody could expect what would come next.\n\nAfter quickly and brutally seizing power in Belgrade, Kavaja and SOPO took control of the whole of Serbia, violently crushing any form of resistance. Proclaiming the restoration of the Serbian kingdom, Kavaja and his men are now de facto in control of a new Serbia, their virulently nationalist propaganda being welcomed by the long downtrodden Serbs. And yet, the struggle for Serbian liberation is not yet over - and Kavaja is ready to ensure that no communist nor German invader dares ever again to try and usurp the throne of Nemanja, whatever the costs."
 POLITICS_DIMITRIJE_LJOTIC_DESC: "在所有塞尔维亚人中，只有德米特里耶·廖蒂奇及其教权法西斯政党联合激进劳工组织得到了足够的信任，能够掌管塞尔维亚的傀儡政权。这也合情合理，因为他和他的政党是这个国家唯一甘愿做德国走狗的，即使在第二次世界大战和南斯拉夫沦陷于民族社会主义帝国之前，反德情绪就已充斥塞尔维亚全国上下。\n\n廖蒂奇生于1891年，在第一次世界大战期间曾在塞尔维亚军队服役；之后，他进入政界。1931年，他被任命为司法部长，但仅六个月后就被迫下台，因为他提出的政治制度即使对以威权著称的亚历山大一世来说也过于专制。之后，他成立了亲德政党联合激进劳工组织，却在1935年和1938年遭到拒绝，并在不完全虚假的“宗教狂热”指控下被送进疯人院，最终四处逃匿，直到1941年轴心国占领巴尔干。\n\n当轴心国寻找合作者时，只有廖蒂奇符合条件；极少有人像他这样热情、疯狂或谄媚。他是一个坚定的反犹主义者，甚至在许多纳粹之前就公开主张消灭犹太人。加上他对德国的疯狂热爱，以及对共济会、共产主义者和资本主义者的疯狂仇恨，使他成为控制塞尔维亚余下部分的理想人选……不过，对他来说不幸的是，这个政权根本无法运作，也永远不可能运作。\n\n由联合激进劳工组织统治的塞尔维亚政权被普遍憎恨；甚至连因他将其牧首从达豪集中营解救出来而喜欢他的教会如今也无法容忍他。这个国家是一个失败的国家，以至于让其他极度混乱的国家看起来都像托马斯·莫尔的《乌托邦》。由于大量塞尔维亚人在乌斯塔沙统治克罗地亚期间逃离或被驱逐，造成了难民危机。各种各样的游击队，无论是共产主义者还是民族主义者全都遍布乡村。每天都有大量叛逃事件发生。\n\n然而，廖蒂奇不仅没有提出解决办法，反而像他的德国偶像一样不断地咆哮。毕竟，为什么要自我反思呢？他可以把自己的问题归咎于犹太人、自由派、共济会、共产主义者，有时甚至归咎于教宗、土耳其人或保加利亚沙皇。结束廖蒂奇政权的唯一办法就是结束它的痛苦。但事已至此，问题已不是它是否会垮台，而是何时垮台。"
 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_MUSICKI_DESC: "After the utterly despicable Ljotić, few collaborators are more notorious than Konstantin \"Kosta\" Mušicki - which makes sense, given among other things that Mušicki was the most prominent ethnic Serb fool enough to try to join the Ustaše despite, well, the Ustaše's well-known leanings.\n\nBut that was not Mušicki's only folly. Having joined ZBOR in 1934, after the assassination of the King, he was stationed in Slavonski Brod when the Axis invaded in 1941. Appointed as a colonel responsible for the Belgrade-Zagreb railroad, he supported not his country but the Germans during the invasion.\n\nAfter the war, Mušicki went to Belgrade, joined the Serbian Volunteer Corps - the German hatchetmen in Serbia - and was made its commander. During his time in that position he of course participated in any amount of brutal reprisals and massacres against civilians, supporting his patrons' aims. Due to that his forces were regarded as the only Serbian forces completely trusted by the Germans during the war.\n\nNow Ljotić is gone, and \"Kosta\" takes over. But Serbia of the ZBOR remains a failed state, still based upon cruelty, self-hating sycophancy, and corruption. It is still ruled by shameless fools and brutes led by a shameless fool and brute.\n\nThe reality remains the same; only the cosmetics have changed."
 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KALABIC_DESC: "For years and years the leader of the Ravna Gora Movement - colloquially the Chetniks - has waited for an opportunity to drive the Germans and their puppet ZBOR out of his tormented homeland. Now that that has happened, Nikola Kalabić feels his head spin at the shock of seeing something that he feared he would never get to see in his lifetime.\n\nA mere land-registry manager in Valjevo before the War, Kalabić entered service under Draža Mihailović's elite Mountain Guards. When Yugoslavia fell, Kalabić kept fighting, collaborating with both the Axis and the Allies. He was motivated by his abhorrence of leftism to enter agreements with Germany and Italy to fight the Partisans. Despite that, Allied commanders that dealt with him spoke highly of his unit and of Kalabić's authoritative personality and appearance.\n\nYet all that collapsed when Mihailović was suddenly captured and killed; the Chetniks suffered multiple critical defeats before they were able to reorganize under Kalabić's command - though it was all for the better in the end, since Kalabić is now in charge of what little remains of Serbia.\n\nBut the struggle of Nikola Kalabić is far from over. Two decades now he has fought both Germans and Partisans, wanting to free his fatherland against those he deems - rightly or not - to mean harm to it. But to his God, the God of Justice, who has saved the Serbs once more, Nikola Kalabić makes this vow: he will not fail or falter in his efforts until his eyes close forever."
 POLITICS_DOBRICA_COSIC_DESC: "In the aftermath of the Serbian Civil War, it is Dobrica Ćosić who has assumed responsibility for the welfare of the remnants of the Serbian state. Yet if you told a young Ćosić in 1938 or 1939 that this would be his fate he would laugh in your face or refer you to the local sanatorium.\n\nIn that time, the happy time before Yugoslavia was destroyed, Ćosić joined the Communist youth in Negotin. When the Axis came for Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the Communist Partisans and took to his duties with alacrity... until the Soviet Union fell, and the war kept dragging on with no true hope of success.\n\nThen, he began to doubt the validity of both Communism and Yugoslavism. As a result, as he continued to rise through the ranks, he became more a nationalist than a communist. Exploiting the divide between the Italians and Germans - which was leading to the fortification of the Serbo-Croatian border, and dividing the Croatian and Montenegrin partisans from the Serbs and Macedonians - he inspired others that shared his sentiment and developed a sizeable following within the Partisan movement.\n\nAnd now that has reached fruition. The man that could debatably be referred to as the father of modern Serb nationalism now is in charge of his country, for better or for worse - though others may well have something to say about that."
 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_TITO_DESC: "多年以来，“铁托”约瑟普·布罗兹一直在同南斯拉夫的法西斯走狗作斗争。铁托将全部精力投身在自己的事业上，即便苏联陷入崩溃、西方选择屈服，他也未曾有过丝毫动摇。铁托的努力终得回报，游击队已经掌控了整个塞尔维亚，二十年过去了，希望再度出现在地狱般的南斯拉夫大地之上。\n\n布罗兹出生在库姆罗维茨村，他的父亲是克罗地亚人，母亲是斯洛文尼亚人。布罗兹应征入伍，成为了当时奥匈军队最年轻的士官。一战时，他沦为俄军俘虏，之后被送到了乌拉尔山脉的劳动营，后又投身俄国革命，为红军效力有一年之久。1918年，他回到巴尔干，并加入了南斯拉夫共产党，他还曾领导遍布旧南斯拉夫王国的游击队，同入侵的纳粹作战。\n\n1963年，克罗地亚形势急转直下，铁托受了伤，但侥幸捡回一条命。好在联合激进劳工组织政府很快就崩溃了，游击队取得了最终胜利。铁托随后来到塞尔维亚，成为了人民共和国的领袖。\n\n铁托下定决心，他绝不会浪费这次千载难逢的机会——他要让受尽苦难的人民重拾希望，他更要重燃塞尔维亚以至整个巴尔干的自由火炬。"

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_COPIC_DESC: "Vladimir Ćopić grew up entranced by the stories of Karađorđe and other heroes of Serbian legend who threw off the shackles of the Ottoman Empire, knowing that his lot in life was to be a fighting man. First taking up arms in the Great War, he quickly found himself in the arms of the Russian Red Army, where he was introduced to Communism.\n\nUpon Vladimir's return to his homeland, he joined the Communist Party, traveling to Russia to learn tactics and Spain to fight once again. His warrior spirit gave him a following amongst the Marxists in Yugoslavia, eventually returning home once the Axis invaded and occupied the region to help found the resistance.\n\nHe quickly became a leader of the movement, rallying guerillas to strike at the Germans wherever they were weak. A newborn hero in a land full of villains, his task is no easy one. While no military genius, his natural charisma ensures that those around Ćopić will follow him through hell itself, which is not too far off from the killing fields of Serbia."
 POLITICS_DRAGOMIR_JOVANOVIC_DESC: "When one asks a foreigner who is well versed in contemporary Balkan history about those people in Serbia who embraced the Reich, they'd tell them first about Milan Nedić, then about Dragomir Jovanović.\n\nHaving been the chief of Belgrade's police prior to the war, Dragomir Jovanović already found himself with connections within the Reich, something which had allowed him to attain prominence swiftly in the Government of National Salvation. When the German occupation formally began, he was appointed as commander of Belgrade, bolstering its defense and aiding the Germans with whatever they had ever needed help with. Be it dealing with communist guerillas with his Special Police, or assisting in the creation of various camps across Serbia, Germany sought him out time and time again. They loved his reliability, his dedication, and the draconian measures he often employed to eliminate left-leaning resistance forces.\n\nHe has defined himself with those characteristics, and he will continue being just that. Reliable, draconian and dedicated, even if he is comparatively less fanatical about ideology than some of his other contemporaries in the government."
 POLITICS_MOMCILO_DUJIC_DESC: "To many, he's the culmination of all that's wrong with the Chetnik movement, a collaborator, a pillager, a rotten person. But to his men, he's the leader that got them back to Belgrade safe and sound.\n\nMomčilo Đujić was born in rural Dalmatia to a relatively wealthy family, where he later became a priest of Orthodox Christianity. The wealth of his family made him influential in the area, and the beginning of his association with the emerging Chetnik movement following the conclusion of the Great War landed him in the town of Knin. In Knin and around it, word was quickly spreading of Đujić's leadership capabilities, where he organized paramilitary formations within the greater framework of the Chetniks. When German tanks rolled through all of Yugoslavia, he moved to the newly formed Independent State of Croatia with his men, where he continued his resistance against the occupiers. Though his resistance was quite minimal, given he and his men were more involved in looting and ravaging the countryside, collaborating with Germans and Italians so they could survive.\n\nAnd it would be correct to assume that Momčilo was rewarded for his actions in the form of his chief's, Draža Mihailović's, assassination by Gorkić's communists following the conclusion of the war, given he had immediately consolidated himself as the new leader of whatever scraps of the Chetnik movement still existed. When the Italo-German split finally occurred, Đujić made for Belgrade, where his gamble had paid off - he and his Chetniks were key to the formation of the now legalized Serbian National Army."
 POLITICS_JAKOV_LJOTIC_DESC: "To many in Serbia, the death of Dimitrije Ljotić was nothing to celebrate, knowing who would very likely end up replacing him. And to those same Serbs, the former Prime Minister's spirit lives on through his remaining family, aiding in the most holy crusade against corruption.\n\nJakov Ljotić, the younger brother to Dimitrije Ljotić, is much like his brother. Pious, loyal to Germania, and deeply involved in the mysticism that the two were embroiled in since the early days of the Zbor. Jakov styles himself after fearless crusaders, supported by the Reich itself in his crusade against the satanic influences of communism, liberalism and masonic internationalism. His mission is one given to him by God - with his brother's death, Jakov takes the mantle of leadership, becoming the new spiritual leader of the entire country, guiding it through the muddied waters that Serbia finds itself in. And only through the proper implementation of religious zealotry and National Socialist policies can he ever hope to keep Serbia afloat, to prevent it from drowning into the judeo-bolshevik mud, and asphyxiating itself beneath the waves of masonic liberalism. And now, at the most important crossroad in Serbia's collective history, Jakov is ready to forge a path forward."
 POLITICS_BORIVOJE_JONIC_DESC: "Serbs have no need for self-deluded ideologues to marshal them, all they need is a patriotic God-fearing policeman, and with Jonić, their call has been answered.\n\nFor a man who led the Serbian gendarmerie since 1942, a role that closely linked him with the Reich, Borivoje Jonić's motivations remained a mystery. His fervent nationalism and zeal in hunting down communist partisans only allowing a glimpse at his true convictions, with his advocacy for the legalization of the Chetnik movement being the only other crack of light into beliefs.\n\nHowever, Jonić's views would be forced into the light by the man himself as the situation of his homeland took unexpected turns. Serbia's recent turmoil turned him into a voice for strong German cooperation, coming to the conclusion that only the Reich could protect his nation from its many enemies.\n\nThe defender of Serbdom now sits as its head of state, spying threats from every corner. Jonić has discarded any lingering remnants of his prior apathy towards the Reich, for he now knows they will deal with Serbia's enemies with the fury they deserve."

One such rebellion was unfortunately successful in the small nation of Serbia, which under its former leader Dimitrije Ljotic was one of our most stalwart allies in the unstable Balkans.\n\nThe character of the new red regime in Belgrade has been one of utter degeneration. The Serbian people have been placed at the mercy of Jewish commissars and sadistic bandits. These raiders and apparatchiks have undertaken a program of destruction across all of Serbian society, from the churches to the family. Policies upending traditions in favor of Soviet-inspired social experimentation (collectivization, free divorce, etc) were passed with demonic speed. The people themselves are tyrannized with a propaganda apparatus so all-encompassing that many have avowed that Serbs now believe that Germany was undertaking genocide against ethnic Serbians in the Banat region.\n\nLuckily, not everyone has chosen to abide by Red tyranny. Within our territories, countless Serbian patriots have assembled to take their country back.

His office was far away from battle torn lands of Serbia, yet his decisions could see thousands dead, something he took a sick pride in even if he seldom saw the fruits of his labor.

His underlings had assembled a report on a Serb able enough to rally his compatriots into liberating their land from Judeo-Bolshevik tyranny, someone who will return Serbia to its rightful master. Hoffmann began to thumb through the report.\n\nThis Borivoje Jonić was an old soul who fought in the Balkan Wars, World War One and World War Two, first against and then for the Reich. Jonić would serve as head of the gendarmerie for all rightful Serbian governments, a testament to his value for these administrations, perhaps he would be able to rekindle the popularity of Nedić as a unifying figure for Serbdom.\n\nHoffmann turned the page to gaze at the impressive number of commendations for anti-partisan actions, comments of praise credited him for the efficient extermination of Jews, communists and other undesirables. His adjutants had noted that while Jonić lacks the ideological commitments of Ljotić and others, Serbia's red infestation and Jonić's relentless anti-communist fervor makes him a very willing ally of Germany, Hoffmann could attest to the fact that ideology was less of a factor these days in the Cold War.\n\nThe brown bureaucrat took out a small stamp and after a small moment of extra consideration, marked it as approved. He called on his secretary to have it sent onto the relevant authorities before resting in his chair. Hoffmann would not receive any special awards or commendations for his work but the satisfaction of having played his part in freeing another country from the hands of Judeo-Bolsheviks was enough for him.
