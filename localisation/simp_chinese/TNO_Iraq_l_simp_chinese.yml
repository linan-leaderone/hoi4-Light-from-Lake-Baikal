 IRQ_the_spectre_of_baathism: "复兴主义的幽灵"
 IRQ_the_spectre_of_baathism_desc: "As elsewhere in the region, Iraq's Arabs grow increasingly restless, desiring a unified state, free from imperialism and western degeneracy. This is nothing new, and these feelings have been unleashed before, in the July 14th revolution (which drew its inspiration from the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere). However, the revolution's failure did not defeat Iraqi Pan-Arabism, but instead made it clandestine, efficient, and highly organized through the Ba'ath party. While one might not be able to see the Ba'aths they are there nonetheless. Their posters appear at night despite the government's and garrison's dual efforts to remove them; their slogans are shouted at ever more common protests; and the desert seems to have an inexhaustible supply of these dedicated, angry men, hungry for the power they're sure will inevitably come their way."

 POLITICS_ABD_AL_KARIM_QASIM_DESC: "What is the legacy of Iraq's Sole Leader? How will he be remembered?\n\nBorn in dire poverty to a Sunni Arab father and a Shia Feyli Kurd mother, Abd al-Karim Qasim was not someone expected to amount to anything. He became a teacher, then a member of the army. His intelligence and boyish charisma helped him rise through the ranks. These qualities led, in the 1950s, to Qasim being invited into the Free Officers Movement, a disorganized group of military officers determined to destroy the Italian-backed government. Almost single-handedly, Qasim seized control of the group and used it to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy. This victory alone would have been enough to make him a national hero but his subsequent triumph over the Triumvirate's invading forces, the embodiments of colonialism, in 1959 made him revered, an icon across the region.\n\nOutwardly, little has changed since the revolution and the signing of the Italo-Iraqi Friendship Treaty that ended the invasion. Though Qasim's Iraqi nationalism runs headlong into rising pan-Arab sentiment and though his concessions to the Italians have stirred complaints, Qasim remains a towering figure. Most are willing to tolerate his idiosyncratic leadership, his purges of one-time friends, and his progressive reforms because they still believe in his conception of the revolution. They still believe in his vision of a modern Iraqi state where people of all faiths and backgrounds can unite to overcome poverty, sectarian division, and foreign exploitation.\n\n§xAt least for now...§!"
 POLITICS_VITO_MICELI_DESC: "Vito Miceli, Italian consul in Baghdad, knew the Iraqis had gone too far with their so-called \"revolution\" when Qasim started talking about nationalizing the oil industry. The stupid bastard had probably expected him to twiddle his thumbs as the Arabs stole Italy's hard-earned oil, but no. Miceli was smarter than that. As chaos spread across the Middle East and the vultures started circling, Vito Miceli took matters into his own hands to protect Italian interests. He found a few dissatisfied members of the Iraqi army and some long-time friends in the Italian special services, then he used them to wipe the \"Sole Leader\" off the map. He was there when the man died, babbling incoherently about how he had been a friend to the poor and built them \"thousands of little homes.\"\n\nThe next step was supposed to be easy. Miceli would find some new \"Sole Leader,\" a simple-minded puppet that would know his place. Instead, anarchy followed Qasim's death and Miceli found himself stranded in Baghdad, propping up a \"transitional authority\" with little domestic legitimacy, transparently beholden to Italian interests.\n\nNow, Vito Miceli must fight not only for the glory of the Italian empire but for his life as well. For as complicated as Qasim's legacy might be, few will suffer the continued survival of a man who embodies the absolute worst that colonialism and imperialism has to offer."
 POLITICS_ABU_AL_QASIM_AL_KHOEI_DESC: "The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) said: \"When a person dies, his deeds are cut off except for three: Continuing charity, knowledge that others benefited from, and a righteous son who supplicates for him.\" Abu Qasim al-Khoei- scholar, jurist, and a leader of al-Hawza in Najaf- has understood this his entire life.\n\nBorn in Iran as the son of a religious scholar, al-Khoei spent his early life studying the Quran and learning from varied Shi'a leaders. This seminary education allowed him to develop a unique voice among jurists, one often sympathetic to women and non-believers. It also instilled in him a deep sense of obligation to Muslims worldwide. Between clerical duties and his studies into jurisprudence, he became a ceaseless advocate for welfare, supporting charities across Iraq. The scholar became a familiar sight wherever catastrophe appeared, using his administrative skills and religious connections to provide comfort to victims of injustice.\n\nIt was this same sense of obligation that drove al-Khoei to action during the collapse of Qasim's republic. After witnessing the growing tide of violence across Iraq and the rise of despotic, demagogic leaders, al-Khoei declared it the duty of the clergy to stand against corruption and oppression. With the quiet support of the Grand Ayatollah, al-Khoei assembled and appointed a delegation of Shi'a leaders to re-establish order across Najaf. While keeping distance between himself and the rebellion, al-Khoei serves as a powerful symbol for those who hope for a new government guided by democratic, Islamic principles."
 POLITICS_AHMED_HASSAN_AL_BAKR_DESC: "What was 1958 but an incomplete revolution? True, the Arab people of the Iraq region cast off the most obvious symbols of Western imperialism, but they remained artificially divided from their brethren. They were prisoners in states imposed by foreigners, crushed by economic systems beholden to foreign interests. No longer, says Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. It is time for the Arab people to shatter this legacy of oppression.\n\nBorn in Tikrit while it remained under the yoke of Turkish oppression, al-Bakr's life was defined by struggle. He overcame a hard childhood and spent six years as a primary school teacher before joining the Iraqi Army. When the Golden Square launched its revolution against the British in 1941, al-Bakr, his family, and many of his fellow officers joined it, only to find themselves marginalized in its aftermath. Embittered at having been duped, at having traded British overlords for Italians, al-Bakr found himself drawn toward two camps, the Free Officers Movement- an underground officer group dedicated to overthrowing the monarchy- and a newer faction- the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party.\n\nEven after Qasim became Sole Leader and began his crackdown on the Baath, al-Bakr held firm in his conviction that the party was destined to be the revolutionary vanguards, the vehicle through which imperialism will be defeated. Standing amid the ruins of Qasim's republic, he is determined to use his power as chairman of the party's military bureau to complete 1958's unfinished revolution and see Arab unity finally achieved.\n\nBy any means necessary."
