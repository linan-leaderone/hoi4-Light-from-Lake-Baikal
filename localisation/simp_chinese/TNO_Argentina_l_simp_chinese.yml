In the pursuit of this task, the young Subiza became the interventor-governor of six provinces, a record in Argentine history, a career cut tragically short in 1956, when he escaped into exile along with Perón.\n\nWith the former Colonel's political micro-manager, Angel Borlenghi, now deceased, there was no better candidate to fill his post at Interior but Subiza, who in Visca's brief interlude as President acted with unprecedented dexterity and rapidity to gerrymander the newly created first-past-the-post system as head of Political Affairs. This work ethic has gained him the upper hand over his rival, communications minister Raúl Apold.§!"

However, as with many of Perón's early associates, the 'genius' tin-merchant Miguel Miranda is now long dead.\n\nIn Miranda's place as de-facto administrator of the economy now sits Jorge Antonio, who amassed enormous wealth under the first Peronist regime through questionable practices, while serving as an advisor to the President on industrial affairs. As with Miranda, the new occupant of the BCRA has shown an eagerness to handle the economy as he has his businesses - by speculating - while giving inevitably affirmative responses to Perón's request to further public spending to please his trade-union base.§!"

Filled with rage and despair at the revanchist turn taken by the Revolucion Libertadora, Iñíguez spent the late 1950s and early 60s riling up scattered garrisons for ultimately unsuccessful revolts, a quixotic campaign that gained him the respect of the exiled Perón.\n\nWhile Perón's deal with the checkmated Onganía, and by extension, Azul high-command, explicitly prohibited reincorporations of retired officers, political posts such as the War Ministry are still open for men like Iñíguez, who in turn has to work within the constraints of the aforementioned deal to secure a loyal army for the returned Colonel.§!"

 ARG_Pedro_Eugenio_Aramburu: "佩德罗·欧亨尼奥·阿兰布鲁"
 POLITICS_PEA_DESC: "Immoral, sociopathic, unfeeling, and egotistical: Pedro Eugenio Aramburu is the ultimate distillation of the grotesque politicization of the Argentine Army, capable of changing loyalties or ideology whenever necessary, and completely divorced from any regard for Christian morality.\n\nAn unimpressive infantryman that obediently served as a senior officer throughout the entirety of the Peronist regime without incident or conspiratorial inclinations, Aramburu transformed into a fervent Gorila when the winds changed, and played an important role in backstabbing Lonardi as Minister of War. A few days later, he authorized the infamous executions of a few dissident generals and their civilian Peronist allies at the request of the President, Admiral Hartung, and even jailed his close personal friend, General Bengoa, for refusing to abandon Lonardi. In spite of this subservience, he was not rewarded with a promotion, and remained bitter at not becoming President himself, his longtime ambition which overcomes any consideration for God and Country.\n\nChanging his strategy, Aramburu acted as leader of a pro-Frondizi sector in the Army during the Correntine lawyer's ill-fated presidency, hoping to obtain the UCRI candidacy for the presidency in 1963 by saving him from his imminent overthrow time and time again. Indeed, it was Aramburu who was called upon to solve the crisis that ultimately destroyed Frondizi's presidency, but changed his mind halfway through the affair and betrayed him, too. Rewarded with the leadership of the Army once Poggi's project failed, Aramburu immediately began plotting against General Menéndez, in a bid to finally conquer the Presidency. Successfully locking him up in an insane asylum, Aramburu could finally ascend to the presidency himself.\n\nTaking power directly, however, was never Aramburu's plan. Instead, he carefully engineered an electoral law that would permit him, and the array of rancid gorilas around him, to take power by electoral means, with Peronism banned and the traditional UCR splintered beyond repair by the political convulsions of the last years. From this situation was born UDELPA, a party built entirely around his own figure, who in alliance with the anticlerical PDP, Unionist Radicals, Democratic Socialists, and military interests seeks to maintain a fundamentally unrepresentative and repressive center-left 'softatorship' until the memory of the deposed tyrant can be completely erased by the passage of time."
 ARG_Juan_Carlos_Ongania: "胡安·卡洛斯·翁加尼亚"
 POLITICS_JCO_DESC: "Lt. General Juan Carlos \"The Walrus\" Onganía is a man who lives and dies by rules. Indeed, Onganía's near-fanatical adhesion to structure has been so intense that it has sometimes led him to underperform, as he did at the Colegio Militar de la Nación, where he ended in the bottom quarter of his class. This preference for rigid frameworks also steered the fairly intelligent cavalryman away from intellectualism of any sort, an aversion that when combined with his innate capacity to command and personal honesty, led him to develop as a stereotypical, \"tropero,\" an officer dedicated exclusively to unit-command, who has never held staff or administrative posts.\n\nFollowing rules also made coup-plotting deeply distasteful to Onganía, although his refusal to participate in anti-Peronist plots didn't save him from being exiled to a subordinate role at the Inspectoria General de Remonta, where he languished overseeing horse stables until Perón's overthrow. Following this stint as a nonentity, he became leading tank commander. Sickened by this collapse of organization during the 1960s, Onganía was driven to his breaking point, and together with many of his fellow Cavalry officers, led a campaign to destroy the \"Colorados,\" incidentally saving Argentina democracy, and earning him the position of Commander-in-chief at age 48.\n\nFrom there, Onganía's motivations become far murkier. The reasons for his retirement, his possible involvement in the coup that placed in power, and the extent to which he genuinely believes, or has been gaslighted into believing he is a great leader are almost impossible to determine. What is known is that the contingency plan for a takeover by the military, eventually put into effect by disgruntled generals, necessitated Onganía's appointment as President, something which he only accepted if he were given, \"a blank check\" to carry out, \"an authentic national revolution.\" What exactly this means, particularly in light of the growing hostility between the mutually-distrustful Liberal and Nationalist groups that coexist in his government, remains to be seen. Nevertheless, Onganía's project appears to have a wide array of backing, including that of most trade unions and large corporations, and even his detractors recognize him as a well-educated, well-intentioned man."
 ARG_Jose_Luis_Romero: "何塞·路易斯·罗梅罗"
 POLITICS_JLR_DESC: "For Romero, his reputation as a historian is inseparable from the politically committed citizen. From a family of Spanish immigrants, Romero expressed from a young age interest in History and Philosophy. He soon gained intellectual prestige among his peers for his studies in Greco-Roman history, writing for several cultural magazines. Romero's passion for understanding the mechanism of social and economic structures is inexorably tied to his militancy in the Partido Socialista. Fervently opposed to Perón's government, he was expelled from his position at the University of La Plata, but he was named Rector Controller of the institution after the 1956 Coup.\n\n\"Peronism\" was always such a conflicting word for the Socialist historian. A movement with Fascistic characteristics that manages to gain the hearts and minds of the working class should be unthinkable, almost unnatural. But for Romero, the truth was self-evident: Peronists have triumphed where Socialism has failed. He became one of the main supporters of the change of course spearheaded by the Socialist, trying to appeal to Peronist voters with a more aggressive anti-establishment instance.\n\nHowever, Romero struggles to solve the internal contradictions that have plagued the party in the last years. Is the USA an imperialist power or an ally against Fascism? Is Peronism an expression of the discontent of the workers or demagogic manipulation? Even with his vast knowledge in social sciences, he still lacks an answer. Nevertheless, he has some ideas to solve them: a better educative system, a more plural democracy, better working conditions.

 POLITICS_BALBIN_DESC: "The face of the democratic struggle against Juan Perón and professional loser Ricardo Balbín has now faced the ultimate, crushing humiliation of reaching the post he's fought and lost four times, entirely due to the magnanimity of the man who thrice defeated him, Perón himself.\n\nIn truth, this is only fair. Balbín's overnight catapultation to the forefront of Argentine politics was itself the result of a carefully planned move by Perón: In a bid to atenuate Arturo Frondizi's then seemingly unstoppable rise, Perón ordered a purposefully botched assassination attempt on Balbín's life, which as expected, turned the decent but markedly mediocre intransigeant Congressman into a martyr. Indeed, the plan worked so well that Frondizi was so thoroughly disposed of his majority within the party, that he became resentful enough to himself become a Peronist asset.\n\nWith Frondizi's fall to the Peronists, Balbín remained the only national figure available to the opposition, and so, he tiresomely marched towards certain defeat against Perón and his men every six years, becoming increasingly depressed. It turned out, however, that this image as a perennial candidate had his use. Perón, sensing his impending death and lack of a suitable successor, found a useful transitional and sympathetic figure in this meek opposition leader, and determined to ensure his election as his Vice-President, convinced his mere ascension to the office would prove enough to bring about a peaceful dismantlement of a regime he long ago lost control of.\n\nWith Perón now deceased, it appears his plan is working to perfection, with a small preemptive coup on the part of non-Peronist officers to forestall any movement against the legitimate President, Balbín has had little to do but watch as the Peronist Party collapses on itself. Many, including him, think this means a return to free elections as soon as his term is over. However, the UCRP is not what it used to be, and men like Hidalgo Solá, the increasingly powerful Minister of Defense, have taken the view that it is necessary to elongate the transitional period by predetermining the outcome of at least the subsequent election trough some form of frankensteinian UCRP-PP/PPF alliance, forced with the blessing and direction of the military."
 ARG_Arturo_Umberto_Illia: "阿图罗·翁贝托·伊利亚"
 POLITICS_ILLIA_DESC: "The standard pilgrimage of Argentine politics usually involves young Cordobese lawyers abandoning their native province for a promising future in the halls of power in Buenos Aires. Arturo Illia, by contrast, was a Porteño doctor who made his way towards the miniscule town of Cruz del Eje in the mediterranean province, at the explicit request of Hipolito Yrigoyen himself, who micromanaged the appointment of railway physicians.\n\nSince receiving his posting in 1929, Illia has become immensely popular in Cordoba, proving himself an honest administrator. As the province remained immune to fraud in the 1930s, the Cordoba UCR remained in power, and developed a distinctly intransigent, leftist bent, exemplified by Illia's boss, Amadeo Sabattini. Staunchly loyal to Sabatini's 'Cordoba Line,' he led it on after the caudillo's death in 1960, and distinguished himself as an early anti-frondizist within the UCR. With the brief exception of the three years in which he was Vice-Governor of Cordoba, Illia carried out his political career while acting as the only medic in Cruz del Eje, which he often serviced traveling by horse.\n\nThe figure of the selfless, wholesome country doctor, dedicated to improving the health of his citizens, has proven an invaluable asset to Illia throughout his presidency. However, underneath this fundamentally truthful image of Illia, there is also an aged, not particularly agile man whose view of the world has remained fundamentally static since 1930. His distracted demeanor, antiquated language, lack of vision, and exclusion of non-Radicals from decision making have raised comparisons to the latter-days of Illia's hero, Yrigoyen. Worse still, they have caused an immense feeling of resentment and exclusion from power on the part of a man who, in their eyes, has come in with 20% of the vote to govern in the name of a secretive Radical sect that admits no fault or flaw."

Among the characteristic this hypothetical President-designate should have, the most important were:\n\n 1. Sufficient approval from the PAF (Peron, Azules, and Frondizi).\n\n 2. Recognized Catholic and Developmentalist credentials.\n\n 3. Sufficient distance from the Front's leading men to avoid the appearance of favoritism.\n\nDr. Pérez Companc, an extremely catholic businessman of respectable landowning lineage, and a political nonentity, has all of these in abundance. Indeed, as a man so completely unknown days before his candidacy was announced his great advantage was an inability to provoke strong feelings in the minds of the Azul generalship or Peronist political chiefs. The heavy scrutiny he received in the following weeks, including a thorough investigation of his finances by Army Intelligence, placed him in a good spot as an honest businessman whose concerns could only benefit from a legitimate implementation of the National Front's economic programme.\n\nNevertheless, amidst all the scrutiny and audits, public opinion seemed to miss his strong personal association with Rogelio Frigerio, a man of similar commercial extraction. Indeed, it appears that his candidacy is little more than the exposed dorsal fin of Frondizi and Frigerio's plan to co-opt the Front for their own purposes. They could not fool everyone, however, and one of the front's minor partners, General (Retired) Justo Leon Bengoa, sounded the alarm to the dubious neutrality of the candidate. It was thus that Companc's partnership with the one-time Minister of War came into existence, much to both their charging.\n\nTheir victory, achieved with the cautious support of the Peronist chieftains, now opens the road to potential stability. Nevertheless, the undoubtedly awkward limiting of the Peronist to only peripheral roles in government, while the bulk of posts are taken by Frondizist members of UCRI and electoral nonentities from obscure nacionalista groups - like Pérez Companc himself - cast doubt on the viability of this. Indeed, in light of the Peronist Civil War appearing on the horizon, even the full support of the deposed tyrant himself may not be enough for the Frente's government to avoid the very turbulence it was engineered to prevent."

Born to an aging Rosista father in 1901, he was given the middle name 'Solano' in honor of the Paraguayan dictator Solano Lopez, but this was eventually confused with his surname - 'Lima' - to the point of becoming inseparable.\n\nThe young Vicente opted to become a lawyer, but unlike his schoolmate Ernesto Sanmartino, became associated with Conservative politics. He was elected a National Deputy for the National-Democrats (PDN), and later appointed as chief minister in the Provincial administration of Rodolfo Moreno. It was here that he earned the moniker of, \"Red Minister\" for carrying out a proto-Peronist labor policy. Displaced shortly before the 1943 Coup, he returned and obtained control of the Buenos Aires conservatives in 1946. Although he was briefly exiled to Montevideo during Perón's presidency for printing conservative newspapers, he consistently denied being an anti-Peronist.\n\nBecause of his friendly connections to syndical leaders, and willingness to stand in the rigged Peronist elections, Solano Lima became the face of the PDN throughout most of the 1950s. His conciliatory positions with respect to Peronism placed him and the Buenos Aires conservatives on a collision course with the 'liberal' conservative parties in the interior. The crash eventually occurred in 1956, when Solano Lima's faction backed Lonardi against the navy coup that displaced him. The resulting crisis destroyed the PDN, and Solano Lima created his own party, the Popular Conservatives (PCP), who adopted a pro-Peronist policy. This conciliatory attitude, his defense of Lonardi, and nominal non-Peronism make him an acceptable candidate for the Azul's Frente Nacional.\n\nThe National Front, intended as an agglutination of \"productivist\" social sectors that, with the support of the military, could carry out an ambitious industrialization project, failed to achieve the universality that its progenitor, the also former-conservative Rodolfo Martinez intended. With most Radicals refusing to participate, it became a proxy for Peronists, Frondizists and Christian Democrats, Nationalists, and the PCP, with Solano Lima at the lead. Unfortunately for the Generals that arranged for the Front's construction, however, Solano-Lima's connections to Perón are far §Ydeeper§! than they imagine."

Picked up by the safety-net of the local Conservative political machine, Hardoy avoided poverty through a hand-out position at Lomas de Zamora municipal government until becoming a lawyer. Brought along to the Buenos Aires provincial party by his benefactor, Hardoy labored away his entire youth working for the Conservative Party.\n\nEarly connections paid off, and Hardoy was elected a National Deputy in 1935, aged 24, in widely fraudulent elections won by the rebranded National Democratic Party. This particular election haunted Hardoy and the rest of Argentine conservatism for years, and the system which enabled it to happen was eventually overthrown in 1943. The displaced Conservatives were engulfed in a deep internal crisis, victimized by the electoral system they themselves had created in 1912, and which now left them almost entirely without representation. Moreover, their exclusion from the Union Democratica by the recalcitrant Radicals against whom they had committed fraud left the Conservatives as a virtually irrelevant third force in national politics.\n\nIn every crisis, lies in an opportunity however, and Hardoy's repeated, arbitrary imprisonments at the hand of Peronism earned him the same status within the Buenos Aires conservatism as that treatment did Balbin in the UCR. His only provincia rival, Vicente Solano Lima, removed himself from the picture by forming a splitter party, leaving the soft spoken Lawyer in charge of the monumental task of reviving Argentine conservatism.\n\nOver the next decade, Hardoy fought hard to overcome the malaise and pessimism that engulfed the renamed Buenos Aires Conservative Union, and his brainchild, the National Federation of Centrist Parties. While he succeeded enough to 'win' the highly fragmented, anarchic elections that followed Frondizi's presidency, the truth is the FNPC is not a proper party, and the conservatives are not fully reconciled with post-1916 democracy. Even Hardoy himself, and his 'democratizer' wing openly called for the overthrow of Frondizi in the darkest days of his administration. Hardoy's task, apart from the not at all easy job of seeing through the entirety of his term, is to properly build a proper conservative Party with a genuine popular base."

Rewarded with the leadership of the decapitated Army, Poggi let himself be influenced by the navy leadership, which did little to help his unpopularity with his own branch of service.\n\nApparently oblivious to the growing movement against him, Poggi developed even grander ambitions, manipulated by the Admirals along the way. Frondizi's misfortunes once more opened the way for an undeserved promotion, and Poggi marched his merry way into the Presidency after attempts to find alternative solutions failed, confirmed in his post by a Junta dominated by the navy.\n\nWhile Poggi merrily signs decrees he makes little effort to read, however, the country and Army underneath him are beginning to unravel. The sheer extremes to which the now unleashed forces of anti-Peronism are willing to go are eating away the relative tolerance and aversion to violence that had characterised Argentine politics, even in times of undemocratic governments.\n\nAll the while, the mediocre general has been under increasing personal pressure, and his fits of rage become common, especially as the collapse of army discipline makes the figure of Army Caudillos, far more popular than himself, increasingly important."

A one-time nacionalista and Germanophile officer, he repeatedly failed to overthrow the governments of General Justo and Dr. Ortiz in the late 1930s. He gladly supported, but was blindsighted, by the June 1943 revolution against Castillo, and by the successful imprisonment of Perón in 1945. When the Democratic Union government was set to move him into the reserve for his attitudes during the war, he attempted to topple them too, but failed to get any supported Shortly thereafter, the cavalryman became a fervent liberal and collaborated with Radical Unionists in a botched attempt to preempt Perón's presidential assumption in 1951.\n\nImprisoned for the rest of Perón's presidency, Menéndez was freed, but kept away from any important posts. Growing increasingly worried by the prospect of a Peronist return over the course of Frondizi's presidency, he attempted to overthrow him twice, but was often bullied by younger officers who \"stole\" his generals, and had no role in his successful ouster. Finally, however, the end of Poggi and his clique forced the navy, at risk of losing its power and prestige, to scour deep enough into the pit of presidentiable retired generals. Thus, the plot which propelled Menéndez and Rojas into the presidency and vice presidency at the behest of a junta controlled by the latter, was born.\n\nThe extreme element of luck involved in Menéndez's umpteenth and ultimately successful coup plot aside, the 70 year old general faces serious questions about the viability of his presidency. While quite lucid, his up till now story of uninterrupted failures, subservience to the navy, former Germanophilia, and general mediocrity have cast doubt on his usefulness.

When Lonardi toppled Perón in 1956, he was appointed to the Consultative Junta in representation of the new party, and upon the general's defenestration, he was elevated to Minister of Industry. Throughout his time in Hartung's provisional administration, Martinez remained one of the most vociferously anti-Peronist figures in the government, and struck up a close friendship with the minister of War, General Aramburu.

There, Palacios befriended his fellow deputy, Conservative former President Carlos Pellegrini, with whose support he managed to pass progressive labour legislation, that to this day forms the basis of his considerable popularity amongst Buenos Aires' industrial workers.\n\nAs the rising star of the Socialists, he seemed their ideal candidate from the first elections employing universal suffrage in 1916, but was expelled for engaging in duels over the love of a woman, whom he ultimately declined to marry. Exiled from politics for most of the 1920s, Palacios developed a formidable academic career, before being called back to lead the Socialists in the aftermath of an internal split over attitudes Yrigoyenism.\n\nWhile his following grew considerably in the 1930s, when the Socialists formed the largest parliamentary opposition group to the UCRA-Conservative government, the advent of Peronism after 1943 virtually erased the Socialist's voter-base, and Palacios' membership in the first Democratic Union earned him only a short stay at the Labour Secretary previous occupied by Colonel Perón, abolished shortly thereafter. Seemingly destined to fade into the background, with his position in the party threatened by the likes of Americo Ghioldi, the failed attempt to forestall Perón's investiture thrust Palacios back into the foreground as leading member of the opposition.\n\nFollowing Perón's fall, the aging Palacios was appointed ambassador to Uruguay, returning in 1958 to run for the presidency for the second time, coming in a distant fourth.

Imprisoned until 1956 over that attempt, Lanusse paid his liberator, General Lonardi, with betrayal by initiating the conspiracy that toppled him less than a month after his release. Subsequently playing a major role in shaping the rise of General Onganía from his prestigious position within the Cavalry, he was amongst those that pushed him to crush the Colorados in 1962.\n\nOver the following years, Lanusse and Onganía were often identified as friends, but the later's government - which Lanusse did much to bring about - proved a disappointment, and so Lanusse once more betrayed and overthrew his benefactor - who had named him head of the army - hoping that a brief interlude by a far less relevant general would pave the way for his own election. His hopes were dashed once more, however, and eventually came to the conclusion that the least embarrassing option would be to take control of the government directly.\n\nThis, however, doesn't mean an end to his ambition to become President legally.

What is known is its bizarre outcome, and the benefit it brought to the governor of perhaps the most peripheral state of all.\n\nRodolfo Martinovic was born in Buenos Aires, the child of Croatian immigrants. Somewhat stereotypically for a Radical politician, he studied medicine, and moved to the unforgiving, frigid Patagonian South to exercise said profession. He became politically recognized in his adopted home of Santa Cruz for his role in founding the Province's principal hospital. Still, this was not enough to succeed against the immense power of Peronism in the rural south, and prospective deputy-governor Martinovic experienced a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Peronist-supported UCRI candidate in the Province's first elections in 1958.\n\nMartinovic was not done, however, and in any event, the brave stance earned him support to run in 1963. His campaign style, general demeanor, and almost messianc attitude earned him - probably sought-after - comparisons to Jânio Quadros. In any event what earned him national status wasn't this, but the permanent hostility to which he was subjected to by Balbín's men in the provincial UCRP, and his aggressive responses to it. In an attitude that reflected growing disillusionment with his handling of internal Radical-Party affairs, Martinovic launched an open against the President of the National Committee, quietly aided by Illia and the Cordoba Line, to which he belongs.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, this Patagonian Quadros won his showdown with Goliath, and with Illia in control of the national executive, there was no one else to fill the shoes of a Presidential Candidate but himself. On the campaign trail, he repeated his provincial strategy, and his calls to clean up Buenos Aires' notorious politics, stand up for the rights of the Interior, and reimpose Presidential authority resonated enough to hand him the presidency. Indeed, the Yrigoyenist tone of his campaign, unseen in Radical circles for years, is generally credited for his victory. Now, however, he has to face the reality of governing, which has been made ever so much harder by his declared opposition to just about all non-Radical political, sindical, and social sectors.

This dream was co-opted by the arrival of a certain Colonel to the Undersecretary of Labour, who turned Reyes' dreams into a personalistic nightmare. Nevertheless, he tried to make it work. Indeed, between 1943 and 1945, few men worked as tirelessly as him to ensure the success of Perón's career. When his jailing made him ineligible for the candidacy that year, Perón ordered his supporters to cast blank ballots. Reyes disagreed, and ran for President himself, and in 1952, against Perón.\n\nFor his trouble, the dissident labour-leader was jailed by both Radicals and Peronist governments, but offered a post within the Lonardi administration, which he was unable to take up due to its short existence. Nevertheless, he was determined to revive the Labour Party, and slowly but surely worked with trade-unionists who grew increasingly tired of Perón's leadership from afar.

In addition to the dissident Peronists grouped in his own PL, the UP, PTB, PP and several MPPs, Reyes, helped by former-President Frondizi, has amassed the help of a wide coalition of smaller parties, ranging from Frondizi's MID, to Christian Democrats, and even some far-right nationalist parties.\n\nThis victory of political ingenuity and independent labour has completely upended the Argentine political scene, as has the military's willingness to allow Reyes to take office. While what happens from now is a mystery, one thing is certain: The era of Perón is over, and Reyes has been its undertaker."
 ARG_Guillermo_Estevez_Boero: "吉列尔莫·埃斯特韦斯·博埃罗"
 POLITICS_GUSTAVO_BOERO_DESC: "How to adapt Socialism to the particularities of the Argentinian nation? After years of trials and tribulations, the Socialist activist born in Rosario seems to have figured out how. For most of his life, Boero stood out as an important figure of the student activist movement, being present in every conflict in defense of students' rights. Despite being characterized as a man of action and organizer instead of a thinker, Boero developed his own political theory to revitalize the Socialist movement.\n\nDespite their almost irreconcilable differences, Peronism and Radicalism have more in common than everyone thinks: Nationalist popular movements that had to be stopped by local and foreign economic elites by force. According to Boero, the path to \"national liberation\" lies in a political alliance to guarantee the stability of the democratic system. Building upon the legacy of Alfredo Palacios, Boero thinks a popular movement based on equality, social justice, and democracy will end the Argentinian cycle of self-destruction.\n\nNow that he has emerged as the unlikely winner of the 1969 election, he wants to put his ideas into practice. Socialism without bombs or weapons, but achieved through democratic consensus, defense of national interests, and solidarity with fellow Latin American nations. A new nation won't be built on death and hatred, but hope for the future.\n\nBut, §Rwhat if it ends like everyone else that tried and failed?§!"
 ARG_Emilio_Jofre: "埃米利奥·霍夫雷"
 POLITICS_EMILIO_JOFRE_DESC: "If there was any moment that things could change for the aging conservative movement, it would be this one. In the hands of Emilio Jofré, conservatism lives or dies.\n\nBorn to wealth in the province of Mendoza, Jofré first rose to prominence when he managed to snatch the seat of Governor from Peronists and Radicals alike. By the late sixties, Jofré was one of the most successful conservatives of Argentina. It was the perfect moment, as the conservative parties began to realign, re-emerge, and eventually, reform. In Emilio Jofré, they had their candidate.\n\nImprobably, the campaign worked - Jofré and the PDR soared into power. Now, Jofré must form the first government ruled by a unified conservative party since 1943. It is an immense challenge, but Jofré is up to the task. While his milder anti-Peronism and feminist leanings might be at odds with many in his party, his acumen has allowed him to gather a cabinet that might turn back the tides of reformism once and for all.\n\nIt might seem insane that Emilio Jofré is so calm. To those within his party, his success - or his failure - will drive the fate of the Conservative movement for decades to come. But this is just his job. In the face of expectations, there is nothing he can do but get to work."
 POLITICS_ISAAC_ROJAS_DESC: "Admiral Isaac \"Black Ant\" Rojas, so named for his love of broad black sunglasses and his diminutive stature, or perhaps because he shamelessly chases after power like an ant.\n\nOf course, Rojas now faces a similarly ignominious fate. Once a major powerbroker in the military junta and ally-turned-arch-enemy of Perón, Rojas has lost considerable influence after unwisely backing the Poggi and Menéndez administrations. Rojas, his power over everything but the navy having slipped far from his grasp, has now been forced to fall in line with Aramburu's plan to control the country. As part of the scheme, Rojas now briefly serves as interim President of the Republic until elections can be held, the \"victory\" of Aramburu in which is considered a foregone conclusion by political analysts. Few are certain what will become of Rojas after Aramburu takes power, Rojas himself least of them all."
 ARG_Julian_Licastro: "胡利安·利卡斯特罗"
 POLITICS_JULIAN_LICASTRO_DESC: "There is no President of Argentina, only Major Julián Licastro, chief of the \"Peronist Technological Command\" (CTP), an organization that would appear as an invention of poorly written fiction, were it not so real. A junior officer graduating at the top of his class, Licastro's Peronist sympathies assured him unprecedentedly fast promotions, and an appointment to head Peronist Technological Command. This department of the Peronist Party, tasked with long-term political planning and establishing a functional Peronist philosophy, has now taken control of the machinery of the state.\n\nWhen Perón's Vice President, elected in an emergency, appeared to deviate far too quickly from established Peronist tenets, Licastro knew that it would be the death knell of the revolutionary process that began in June 1943. Thus forced to revolt against the government he pledged allegiance to, he, Colonel José Luis Valoni and other junior Peronist officers, and young members of the Peronist party such as Julio Barabro and Carlos Grosso launched an emergency coup to save Peronism from itself. The CTP officially \"intervened\" the Peronist Party in order to reform it in view of making it more sustainable. More specifically, Licastro has promised to attenuate the purges of leftist Peronists, and is working hard to forge a consistent ideological framework for Peronism to operate within.\n\nThis is easier said than done. While Licastro may rule the nation, he is paradoxically a subordinate, and indeed quite junior, Army officer. He walks upon a tightrope. The established Peronist political class no doubt plots against him, and the loyalties of many members of the CTP are themselves in question. Inspite of these challenges, Licastro is determined to enact his vision, but whether his government of junior officials and ideologues, many of them fresh from university, can survive long enough to complete it remains in question."
 ARG_Carlos_Menem: "卡洛斯·萨乌尔·梅内姆"
 POLITICS_CARLOS_MENEM_DESC: "Being the lord and master of La Rioja, Vice-President, a professional rally car driver, a devout Muslim family man, and media personality all at once is not an easy task. Nevertheless, Carlos \"the Turk\" Menem performs all of these simultaneous roles with glee and charisma unmatched by professional demagogues the world over. Indeed, this admirer of Facundo Quiroga, who had his political start less than twenty years ago, grew to be popular enough to scare even Perón himself.\n\nElected governor of La Rioja briefly before Perón's return in 1964, he proceeded, as Peronist governors often do, to turn his province into a firmly controlled feudal domain, home to some of the most outrageously lopsided elections throughout Perón's second and third governments. Even before securing this base, however, his permanent visits to other provinces pointed towards a long-term electioneering campaign, the benefits of which would someday be reaped. So it was that when the time came, Menem was able to force his own election as the ailing Perón's Vice-President and effective successor.\n\nRunning on a comically demagogic platform so manifestly divorced from economic reality as to make many of his own supporters question its seriousness, Menem came to be identified not only as the \"continuity\" candidate, but as one who would do Peronism even harder than Perón himself. This in part is true, Menem has every intention of maintaining the regime and its methods. However, Menem's appreciation of the economic and geopolitical situation is completely different in private than it has been in public. Convinced of the inevitability of America's victory in the Cold War, and the inefficiency of the Argentine economy, the new President has decided - at the detriment of traditional tenants of Peronist ideology - to adjust the regime accordingly.\n\nThe last hurdle before Menem has the political strength within the Peronist Party to do so lies in snap elections he has called, a move which has provoked a controlled but significant thaw, to the extent it has become a real contest. His opponents, grouped either in the §CAuthentic Peronist Party§!, made up by the remnants of purged leftists within the PP/PPF, and the §MRadical Civic Union§! thus have some chance of defeating him. Indeed, as an unnervingly popular campaign slogan promoted by the former points out, traditional Peronist may find themselves at risk of voting for §YMenem§!, but electing §lAlsogaray§!."
