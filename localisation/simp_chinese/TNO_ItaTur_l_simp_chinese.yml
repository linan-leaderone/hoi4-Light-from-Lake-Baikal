 itatur.1.d:0 "哟伙计，《佩涅洛普之网》还没出，你不应该玩土耳其的。这个事件本来还说蒂尔凯什是领导人，现在他已经滚蛋了，文本也没有意义了，你要是觉得充数的文本有意思，那就随便你吧。"
 itatur.1.a:0 "我们必将胜利！"
 itatur.2.t:0 "土耳其胜利"
 itatur.2.d:0 "好啦玩家，我们做到了，意大利人被我们打得跪下喊爹！（好结局）"
 itatur.2.a:0 "提交和平条件！"
 itatur.3.t:0 "Italy Holds on"
 itatur.3.d:0 "Despite the Turks best efforts, our troops in the Middle East have been able to stem the tide of Turkish forces, and blunt their offensives. Reports from our intelligence networks are that the Turkish govenrment is panicking due to the war dragging out and their economy suffering for it, making this an ample time to send peace terms.\n\nIn the halls of the Grand council, two ways to deal with the Turks have come to prominence. The first is from our Duce Ciano, and is quite moderate. In it, he proposes that we demand reparations from the Turkish government and also a demilitarisation of the Damascus region, to ensure that they cannot threaten our presence in the Middle east again. The other deal, proposed by Ciano's rival in the party, Scorza, is demanding the handing over of some terriotries from the Turks, namely the Damascus region and the Mosul region for Iraq. He argues that the Turks know they are beat and will accept these terms, and that these regions will give us access to new welath and improve relations with our Iraqi allies. All remains is for the council to vote on a deal."
 itatur.3.a:0 "Ciano's deal is ratified and sent."
 itatur.3.b:0 "Scorza's deal is more appealing, we shall push further to have more leverage."
 itatur.30.t:0 "The Empire Remains Strong"
 itatur.30.d:0 "As our brave Italian soldiers push further into Turkey, it is apparent that we are victorious. With Damascus held firmly under our control we have more leverage than we previously had.\n\nCarlo Scorza has made it clear to the Grand Council that for Italy's empire to remain strong we must gain new territories. These words of his previously held us off and let us keep the fight going on within the Levant. However now as we have Turkey on their knees, we are finally able to make our demands."
 itatur.30.a:0 "Scorza's deal shall be sent to the Turks."
 itatur.4.t:0 "İnönü Sends His Demands!"
 itatur.4.d:0 "As we have decisively lost in the field of battle in the Middle East, the Turkish President, Ismet İnönü has sent us his demands. In it, he details that in exchange for us keeping the Levant, we will hand over our possesions of the Dodecanese, Cyprus and Lebanon.\n\nIn our current position, we will have no choice but to accept the terms sent to us."
 itatur.4.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 itatur.5.t:0 "Ciano Sends His Demands!"
 itatur.5.d:0 "意大利菜的抠脚，你咋让他赢的？"
 itatur.5.a:0 "I suppose they'll do, send our reply accepting."
 itatur.6.t:0 "桌案上的提案"
 itatur.6.d:0 "斯科尔扎这个弱智东西，见你的鬼去吧。"
 itatur.6.a:0 "拒绝，再说一遍，拒绝。"
 itatur.7.t:0 "土耳其人拒绝了我们的提议！"
 itatur.7.d:0 "这些可恶的土耳其人竟敢拒绝我们的提案！他们声称自己的前线守的好好的，伊拉克甚至都未受波及，条款上的内容他们一个也不会接受。现在球踢回我们这边了:我们是要把土耳其的牛皮捶破，逼迫他们把这颗苦果吞下，还是采用齐亚诺更温和的提案呢？"
 itatur.7.a:0 "试着戳穿这些土耳其人 - 同样的提案再送过去一次。"
 itatur.7.b:0 "显然我们得给个更合理的提案，采用齐亚诺的方案好了。"
 itatur.8.t:0 "斯科尔扎的提案- 第二轮"
 itatur.8.d:0 "Italy is having a gamer moment."
 itatur.8.a:0 "开什么玩笑！拒绝！"
 itatur.9.t:0 "提案再度被拒绝"
 itatur.9.d:0 "土耳其人再度拒绝了斯科尔扎的提案，给的理由跟上次一样。大委员会中越来越多的人认为我们应该用齐亚诺的方案，因为很明显土耳其人不可能接受上一份提案。而斯科尔扎跟他的党羽们仍在大委员会里为他的方案辩护。"
 itatur.9.a:0 "行三顾茅庐故事，再送过去一次。"
 itatur.9.b:0 "真是徒劳，把齐亚诺的提案送过去得了。"
 itatur.10.t:0 "斯科尔扎的提案 - 第三轮"
 itatur.10.d:0 "意大利真是欺人太甚，这下不得不接受了啊 :("
 itatur.10.a:0 "没别的办法了……"
 itatur.11.t:0 "一场海上交锋"
 itatur.11.d:0 "罗得岛海军部传来几份令人担忧的报告。昨日，我们的巡逻船遭到土耳其方拦截。通常来说对方的措辞还是比较礼貌的，但这回他们开着大喇叭警告我们已开入了土耳其的领海，该行为是在侵犯他们的主权。一场争论接踵而至，我方坚称该区域隶属意大利领海，因其离罗得岛的海军基地不过区区数海里。\n\n突然间，土耳其方静默，转而向我军船只开火。我方进行了还击，局势就此升级。双方出动了更多军舰，随后展开紧张对峙。在罗得岛与马尔马里斯的海军部进行一系列对话之后，两方各退一步并收兵回港，所幸此次事件并未造成双方的人员伤亡。\n\n该报告似乎证实了我们的最坏打算，即土耳其人正琢磨着对意土两国的争议领土做文章。对该地区的增防工作已开展，意军部队及整个东地中海的意海军部都已进入高度戒备状态。"
 itatur.11.a:0 "我们必须做好最坏的打算。"
 itatur.12.t:0 "我军部队被意大利人袭击！"
 itatur.12.d:0 "打倒意大利帝国主义"
 itatur.12.a:0 "加强巡逻并调兵增援边境。要准备打仗了。"
 itatur.13.t:0 "塞浦路斯的动乱"
 itatur.13.d:0 "更多的坏消息从东部边境传来。\n\n塞浦路斯的土耳其裔人一直为自己的意大利身份而感到不满，随着意土二国之间的紧张关系加剧，这一矛盾已到了爆发的节骨眼上。\n\n在一场当地土耳其人的集会将矛头指向警察后，宪兵被派往公安部门以解决此事。随着警方与与会者发生肢体冲突，这场集会演变成暴乱。虽说土耳其人尽了自己的最大努力，但在增援的加持下警察仍控制了局面，暴乱最终得以平息。\n\n土耳其与意大利的紧张对峙即将变得一发不可收拾，塞浦路斯政府也实行了全岛戒严。"
 itatur.13.a:0 "至少希腊人不会对这感到大惊小怪……"
 itatur.16.t:0 "罗得岛大捷！"
 itatur.16.d:0 "As the last Italian soldiers scrambled from the Rhodian shore, a decisive victory has been achieved over the Italian forces in the Aegean.\n\nAlthough the Italian forces had been long prepared for inevitable scenario of an attack, stationed forces were able to breach the Italian fortifications that had been installed, enjoying overwhelming air superiority as well as the element of surprise. By first securing the adjacent Isle of Simi, naval forces stationed near the area successfully landed several regiments of infantry along the north-eastern coastline, easily securing the majority of the island. Although minor skirmishes throughout the treacherous terrain continued for another 13 days, organized resistance finally ceased when Italy withdrew all non-captured forces from the island, cementing our position in the newly-acquired city.\n\nWith the capture of the city, as well as the surrounding region, the Turkish navy has significantly greater control over the Aegean.\n\nAs Turkish soldiers march past scattered ancient ruins, many are certain that our triumph in the Aegean is a sign of things to come, as with this victory, the ability for Italy to project its power through the Aegean has been greatly diminished, at least until for the remainder of the war. Through our newly-gained control over the Aegean, we shall be in an excellent position for further incursions into the severely-weakened Italian Aegean. This victory's benefits are twofold, however; as a part of the greater campaign to reclaim disputed claimed territory, this battle has served as an extremely useful media tool. Reports of our victory have been widely publicized in Turkey and Italy alike, and the increased morale will certainly aide us in our campaign in the Middle East."
 itatur.16.a:0 "At last, Roda is ours!"
 itatur.20.t:0 "Rhodes Falls to the Turks!"
 itatur.20.d:0 "Marte's regiment had hardly a day's warning of the most recent Turkish offensive. They found themselves stumbling through the barracks at some ungodly hour at their commander's orders, drifting between consciousness and slumber. The only light above was that of the dim moon.\n\nThe Turkish defense forces were expected to beeline towards Italian military assets on Rhodes, but not with such ferocity or in such a short span of time. A well-practiced combined-arms effort saw the Turks shattering the expectations set by their previous maneuvers in the region. Bypassing the Rhodian Strait and its well-prepared Italian defenses, the Turkish navy was able to secure the Isle of Simi north of Rhodes and then leverage their advantage to launch a coordinated night attack that saw the north-east of Rhodes falling to small infantry contingents supported by overwhelming airpower. But Marte and his regiment would only find that out weeks later, in newspaper columns gleefully read aloud by the Turkish officers.\n\nAll they knew at the time was that a small Turkish force had managed to somehow land on the island, but without the means to supply itself or pose a serious threat to Italian possessions. The night skirmish by Kremasti and the harrowing defeat the Italians suffered was not a fluke, nor a single incident, but a sign of things to come. Similar maneuvers had been taking place north in the Italian dioceses, and Italy's grip on the Aegean was not expected to recover from the losses incurred during the Turkish Aegean campaign - not during the course of the war, at least. Marte and what remained of his regiment later found out that Rhodes as a whole had held on for roughly 13 days before Italian forces were forced to evacuate the island, leaving him and the rest of the men captured by the Turks to their fate, learning of the war's progress from newspaper columns and the mood of the prison camp's commanding officer during the morning rollcall."

 itatur.100.d:0 "自第二次世界大战结束以来，土耳其一直对他们在战利品中所占的份额感到不满。太多的土耳其人死在他们的国境之外，得到的却少之又少。随着土耳其总统伊斯麦特·伊诺努宣布土耳其共和国和意大利帝国之间进入战争状态，这种长期的紧张局势终于在今天走向爆发。\n\n尽管两国此前是盟国，但战争在土耳其极受欢迎。青年民族主义者在安卡拉的街道上游行，呼吁伊诺努“引领我们走向胜利”。相比之下，这场战争几乎完全得不到意大利民众的支持，许多人质疑意大利为何当初要介入塞浦路斯的乱局。"
 itatur.100.a:0 "又一场帝国主义战争。"
 itatur.100.b:0 "我们要将其击溃。"
 itatur.100.c:0 "居然能如此对待前盟友。"
 itatur.21.t:0 "意大利在罗得岛获胜"
 itatur.21.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, our forces have successfully repelled the Turkish advance into Rhodes. Though the short conflict was simply part of a larger effort by the Turks to conquer long claimed territories in the chaos following the collapse of the Triumvirate, the victory has been widely publicized by the press and celebrated in Rome.\n\n\"The bravery of the Italian army can withstand any attack!\" Ciano said in a speech from the capital. \"The Turks could not defeat us in Rhodes and they will not defeat us in the Levant!\"\n\nThis success hardly assures victory in the Middle East or the continued glory of the Empire, but in Rhodes, at least, the Italian banner still flies."
