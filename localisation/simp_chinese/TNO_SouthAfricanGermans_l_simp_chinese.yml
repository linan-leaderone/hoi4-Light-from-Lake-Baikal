 SFG_huttig_division_desc: "Oberkommando Südafrika comprises some of the most battle-hardened and ruthless soldiers in the entire Second South African Civil War. Having participated in the South African War and countless guerilla-crushing operations afterward, they are no strangers to the combat or terrain that defines this war. Now, with new orders, the veterans of Oberkommando Südafrika are ready to destroy the resistance in South Africa, one last time."
 SFG_restoring_order_in_sudafrika: "恢复南非的秩序"
 SFG_restoring_order_in_sudafrika_desc: "Oberkommando Südafrika has been given a simple goal ordered straight from Hüttig himself; bring South Africa to heel, by whatever means necessary, forever. There are no morals or ethics holding back the troops of Oberkommando Südafrika, and neither do they present any preface of having one. They are here to destroy, conquer, and subdue, nothing more."

 POLITICS_KARL_CHMIELEWSKI_DESC: "卡尔·赫梅莱夫斯基一直被认为在任何方面都不如常人，唯独除开残酷一项。\n\n赫梅莱夫斯基曾在德国党卫军中有着远大前程，他是少数几个那折磨囚犯的兴趣甚至让海德里希感到不安的人之一。然而，过度贪污和违反党卫军条例的行为结束了他的职业生涯，他也被永久放逐到了许蒂希治下的东非。在这里，他什么都不是。\n\n多年以来，这位名誉扫地的营长一直在尝试获取专员的信任，但这无济于事。甚至于他暗杀伊恩·史密斯的行动也因为阻挠了上司的计划而让他灰头土脸。他在南非战争中作为军队指挥官的能力也乏善可陈，看起来这就是他最后一份工作了。马兰的叛乱和许蒂希的被迫介入让这一切戛然而止。\n\n由于许蒂希手下更有能力的将领都在忙于管理他的辖境，所以赫梅莱夫斯基是唯一留下来镇压布尔人叛乱的将领。他手上只有一支满编师，而当地对德国人的仇恨也达到了史无前例的高点。赫梅莱夫斯基知道重建对国家的控制已是无望了，但在他被击败前，他至少还要尝试去尽可能地撤走德国在当地的资源。"
 POLITICS_WILHELM_DOMMES_DESC: "Wilhelm Dommes never wanted to be in Afrika, and even now thinks only of how to escape it.\n\nAfter spending the Second World War as the only German commander to closely cooperate with the Japanese throughout the war, Dommes had expected a rapid promotion to the Seekriegsleitung. However, the rapid deterioration of German-Japanese relations after the war resulted in a speedy exile to Ostafrika, where his career languished for over a decade. Worse still, Dommes sat out the South African War, crawling in his skin as the American navy prevented his petty fleet from playing any active part.\n\nThroughout Hüttig's reign, it was speculated he avoided being purged because the Afrikan Kriegsmarine was thought too irrelevant to bother with. Few, however, knew just how true that statement was. While Africa burned, Dommes used the Statthalter's benign ignorance to plot his escape, but being constantly frustrated by want of fuel. When the Vasallenstaat was reconquered, however, Dommes changed his plans: Quietly using the last of his supplies to relocate what remained of his fleet to the abandoned OFN naval base at Simonstown, the Konteradmiral procured to secure control of the Cape in the inevitable event of the Reichsstaat's collapse, and hand it in a silver plate to his former allies in exchange for rescue.\n\nUsing his influence with Rolf Mutzenburg and Hans Ulrich Rudel, both of whom he saved from execution by Hüttig, Dommes painstakingly infiltrated Oberkommando Südafrika in preparation for making his move. When news of Hüttig's death reached Kapstadt, it took little effort to assassinate the hated Chmielewski and recall his troops to the Cape. Merging the late Kolonialverwalter's command with his own \"Seeverteidigung Simonstown,\" he has assembled a collection of weaponry ranging from the barely operable battleship Rodney to the most modern armor available to the defunct Bouhlerstadt regime.\n\nNow that his plan is entering the final stretch, Dommes has only one objective: Survive until his negotiations with the Japanese guarantee him and his men a safe escape route. To this objective, he has established a temporary alliance with the Johannesburg \"Republic\" and OFN prisoners to the north, which few expect to last, even if it survives the impending ANC attack."
