Two months ago, you barely knew how these things worked. That would be enough for today. Try to eat and rest well because we are going to Florida tomorrow to work in our landings\" Ahmed realized that they only had at least six weeks before departing to the Persian Gulf. Could that be enough to break the Royalist defences? Ahmed was a former employee of ARAMCO. Twenty years of service under terrible conditions were rewarded with four fingers on his left hand when he tried to unionize, courtesy of Saudi thugs. However, the two years of service under the CIA to train Saudi dissidents could bear some fruits other than a mutilated hand. The dream of a free Arab nation seemed to be closer than ever.\n\nAs the recruits retired to their quarters, he was approached by Nasir al-Sa'id, leader of the Arabian People's Peninsula Union. Nasir introduced Ahmed to the US government when both escaped the country. \"So, are these boys ready to bring me the head of the King?\" asked Nasir filled with optimism. \"They are improving. Maybe we can spark a revolt after we deal with the coastal defences. But what we are going to do with the Americans once we take over? The CIA doesn't look a charity organization to me\" remarked Ahmed. Nasir laughed confidently \"Remember the oil wells, my friend.

You are about to embark on a crusade to liberate our oppressed brothers and sisters from the tyranny of the Monarchy\" screamed from his megaphone. The sound of a Douglas B-26B cut through Nasir's speech. Ahmed interpreted this as a bad omen. Shouldn't the Americans have neutralized the Saudi air force by now? It is vital for the success of the operation that their paratroopers can land unopposed. The pilots that the CIA offered for ground support weren't doing their job properly\n\n\"As we enter our decisive battle, the enemy will fight fiercely to protect the privileges of the King and his cronies\" continued Nasir in a louder voice. Once again, the speech of the revolutionary leader was interrupted this time by the loud noise of Saudi anti-aircraft artillery. From the ship, Ahmed could guess that probably were old WW2 models. \"But this battle will be the founding stone to build a future for our child...\" Suddenly, a company of five old German tanks started to fire the freighters from the beach. Ahmed wondered if the Nazis were the reason behind the Saudis being so well informed of the operation. Probably aware of this, Nasir couldn't hide the anger on his face. \"You know what? To hell with this. Let's get to Riyadh right now. Glory to the Arab people!\" The rest of Ahmed's squadron cheered raising their fists into the air.

But when you are outnumbered 10 to 1, supplies don't make the difference. It was a miracle that they even lasted a single day. \"You were right this whole time, Ahmed. The Americans only used us as bait\" exclaimed Nasir with despair. Ahmed was desperately holding the wound of his friend. Just twenty-four hours ago, he was joking about putting the King's head on his wall. \"I don't lose hope yet. Maybe the Arab people revolts against the Saudis or maybe Nasser invades the region. Either way, I don't want this scum to get away so easily\". There was nothing Ahmed could do anymore. \"Honestly, I should have stayed in Egypt\" exhaled Nasir for the last time.\n\nAhmed made the proper military salute thinking of how everything went wrong. He cursed the CIA for sending them to this deadly trap without proper training. How could he expect that the people that got their asses kicked by the Germans knew something about warfare?The noises of approaching steps on the sand filled Ahmed with enough determination to avenge his fallen comrades. The Arab officer grabbed his machine gun for a final confrontation with the Saudis. After all, it was a better end than being beaten to death by strikebreakers for a minimum wage.

The reconnaissance patrol informed him of the apparent last Saudi holding point: the Tarout Castle in Qatif. Apparently, the Saudis made their gamble for a last stand on the ancient fortress \"The past is a perfect place for these rats to hide\" commented Nasir jokingly.\n\nFrom the top of a M26 Pershing, Nasir guided the advance towards the old castle but the Saudis made no attempt at defense. No artillery or machine guns could be seen at the top of the building \"They want to surrender already?\" asked Nasir to himself. A group of soldiers came from the ruins. \"Lay down your weapons now!\" screamed one of Nasir's men as they aimed their guns. It was then that they recognized the uniforms of the men coming through the doors: they were their guys! \"So, when we are going to Riyadh?\" joked Ahmed. A burst of cheers and laughter came from Nasir's squadron. Ahmed already foresaw the possibility of the Saudis entrenching on the fort, so he made sure to occupy it beforehand.

He'd seen that before, southerners and South Africans uncomfortable at serving beside a man of a different skin tone, but the men involved in the argument were practically identical. Worse, it appeared that the incident had set off all sorts of invisible lines between the men. Maronites, Muslims, Shias, Sunnis, even Armenians (How did the Armenians get there?) all supposedly featured in some quantity.

The factory managed, a part of the Toyota Industries' supply chain, was in worst shape than he'd ever seen before: Late deliveries, lacking equipment, absent-minded employees, and every report from company higher-ups bringing worse news than the last.\n\nThis month's report understandably put a smile on his face. While the Crisis had harmed nearly every part of Japan's economy in some way, the time for a turnaround had come. Due to what the report could only attribute to \"a variety of purchase orders from unknown groups across the middle east,\" Toyota's vehicle orders had skyrocketed and so did the factory's projected revenues. At last, a ray of sunshine managed to sneak in through the rainclouds.\n\nOnly after reading the report from front to back did he realize that it made no mention of alleviating the issues faced by the factory. The only conclusion he could draw is that they would somehow need to meet this surge in demand with the already limited means they were working with. The rainclouds had decided to close ranks after a brief shuffle.\n\nKatsumi was a resourceful man. Rainclouds or sunny day, this would need to be done. Immediately two options presented themselves. It was an open secret that most workers could not cope with the increased expenses multiplied by the crisis. Up until now, this was considered irrelevant to the running of the firm, but would most workers refuse longer hours if it means a chance to pay their bills? He reasoned they would not. On the other hand, he maintained a long list of connections to tap into on such a rainy day. Normally his lack of faith in the quality of outsourced tasks would prevent him from opening that drawer, but hard times called for hard measures, and the final product would be shipped thousands of kilometers away. After weighing the costs and benefits of each choice, it was decided that:"

There was nothing to do in this hellhole other than stay in the shade of the camp and glance at the mountainous desert landscape that lied outside, or stroll out the camp's door and succumb to the scorching sun above them. Joachim might have served through similar conditions under Rommel's command during his tenure on the North African front, yet he was no longer the same man he was three decades ago.\n\nHe was a shell of his former self, his bones creaked, his muscles ached and he could hardly take a stroll without running out of breath; he was stricken by the ills of old age, the same ills that he once mocked in his youth. That was not the only thing to change, the looks that the Arabs gave him were now ones of distrust and rage, not the cheers and salutations that accompanied the German victories in the middle east during the war. Back then he had read some local papers with the little scraps of Arabic he had learned in Libya and had seen images of celebration and earnest belief in a coming renaissance for the Arabs. They had welcomed the German army as liberators, an iron phalanx sent by God to avenge their subjugation, to strike fear into the hearts of the colonisers and throw off their foreign yoke, unleashing the Arab people from their shackles.\n\nBut come to the end of the war and the collapse of the Anglo-French empires, that bubble of euphoria would rapture as the Italian phoenix and the Turkish mob, aided by the Germans, descended onto the carcases of the fallen empires and chained these aspiring countries to their own rising empires. After all, that was the natural order of things, the uncivilised and backwards races would forever serve their more refined, European masters.\n\nAt least that was what Joachim always believed, yet now he was here serving at the hands of Arab independence rebels wishing to break free from the Italian protectorate, why and for what reason? He did not know, yet it was the Führer's command- and the ever-wise Führer, infallible as he is, was surely correct in his motives and plans. His line of thought was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a stern-looking Arab calling on him to attend to an envoy arriving from Germania."

Inspired by uprisings in neighboring countries, citizens in Cairo this week took to the streets to protest a government that they claim is more beholden to Italian interests than their own. The unrest-.\"\n\nA loud, phlegm-filled cough forced Mark Daniels, Chicago Tribune, to look up from his portable typewriter. Standing before him, in the cramped hallway of his hotel, was a man dressed in the uniform of an Egyptian palace guard. In the corner of his mouth was a large cigar. He removed the cigar and made another guttural noise with his throat. \"You the American asking around for...\" He twirled the hand holding the cigar. \"Sources?\"\n\nMark gave a confused smile. \"I'm on a deadline but, uh... yes. Of course. You are?\"\n\nThe man stuck the cigar back into his mouth. \"I can get you in the palace for thirty American dollars.\"\n\nMark Daniels blinked. He blinked again. \"Do you have any idea how many people I've had to bribe already today? The taxi driver was going to let some religious fanatics kill me unless I gave him five bucks. A police officer outside threatened-.\"\n\n\"Twenty American dollars for a big-time scoop, as you say. No one else has this offer,\" said the man. Based on the expensive cigar, Mark somehow doubted that was true. \"Maybe bring a photographer and five extra dollars and you can get some nice photos for your bosses.\"\n\nMark massaged the bridge of his nose. The Tribune's accounting department was going to kill him for subsidizing the income of every crooked guard, policeman, and bureaucrat in Egypt but they knew how to get sources and he wasn't about to lose out on an exclusive to the fucking Times.

Below that name was \"Abdul Karim Qassem Square,\" then, painted over that, \"Michel Aflaq Square.\" The entire parking lot seemed to have been consumed by rival factions of painters, each group determined to claim the small lot for themselves as the cars inside it grew more and more deteriorated.\n\nToshiro sighed and tried not to think through the implications of the state of the parking lot. \"Gentlemen, we are here to represent the Co-Prosperity Sphere here in Iraq today,\" he said, looking over at his colleagues. \"It is essential that these Arabs see us as an inspiration, liberators. Just as the Asian people were shackled by Western powers and unnaturally divided, so too are the Arabs. Under the guidance of Japan, the people of Baghdad can become strong, free, and-.\"\n\nHe broke off as one of his associates tilted their head pointed behind him. Toshiro turned in time to see an angry man with a paint bucket enter the parking lot.

With that, the presumed representative of the Ba'athists knocked on the window, climbed into the car, and took a seat next to his fellow guest in the city of Sofia. \"Herr Strik, tell me, do they still allow you to smoke this much in Lufthansa?\" Wilhelm held out his cigar box, which the Arab opened graciously.\n\n\"Of course not, Herr Ahmad! This car alone must be only second to the smokestacks in the east, no?\" Ahmad smiled, a look of discomfort coating his face as he leaned back in his seat. \"Don't worry, the Ba'athist cause is one which seems to fall directly in line with the Reich's, therefore you're the safest men on the planet.\" The tension in the room lifted, even if the smoke hadn't, and Ahmad removed a stack of papers from his briefcase.\n\n\"First order of business, how much can we count on you in terms of providing us with firearms?\" Wilhelm scoffed at the question and put on a smirk over his raised eyebrow.\n\n\"Ahmad, Germania backs our cheques from here to kingdom come, this is only really a matter of how confident you are you can put the guns to good use.

Ciano's mismanagement of foreign policy and the Italian Empire, the turmoil stirred up by the transition to democracy, and the incompetence of the Italian colonial administration has led to an explosion of chaos in the Middle East.\n\nThis would not be our concern except for two reasons. First, Italy is an extremely valuable ally with vast influence over the Mediterranean, a powerful military, and economic ties to both us and our allies. Second, Italy's empire is one of the world's largest producers of oil, and the collapse of their colonial governments has dramatically destabilized the oil market. Both of these are reason enough to intervene, the only question is the nature of that intervention."

This means getting our agents and advisors on the ground to ensure that the governments we choose are the ones winning.\n\nAgent Hunt and his men have their orders, and are beginning operations against German and Japanese-backed forces already.
