 POLITICS_Hermann_Fegelein_DESC:0 "From the city of Dresden comes a regular radio broadcast, singing the praises of the Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler and the Burgundian System- and urging the people to follow them.\n\nHermann Fegelein. Experienced, cynical, and ever-irreputable, the Obergruppenführer has seen much in his years of service to the Reich and the SS, and his eyes have watched dozens of plots pass before them. Accusations of treason or crimes against the Reich, evidence passed hastily in back-door deals, the slow rise and fall- or, in some cases, success- Fegelein has seen it all.\n\nSo, when caught between what little loyalty he possesses to Himmler and the System and Heydrich's frankly ridiculous allegations of the Reichsführer's plots- nuclear armageddon? The end of the world? Please.- Fegelein stuck with his guns. Today, he and his men devote themselves to ending Heydrich's treachery and exposing his falsehoods- through both pen and sword, as they broadcast nationwide urges to leave the traitor and instill the true Spartanist Aryan ideal as devotedly as they fight for it. If there's one thing that the Obergruppenführer is committed to, it's the Aryan paradise he's worked towards for so long.\n\nAnd yet, something tickles at the back of Fegelein's consciousness- What if Heydrich's words are somehow true? Fegelein wants the Aryan ideal, yes, but not by ending the world. It's a good thing Fegelein doesn't root himself to many causes, for if Heydrich backs his words with facts, Fegelein may find it wise to desert- and everyone wants a good propaganda department these days."

 SSF_reichwide_political_ties_desc:0 "除开党卫军的身份，费格莱因还是位人们心目中魅力非凡的社交名流。与爱娃·布劳恩之妹的政治联姻为这位骑兵猛将提供了许多机会。战争结束后，他利用自己的关系，为自己拉拢了许多党卫军的敌人。"

 SSF_unscrupulous_nazism_desc:0 "虚荣傲慢、见利忘义的费格莱因既是一个忠实的纳粹分子，也是一个地地道道的流氓。和这位军官一样，他手下的士兵也常常胡作非为。费格莱因是党卫军的耻辱，但希姆莱似乎对此并不关心。"
