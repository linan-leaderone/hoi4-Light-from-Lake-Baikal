 USA_LBJReac_Naivety_Johnson:0 "约翰逊的幼稚"
 USA_LBJReac_Naivety_Johnson_desc:0 "自1948年以来，林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊一人令参议院的民主党人，后来是共和党人团结一致。他的一言一语使得他的党派能成功渡过二战后的政治风暴，但他的意见便是定论，也不允许任何异议。“参议院的雄狮”虽然会守护着自己的人，但他也要求以忠诚作为回报。美国人民也期望他的这般习性能让他那所谓的“伟大社会”得以实现，因此让他迈进了白宫。\n\n但是，他们没有看见雄狮，只看见了一只幼稚的老鼠，除了四年来把国家的钱大肆浪费以外什么事都没能做成。在对他的承诺失去信心之后，他们把票投给了我们，让我们来弥补他的错误。\n\n虽然我们可能仍对自己的先见之明感到得意，但不要再讲那位得克萨斯人的故事了。经济正在大出血，而美国人民要求我们堵上这道伤口。让我们在更多的伤口出现之前开始工作吧。"
 USA_LBJReac_Already_Great:0 "美国早已伟大"
 USA_LBJReac_Already_Great_desc:0 "如果你参加了约翰逊的竞选集会，你可能在离开时就会完全相信，美国已经无可救药。面包还没放到餐桌上就早被抢走，人们对他们同胞充满了歧视，煽动仇恨的人掌握了权力，而对困扰人民的问题毫不关心。这些集会所描述的美国的问题，只有激进的方式才能解决——巧合的是，这些正是约翰逊所兜售的政策。\n\n对约翰逊承诺的幻想破灭的那些人，只需要忽视这些明显的攻击说辞，便能意识到约翰逊所攻击的只是些站不住的稻草人而已。看啊，我们的繁华小镇的生活水平比世界上其他地方都高；看啊，那些在农场和商户工作的人对待陌生人是多么友好；看啊，我们的技术官僚和政治家们正引领我们的国家走上正确的道路。\n\n不要被激进分子的言语所蛊惑。美国早已伟大，而她在我们的政府治理之下会依旧伟大。"

 USA_LBJReac_How_Many_Agencies_desc:0 "心脏病-癌症-中风问题委员会(HDCS)、社会保障署(SSA)、发展概念文件(DCP)、国家人文基金会(NEH)、美国运输部(USDOT)、社区行动计划(CAP)、志愿服务队(VISTA)、经济机会局(OEO)、食品券计划(FSP)、美国住房与城市发展部(HUD)……如果通往地狱的道路是由善意铺就的，那么约翰逊一定以为通往他的“伟大社会”的黄砖路的砖头上面必须写满了字母缩写。\n\n无论如何，连他最小的改革都需要如此多的繁文缛节，简直荒谬得让人无法讽刺……如果是在更理智点的世界的话。在这里，它只是昂贵得可怕，更不用说违宪了。削减这些机构大部分的资金既能部分解决我们的财政困境，又同时能维护国家的法律。"
 USA_LBJReac_Slash_Budget:0 "削减预算"
 USA_LBJReac_Slash_Budget_desc:0 "臃肿的预算让臃肿的官僚机构得以形成，而这又再度需要臃肿的预算，又再度生成更多官僚机构……说到这里应该就能明白问题何在了。\n\n约翰逊一定以为自己是奥林匹斯的神，因此犯下了希腊神话中“傲慢自大”的这个通病，在他的任期内不仅大幅扩张了行政机构，还大幅扩张了预算。聪明人本该意识到此般愚蠢行为的自然后果；只能庆幸现在聪明人重掌了大权，能修复美国的政府赤字。\n\n他们给出的解决方案简单明了：将官员数量和预算都削减一定百分点。二者相互影响，最终便能共同降至一个更容易管理的水平。"
 USA_LBJReac_How_Far:0 "前路何方？"
 USA_LBJReac_How_Far_desc:0 "目前为止，我们已经摘下了足够多的低垂果实，稍微缓解了美国预算中让人触目惊心的赤字。虽然预算状况仍然不是那么理想，但至少它现在损失的钱比大选前少得多。现在约翰逊的遗产只剩下了那些确实在一定程度上得到美国人民认可的项目，其中最值得一提的是社会保障。\n\n国会在这一关头对如何前进出现了分歧，除了我们的党派核心外，财政保守派也主张尽快废除这些项目。相反，约翰逊所在党派的温和派则认为，保留这些项目利大于弊。无论其缺点如何，他们依然认为“伟大社会”对美国的一些弊端给出了一些意图良好并实践有效的解决方案。\n\n我们该走哪条道路呢？"
 USA_LBJReac_Could_be_Usefull:0 "保留框架"
 USA_LBJReac_Could_be_Usefull_desc:0 "不论是出于美式实用主义还是对他的宽恕，约翰逊的仓促改革还是有点价值，虽然他像把午餐钱花糖果上的孩子一样把很多钱他浪费掉。但前总统还是设法投资了一些十分有利于美国人民的项目。保留这些项目能让国民继续享用约翰逊做出的蛋糕中的精华部分。\n\n另外，民主党人收回他们做出的敷衍承若不大可能让他们大动肝火。毕竟，他们是爱惜羽毛的。"
 USA_LBJReac_Targeted_Funding:0 "精准拨款"
 USA_LBJReac_Targeted_Funding_desc:0 "然而，我们犹豫地接受约翰逊的某些改革，并不自然而然地意味着从他上任伊始就被我们反对的肆意挥霍被认可。如果我们想要保留他的某些项目，拨款给哪些，拨多少钱则需要认真考量。在超出国会中预算问题上的鹰派对例外——而且是合理的例外的接受范围之前，不会指责我们对他灾难性的预算太过宽容。\n\n因此，新预算的可支配资金应当定点流向那些已经显示出极大成功，至少效益成本比比较大的举措。"
 USA_LBJReac_Shrink_Safety_Net:0 "缩小社会保障网"
 USA_LBJReac_Shrink_Safety_Net_desc:0 "目前，联邦政府没有足够的财力和精力成为所有公民尽职的大家长。撇开道德义务和宪法问题不谈，联邦政府不可能补贴所有人从摇篮到坟墓的一生；要求这种不可能的事情是十分幼稚的表现，同时，听从这样的声音，会让葬送约翰逊总统生涯的重大失败再度归来。\n\n我国的社会保障网必定要在为平衡预算而进一步削减其经费的诱惑中面向未来。这一目标可以通过裁撤那些可能处于不可持续的水平的项目来实现。"
 USA_LBJReac_Era_of_Big_G_is_over:0 "大政府时代的结束"
 USA_LBJReac_Era_of_Big_G_is_over_desc:0 "约翰逊和他的拥趸最大的错误是假设组建一个大政府就会构建一个更公正繁荣的社会。他在白宫的最后日子恰好证明了这一点，大政府只会搞些不计后果的经济支出，而美国民众却什么都没有得到。我们对他的黯然离场的境况有相似的看法：在坚定服从一个小谎言的短短四年，几十年的稳步进展化为乌有。\n\n我们只有承若从前总统的愚蠢行为中汲取教训，才能让民众们满意。未来的政府可能会忽视他们之所想，然而，至少现在，从国务院和国会中发出的正义之声将战胜这个反复无常且蛊惑民心的总统。"
 USA_LBJReac_Shutter_Office:0 "关闭经济机会局"
 USA_LBJReac_Shutter_Office_desc:0 "事实证明，约翰逊在消除美国贫困的努力中走火入魔了。他所创建的经济机会局破坏了工作热情，践踏了州权，而且……实话说，它实在是太他妈的昂贵了。我们一定可以找到更好的方法来消除贫困，而不是靠政府直接强制性执行。"
 USA_LBJReac_End_Social_Security:0 "结束社保"
 USA_LBJReac_End_Social_Security_desc:0 "现在可以说约翰逊的政治遗产已经被完全勾销了。他所实施的项目已被废除，减少了国家财政上的负担。他的“伟大社会”的残渣要么只会被历史书所铭记，要么就是被削减得如此彻底，作为挂名头衔给政治盟友别人都不屑。虽然还需要一些时间才能看出理智开销的所有好处，但以后政府的经费不会被那些项目白白浪费了……\n\n除了社会保障项目，一些保守派如是说。虽然约翰逊的得意之作极受美国人民的欢迎，但是往好的方面说其根基也是站不住脚，往坏的方面说就是个大骗局。年轻劳工所缴的社保费总有一天会跟不上受益人的数量。节俭的经济不应该纵容这种如此明显会崩溃的施舍系统存在——他们表示，这就是社保必须被废除的缘由。"
 USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat:0 "稳住危船"
 USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat_desc:0 "约翰逊曾在选举日前掀起大规模民权立法的浪潮，这是在短时间进行大量草率承诺的鲁莽举措。或许他认为有必要通过激进的手段来弥合我国的种族裂痕，抑或他仅仅是在做一次豪赌，赌黑人地带的选民能站在他的身后。\n\n不论从哪个角度上看，他的尝试都是偷鸡不成蚀把米。南方白人为改善黑人的福祉做了太多的工作而大吵大闹；全国黑人对总统只给到他所承诺的零头而感到愤怒。这个得克萨斯人在试图愈合国家的伤口时，反而更加撕裂了伤口。\n\n我国目前的情况就像一艘全速撞向岩石峭壁的快船。而我们的任务是确保我国一头撞上另一个可避免的危机之前将它控制住。"
 USA_LBJReac_Coddle_South:0 "宠溺南方"
 USA_LBJReac_Coddle_South_desc:0 "从没什么民权立法反对者能有乔治·华莱士和他麾下的迪克西派小集团闹腾。他们用“保护州权”和“捍卫南方生活方式”之类的借口掩饰着对黑人的蔑视，而支持他的选民却像猪猡一样饥不择食，不假思索地接受了华莱士的这套说辞。\n\n不幸的是，华莱士越是认为自己的言论遭到忽视，他就越会给行政部门制造麻烦。这位如同角斗士一般的参议员的种种斗争无不与我们的议程南辕北辙，但我们至少也得做做样子，以他所期望的方式对待他长篇大论的声讨。天知道这个哗众取宠的阿拉巴马人的激烈抨击是多么令人难以忍受啊……"
 USA_LBJReac_Unshackle_Police:0 "放出警察"
 USA_LBJReac_Unshackle_Police_desc:0 "为了防止美国警察对非裔美国人的不公对待，《民权法案》的起草者们制定了各式各样繁琐复杂的法律条文，将警察牢牢地束缚起来，可这却让他们根本无法处理任何事务。沉重的政策压得警察们喘不过气，连执法都无从谈起，那这些政策又能有什么用处？如此演戏一般的安全保障没有为任何人带来正义——无论是它声称要保护的黑人，还是那些真诚地宣誓要保护他们的勇士。\n\n如果我们期待警察能够践行“服务与保护”的信条，那么一个必要条件就是将警务工作从侵扰其正常运转的官僚魔掌中解放出来。这样的官僚主义哪怕只有一丁点，都会阻碍工作的正常进行。而摆脱这种干扰，将使警察能够更好地服务于大众。"
 USA_LBJReac_Question_Still_Stands:0 "问题依旧"
 USA_LBJReac_Question_Still_Stands_desc:0 "目前为止，我们已经删除了民权法案中最过分的恶法条例；修订了指导方针，调整了惩罚措施，明确了定义，简化了程序。但对于这么一个棘手的问题，我们的削减只能起到这么点作用。不管我们喜欢与否，它就在那里，耐心地等待着我们最后的决定。\n\n最后的决定应该怎么做？一如既往，只有两种答案：要么完全支持现行的民权法案，或者让其作为失败的立法归档国会记录，优秀的总统在任期内的关键时刻都会谨慎行事——就像现在这样。"
 USA_LBJReac_Cant_Change_it_Now:0 "我们现在无力变革"
 USA_LBJReac_Cant_Change_it_Now_desc:0 "尽管南方人喜欢抨击《民权法案》，觉得它就像是恶魔意志在世间的显现，尽管它的具体条款……并非如此。与之相反，大量的美国民众认为这一法案证明上层兑现了他们的承诺，法案提供给他们的保护程度远远超过了过去几年的总和；此外，为了安抚南方的白人而停止已经通过的法案不会带来多少益处，反而会引发更多问题。\n\n维持法案的某些条目能为解决美国种族隔离问题提供巨大帮助，但即使抛开这一目的不谈，《民权法案》也是一部已经正式实施的法案。就算是为了避免驳回法案所面临的一系列政治斗争，我们也应该像接受正常法律一样实施它。"
 USA_LBJReac_Enforce_the_Provisions:0 "循规蹈矩"
 USA_LBJReac_Enforce_the_Provisions_desc:0 "“法是严厉的，但这就是法”——这是拉丁语中关于法律的一句名言。没有任何一个人能低估法律在维持文明运转方面的作用；即使是难以接受的法律，也应当严格遵守，没有这种信念，我们的社会就会自行崩塌，因为法律条文不可能顺遂每一个人的所有意愿。同理，政府必须在没有成见的情况下展现出维护法律的意愿。\n\n这些道理都非常适用于现在与《民权法案》有关的情况。尽管我们对法案中的部分条文有些许意见，但它依然是美国法律体系中不可或缺和无可争议的重要部分。也因此，我们必须切实执行这一法案——如果不同意其精神，那么至少落实其文字。"
 USA_LBJReac_Dismiss_Lawsuits:0 "驳回诉讼"
 USA_LBJReac_Dismiss_Lawsuits_desc:0 "诉讼这种武器历久弥新，在美国人的军火库中始终占据着特殊地位。当欧洲的骑士和国王们还在为了特权与正义而进行老式的比武时，美国人已经开始站在法庭上互相争名逐利了。就算你的主张明显无效也完全无所谓，只要你有钱，所有人都能发起一场又慢又长的普通法诉讼案。早在过去的历史上，正义的天平便像这样向着财富倾斜了。\n\n自从约翰逊批准民权法案以来，针对法案部分条款的法律诉讼就一直有增无减。如果不加以解决，这些诉讼很可能导致民权法案的关键条款被取消，从而实际上瘫痪整个法案。幸运的是，最高法院的大法官们不会忽视或者教唆这些赤裸裸的攻击行为——获得他们的直接帮助将能为我们永远解决这些问题。"
 USA_LBJReac_Do_Whats_Right:0 "遵从正义"
 USA_LBJReac_Do_Whats_Right_desc:0 "我们抵制、我们承诺、我们获利、我们联合，我们做了所有能做的事以反对这个法案。我们舍弃原则、割舍利益，终于走到了现在这一步。\n\n在这个节点上坚持我们的协议可能不是一件容易的事……但绝对是一件正确的事。因此，就算不择手段，我们也要取缔《民权法案》。"
 USA_LBJReac_Pull_our_Support:0 "撤出援助"
 USA_LBJReac_Pull_our_Support_desc:0 "在某种程度上，法律只在其施行时才算真正重要。如果一部法律的落实缺乏政府全力支持，民众就不会视其为一部有效的法律。通过决定哪些法律可以执行而哪些又不行，即使我们没有公开声明，普通人也会清楚政府的倾向性。\n\n我们可以运用这个逻辑来向国会和选民们示意：行政部门不再支持《民权法案》了。我们必须尽量避免争论，减少直接冲突的风险，并通过这种“阳奉阴违”让那些不愿意了解或不明确知悉我们行动中暗示的人明白我们的意图。"
 USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting:0 "悄声行动"
 USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting_desc:0 "我们会致力于废除《民权法案》，但我们不能无视这一举动产生的后果。即使我们稍微做出暗示要废除这项法案，黑人群众以及他们在国会和州政府的盟友们就会群情激愤，甚至发起暴动。如果官方程序在政治压力下被禁止，人们就会考虑一些“创造性”方法来否定这些压制法令。\n\n一个可行的方法是在接下来的几个月里不断颁布看似不相关的法律和行政令，但实际上它们各自都废除了《民权法案》的一小部分。这将以新任总统在立法方面的“新官上任三把火”为伪装；当人民察觉到发生什么时，法案的废止已经成为一个既定事实了。"
 USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track:0 "回归正轨"
 USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track_desc:0 "多年以后，历史课本会详细记述林登·B·约翰逊在美国政坛的扶摇直上与昙花一现。人们会评价他的成就与失误，会剖析他的所有微不足道的举止、缺点和习惯，以理解他的动机、目的和行为；人们会追猎他的所有生活痕迹，从他遇见的人到他待过的地点，这一切都是为了拼凑出他的人生轨迹，厘清他的迭起兴衰。最后，他们会下结论，这个来自得克萨斯州的议员在他总统任期内的最大“成就”就是刷新了美国的债务最高记录。\n\n书写我们这一时期历史的人会看到两幅图像，即使光与暗的对比在这两幅图像的不同面前也会显得相形见绌。约翰逊使美国的债务飞速飙升、经济直跌低谷，但我们让美国财政回升，经济也迅速回暖；约翰逊使美国接近分裂与冲突，我们却把这个国家建成友爱与联合之国；约翰逊使美国不断步入黑暗，我们却引导它走向光明。\n\n假以时日，历史也许会弥补林登·B·约翰逊的诸多过错。但那时，美国将更加明白，是[USA.GetLeader]带领她走出失败的黄昏，把她重新带回黎明之中。"

 WAL.response.1.t:0 "To Undo the Mistake"
 WAL.response.1.desc:0 "To many Americans, George C. Wallace entered office with their highest hopes. Alone he stood against both the duplicitous Republican-Democrats and the fanciful dreams of his new party's progressives and communists. His cause was one of succor in a tempest, a guiding light promising comfort and vigor renewed to a rain-soaked, fatigued man. With America's greatest generations behind him, Wallace paraded down the National Mall in his inauguration like Augustus leading a triumph in the streets of Rome: flush with victory, praised by men, and all but assured that the Republic will be restored under his rule.\n\nThe hindsight of having followed a lunatic to his downfall tastes like bitter, dry ash to many Americans' weary tongues. Grief and shame will follow them as companions for a good while yet.\n\nIn the meantime, President [Root.GetLeader] swears the oath of office under cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers. [Root.GetHerHis] supporters came out in droves despite the weather, clinging to [Root.GetHerHis] uplifting words as rain-soaked, fatigued men cling to what embers burn in defiance of drizzle and damp cold. In every one of them can be found the irony of the forsaken, having their trust betrayed by one man promising them the world, bestow that very same trust to another claiming the very same. Perhaps they do recognize it, yet bestow their trust regardless in a fit of desperation -- so horrified are they of Wallace that they would risk another mistake for a chance, any chance, to undo the nightmare he had wrought.\n\nThe weight of duty bears heavy on the shoulders of every American President since George Washington. Yet in the midst of the nation's greatest crisis in decades, President [Root.GetLeader], it seems, shall bear heavier weights than most. For the American people, [Root.GetSheHe] must."

Many thought it resolved ever since Reconstruction; as the recent bedlam in cities across the South can attest, they thought wrong. Still, our party's leading figures questioned the wisdom of rocking the American boat overtly while we all suffered under Wallace's idiocy; one innocuous overture, they cautioned, may lose us the trust and votes we dearly needed to keep the party whole. Pandering for votes can come after the fragments of government are picked up and good governance made whole.\n\nTo their credit the strategy worked -- at least, until Wallace was booted from office. Now the crisis has passed, and its bandaids have lost their hold over the deep fissures they had papered. Both left and right have mobilized their machines and their men, lumbering to life to again fight their respective sides in America's many issues. Now there is nothing the White House can do but to either rein what it can control... or tie its fortunes to either side.\n\nNormalcy may be returning to America, but in a fit of myopia, its people have forgotten what \"normal\" truly meant -- not an end to chaos, no, but rather its resumption after a century of pause."

Wallace handled it poorly; as the duty-obliged janitors cleaning up his many mistakes, we are left with no choice but to press one ear into the public pulse at all times.\n\nOur observations create a picture of violence and disorder gripping all forms of discussion over civil rights. Passionate souls engage in riotous behavior to prove their point, and policemen intervene to uphold the law's points. Rinse and repeat in upended barrooms, barricaded streets, and broken homes nationwide.

Because of cooperation and compromise, the Greeks stonewalled Persia's mighty armies; scientists developed innovations that shaped history; and backwoods colonials birthed the world's mightiest republic.\n\nYes, peaceful agreements have accomplished just as much as the armies men resort to mustering should agreement fail to manifest. These agreements are also what America's governing party needs to act as the country's duly elected government; as it is, ideological divides and personal vendettas have hamstrung its ability to pass civil rights legislation, much less laws for other, less taxing issues.\n\nBefore this paralysis lingers long enough to stick for the next four years, the President must act posthaste to bring the party together..."

Rivals exchanged hushed barbs and retorts instead of ignoring the other's presence altogether. Others were content to bask in an ambience both foreign and familiar before the daily prayer.\n\nAnimus had returned to the party, thanks in no small part to the President's efforts to mend the fissures Wallace had left behind.

Old hands learn to use money where it counts. Still, it pained the Arizonan to burn some hundred thousands of dollars to ease cornered rats, like Barry's companion. The man's bloodshot eyes locked with his while their owner quaffed his drink like a man gasping for water.\n\n\"Wallace had some catastrophically bad ideas,\" he began, pausing for the right words. \"But also some good ones hiding underneath. Ideas which we both value equally.\"\n\n\"And you don't trust the Ivy Leaguers and liberals you hitched with no more.\" His Southern twang rolled thick with tar, spite and beer foam.\n\nBarry sighed. \"Look, I know we didn't leave on the best of terms-\"\n\nA snort.\n\n\"-but there's no chance in Hell they'll go along with us here. You might.\" He shook his head. Any man his place would be just as tempted to finish the job. \"No. You will.\"\n\nThe President returned his erstwhile colleague's stare with his own. \"Right?\"\n\nSmothered by silverware, conversation and jazz chords, their own silence stretched out unnoticed. What hesitation lingered in Barry's conscience faded as he held his ground against the spiteful, beleaguered exile.\n\nThen the erstwhile Republican's lower broke into a grin, sputtering chuckles like an engine thrumming to life. He poured a bottle of beer on both his and an unused mug until amber liquid filled both to three-fourths their height.\n\n\"If Philadelphia had more folk like you then me and mine wouldn't have jumped ship someplace greener!\" the Congressman laughed out.\n\nBarry caught the mug slid his way as he let his breath loose. If not brought back to the fold, then they were at least now willing to vote with the party. Having their golden mouthpiece pledge his cooperation will see to that soon enough.\n\nThe Senator raised his mug towards the night sky. \"To the union,\" he toasted, \"next to our liberty, the most dear.\"\n\nBarry Goldwater chuckled. Trust South Carolina's fourth branch of government to fashion himself the next Calhoun. But it was all in good fun, so he humored his fellow Southerner with clinking mugs. \"To union and liberty.\"\n\nAnd with that, Strom Thurmond joined the party in earnest."

 WAL.response.9.desc:0 "Vice President Rockefeller barged into the Oval Office just as Barry finished the last sheaf of tonight's paperwork. He caught the sigh before it left his throat.\n\n\"With all due respect, Mister President...\" Rockefeller's frowning mug grew deeper. \"This wasn't what you promised.\"\n\nAh. News does travel fast in D.C.; rumors can entangle themselves in an intricate web of connections, helpless before press journalists looking for a scoop. Setting his fountain pen to its holder, the Arizonan tilted up and faced the New Yorker fully.\n\n\"I promised the American people to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution,\" he answered, just like last... several conversations they've had as of late. \"Now you ask me to play tyrant with its laws just because we're staying in the White House for four years?\"\n\n\"For the love of God, Barry, we've been through this before-\"\n\n\"And my opinion hasn't changed: It's not our job. Treat the states like children once and they'll act like children 'til the day we die.\"\n\n\"So all the blacks out dying in Montgomery and Savannah are just kids' toys to you?!\" Rockefeller bursted out, looking for all the world like a red-faced devil as he did. His pointed fingers accused the President of some grand crime only his Vice knew. \"Is that your promise, Goldwater? Letting them suffer more in the hands of spoiled brats before we give them what they're owed?\"\n\nBarry said nothing as he matched Rockefeller's glare. Silent moments later the man deflated, breaking contact.\n\n\"Don't block it. Do anything else you want -- just promise us that.\" He trailed off. The unspoken threat hung in the humid night air like a guillotine. Barry's head or Rockefellers... it was pointless to argue whose deserves a basket. The party will have its headless man either way. If forced the choice, then President Goldwater preferred his head a martyr's.\n\nSo he rose up, gathered his files and empty mug, paced out of the Oval Office, switched the lights out, and called the Republican's bluff before he closed the door shut."

They greeted their allies with warm smiles, their adversaries slightly more fictitious smiles, and voters the brightest smiles PR can beat into their faces. Those wedged uncomfortably between Beltway relevance and Beltway ignominy escaped oversight as Congress strutted like a conga line of peacocks into the Senate and House chambers. Taking their seats, the nation's Congressmen awaited the latest bout of long-standing procedure before another eight hours of business as usual.\n\nSeconds passed into minutes, then half-hours. Heads craning side to side, eyes wide, brows quirked up. No sign of the Vice President.\n\nMurmurs spread throughout the chamber.

 USA_Strom_68_the_greatest_disaster_desc:0 "The unexpected presidency of Strom Thurmond was, to say the least, a disaster for American democracy. The whiplash of the reformist President Kennedy being suddenly replaced by an unelected hardline segregationist shocked the political sphere of the nation to its core, and both sides of the spectrum are now at each other's throats. Worse, Thurmond's highly questionable actions of dubious legality have thrown the integrity of the entire system into question. If we are to prevent the political atmosphere from growing even more volatile, we must work to undo the damage left in his wake.\n\nThurmond leaving office has in itself cooled things down by a fair amount, so we have a window of opportunity to make things right. Unfortunately, this can only be achieved by more or less completely undoing his legacy, which will take up considerable time and effort that could have been spent on our own policies. Regardless, we must work to address this wound on the American psyche, lest it fester and grow until the nation burns once more."
 USA_Strom_68_the_courts_desc:0 "President Thurmond was able to use the Supreme Court, an institution designed to prevent tyranny from ever taking root in this country, to his absolute advantage. Through blatant overreach of power and grossly underhanded tactics, he was able to pack the courts with loyal conservatives who bent the legal system to his will. Though Thurmond no longer holds power, the Supreme Court remains in a corrupted state, and even if we fix this injustice there is nothing to stop it from happening again.\n\nWe must make sure that Thurmond's abuse of legal power can never be repeated. Though most are in agreement that the courts should be reformed, there is disagreement as to what this reform should be. Should we simply formalize the \"unspoken\" rules of the Supreme Court to make them sacrosanct, or should the whole system of selecting judges be reworked from the ground up?"
 USA_Strom_68_solidify_the_line_of_succession_desc:0 "That Thurmond was able to become President at all was the result of the most staggeringly implausible sequence of events in American political history. That the President and vice President were simultaneously killed while the speaker of the house \"conveniently\" recused himself from taking the position all so the President pro tempore of the Senate could take the title was technically a possibility, but one so utterly unlikely that only the faintest of preparations had been made for it.\n\nIn order to prevent this political equivalent of a royal flush from happening again, there have been calls for a review of the presidential line of succession. Reforming such a crucial element of government process will cost a fair amount of political capital all for something that has an even smaller chance of recurring, but the fact that we are preparing for such a possibility will placate many progressives who have been left spooked by the Thurmond presidency."
 USA_Strom_68_the_abominable_maps_desc:0 "Gerrymandering has always been a problem in America, though President Thurmond took the matter to far more outrageous heights than ever before. No rationale could exist for the voting boundaries created by Thurmond during his term other than to gain dozens of extra seats for his ilk with no change in actual voter share. Even many within the NPP agree that this egregious act of subversion cannot be allowed to stand.\n\nA bill has been introduced in the Senate that would undo most of the damage done by these insipid map games, restoring the boundaries to their pre-64 arrangement. Many pro-Thurmond voices both in and out of the Capitol are already raising a stink over this, though at this point few senators care for the feelings of his clique. The bill is unlikely to face any real opposition."
 USA_Strom_68_the_chimera_in_the_room_desc:0 "Never has the unity of any American political movement imploded so spectacularly than it did for the NPP under President Thurmond. Where before the segregationist and progressive wings were somewhat willing to compromise with one another on matters unrelated to their main causes, now the two rant and rail at each other in the halls of power; a chimera nipping at its own heads.\n\nThe future of the NPP is uncertain. The Republican-Democrats wait on the sidelines, quietly hoping that this will mark the end of their rival as a major political force. But within the pact, there are those who believe this to be the perfect chance to once and for all wrest control of the NPP for their own ends. Now is the time for the power players of American politics to intervene and determine the fate of this anti-establishmentarian monstrosity."
 USA_Strom_68_defining_normal_desc:0 "We have addressed the most glaring offenses of the Thurmond presidency, and things are (for the most part) beginning to calm down. There is a hope amongst those in power that things can finally begin to return to normal. What \"normal\" is, exactly, is a question that still needs to be answered.\n\nThe 1960s have without a doubt been a decade of scandal, change and chaos. President Kennedy championed a new model of civil rights, which Thurmond then resoundingly tore up upon the former's tragic assassination using a number of extremely underhanded tactics. There are still some major decisions to be made regarding both the fate of Thurmond himself and the legacy of President Kennedy - decisions which could radically shift the future of American society and politics forever."
 USA_Strom_68_let_it_go_desc:0 "It is true that Thurmond's actions during his presidency were reprehensible, and that he almost certainly used illegitimate and illegal means to do what he wanted. However, there are many in this country and in politics who still stand by him. Punitive action taken against him would only widen the fractures present in our society, and at a time like this we need to make some compromises. Therefore, we will not take legal action against former President Thurmond.\n\nThere are many who will cry foul over this, but as long as we continue to roll back his worst excesses we should be able to keep them onside, while letting the man walk will be some small comfort to his not insignificant support base."
 USA_Strom_68_the_corrupt_bargain_desc:0 "There is one big question about Thurmond's presidency that remains unanswered: why did the speaker of the house so resolutely refuse the position? The man in question has until now remained quiet on the matter, insisting that he simply could not handle the burdens of power. However, shocking evidence has come to light that suggests a more sinister reason - the speaker was threatened by Thurmond himself so that he could secure the presidency.\n\nThis, combined with Thurmond's other acts of dubious legality, cannot be allowed to stand. We must launch a full federal investigation of Thurmond's activities to uncover any wrongdoing and subversion of the law, and if he is found guilty, he must be punished accordingly. This will make us many enemies amongst the segregationists, but in the interests of American dignity, we must remind everyone that nobody, not even a former President, is above the law."
 USA_Strom_68_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "Thurmond's unceremonious tearing up of President Kennedy's work on civil rights certainly brought unnecessary strife and unrest to America. However, he was not entirely wrong. Kennedy's actions were unnecessary and overreaching, and the protections he granted for racial minorities were excessive. While we do believe civil rights are essential, we will not simply revert ourselves to his tyranny.\n\nWe will begin laying the groundwork for our own civil rights bill, which will ensure a fair and balanced state of living for all Americans. Rather than casting them out like Kennedy did, we will allow the segregationists to have a say on the matter. Progressives and African Americans may be uncomfortable with this, but if we want to heal the many scars in this country, it will not be managed by a bill that does not strike a balance."

The Civil Rights Act brought much needed justice and equality to African Americans and halted the unrest that had spread across the country. All this, only for his tragic death to open the door for Thurmond to come in and rip his work to shreds, reopening the wounds and dividing America even further.\n\nIf we are to truly move on from the troubled days of the Thurmond presidency, we must restore Kennedy's vision after it was so viciously tarnished. Our new civil rights legislation will undo the damage done by Thurmond and his clique, reinstating protections and guarantees for racial minorities. This will no doubt infuriate the remaining segregationists, but after their attempted subversion of American democracy, few others are likely to mind us sidelining them."

First, however, we must draft up the legislation we intend to introduce to undo the damages. Though the general ethos and aims of our new course on civil rights has been decided, they say that the devil is in the details, and so we must pay close attention to how this bill is structured - particularly if we want to make sure it can't be undone again at a later date.\n\nClarifying the wording of this bill will make its intentions clear, and should help smooth its passage through to the President's desk. The final result might turn out stronger or weaker than anticipated depending on the precedent we have set so far, and certain people might appreciate or take issue with what comes out the other end. Regardless, now is the time to put pen to paper and give form to the bill that will set us back on the right path."

Today, we resoundingly rebuff this blatant attempt on American democracy and honor the legacy of President Kennedy by bringing our new civil rights bill to vote. Millions have their eyes on Washington as we prepare to make the necessary steps to restore racial justice in this country.\n\nThis bill will revert the damage done by Thurmond, and restore hope to countless souls who once more felt the sting of persecution at his hands. The segregationists scream bloody murder while the progressives breathe a sigh of relief, but for now we must let their voices fade away as senators sit down to vote. Most pollsters agree that after the dark days of Thurmond, this bill will face few obstacles and is almost certain to pass, and soon we can finally move forwards into a future of our own.\n\nWe hope."

It is not the Federal government's job to do more than it already has to reverse Thurmond's excesses, especially when it would be reaching into the states' authority.\n\nWe have done enough."

Instead, the committee's fierce infighting stalled any effort at progress. Today's proceedings were no exception.\n\nRight from the get go, there was an uproar amongst the Nationalist Caucus members when Senator Maurine Neuberger motioned to invite Rev. Jesse Jackson to deliver the chaplain's opening benediction. Senator Robert Byrd denounced the motion as political posturing. Senator Neuberger then reminded him that he had previously invited segregationist radio preacher Jerry Falwell Sr. to deliver a benediction at an earlier Senate proceeding and that Rev. Jackson better embodies, \"The ideals of the late President Kennedy whom this committee honors.\" This prompted Senator Richard Russell Jr. to retort that Kennedy's ideals and legislation were precisely the source of all the division in America today. Senator Scoop Jackson then pointed out that the present committee would not need to be formed had President Thurmond not tried to undermine Kennedy's legacy with his segregationist legislation. Senator Byrd angrily shouted that Thurmond was the only President in the 20th century who fought for Americans' constitutional rights. Senator Pepper then sarcastically asked if Byrd was grateful to Kurt Saxon for giving Thurmond the chance to do so.

The work was long and hard, but with such an ample budget supplied to the investigation, those who burned the midnight oil could expect a healthy bonus for their efforts. So they pressed on, long into the early hours of the morning.\n\nIt started with a hunch. A seemingly useless piece of evidence that one of the investigators decided was important - a receipt for a two night stay at a hotel in downtown D.C., in the immediate aftermath of Robert Kennedy's shooting. Two things stood out about it; firstly, though the room was documented in Thurmond's expenses as being paid for by him, it was booked in the name of one of his aides who resigned shortly after he came to power. Secondly, the hotel was only two blocks from the speaker's D.C. residence at the time.\n\nThe aide in question was soon tracked down and interviewed by the investigators. He expressed nervousness and fear of recrimination, though after reassurances that he would be granted protection and anonymity, he relented, and broke. He confessed that his former employer had commanded him to meet with the speaker and present him with some \"unfortunate information,\" to encourage him to \"consider his options.\" When asked if he had any evidence, the former aide nodded, and expressed hope that his cooperation would lift the cloud of shame that languished over him.\n\nFrom amidst disorganized files of old paperwork, he produced a manila envelope which he had presented to the speaker years prior. The contents of the envelope were sensitive and compromising, and the investigators shared looks of trepidation with one another as they realized the severity of what they had uncovered. It was clear as day. Strom Thurmond had threatened the speaker of the house into refusing the presidency, allowing him into the highest office in the land."

 STROM.response.23.desc:0 "\"James Strom Thurmond, this court finds you not guilty of charges of blackmail, though I should stress that this is only due to lack of evidence. This court does however find you guilty of one count of perjury and two counts of bribery within a public office. Therefore, though I do not see fit to consign you to jail, I hereby order you to pay a fine of two hundred thousand dollars in damages. You may not have been found guilty of the main charges brought against you today, but that does not mean that your conduct was at all befitting that of a man who held such a prestigious office.\"\n\nA mixed mood has set in across the nation in the wake of the trial's conclusion. Progressives are unhappy that Thurmond has seemingly escaped justice for his most heinous offenses, though are satisfied that the investigation proved that he was not as spotless as the segregationists would say. Conversely, Thurmond's clique have cried foul that he was charged at all, though celebrate that the \"fantasy\" of his blackmail was quashed once and for all. Thurmond himself was seen leaving court earlier today, looking haggard and frustrated, but also relieved.\n\nPerhaps with a few more resources, the investigation could have made the blackmail charge stick. However, some within the administration are quietly thankful that the sentence was not more severe - such a development would be rather incendiary in the current political climate. With a mixed success that has seemingly avoided widespread controversy, it is hoped that the unfortunate legacy of the Thurmond presidency can finally be put to bed."

 STROM.response.24.desc:0 "\"James Strom Thurmond, this court finds you guilty of one count of blackmail, one count of perjury in a court of law, and two counts of bribery within a public office. Therefore, I hereby sentence you to a term of two years and six months for the crimes committed, and order you to pay a fine of six hundred thousand dollars in damages. I am well aware of the significance of your former position, and so I feel it all the more important that this sentence be committed today. Let it be known that no man is above the law.\"\n\nThe mood on the overwhelming majority of the streets was one of elation. Those who had once watched in despair as Thurmond seemingly ran roughshod over American values of liberty and justice now bore witness to the triumph of that same justice against him. Some felt that the sentence was lackluster compared to the severity of the charges, but when most had expected the man to walk as men of power tended to do, the fact that he had been punished at all was enough to provoke outright celebrations across the country.\n\nIn the South, however, the fury was all consuming. Segregationist demonstrations swelled larger than they had been in years, and reports of violence were commonplace. So fanatical were Thurmond's supporters that even now they refused to believe that the charges against him were anything more than a conspiracy. With such a breakdown in discourse, it is unlikely that the administration can expect many seats there in the next election.\n\nRegardless, thanks to the government's generous funding of the investigation, Strom Thurmond will be spending the next few years reflecting on his mistakes. For many, the anger and sacrifice was worth it to watch Thurmond squirm as he left court today, vanishing into a secure wagon to begin his sentence."

God knows what you were thinking when you signed your name and all but snatched defeat from the jaws of-\"\n\n\"Didn't regret it then and still haven't now. Never will. The American people sent me here to protect America from radicalism - and so I did.\" Sip. \"So I did,\" sighed the man.\n\n\"Then step out of the White House for once. Hear what the American people really think.\" Raucous chanting simultaneously close and far away quickly filled the disquiet between the two men. \"They're angry, Barry; Christ's sake, they've been angry since Nixon. And your damnfoolery made them angrier. Why?!\"\n\nCrash. Hot liquid streaked ink-black across cold, faded-yellow linoleum. A coffee mug had met the floor and formed scratches where its countless tiny pieces scattered. Indelible scars on the hallowed Office, as decreed by executive order. Would if they fade away like any old wound.\n\n\"There's your fucking answer,\" spat President Goldwater. \"Good day, Mr. Vice President.\""
