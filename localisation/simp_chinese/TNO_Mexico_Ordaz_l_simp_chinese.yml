 MEX_prodigy_president: "天才的任期"
 MEX_prodigy_president_desc: "一切都在按古斯塔沃·迪亚斯·奥尔达斯·博拉尼奥斯的计划进行：党与人民对他寄予厚望，革命制度党绝大多数机构把他托上了权利宝座。\n\n革命制度党和墨西哥合众国的黄金时代将长存。我们将以洛佩斯·马特奥斯总统及其前任的遗产为基础让经济焕发又一春；还要和美国盟友紧密合作，遏制德日法西斯；最重要的是，一只大手将牢牢把控革命，并为其抵御内外敌人。\n\n奥尔达斯万岁！墨西哥万岁！"
 MEX_allies_on_the_left: "联合左翼"
 MEX_allies_on_the_left_desc: "卡洛斯·马德拉索是革命制度党最著名的内部批评者，饱经宦海浮沉的他逐渐成了新总统的私人密友与亲密盟友，他们将手牵手粉碎颠覆者萨利纳斯用他所谓的“技官”扭曲革命制度党的企图。\n\n如今是时候加强我们的纽带了，奥尔达斯将运用他强大的权势，任命马德拉索为革命制度党全国执行委员会主席——该党的实际领导者，相信这对墨西哥政府大有裨益。马德拉索在党内独木难支，必然要依赖奥尔达斯，帮总统拉拢知识分子，让学生和中产阶级闭嘴。"
 MEX_mateos_guidance: "马特奥斯的指引"
 MEX_mateos_guidance_desc: "如果奥尔达斯总统没有他最优秀最可敬的前任、导师兼朋友，阿道弗·洛佩斯·马特奥斯的支持，他根本走不到今天这一步，师恩难忘，他对此颇有自知之明。\n\n因此，洛佩斯·马特奥斯将有权随时联系总统，奥尔达斯也会在需要时继续向他虚心求教。此外，迪亚斯·奥尔达斯将颁布法令，授予前总统全权去完成他的1968年奥运之梦。"
 MEX_the_right_hand_man: "得力助手"
 MEX_the_right_hand_man_desc: "每个领导人都需要负责稳定局势、协助工作的副手才能稳操胜券。对奥尔达斯来说，没有比内政部长路易斯·埃切韦里亚·阿尔瓦雷斯更合适的副手了。奥尔达斯钦佩埃切韦里亚在共和国法律与秩序方面的建树，而埃切韦里亚也曾担任奥尔达斯的内政副部长，两人共事五年以上，建立起了互敬而紧密的联系。\n\n如今，为了革命永固，总统和内政部长必须精诚一致。奥尔达斯已经保住了埃切韦里亚内政部长的位子，他无疑会更忠诚地辅助奥尔达斯。"
 MEX_the_carrot: "胡萝卜……"
 MEX_the_carrot_desc: "日本人的愚蠢打开了潘多拉魔盒，被称为“歌舞伎效应”的混乱仍肆虐在墨西哥合众国。而在危机中医生们竟然胆敢罢工，这瘫痪了我国的卫生系统，进而威胁到了公共秩序。\n\n几个月来，我们一直在解雇这群颠覆分子（他们确实是），并让他们换个方式申诉（他们早该这么做了）。现在奥尔达斯将邀请这些自诩的“工会领袖”去一同改革，以期最终解决问题并结束罢工。"
 MEX_the_stick: "还有大棒！"
 MEX_the_stick_desc: "正如奥尔达斯总统所担心的，医生们没有老实遵守与政府的协定，而是背信弃义地鼓动护士，一同掀起了新一波罢工狂潮，这对墨西哥的医疗体系又是一次重击。\n\n先把我们无比准确的第六感抛到一边，我们得先下手为强。这群叛国贼把我们施舍的慷慨当成软弱，还想吸干我们的血。他们等着吧，迎接他们的将只有屈膝和毁灭，我们再也不会容忍一丝异见。"
 MEX_mendoza_a_day: "一天一把门多萨"
 MEX_mendoza_a_day_desc: "如果医生们执迷不悟要造反，我们就得出动部队铁拳镇压这帮反贼了。士兵们将驻扎在医院维稳并保障其正常运转。\n\n内政部和国防部已经授权士兵，必要时可采取一切行动稳定医院，他们个个都带着门多萨冲锋枪，定能吓退这帮乌合之众。"
 MEX_contract_terminated: "不干就滚"
 MEX_contract_terminated_desc: "正如尼科洛·马基雅维利曾言，当感激之情在生存受威胁时烟消云散，如果一个人还想要激发大众的纪律性，那么受爱戴不如被恐惧。这明谏在今日再适用不过了。\n\n除了在医院维持法律与秩序的士兵，奥尔达斯总统还有些手段来终结这场持续的自杀式谋杀：发出警告。罢工者一律将被解雇，倘若他们执迷不悟，那我们就不能保证他们的人身安全了。"
 MEX_bright_future: "前程似锦"
 MEX_bright_future_desc: "终于，这帮自大的医生败了，他们的罢工接近尾声了。早该这样了，奥尔达斯已经开始不耐烦了，他想把时间花在国家治理上，还墨西哥合众国一个美好未来。\n\n召集内阁，奥尔达斯政府要开一系列会议去明细未来计划。这样一来，墨西哥繁荣也将更上一层楼，而奥尔达斯会用他稳健的大手证明自己是墨西哥革命与革命制度党的绝佳引路人。"
 MEX_establish_IMP: "成立墨西哥石油研究所"
 MEX_establish_IMP_desc: "只有傻子才不明白石油是墨西哥经济的命脉。然而我们在歧路上走了太久，一直没能充分开采利用墨西哥境内的石油。是时候回归正途了。\n\n奥尔达斯将成立墨西哥石油研究所作为石油研究的国家级中央机构。研究所将和墨国油通力合作，相信这能提高墨西哥石油生产商的开采与提炼技术。"
 MEX_sea_of_tehuantepec: "特万特佩克之海"
 MEX_sea_of_tehuantepec_desc: "近日，勘探队在瓦哈卡州的特万特佩克幸运地发现了一块新油田，到下一个十年到来时，我国石油年产量有望因此提升至1.77亿桶。\n\n这无疑是一个巨大的机遇。墨西哥石油研究所与墨西哥国家石油公司必须立刻筹集资源，着手准备进行开采，每分每秒都不能浪费！"
 MEX_modernize_pemex: "墨国油现代化"
 MEX_modernize_pemex_desc: "墨国油，全称墨西哥国家石油公司，乃是著名的拉萨罗·卡德纳斯总统的杰作，革命制度党的一大成就。但正如洛佩斯·马特奥斯的成功一般，我们仍可为这一伟大的遗产添砖加瓦。\n\n墨国油亟需接受现代化改革，其业务重心也要扩大到将天然气开采与石化产品生产纳入其中。奥尔达斯总统将颁布法令，促进墨国油的大规模扩张以开发新近勘探到的自然资源，从而推进墨西哥工业化的宏大事业。"
 MEX_caracas_connection: "去找加拉加斯！"
 MEX_caracas_connection_desc: "墨西哥蒸蒸日上，石油也开始供不应求，未来我们可能不能自给。在石油供应真的出问题之前我们应当未雨绸缪。还好，我们还有一个潜在供应商：我们在委内瑞拉的石油生产伙伴。\n\n与委内瑞拉总统[VEN.Getleader]会面后，我们将达成一项强而有力的贸易协定以解决这一难题。委内瑞拉对OFN一向友好，国内局势稳定，无疑是最好的候选。我们可不想冒险去找阿根廷人和他们差劲的财政油田，不是吗？"
 MEX_alliance_for_freedom: "自由之友"
 MEX_alliance_for_freedom_desc: "“自由之友”是美洲自由的重要支持者，考虑到我们正与德意日支持的颠覆分子发生冲突，再加上受其支持跑到西方世界横行霸道的特鲁希略之流，它的重要性更是不言而喻了。\n\n墨西哥合众国肯定能从“自由之友”的支持中获益良多，因此，迪亚斯·奥尔达斯总统将会见“自由之友”，并同时增进与美国的关系。"
 MEX_restrict_strikes: "限制罢工"
 MEX_restrict_strikes_desc: "罢工阻碍了经济发展，伤害到了外国盟友的在墨投资意愿。尽管我们已经表现出了宽容态度，但这些医生却又想重新开始罢工。显然，我们不能放任事态继续发展。\n\n我们要做出决定性的决策。在罢工煽动起更多人，让他们产生罢工是合法权利的错觉之前，我们必须限制那些在革命制度党的授权之外运作的劳工组织。这除了能够防止类似医协的事件再次发生，还能增强墨西哥工人眼中革命立法机关的作用。"
 MEX_freedom_tractors: "自由的拖拉机"
 MEX_freedom_tractors_desc: "“自由之友”除了支持西方世界自由政权对抗国际法西斯势力，还会向友好国家提供经济援助，我们中美邻国的农业机械化正是绝佳案例。\n\n迪亚斯·奥尔达斯总统深知这些计划对墨西哥大有裨益，“自由之友”的资金与专业知识将带动全国实现机械化。"
 MEX_northern_harmony: "北方谐音"
 MEX_northern_harmony_desc: "自从卡列斯时代结束后两国关系实现正常化以来，美国一直是我们在世界上最亲密的伙伴。当然还有很多国家在文化上与我们更亲近，但没有一个国家像美国一样与我们有着如此紧密且繁荣的利益联系。但这种关系可以更进一步，墨西哥总统指出两国可以采取更多措施来加强这种联系。\n\n古斯塔沃·迪亚斯·奥尔达斯总统主张进一步与美国政府合作。他将利用他之前与美国情报部门的联系，推动放宽边境限制。 毕竟更自由的边界意味着更自由的贸易，而更自由的贸易将意味着更有力的经济增长。 这样美国和墨西哥之间兄弟般的关系将会牢不可破。"
 MEX_legislative_approach: "立法手段"
 MEX_legislative_approach_desc: "我国的立法机关完全在革命制度党的指导下运作，因此常被外部批评家抨击为“傀儡”。无论罢工者们有何立场、有何诉求，立法机关确实是挫败他们的好工具。\n\n利用立法机关通过法案能让我们通过法律手段终结罢工，这比直接请他们吃警棍有效得多。然而，这项举措能如同我们所希望的那样奏效的前提是，我们必须对革命制度党有足够的控制以避免官僚部门扯皮，即使是奥尔达斯总统也曾多次抱怨过这一问题。除此之外，我们必须认识到这种手段会比直接动用武力起效更慢。"
 MEX_military_option: "强力手段"
 MEX_military_option_desc: "我们没时间纠结立法了，那根本收拾不了多如牛毛的问题和各种政治煽动分子。对此次事态而言，在字面意义上，当代的重大问题不是选举和多数票所能解决的，铁与血才能。\n\n根据墨西哥总统的政令，出动的军警将可以使用一切他们认为适宜的强制手段打击未经许可与非法的罢工活动。除此之外，忠诚的鼓动者们将被允许参与到军警部门结束罢工、恢复秩序的行动中。"
 MEX_establish_the_asa: "建立建立机场和辅助服务部门"
 MEX_establish_the_asa_desc: "机场危机已经困扰我们有一段时间了，我们需要采取某种形式的果断决策来确保墨西哥人民能够安全旅行。幸运的是，现在有一份很有趣的提议摆在我们的案前——建立机场和辅助服务部门，简称“ASA”。\n\n为了解决当下的机场危机，我们需要让 ASA 负责管理墨西哥大部分机场的责任。 这有助于我们更好的管理墨西哥机场，并对墨西哥旅游业和航空业进行投资，并最终在未来扩张这些行业。"
 MEX_money_trees: "摇钱树"
 MEX_money_trees_desc: "经济作物（如菠萝、香蕉、可可、芒果和香草）是农业的未来，它们可以说是能长出比索的摇钱树。国际市场的旺盛需求决定了它们巨大的盈利能力，使得它们能为我国经济赚取大笔财富。要是能扩大各种经济作物的种植面积，税收将会大大增加。\n\n尽管全国农民联合会和农民很可能会对此感到不满，但一切都是为了墨西哥的利益。我们将会推广经济作物。"
 MEX_loyal_bulwark: "体制的拥趸"
 MEX_loyal_bulwark_desc: "难道经济作物真的比他们还宝贵吗？扪心自问，我们的农民，革命制度的基石，真的能看到哪怕一分实实在在的钱从这些树上长出来吗？我们明白，经济作物帮不上种植它们的农民。\n\n与其强迫农民种那些他们根本不想种、也根本填不饱肚子的经济作物，损害农民对体制的忠诚，我们应该和全国农民联合会合作以促进自给农业的发展。"
 MEX_restrict_the_reformists: "羁绊改革派"
 MEX_restrict_the_reformists_desc: "尽管政府并不愿意承认这一点，古斯塔沃·迪亚斯·奥尔达斯想到这一点也会头疼，但我们必须面对事实。让卡洛斯·马德拉索担任全国执行委员会主席可能并不是一个对我们有利的好主意。他的行动已经远远超出了我们的预料，他也不理会我们的诉求。我们现在必须挫败他那不切实际的计划了，以免革命制度党的存在本身都受到质疑。\n\n马德拉索的反腐行动必须被遏制，从原则上来说反腐行动并没有什么问题，但确实也在瓦解革命制度党的根基。什么样的反腐措施会让州长不得不与一群有行动力，有跳动脉搏并且佩戴革命制度党党徽的人进行搏斗？为什么他让初选看起来如此混乱，以至于荣冠战争都看起来那么和平？马德拉索必须离开全国执行委员会——在他后悔之前。"
 MEX_assigned_to_antartica: "发配深南州"
 MEX_assigned_to_antartica_desc: "不知何故，尽管屡遭失败、羞辱和打压，萨利纳斯领导下的亲日技官集团仍然阴魂不散地待在奥尔达斯的政府里。不能再这样下去了，最好找到某种能一劳永逸消灭这种威胁的办法。\n\n让我们把萨利纳斯和他的盟友发配到远离他们权力根基的政治死地——深南腹地里去。他们的技能大可领导我国走向经济奇迹，但他们永远无法从中取得政治利益。他们将亲身体会到“有责任、没权力，太监就该这么地”这句格言的含义。"
 MEX_the_olympian_spirit: "奥运精神"
 MEX_the_olympian_spirit_desc: "奥林匹克运动会，洛佩斯·马特奥斯总统曾为之殚精竭虑的非凡盛会，即将于1968年来到墨西哥。确实，现在才到六十年代中期，但现在也是开始制定计划和准备赛场的最佳时机。\n\n我们不能浪费时间，奥运盛事恰可一箭双雕：一方面，我们要向广大的世界展现墨西哥的荣耀；另一方面，我们还要向马特奥斯总统的心血和功绩致敬。"
 MEX_Ordaz_japanese_technicans: "日本技工"
 MEX_Ordaz_japanese_technicans_desc: "我们不会信任日本帝国主义政权，但直接跟他们一刀两断也未免太过愚蠢了。要牢记，我们不能随随便便寻衅于人。那我们就给他们点甜头吧。\n\n日本人以精通工程学和勤奋著称，这点连美国人和德国人都相形见绌。邀请日本工程师来我国工作有助于改善场馆的建设，说不定还能让它们在奥运会结束后派上其他用途。"
 MEX_american_contracts: "美国合同"
 MEX_american_contracts_desc: "我们不会信任日本帝国主义政权，这一点不言自明。将如此重要且庞大的项目交给不可信任的国家，某些人脑子是不是坏了？我们不能像萨利纳斯那帮愚蠢的技术官僚一样冒险。\n\n我们要信任的是美国人，“老美利坚人的技术和脑子”不是开玩笑的。美国人的专业知识和勤奋将足以满足我们的需求。"
 MEX_mateos_dream: "马特奥斯的梦想"
 MEX_mateos_dream_desc: "洛佩斯·马特奥斯总统为墨西哥申办奥运会倾注了热血、汗水和泪水。在为墨西哥人民巩固繁荣和维护革命制度带来的福祉之外，申奥是他最伟大的工作，也是他最引以为傲的工作。\n\n洛佩斯·马特奥斯的梦想，是在他的国家举办一届成功的奥运会。我们将坚持他的梦想。为了他为墨西哥、为党、为奥尔达斯总统个人所做的一切，我们欠他太多太多。"
 MEX_practical_realities: "现实状况"
 MEX_practical_realities_desc: "是的，如果我们能在1968年举行一次成功的奥林匹克运动会，其带来的好处自然是无穷的。是的，我们也知道这是阿道弗·洛佩斯·马特奥斯最宏大的梦想和最野心勃勃的计划。不过，一个幽灵，一个名为“成本”的幽灵在我们的预算薄和计划书上游荡，如果不能妥善的处置预算和成本的平衡，那么毁灭也离我们不远了。显然我们决不能为了个人野心将国家推向破产的边缘，无论这个人再怎么伟大也不行。\n\n我们必须稳步、谨慎地规划一届成功的奥运会。当然我们会与洛佩斯·马特奥斯合作来实现这一目标，但我们不会把一切决策都托付与他。"
 MEX_envy_of_the_world: "世人艳羡"
 MEX_envy_of_the_world_desc: "第十九届奥林匹克运动会将成为墨西哥合众国的象征，向广阔无垠的世界展示墨西哥的文化、工业和创新。现在只有傻子才不明白我们可以通过这个机会获得不可胜数的好处。财富和威望将从奥运五环中应运而生，如同硕果生于树上。\n\n墨西哥将尽可能地利用奥林匹克运动会的形象为国家吸引更多投资。"
 MEX_a_matter_of_honour: "事关荣誉"
 MEX_a_matter_of_honour_desc: "难道我们要坐在这当乌龟吗？对军营搞突袭，简直奇耻大辱！自基督战争结束以来，这还是头一次有人进攻联邦军队的军事基地，绝对不能再容忍了，这简直是对共和国总统荣誉的侮辱，冲到脸上挑衅奥尔达斯！\n\n忍无可忍，无需再忍。让墨西哥人民在场佐证：一切叛乱都将被碾碎。不惜一切代价，恢复法治秩序。一切生事滋乱，绝不容许。"
 MEX_an_orderly_start: "秩序之始"
 MEX_an_orderly_start_desc: "这些天政府的气氛不错。今年到目前为止过得都挺好的。政府改革进行得很顺利，革命制度党团结在我们身后。股票被卖出，媒体被摆平，中产阶级准备接受我们合法统治的又一个时期。\n\n万事顺利，无需多疑。墨西哥合众国正在前进——在迪亚斯·奥尔达斯总统的指挥之下，稳定和繁荣正等待着我们。"
 MEX_disciplines_virtue: "规训是美德"
 MEX_disciplines_virtue_desc: "“人天生便喜好利益。若沉溺其中，则纷争矛盾随之产生，同样与生俱来的谦逊与退让之心便消失无踪。人生而有嫉妒与憎恨之情，一旦放纵这些情绪，便会走上烧杀抢掠的邪路，同样与生俱来的忠诚与信义之心也将荡然无存。”\n\n在今日的墨西哥，不忠不义之人发起了公共抗议活动，他们沉溺于争斗和嫉憎，只为一己私欲。这些傻子叛徒不为墨西哥利益出力，反而还大肆谩骂攻击。更糟糕的是，他们还从那劳什子“人民游击队烈士”那里汲取灵感。我们不会再容忍了：立即加强对叛徒分子的司法惩治活动。"
 MEX_its_bedtime: "睡觉时间"
 MEX_its_bedtime_desc: "我们做得还远远不够。医生们被送回了医院，但他们的忤逆行径却鼓舞了其他抗议团体。现在，学生走出校园，跟医务人员一样参与抗议活动，大学为之一空。他们试图组建学生会，与大学及政府进行谈判——这简直是荒谬至极。\n\n根据政府法令与教育部指示，必须制止颠覆分子通过从事反政府活动来破坏墨西哥教育机构稳定的企图。实施强制宵禁令和抗议禁止令。派出警察和掷弹兵执行上述保护措施，就跟之前对医院采取的措施一样。"
 MEX_hands_dirtier: "血雨腥风"
 MEX_hands_dirtier_desc: "叛逆之风愈演愈烈，如今局势正如那四字成语：“四面楚歌”。对我们合法统治、对革命制度党施政的反抗正如野火般蔓延；我们所做的努力显然不够。政治局势瞬息万变，可能会失去控制。\n\n我们得动真格的了，即使双手沾满泥土和鲜血，也要保住墨西哥与总统的未来。必须将敌人彻底粉碎，赢来更美好的明天——一旦让他们取得胜利，我们将面临无可企及的恐怖。"
 MEX_Ordaz.2.t:0 "马德拉索对革命制度党的致辞"
 MEX_Ordaz.2.desc:0 "奥尔达斯总统的就职典礼才过去一周，马德拉索又带着他那数十年如一日的不倦精力走上党大会的演讲台。总统在前排微微点头，这股年轻与激情将给革命制度党注入活力，这就是他推举马德拉索执掌全国执行委员会的原因。\n\n马德拉索突然扯开麦克风，大步走向讲台边缘，盯着攒动的人群，一言不发。“如今，”他开口了，“党就在我面前，制度就在我面前。”\n\n“但革命去哪了！”南方气旋咆哮道，“我所看到的是一张张衰老不堪的面庞和一双双暮气沉沉的眼睛，还有一房间自以为三十年前就大功告成的人！满目都是靓丽的服饰与漂亮的手表，而这些都是你们不知廉耻地从墨西哥工农手中贪来的！全是只知取悦上头的奴才和马屁精，毫无为人民服务之心。我所看到的就！是！你。”\n\n如果马德拉索能注意到奥尔达斯，他就会看到张震惊又苍白的脸。太过分了，这和谈好的不一样，必须在——\n\n“所以，我明白了，我作为党领导的使命何在。当务之急就是恢复我党的革命精神，我很清楚该怎么做。我们将立即展开常态化的突击腐败审查，此外为了落实你们严重不到位的问责制，我们将开展党内选举，以此决定各职位的候选……”\n\n马德拉索仍喋喋不休，完全无视了党员们惊恐的表情。奥尔达斯的愤懑蔓延全身，他攥紧双拳，汗如雨下，浸透了他的衬衫。不能再这样了。"

 MEX_Ordaz.57.desc: "Smoke filled the room as party members moved about, taking whatever food and refreshments were available on the side table arrayed for their pleasure as the last speaker moved from the podium. His speech had been welcomed by polite applause, but nothing more as he spoke on some vapid ideal or another which he had hoped would get him one step further along in the party. Del Rosal had given applause all the same, albeit with a face as cold as stone, just as it was for most of the speakers.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he could see Ernesto Uruchurtu Peralta making his way to the podium. The \"Iron Regent\", or in more proper terms, the former Chief of the Federal District. Most of del Rosal's gaze was directed at the clock hanging on the wall, which showed how much time was left in this party meeting. He had far more important things to worry about than what some bureaucrats thought ought to be done about this country. But he still had an hour left, and so he returned his attention to Uruchurtu.\n\n\"-is an unprecedented and uncontrolled migration from the rural areas of our country into our capital city, at a rate which is wholly unsustainable for both the city and its government,\" Uruchurtu spoke with vigor. \"There are vast swathes of lost cities and invasions into the Federal District that have begun to serve as crime dens for our most disreputable and degenerate, labeled as so-called slums. Yet most of all, it has dirtied the streets of our once-grand capital as squatters fill public parks and streets throughout the city. These vagrants are a risk to the safety of our citizens and must be dealt with swiftly before the world descends for our Olympic games.\"\n\nDel Rosal could not have been more shocked. How did Uruchurtu have the audacity to complain with such fervor when he had played a part in causing the very problem? And what precisely was he suggesting by talking of this here? His shock turned to anger. Now this had to be dealt with, and swiftly."

 MEX_Ordaz.58.desc: "Ordaz watched from the foyer as the three men's cars pulled up into the driveway of the Los Pinos presidential residence, greeted one another, before making for the entrance. Good, he thought. As soon as they had a solution to this problem his administration could move on to more important matters.\n\nOrdaz began to speak as he ushered them in, \"Welcome, Secretaries. You all know why I called you here; we must deal with Uruchurtu and the points that he has raised at the party meeting. It is a known issue now, and if we don't solve it then we will look weak. So, gentlemen, what are your solutions?\"\n\nDel Rosal wasted no time answering. \"Secretary Echeverría must reprimand Uruchurtu for this speech. He has overstepped his authority.\"\n\n\"General, while I respect your opinion,\" Echeverría quickly interjected, \"I must point out that Uruchurtu does have a point. CDMX security is in desperate need of funding and manpower. I believe that we can solve some of the issues he has raised in such a way that aids, not hurts, our public image.\"\n\nOrdaz's attention turned towards Manautou. \"And you, Secretary? What are your thoughts?\"\n\nManautou took a moment to ponder, before he finally replied, \"I believe subtler methods are required, rather than filling the streets with more police which may only further inflame the problem. Security may help stem some problems, but it cannot be the only solution. A softer touch is required.\"\n\nOrdaz glanced from one man to the next, considering each of their proposals. This problem could not be made to grow into a roadblock for his administrations' goals, he knew that for sure. Which made the answer all the more obvious to him."

It was late and most of the other employees had gone home for the night, leaving just a few to clean up the last of the day's work before heading home.\n\n\"But you did hear about it, right?\" Elias asked in a much softer tone. After seeing Ramón's nod, he continued, \"It was quite stern too, from what I heard. A lot of threats were thrown around if you believe some of the gossip.\" The two of them, having finished with one of the boxes, hoisted it up onto a shelf before pulling out another box to begin sorting once more.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if we believe the gossip or not, Elias,\" Ramón said just as he glanced over his shoulder to check one more time. \"Talking about this sort of thing will only get us into trouble too.\"\n\n\"But he was complaining about things that are true!

We have to just keep our heads down, stay quiet, and not flag these problems in our reports or else you and I will be in for a much stronger reaction than Uruchurtu ever got.

What would you suggest we do?\"\n\nWith an ominous grin, Echeverría launched into his proposal. \"The slums springing up around the city are a major blindspot for existing law enforcement. Establishing a police presence in these areas, with assistance from the DFS, will close that gap.\"\n\nAs Ordaz nodded his head, Manautou realized the President was not in the mood for non-security based solutions and held his tongue. Del Rosal, meanwhile, quickly found fault with the Secretary of the Interior's plan.\n\n\"Policing the slums will spread our forces very thin, and would be counterproductive. Remember that these are illegal land invasions, not official delegations of the District. We should increase policing in the city center and other important areas.\"\n\nEcheverría gave del Rosal a side-eye. \"General, are you really content to leave these lost cities unpoliced?\"\n\n\"I think we should be protecting the places where crime does the most damage. If that means the slums are neglected, so be it.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Ordaz said, cutting the discussion short. \"You've both made your points, but we can only commit to one course of action.

What do you suggest?\"\n\nManautou smiled brightly. \"There are things we can do to mitigate the effects of rural migration here, but we'd only be treating a symptom. Peasants are leaving the countryside in record numbers, and there's no way Mexico City can absorb them all. We need to redirect migrants towards other cities that are better equipped to handle the influx.\"\n\nAs Ordaz listened intently, Echeverría realized his ideas were not favored and quietly bowed out of the conversation. Del Rosal, on the other hand, felt the President's attention slipping away and tried to wrest it back.\n\n\"Diverting migrants to other cities isn't going to work,\" he said hastily, \"Mexico City is the heart of the nation and the best place to find work, that's why so many peasants have come here already. We should use our resources to expand public housing developments, so that new arrivals won't be forced into land invasions.\"\n\n\"I understand your point, General,\" Manautou said with a raised eyebrow, \"but are you sure the Federal District has enough resources to expand public housing on this scale?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"I'll see to it personally.\"\n\nBoth men looked towards the President, who had remained silent.

He'd hoped to find a job and an apartment quickly, but had not been quite so lucky. Ignoring the pangs of hunger in his stomach, he trudged along down a side street. At last he came across a small park with firm wooden benches. Curling up in an attempt to stay warm, he laid his head down and drifted off.\n\nA couple of hours later Alberto awoke suddenly. He realized his head was covered by some kind of cloth or sack. When he moved to pull it off he was struck hard in the chest, knocking the wind out of him. He was then grabbed and thrown onto a hard metal floor.\n\nHe felt hard, jerking motion and realized he must be in a vehicle. He tried to get up but was struck again, this time in the head. It felt like the tip of a hard boot. He was hit over and over again by multiple assailants, until the pain blotted out his hunger and fatigue.\n\nAt last the vehicle stopped, his head covering was removed and he was pushed out onto the street. As his eyes adjusted he surveyed the dingy, ramshackle buildings around him. Was this still Mexico City? If so it was a part he'd never seen before.\n\nHe turned around and was momentarily blinded by a flashlight. He couldn't see his assailants' faces through the glare, but they were wearing police uniforms.\n\n\"If you know what's good for you,\" yelled one of them, \"You won't come back!\" With that, they closed the van door and sped off into the night."

Finally escaping endless hours of work in the fields of Guanajuato, trading it all for an exciting life in the capital. Eventually he just couldn't take waiting any longer and decided to set off, with no plan and no savings.\n\nAs Marco got into line at the ticket booth, he busied himself looking at the posters adorning the dusty walls. Most of them were old and faded, but a newer one printed in bright colors stood out.\n\nBIENVENIDOS A GUADALAJARA — Now offering reduced fares for all travelers!\n\nMarco read the listed price and gasped. It was less than half the cost of a ticket to the Federal District. If he decided to go there instead...\n\nNo, he thought, he couldn't.

His office's conference room had been taken over by the Department of the Federal District's public housing planning staff. Each building concept shown was in the modernist style that was so popular nowadays. Del Rosal had used the public housing programs' impressive budget to hire the best architects that money could buy. The ones his staff had found were all idealists. They wanted to create housing which embodied the Revolution itself. Apparently, modernism did this by moving away from old-fashioned bourgeois styles and instead focused on function over form. Del Rosal watched silently as the excited architects unfurled a large sheet of paper. \"While sufficient individually. Together, they can form a complex that supports itself. A city within the city.\"\n\n\"What about this area here?\" Del Rosal placed a single sturdy finger on a large empty plot in the middle of the layout.\n\n\"We believe that could be used as a communal green space for the residents to enjoy.\" One of the staffers replied with a self-satisfying grin.\n\n\"Remove it. The people need housing, not a park.\" Del Rosal eyed the architects and his staffers. All excitement had left the room, but no one objected. They could be as disappointed as they liked, but Del Rosal had a job to do. Unlike them, he was the head of the nation's capital. They did not understand the burden.

 MEX_Ordaz.74.t: "Grand Projects"
 MEX_Ordaz.74.desc: "At an upscale restaurant in La Condesa, President Ordaz was enjoying dinner with his wife Guadalupe. It was a rare evening alone for the couple, with no presidential duties to attend to and all of their children busy elsewhere.\n\n\"...and after the cabinet meeting,\" Ordaz droned on, \"I sat down with Torres Landa, the Governor of Guanajuato. He reported on his pet project, 'Plan Guanajuato,' to develop infrastructure and build an industrial corridor. I'll admit, I was impressed.\"\n\nGuadalupe smiled, not at all surprised that her husband was still talking about his work. \"You shouldn't let a governor outshine you, dear. There are plenty of major infrastructure projects left undone. For example, this city still lacks a metro system.\"\n\n\"A metro system in Mexico City?\" Ordaz asked, scratching his chin, \"It's certainly grandiose, yet I'm not sure that it's feasible.\"\n\n\"But it is feasible. The civil engineering firm Empresas ICA — my brothers work there, remember? — has a proposal for just such a system. They say it will dramatically reduce traffic, and construction could be completed before the Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe President was intrigued. Giving the capital a metro system would be a major victory for his administration, especially if it was finished before the Olympics. He vaguely recalled the idea being raised during López Mateos' term, but opposition from the Federal District's Regent had defeated it. Ordaz resolved to look into the matter himself."

 MEX_Ordaz.75.desc: "\"Licenciado Uruchurtu,\" Ordaz began, \"please, have a seat.\"\n\nThe Regent of the Federal District studied the man across from him. The President was an ugly specimen, lacking in both charisma and imagination. His deficiencies as a leader were one of the many reasons Uruchurtu had supported Salinas Lozano's presidential bid.\n\n\"As you know, Mexico City will be hosting the Olympic Games in 1968, and the district will need more modern infrastructure to accommodate them. I believe it is time to build a metro system.\"\n\nUruchurtu scowled, his default reaction whenever a metro was mentioned. \"Your Excellency, I must caution against this idea. The Federal District cannot afford a metro, and it is not the most effective way to reduce traffic.\"\n\n\"I think you're mistaken. I've read the ICA report myself, and their models for traffic reduction seem reliable. As for the cost,\" Ordaz smiled, \"you don't need to worry. I will support the construction with as much federal funding as necessary.\"\n\nThe President thought this offer was generous, but Uruchurtu remained unconvinced. After years of opposing the metro, his reputation was on the line, and he had a duty to protect his allies in the transport unions. \"I'm sorry Your Excellency, I cannot support any proposal that includes a metro system.\"\n\nOrdaz's smile vanished. Giving his defiant subordinate a stern look, he replied, \"If that's all you have to say, you may leave.\""

I am going to get rid of him, I just need to know how.\"\n\n\"Your Excellency, if I may,\" said Emilio Martínez Manautou, Secretary of the Presidency, \"For all his faults, Uruchurtu has served the party loyally for many years. We could offer him a promotion to some other office, where he cannot interfere.\"\n\n\"A reward hardly seems appropriate for someone so insubordinate,\" Luis Echeverría, Secretary of the Interior interjected, \"What we should do is have the DFS dig up some dirt on Uruchurtu. Then we confront him with his dirty laundry and force him to resign quietly.\"\n\nManautou turned pale at this suggestion. \"With all due respect, Secretary Echeverría, can you think of something less... immoral?\"\n\nEcheverría thought for a moment. \"There's an even simpler solution: the Regent needs support from the city's transport unions to keep things running smoothly. If we pull a few strings and get them to strike, we can tarnish his image. That would justify a dismissal.\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Ordaz said suddenly, \"All of your ideas have merit, but we only need one plan. I will make the final decision.\""

It's a sufficiently prestigious post that will keep him far away from domestic politics.\"\n\n\"It is prestigious,\" countered Emilio Martínez Manautou, \"but I don't think the inflexible Iron Regent will make a good diplomat.\"\n\nEcheverría wanted to say, \"That's never stopped us before,\" but held his tongue. Instead, he replied with, \"What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"Something that will make use of his obvious talent for construction and planning. Perhaps a post at the agency for Federal Roads and Bridges? CAPUFE could use a man with his experience.\"\n\nOrdaz was silent, his face scrunched in thought. At length, he relaxed and said, \"You've both given me good options, but I've decided to...\""

His opinion of the President had reached a new low. \"Your Excellency,\" he replied through gritted teeth, \"I see what this is.\"\n\nOrdaz raised an eyebrow. \"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"This 'promotion' is little more than an insult. You're trying to force me out!\" Uruchurtu said, almost yelling, \"You want me gone so you can destroy everything I've built here in the Federal District. Sorry, but it's not going to work. Mexico City is where I belong.\"\n\n\"You dare defy me again!?\" Ordaz growled. His face contorted into a frightening visage. For a moment he seemed ready to explode right back at Uruchurtu.\n\nBut the moment passed. Ordaz's rage cooled into a harder, more dispassionate contempt.\n\n\"You're dismissed from office, effective immediately. There will be no promotion. So long as I'm president you'll never receive another government job. Not even post office clerk.\""

 MEX_Ordaz.79.desc: "Ernesto Uruchurtu stared out of his office window at the people milling about in the Zócalo. Watching scenes of urban activity used to be pleasant, but now he felt only a deep melancholy. These people, and this city, were no longer his.\n\n\"I've finished sorting through your files,\" said a secretary from the doorway, \"Do you need help packing up the things in here?\"\n\n\"No thank you, I will handle it.\"\n\nIn truth, Uruchurtu had barely started packing, his mind was elsewhere. He didn't regret blowing up at the President; Ordaz was a fool and his so-called 'promotion' didn't interest Uruchurtu in the slightest. Yet after nearly 13 years in charge of the Federal District, he wasn't prepared to say goodbye.\n\nHis desk was strewn with documents: plans for beautiful new parks, for boulevards lined with flower beds, and for countless other public works. There was a whole file on infrastructure that could reduce traffic without the need for that infernal metro. With his departure none of it would ever see the light of day.\n\nAs he reflected on his long tenure, he realized the title \"Iron Regent\" had been misleading. He had wielded immense power only when the President supported him. Now the President wanted him gone, and all his ambitions had shattered like glass."

After over a decade in office something improper is bound to crop up, and that would be enough to justify dismissal.\"\n\n\"Sure, we'll probably find something,\"  Luis Echeverría countered, \"but it might not be damning enough.\"\n\n\"Well then, Secretary Echeverría,\" Manautou huffed, \"what would you suggest?\"\n\nEcheverría grinned. \"We should investigate his private life. The Iron Regent's public image is that of a staunch social conservative. If we uncover just one trip to a brothel, his coalition could come undone.\"\n\nManautou found this idea disgusting, but did not voice a response. The choice was in the President's hands, and he trusted Ordaz to make the right decision.\n\n\"Thank you for your counsel, gentlemen.\" Ordaz said at length, \"In the end, I believe the best course of action...\""

A select group of construction firms were given the majority of contracts for roads, parks, beautification schemes and public housing units, despite strong competing bids for other firms.\n\nIn some cases, contracts were awarded before other firms had an opportunity to submit competing bids. The select firms repaid this preferential treatment with financial kickbacks and personal favors for Uruchurtu and his associates.\n\nAdmittedly this form of corruption is not exceptional or even uncommon.

The guests of honor will be my cabinet secretaries, the party leadership and all living former presidents.\"\n\nAs she heard the last part Guadalupe frowned. \"Will the wives of former presidents be invited as well?\"\n\n\"Of course, why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well, at our last meeting Eva Sámano was very rude to me.\"\n\nOrdaz smiled sympathetically. \"I'm sorry dear, I didn't know.

López Mateos wasn't exactly close with his wife; in fact Ordaz knew the ex-President had been pursuing other women for years. Still, Adolfo needed to maintain his public image.

Undeterred, he approached the First Family with a confident smile.\n\n\"Unfortunately Eva couldn't be here tonight,\" he said aloud, \"she's at a planning meeting for a school she's helping start in Coyoacán. You'll have to make due with just me.\"\n\nWith all the guests present, festivities commenced inside the castle. The evening proceeded smoothly, with everyone enjoying a full-course dinner and making polite conversation. As the event wound down and groups began to wander off, Ordaz pulled López Mateos aside.\n\n\"Adolfo, I'm sorry for asking you to come alone-\"\n\n\"Gustavo, please, there is no need.

Their husbands repeatedly tried drawing them into a shared conversation, to no avail.\n\n\"Well Adolfo, at least the dinner's over now.

She was filling a fiberglass suitcase with clothes from a tall pile in the corner. Lupita was going north. Two of her friends who were at the protest outside the hospital had already been arrested and charged with Social Dissolution. She would not be joining them.\n\nLupita glanced at the train schedule on her nightstand one last time. If there were no delays, she would make it to Eagle Pass before sundown. She hefted the suitcase off the bed and made for the front door. Standing at the entrance, she rifled through her purse to make sure everything was there. Oh no. Her passport was gone. She dropped the suitcase and darted back through the kitchen to her bedroom.\n\nTears welled in her eyes as she dug through the pile of clothes. It wasn't there. She started pulling drawers on her dresser at random. All empty. She wiped the tears from her eyes, and started checking under furniture. The dresser? Nothing. Nightstand? No. Under the bed? Something glimmered under a discarded blouse. She snatched it up. It was a blue book with an eagle devouring a snake stamped on the cover in gold foil. She hugged the passport to her chest and put it in her bag.\n\nLupita grabbed her suitcase from its place by the door and stepped outside. It was a beautiful day. Clear blue sky. Quiet and warm. A slight breeze tousled her hair. She had only gone half a block when a blue and white Dodge came roaring down the street. It stopped in front of her with a horrible screech. Her body went numb. The suitcase slipped from her limp fingers and fell to the ground with a thud."

A smiling devil that delighted in torment? No. Lupita had never seen any expression on the old bastard's face other than a stern glare. The creature on the bench staring down at her was not one capable of empathy, or any emotion other than paternal fury.\n\n\"You and your accomplices have spent months conducting inflammatory demonstrations, disturbing public order, and attempting to spread your insurgent labor movement across the nation. For the crime of social dissolution, you will be sentenced to six years in prison.\"\n\nThe world around Lupita receded away from her. It felt like she was watching the courtroom through binoculars from somewhere in the back of her skull. She wanted to scream or cry or do something, anything. No noise escaped her mouth. She blinked back tears.\n\nCameras flashed as police men approached the defendant's table. Anger surged in the gallery. The judge slammed the gavel on the bench. The only sound left were sobs from her parents. The policemen shepherded Lupita out of the courtroom."

Can you imagine rioting like this when we were kids?\" PEMEX director Jesús Reyes Heroles heard prospective IMP head Javier Barros Sierra's tinny laugh through his worn phone headset. The two men were discussing the recent National Autonomous University of Mexico student strike. \"But they're good kids. I appreciate their passion even if it can be misplaced at times.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something to watch, Javier. It's a shame that the rector had to resign. I suppose that's what you get for not being able to control your students.\" With his free hand, Heroles took a sip of his coffee. He jerked the cup away from his mouth, cold. He had waited too long and had wasted a perfectly good drink. He sat the coffee down on his desk next to some building plans.\n\nThere was a long pause before Sierra began speaking again. \"Jesús, The UNAM governing board called me yesterday. They are offering me the job of rector. I'm sorry, but I'm going to take it. I appreciate you thinking of me for the IMP job.\"\n\nAnother pause weighed heavily on the conversation before Heroles was able to respond. He held his tongue and silently regained his composure. If Sierra could see him, he would not be able to hide his anger so well. \"Congratulations, Sierra. I'm sure you'll make a great leader for those kids. Listen, I got to go. Speak with you soon.\"\n\nBefore Sierra could respond, Heroles slammed down his phone receiver. The force knocked over his coffee cup, ruining his IMP plans.

Once they reached the safety of the hallway, the smiles vanished from their faces.\n\n\"We can sign as many papers as we want,\" said one of the Venezuelans, \"none of it will change the fact that Trujillo is still living. We should have made him pay for what he did to Betancourt and the legion.\"\n\n\"It's a damn shame,\" ambassador Rodríguez agreed. A gloomy silence hung in the corridor. The ambassador was the one to break it. \"Before the war,\" he began, \"I was the ambassador to France. I was to continue my predecessor's assignment: assisting Spanish republican exiles who wished to immigrate to Mexico. Then France fell to the fascists in six weeks. The exiles, many of them Jewish, found their lives to be in great danger.\"\n\n\"I moved the legation to Vichy, and I was able to negotiate for their unrestricted departure. A few thousand were able to flee. Many thousands more could not. Those who arrived in Mexico had lost everything for the second time in a decade. But they carried on. Now, many have made good lives for them and their children. I could not save them all. But if I had returned home after the fall of France, many thousands more would have perished.

That lasted until the miller's union demanded due money he didn't have. He'd worked a series of odd jobs and been dismissed just as quickly until he was hired by La Gloria restaurant, where he'd become the food buyer.\n\nThe restaurant owner was good to him, and he repaid that kindness by never missing a day of work. It was the kind of honest living that suited him just fine.

Did Ordaz seriously expect him to give up his life in the capital for some mud hut in the Yucatán, just because he'd been ordered to? If so, the new President was far duller than he'd ever imagined.\n\nHe opened his desk and pulled out a new document: an application for a professorship at UNAM, one of many universities that would be eager to add him to their faculty. Going back to academia was never part of the plan, but with Ordaz trying to send him into exile it was the best option available.\n\nAnd, he reminded himself, most likely a temporary setback. After Ordaz's sexenio there would be other presidents. Men who didn't just bury their heads in the sand, men with vision who would seek Salinas' council. He might even have another shot at the presidency-\n\n\"Father?\" said his eldest son Raúl, \"Carlos and I are going to the movies, would you like to join us?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.

We did have a meeting scheduled for today, didn't we?\" Mateos peered up at the current president, his former protegee. Red blotches marked his face from having his head in his hands. His desk was a mess of documents, plans, and medicine. \"I had some plans for you to look at.\" Mateos shuffled some pages around his desk before grabbing a folder. \"The committee has been crafting some really fantastic ideas. You should see them.\" Under his pained eyes, Mateos managed to flash his well-practiced smile. Ordaz almost recognized the optimistic grin Mateos flashed him six years ago when his turn as president started. \"I must apologize that I do not have more for you at this moment. We are behind schedule already. There is just so much to do.\" Mateos rubbed his brow. \"It has to be perfect. For the people.\"\n\n\"Of course. We still have time.\" Ordaz opened the shaded blinds, letting some brightness into the dark office. Outside the window, misty rain, born from the humid heat, clung to the city. Ordaz was saddened to see his mentor, his friend, in this light. Mateos had spent his best years fighting for the Mexican people. Fighting for a romantic dream that only he saw. Ultimately, he fought too hard and was now paying the price. Ordaz wondered if the price was worth it. Was this to be his fate if he pushed as hard as Mateos?

Now, it was Preciado's turn. \"Located within the folders in front of you is a comprehensive plan to address the difficulties currently facing our rural population.\" He quickly glanced as the men lazily opened their identical folders. \"So far, this administration has made many great strides in industrialization, but I fear that our progress in that regard has blinded us to the people of the countryside. With some key investments and a renewed focus on agriculture, I believe we can reverse many of the persistent troubles our large rural population faces.\"\n\n\"Very good Preciado.\" Ordaz said before the secretary could continue. He opened the first page of the pile and skimmed it. Of course, Ordaz had already read the proposal's key points; he wouldn't allow such an extensive government program to be presented to his cabinet without at least some prior approval, whether Preciado knew it or not. \"I appreciate the hard work you and your team have put in on this matter.\" Ordaz closed the folder, ending his consideration. The rest of the men followed suit with a wave of folding paper. \"I will leave this with my team, and we will decide whether or not to implement it as written,\" Ordaz concluded the topic by handing the papers off to a nearby assistant.\n\nPreciado remained standing. All eyes were on him. Despite all the notes and data he had labored to prepare for this meeting, the discussion was now closed. All he could muster was a \"Thank you, sir\" before sitting again."

His heart raced, and a shiver ran down his spine as he feared the worst. The rhythmic beat of his ceiling fan guided him to his bedroom, where he found everything in its place. Yet on his bedside desk, his radio was playing music with sounds as small as its 'made in Guangdong' inscription.\n\nFerdinand turned the dial to his radio slightly until he felt the satisfying click of the off position.

After all he was merely their representative in the National Union of Social Security Workers, which is in turn part of the Federation of State Workers Unions (FSTSE), which in turn is part of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP).\n\n\"It's not a performance; we expressed the truth in moral and legal arguments, and the rest will work itself out. Hopefully.\" His partner responded with his cigarette hanging limply from his hand. As medically trained professionals, they knew that they probably shouldn't be smoking so much. They've both read the recent reports about their danger, but it hasn't stopped them. The PRI itself was like the addictive stick. Despite its danger, It had been around for so long that, at this point, it was basically impossible to achieve anything without it. \"We will do whatever we can to succeed. If that means going through the state, then so be it.\""

 MEX_Ordaz_DS.17.desc: "\"In conclusion, while they pushed on some aspects of our demands, they seemed receptive to our cooperation with them.\" An AMMRI delegate from the 20 de November Hospital relayed his encounter to his colleagues. Unlike sanctioned unions, their discussions with the PRI are far more unproven. The disenfranchised healthcare workers listened attentively as they sipped and stirred at early morning coffee. \"It seems like our movement is working, and the more pressure we put on, the more likely we will be able to push the PRI beast into submission. I propose that in future meetings, we redouble our focus on massively increasing working and housing conditions, raises, and a total rework of the intern organization structure.\"\n\nA polite round of applause echoed in the impromptu conference room. The Mexican medical residents and interns were dedicated, well-educated, and organized; there was no way they couldn't succeed. With peace or pressure, the PRI would realize it and give them a victory the whole country would see. The assembled delegates chatted aimlessly as they waited for the next speaker to give a report. Before that could happen, a distressed man burst into the room with a large stack of newspapers.\n\n\"The paper's just come in! You guys are going to want to read this.\" The pile of newspapers was split and disseminated around the association. An angry face appears with each pair of eyes that read that day's headline.\n\n'Doctors' Union demands small raise; emphasizes PRI cooperation.'\n\nAngry voices bounce around the room and push toward the previous speaker, who musters the courage to stand and join in the anger so that he might redirect it. \"This is a complete miscarriage of the truth! The PRI and their so-called 'journals' wish to co-opt our movement for their gain. We cannot let them. They will get what they deserve and we shall take what is rightfully ours!\""

 MEX_Ordaz_DS.18.desc: "\"...Furthermore, the salaries of doctors and resident interns shall be raised by seven percent.\" The room exploded into chaos. The chairman of the AMM folded the letter and placed it back into its envelope. He would give them time to weigh their options before a decision was made.\n\nSomewhere in the turmoil, Dr. Soliño beamed. Her family in Leon would never know want or hunger. She turned to Emilio, a young intern from the Federal District she had met during the previous work stoppage.\n\n\"Isn't this wonderful? I can't believe it! We won!\" She pulled him into a tight hug before realizing he did not share her joy.\n\n\"This is about more than just pay now, Dr. Soliño,\" Emilio retorted. \"We need to keep the strike going until they recognize our union if we want to keep any of the gains we've made.\" Dr. Soliño's smile faded.\n\n\"We need to be willing to negotiate, Emilio.\"\n\n\"So we just roll over and take their offer? We need to guarantee fair representation in the future.\"\n\n\"We won't have any representation if Ordaz thinks we'll never be satisfied!\" Dr. Soliño snapped."

Both men had approved of the president's plan to deploy military doctors to fill the gaps left by the strikers. They differed on the specifics. The unfortunate truth was that they did not have enough men to be everywhere at once. A single strategy would have to be chosen.\n\n\"Deploying the bulk of the doctors to the 20 de November Hospital will be the most effective strategy.\" The gaunt ISSTE director explained to the president. \"The Hospital is a symbol of the movement and it has served as an incubator of unrest ever since. Forcibly restoring services there during the strike will be a major blow to the dissidents.\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" began the steely-haired IMSS man, \"Focusing too much on one hospital means leaving the rest out to dry. Spreading the military doctors more evenly throughout the nation would bleed support for the AMM outside of the Federal District, and give us an opportunity to contain the movement in the capital.\""

His hands clutched the pole of the banner tighter as he came face to face with one of the uniformed goons. The soldier tore the banner from his hands before delivering a brutal left hook, sending the doctor stumbling to the ground.\n\nAfter a time, he stood and massaged his head. The soldiers had already battered their way through the crowd, and had entered the building. It didn't take long for them to start dragging out the skeleton crew of doctors maintaining basic services. All the while, a growing crowd of reporters watched them like vultures circling a corpse.\n\nDr. Jareño did not attend the picket line the next day. He had no desire to risk his health and freedom marching brazenly in front of the army. On his way to the grocery store, he stopped to pick up today's paper from a stand. The front page of El Universal caught his eye immediately.\n\nTHE ARMY RESTORES MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE. Below the headline, a smiling soldier administered a syringe full of medication to a patient. The article went on and on, describing the heroic deeds of the soldiers, treating patients when doctors refused to. \"Hey!\" The woman running the stand knocked on the counter in front of the doctor. \"Buy it or put it back.\""

 MEX_Ordaz_DS.14.desc: "After a long day of leading strikes, medical intern Ferdinand carefully unlocked the front door to his vecindad apartment with heavy eyes. It wasn't much to speak of, but it was his, and it was centrally located on the checkerboard block of Mexico City, so he could get around quickly. As soon as he entered, he placed his bag, coat, and shoes in their designated spot. Ferdinand was only ever a couple of steps from anywhere in his home, so everything had to be in its place for any sense of organization. The divide between the kitchen and living room was more loose suggestion than distinct rooms.\n\nOnce he had shed the burdens of the outside world, Ferdinand made a beeline for his functional kitchen. A headache pounded dully against his skull, like being tapped by a rubber mallet. The grueling hours spent on the 20 de November Hospital picket line had taken a toll on his body. He gulped down a glass of water, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat, raw from hours of non-stop talking. Still focused on hydration, Ferdinand reached for his nearby standing lamp, his only light source in the dimly lit room.\n\nThe hair on the back of Ferdinand's neck stood up. His lamp wasn't there. With fresh eyes, he looked around his room. The lamp was in another corner. Something was off. He would have remembered moving his lamp. Ferdinand's throat tightened once again, and a flash of heat washed over him as his heart dropped. But that wasn't all. Turning on the light, he scoured his apartment. Furniture has been moved around, the bathroom light is on, and all his family pictures had been set up in a line on his small desk.\n\nFerdinand's hands shake as he closes his window, which, usually closed to keep in the heat, is wide open and facing a rooftop in the distance. With the initial panic fading, Ferdinand is forced by exhaustion to reach the obvious conclusion: Someone had been in his home. Mustering the strength to sleep, he convinces himself he cannot see the light across the street."
