 GOR_state_of_perpetual_warfare: "永无休止的战乱之地"
 GOR_state_of_perpetual_warfare_desc: "自苏联轰然倒塌以来，高尔基就陷入了无穷无尽的战火硝烟之中，始终都坐落于前线，在永不停歇的抗德战争中充当着关键的军事机关。城市就是堡垒，训练有素的红军驻扎于此，其经济体系则完全致力于尽可能多地生产战争物资。高尔基对莫斯科专员辖区的突袭劫掠时有发生，而军管会也打算就像这样，一直战斗下去。"
 GOR_growing_malaise: "愈发艰难的困境"
 GOR_growing_malaise_desc: "红军的作战行动，再加上高尔基过度的工业化，二者正在迅速燃尽军管会手头的一切资源。按照现在的生产方式和可用资源，如果轰炸不尽快结束，或者革命阵线没能重新崛起，那军管会剩下的日子就屈指可数了：军工崩溃正在一天天地临近。"

 POLITICS_IVAN_CHERNYAKHOVSKY_DESC: "在俄罗斯无政府混乱烈焰的炙烤灼烧之下，伊万·丹尼洛维奇·切尔尼亚霍夫斯基的灵魂已然化作灰烬——但在这片择人而噬的废土之上，他已经能算得上是位幸运儿了。\n\n切尔尼亚霍夫斯基的转变始于西俄战争。在彼时的岁月里，他曾是名开朗乐观、鼓舞人心的指挥官，率领着麾下的第8集团军奋勇战斗。后来，当加夫里洛夫退却时，切尔尼亚霍夫斯基也后撤到了高尔基，如同礁石般屹立，抵御着俄罗斯一浪高过浪的混沌浪潮。\n\n然而，他回到的国家就像他曾经逃离的那片土地一样迷失了方向。人民为反动思想所蛊惑，无情地耻笑着红军；共产党人也摘掉了身上的红星，与法西斯蒂和资本家为伍。当他到达高尔基时，切尔尼亚霍夫斯基的脑海中余下的唯有愤怒：对摧毁家园故土的德国侵略者，和背叛祖国事业的俄罗斯人。\n\n如今，身在高尔基的切尔尼亚霍夫斯基困处囹圄，指引他的只剩下痛苦与责任。俄罗斯已经步入歧途，他因而选择将自己的精力悉数集中于运用手中余下的力量削弱德国。与德国的战斗是共产主义最后的希望——尽管代价沉重，但战斗绝无止息。"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_AVERIN_DESC: "哦，听众们，你们要知道，在苏联及其军队覆灭之后，当俄罗斯的土地在德国人的刀枪下颤抖之时，那是一个人们做梦都想不到的时代：相互交战的国家如深蓝色夜空中的繁星一般，遍布整个俄罗斯——沃洛格达、奥涅加、阿尔汉格尔斯克，民主羽翼未丰而非正规军在苦苦挣扎的科米，有被德国人守护着的萨马拉叛徒，但最骄傲的国家还是统治着俄罗斯西部的莫斯科专员辖区。尼古拉·斯捷潘诺维奇·阿韦林走来了，他来自高尔基，阴沉的眼睛、黑色的心肠，手中握着钢枪，他是一个盗贼、一个劫匪、一个杀手，他怀着巨大的野心，怀着巨大的欢乐，欲要用他的坦克把莫斯科专员辖区的纳粹驻军碾成齑粉。\n\n作为西俄罗斯的恐怖大师，在西俄罗斯战争期间，阿韦林在叶戈罗夫麾下指挥最凶猛的坦克部队，自此在德国人心中刻下深刻的恐惧。在冲突后混乱的时日里，阿韦林集结起俄罗斯剩余的大部分装甲部队，准备在高尔基附近做最后的抵抗，在那里他击退了德军的进攻，保护剩余的俄军安全撒退。西俄罗斯革命阵线崩溃后，高尔基孑然独立，而阿韦林站在她的身旁。\n\n年复一年，阿韦林的坦克集群既是他最大的优势，也是他最大的弱点。为了能让坦克继续运转，他很快就被迫对德国领土进行大规模的袭击。他从德国殖民者广袤而难以为继的领土上获取了维持军队运转所需的燃料、零件和战俘。很快，阿韦林开始享受他作为劫掠者的新生活；不久，所有意识形态的伪装都消失了——阿韦林现在唯一关心的事情就是碾碎德国人，看着他们在他的履带前奔逃，听着他们的女人发出绝望的哀嚎！"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_KATUKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Yefimovich Katukov is a deservingly proud Soviet soldier. A loyal Soviet soldier, not a match for bandit traitors with who he once served along. A distinguished tank officer since the days of the Great Patriotic War, he first made his fame in the inglorious and tragic 1941, when he managed to hold the onslaught of the German Panzer divisions under Tula, greatly impressing Heinz Guderian, the general who commanded them. The will of one man was not enough to save the Union from the tread of the Fascist beast, but even in the wake of the Soviet defeat, Katukov refused to surrender.\n\nAlong with General Averin, he spearheaded the tank wedges of the Red Army during the West Russian War, successfully driving the occupiers out of the Gorky Oblast, but his great victories were to no avail, as his divisions were cut off from the military government in Arkhangelsk by reactionary insurgent forces and his men found themselves isolated in the newly reclaimed city. While the rest of the forces stationed in Gorky under Averin found their new calling in piracy and debauchery, Katukov and his men abstained from their activities, waiting for their opportunity to come.\n\nOnly when the bandit warlords were forced to succumb to the whims of the begotten urban bourgeoisie of Gorky, the aged Soviet general saw his last chance to serve the Soviet Union. Bringing with himself every loyalist he could gather, Katukov dealt a swift blow against the weak and capitalist government, raising the Soviet banner over Gorky once again. And this time, the sacred Red Banner will not fall to the enemy, nor it will be disgraced by the crimes against the Soviet people, as long as the faithful sons of the Motherland will not perish."
 GOR_ONG_Konstantin_Katushev: "康斯坦丁·卡图舍夫"
 POLITICS_ONEGA_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC: "正如这座城市的大多数居民一样，康斯坦丁·费多罗维奇·卡图舍夫的生活由高尔基汽车厂塑造而成。童年时，他住在工厂附近，而他父亲几乎一辈子于此工作。当康斯坦丁长大后成为高尔基汽车厂的首席工程师，设计并完善新型更优车辆计划时，没有人感到惊讶。\n\n实话实说，他对自己为谁工作从来都不满意。高尔基那好战的机动匪徒并不与像卡图舍夫这样博文好静的人相适合，高尔基的新统治者也是如此。\n\n然而，事实证明，北俄共和国与他相得益彰：将新建立的稳定与高尔基汽车厂的能力相结合，卡图舍夫现在不仅自豪地经营着工厂，还经营着整座城市，数不清的利润滚滚涌入共和国，他也终于触及他的人生理想。"

 GOR_Pyotr_Nikolaevich_Lashchenko_hog_desc: "§YFirst Deputy Commander-in-Chief\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\nFocus. Scrutinous labor. The unwavering Pyotr Lashchenko perceives the same value in these pillars in battle as he does administration. In the face of isolation from the larger First Guards Tank Army, facing the iron wrath of the Wehrmacht, neither he nor the Ninth Mechanized Corps were vanquished. Deprived of a united motherland, his loyalty has fallen to the Control Commission in Gorky.\n\nHowever, boisterousness invariably fetters diligence. Consequently, Pyotr is content to remain quiet, to let his colleagues within the Control Commission bicker over political scraps. In his new function as administrator, he toils away, tending to the basic function and fabric of administrative work."

It is with this in mind that one ought to look up to the men whose hearts burn so brightly that they keep the fires of those around them burning. And there is no fire as fierce in Gorky as that of Katukov, commander of the legendary First Guards Tank Army. Katukov is a man whose iron will and commitment to socialism have never faltered no matter the times.\n\nHis many distinctions during the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War ensured that even as the front collapsed, he held firm near the frontline city of Gorky. His many accomplishments would even turn him into kingmaker of the city, facilitating Chernyakhovsky's rise to Chairman.\n\nNowadays he remains as the city's contact to the outside, constantly in communication with the Front's leadership and the many partisan groups in Moskowien. If a man keeps the war alive even today years after its supposed end, it is Katukov."

 GOR_Boris_Mikhailovich_Golovchiner_eco_desc: "§YHead of the Economic Department\nStratocratic Communism§!\n--------------\nIn a land of sorrow, it is such a terrible thing to even feel a modicum of responsibility. Boris Golovchiner, once Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army, now holds the important task of ensuring Gorky's autarky. Thankfully, the impromptu economist has a talent for resource management. Such is his skill that it is common knowledge in government that they owe him a great debt.\n\nSo why does his chest not fill with pride? Smiles and thanks for the appreciation is what Gorky sees, but his mind speaks a different truth. His policies have won no warm feelings from the workers or civilians, for his policies have won them no warmth. Every day, this truth crushes the Socialist Soldier more and more."
 GOR_Mikhail_Alekseevich_Shalin: "米哈伊尔·沙林"
 GOR_Mikhail_Alekseevich_Shalin_sec_desc: "§YDeputy Commander-in-Chief for Civil Administration Affairs\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\nThe Front shattered. Battered in its fight against the Nazi hordes and betrayed from the inside, it was unable to keep fighting. Or at least that was what many believed. For others the fight was never over, simply entering a lul. Former chief of staff of the First Guards Tank Army, Mikhail Shalin was one such man.\n\nAs the front halted, he refused to head to the relative safety of the north. Instead, he scoffed at it and all those who escaped the frontlines. Mikhail chose that he would remain in the very front till dead tore him away. It was this iron will that left him as the chief of the Front's Main Intelligence Directorate, working tirelessly from dusk till dawn to ensure that Gorky remained fighting."
