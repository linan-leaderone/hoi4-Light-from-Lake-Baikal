 GAY_Mikhail_Antipin: "米哈伊尔·安季平"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_ANTIPIN_DESC: "米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇·安季平原先不过是车里雅宾斯克一名卑微的农夫，比起教育或哲学问题，他更多关心的是日复一日的生存问题。在责任——当然也有征役——的感召下，他摆脱了这种生活，作为一名机枪手加入步兵部队，前往乌克兰战线作战。他是一名硕果累累的战士，甚至一度获得苏联英雄的荣誉，但他没来得及获得应有的荣耀——不久以后，政府就垮台了。他的部队陷入内讧，他独自一人逃了出来，身上只剩下蔽体的衣物。\n\n在荒野中游荡了一个多月后，安季平来到了盖尼镇，当地的一位神父收留了他，并细心照料直至他恢复健康。在这个过程中，安季平获得了某种宗教上的启示，他觉悟到俄罗斯所有那些骇人的悲剧——沙皇的无能、德国入侵、十月革命、苏维埃的暴政、饥荒、又一次的德国入侵，这一切绝非偶然，而是惩戒。俄罗斯的众人背弃了主，因此，祂将罪孽的报应降临。\n\n神启为安季平的生活注入了新的意义。他将盖尼和附近村庄的人们召集起来，竖起“圣格奥尔基骑士团”的旗帜，许诺道，“那无神论的恶龙，将被真理之矛贯穿。”这一骑士团虽然规模很小，但为该地区的人民带来了稳定与精神上的激励，不得不说他们卓有成效地抵御了狂人们和异教徒的侵蚀。安季平大团长只会在上帝面前跪下，而拒绝让骑士团向任何凡间统治者屈膝，可一旦他找到了一位足够虔诚的领袖，为了上帝的事业，他乐于献上自己与部众的忠诚。"
 GAY_ONG_Yakov_Panteleev: "雅科夫·潘捷列耶夫"
 POLITICS_YAKOV_PENTELEEV_DESC: "Yakov Elizarovich Panteleyev is a veteran of more wars than most. Born in a village of Udmurtia, he was a farmer until he was drafted into the Red Army mere days after the start of the Great Patriotic War. He bravely defended cities far from his homeland in the Idel-Ural, which earned him many medals and promotions, and fought until the Germans reached the banks of the Volga, and all hope was lost. Still a patriot at heart, Panteleyev volunteered to join a unit of ethnic Udmurts in the West Russian War, but once again, Russia faced defeat at the hands of the Wehrmacht, and from there the officer faded into obscurity.\n\nThat was, until the Anti-Communist Guard reigned supreme over northwestern Russia and authority in the Volga region collapsed. As a respected army commander, Yakov was unanimously elected by a hurriedly formed local council as the new President of the Udmurt Republic, in association with the Northern Russian Republic as a loyal ally.\n\nFor the first time, Panteleyev's people have a nation for themselves, and he would like to keep it that way."

 GAY_warrior_order_desc: "For centuries, Russia was the defender of the One, Holy and Catholic and Apostolic Church, but the Tsars have grown lax in their duty, and the Lord struck them down, sending pestilence over pestilence over our land as punishment for their decadence. But we, the Order of Saint George, have understood that the Salvation of Russia lies in returning to Russia's roots as a land of faith, and by reviving the Faith we will gain the favor of the Lord; and with His Favor comes the fortitude necessary to smite all enemies and reclaim Russia from the invaders and from the Red Scourge of Communism."
 GAY.1.t: "浮生一日"
 GAY.1.desc: "The day of Epistolary Daniil began two hours before dawn. Members of the night patrol rang their bells in the mess halls, carrying lanterns and awakening the warrior-monks. They donned the inner cassock in a few moments, and the chaplain led the Morning Prayer. It was a simple prayer, as ostentation did not endear men to divinity. All done, the chaplain divided the day's duties and administered the Communion, for it was Sunday. After that, he left the monks to pray, prepare, and dress as their tasks demanded of them. Daniil was to train, to pray, and to perform duties befitting an Epistolary. He issued a silent amen.\n\nIn a few moments, the morning patrol departed. After breakfast, Daniil was now in combat gear, leading his men through the war-games. He guessed that an Epistolary was equivalent to a sergeant, and he felt that he did well coordinating and commanding his squad in executing tasks throughout the field. A lucky shot took him out, and he watched in dismay as his fellows fell into disarray. Practice over, they would have lunch, and he spent the afternoon secluded in meditation. He was released just in time for the evening to sweep Russia, and thus dinner to be served. Bellies full, they would start to other tasks. For others, it would mean patrols or studies of saints. For Daniil, it was something else.\n\nHe opened the door to the scriptorium and lit a candle. It would reveal the inkpots and pens, pages and pages of parchment and paper, and volumes bound in jeweled and gilded leather covers. It was his home. Tonight, too, he would do his task with joy. He drew a sheet of parchment and opened a volume, and started copying. He whispered a silent prayer in his heart, and whether or not God existed, he no longer cared. The truth was that faith behooved men to great acts, and he thanked the Lord for what he was given today. At midnight, he would quit his task, and join the night prayer, before going to bed."
