A small movement of Artists and filmmakers have shown interest in engaging with the cultural trends of Washington and Tokyo, and we see no reason to stop them!

Italy, at its founding, was always interested in meaningful cultural exchange with the venues of Paris and Barcelona. Modigliani made a name for himself in the former, and we can not forget the role of Italian art in the courts of Louis XIV. It seems that the Parises and Barcelonas of today belong in the United States and in Japan, and it is there that we must go, bearing the finest works and ideas Italy's artists have to offer."

News of new spectacles releasing in Hollywood and exciting themes and techniques being previewed in Tokyo leaves our own audiences eager to embrace the Hollywood western and the hōga of Japan. Artists, filmmakers and writers from all over the world are welcome to make a name for themselves in the theatres of Rome, and sow the seeds of an international culture based in Italy."

De Sica, Rosselini, and Mazzucato are known around the world for their contributions to both Italian and international cinema. Equally, Italian audiences have been taken with the works of Coppola and Scorsese, Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa. In commemorating this the long-awaited return of the Venice Film Festival will include a great component of international films, celebrating the artistic achievements of the world at large, and laying the grounds for a permanent international presence in Italy."

This cannot be done instantly, but neither was Rome built in a day, so to speak - and we can certainly hurry the process along."

We've named Jack Valenti - president of the Motion Pictures Association of America - to lead a delegation of Italian-American artists and writers to meet with Italian cultural luminaries.

Their democratic institutions could delay help, to the point where we suffer the same fate of Britain. The United States' influence in our strategy shall be reduced, primarily by barring OFN observers access into our direct military affairs. Although this is a harsh step to take, it is one that many believe must be done to ensure our independence and security in the case of all-out war."

For it is not enough to bury Fascism. Now we must build everyday what it means to be independent and free, and reap the benefit from opening up to all those of goodwill.

Washington and Tokyo have their own plans for the peninsula, and may assign their investments contrary to our wishes. This is no issue provided we maintain an independent course throughout the negotiation period; should the scales ultimately favor either superpower, however, then we can only accede to the terms and benefits they have offered.\n\nNote that no two issues can share the same level of investment.
