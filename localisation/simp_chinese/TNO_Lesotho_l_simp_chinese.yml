 LTH_south_african_kingdom_desc: "Lesotho has had a tumultuous history over the last few years. The Kingdom was at first anything but, independent in name only under South Africa, and reduced to another exploited province with the rise of the Afrikaaner Volkstaat. However, with the Volkstaat's collapse, Lesotho has reasserted itself as a proper nation and hopes to build a proper nation from the corpse of South Africa."

 LTH_strong_anc_influence_desc: "After the South African War, the ANC was destroyed and split into factions. Many of the most influential and radical members fled to Lesotho, where they were granted refuge by Moshoeshoe II. While they may be grateful to the king for his protection while under the Volkstaat, the radicals are now a thorn in the side of the king."
