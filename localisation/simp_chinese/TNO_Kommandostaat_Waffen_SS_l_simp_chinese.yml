 POLITICS_Herbert_Otto_Gillie_DESC:0 "The Brother Generals have stabbed each other in the back, and the middle brother rises from the pile, standing with his men to save what remains of the Reich.\n\nHerbert Otto Gille fought through the muddy trenches and drank the ersatz coffee of World War One, and he commanded his Baltic volunteers with pride as they tore through the Russians in World War Two, and he fought the battles of the German Civil War- but he has never seen Germany fall so low as it has. He and his Brother Generals- Paul Hausser and Sylvester Stadler- each took the stunning revelation of Himmler's plot differently. Hausser refused to believe it, Stadler quietly distanced himself from the Reichsführer, and Gille bought every word of it. Such a disagreement could only end poorly, but Gille was skilled enough to find himself ruler of what remains of his divisions- with Hausser dead and Stadler gone, nobody else is left to challenge him from within.\n\nThe task now turns to stopping and defeating Himmler and his lunatics- before they can follow through on their plans. Gille's men- the brave soldiers of the 19th Waffen Grenadiers- stand ready to aid Heydrich and his allies. The tide must be turned, the Reich retaken, and the Aryan paradise restored- and each and every soldier in the division knows what happens if they fail.\n\nThere can be- will be- no retreat, no weakness, no surrender. Gille and his men will end Himmler's mad schemes or die in the process."
 HWL_Sylvester_Stadler:0 "西尔维斯特·斯塔德勒"
 POLITICS_Sylvester_Stadler_DESC:0 "In the chaos of the Brother's struggle, the youngest now stands alone on top of the heap- and he and his men want nothing more than to leave it.\n\nUnlike his friends, Paul Hausser and Herbert Otto Gille, Stadler never fought in the First World War- he was only born in 1910. His relative youth did not stop him from joining the SS early, however, joining in 1933. From there, his rise only continued- soon, he was commanding regiments, then divisions, emerging from the War with an Iron Cross and a new rank as Commander of the \"Hunyadi\" 25th Waffen Grenadier Division- a division made up of Hungarian Nazi's, proud to serve their Führer and the Reich.\n\nStadler has stayed in his post since, but the Reich around him has changed- and not for the better. He, like nearly all other SS higher-ups, stood with Himmler during the West Russian War- and suffered the consequences. Ever since, he worked to aid Heydrich's efforts, helping set the groundwork for his Führership. When the Bürgerkrieg began, Stadler was swift to bring his forces to bear against the others, and stood proudly with his brothers in victory- a short lived one, for then came Heydrich's accusations, and soon after came the split. Stadler himself doesn't quite know what to make of it, but the possibility of the rumors being true tilts him towards Heydrich's side- a position not shared by his Brother Generals.\n\nStadler stands at the head of the Kommandostab now, but his drive to fight has left him- a position shared by his men, who similarly lost that spark that drove them all those years ago. Stadler's main focus now is to move his men back to their homeland, Hungary- and go with them. What happens in Germany behind him is not his concern, though he'll certainly do what he can to get his lands in the right hands. All in all, Stadler stands not as the purist or hardliner he once was, but as a man weary of seeing his men fall before him, wishing for nothing more than the quiet luxury of retirement."
 HWL_Paul_Hausser:0 "保罗·豪塞尔"
 POLITICS_Paul_Hausser_DESC:0 "Surrounded by foes he once called friends, Paul Hausser emerges victorious from the Brother's struggle- and he now moves to end Heydrich's petty rebellion.\n\nPaul Hausser is a veteran of both World Wars, fighting in the trenches in the First and leading various Panzer Corps through France and Russia in the Second. He proudly displays his Iron Cross from those times, now leading the Wiking 5th Panzer Division- a division made primarily of hardline Scandinavian National Socialists. One of the SS officials to avoid purging in the wake of Himmler's failed coup, Hausser continued to bide his time among his allies in the SS, aiding Heydrich's maneuvers where he could and readying his men for the conflict to come.\n\nWith Heydrich victorious, Hausser thought his work was finished- and his men did too. Unfortunately, fate has played a cruel joke on the Reich, and Heydrich- in a feat of supreme lunacy and cowardice- has denounced Himmler on the basis of insane allegations, splitting Germany once more. Hausser and his men proudly stood in favor of the Reichsführer- and were stunned when their brothers, led by Herbert Otto Gille and Sylvester Stadler, refused to stand with them. Things only deteriorated from there.\n\nAt the end of the struggle, Hausser finds himself victorious-but at a steep cost, with his Brother Generals and their forces dead or fleeing. As tragic as this turn is, Hausser knows there's only one man to blame- Heydrich, that snivelling, traitorous worm. This foolish split has cost Hausser much, and the Oberst-Gruppenführer knows how to fix it- with his men, proudly standing with their loyal, true brothers in Germania, ending this treachery once and for all."
