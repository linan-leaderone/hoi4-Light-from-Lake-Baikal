 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi:0 "高木首相"
 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi_desc:0 "终于，在翼赞会内的自由化事业上硕果累累的改革派高木惣吉在国会内取得了可以组建政府的绝对多数，现在日本和整个共荣圈都知晓了他的胜选。这位提督承诺，在他的任期内，贪污腐败、滥用公权和过度的军事化都将一去不复返。\n\n但是，我们必须认真对待每项改革，日本的国家机构是只笨重的野兽，如果它跌倒了，那么它会摔得很惨。但是，如果提督打出了正确的牌，并且选择了正确的时间和地点开始他的战斗，日本社会就能开始一段长期的改革并摆脱过去的过激行为。"
 JAP_new_beginning:0 "翼赞会的新起点"
 JAP_new_beginning_desc:0 "大政翼赞会是一个庞大、笨拙且僵化的政治组织，由从保守派到技术官僚的诸多派阀组成，同时受到狡猾的无所属议员们的反对。不幸的是，它也是日本境内唯一合法的政治团体，绝大多数国会议员都是翼赞会成员。提督将会在执政之初利用翼赞会的弱点来为改革派谋取利益。让翼赞会组织更高效或许可以提高贵族院的信心，长远来看，这一措施将会使改革派受益匪浅。"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism:0 "派阀问题"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism_desc:0 "大政翼赞会不只是一只粗笨的野兽——还是一头由彼此攻讦的四个派阀组成的四头蛇：追随我们的改革派，以及技术官僚、保守派和无所属议员。同时不要忘记，军方那强大的权柄还高悬在国会的头上。\n\n但也正是借由这种分裂，我们的政治路线得以灵活变通：拉拢谁，在国会中扮演何种角色。如果我们能在正确的道路上采取正确的手段，我们很有希望将派阀攻击的对象转向我们的对手，并从中受益。\n\n但眼前最重要的是决定谁将会是我们的盟友，而谁将被我们拒之门外。总的来说，考虑到木户派和技术官僚所许诺的模糊激进未来，池田的保守派最有可能因为我们的共有温和立场而亲近我们。"
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise:0 "合作与妥协"
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise_desc:0 "我们可以选择用温和的手段对抗国会内的其它派阀，同时利用我们在国会外的理想主义支持者。为此，我们将利用国会内其他成员的善意，凭借合作与妥协的手段来促进我们的改革。然而，这将会使改革的力度有所削弱——如果我们走这条路，我们将需要与其它派阀更紧密地联系在一起。"
 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism:0 "调和革新主义"
 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism_desc:0 "我们的改革派和技术官僚中的某些人有着相同的观点，即日本要不改革和重组，要不就灭亡。但是，在具体行动的方式和目的上，我们同技术官僚有着很大的分歧。\n\n如果同技术官僚在譬如精简国家机构等具体事务上达成共识，我们就能吸引到技术官僚中温和派，乃至于某些岸信介走狗的支持。但这些激进的措施的确非常冒险，势必会减小贵族院对我们的支持并激起军方的愤怒。"
 JAP_unified_resistance:0 "联合抵抗"
 JAP_unified_resistance_desc:0 "一些思想较为独立的技术官僚正在反对井野及池田的保守派和军方，我们大可以在这一点上做文章。不管我们在目的和手段上的分歧有多大，在国会中建立一个联合阵线总是能使双方受益的。这当然会剧烈动摇国会目前的政治形势，而这样一个庞大又脆弱的联合阵线势必招致政策上的分歧和冲突。不过，我们最好先把保守派赶出局，再来解决我们之间的分歧。"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy:0 "发扬遗产"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy_desc:0 "提督对改革和自由化的宏大愿景并非是一个新兴产物。事实上，这完全可以被称作为明治天皇和大正天皇时代社会的回归，是自由同克制、外国价值观同传统价值观之间恰到好处的平衡。我们可以发扬明治和大正时代的闪光点，并将提督的统治称作那些个时代的延续。\n\n改革派显露出这等面貌毫无疑问能吸引到国会中更审慎或强硬的议员和贵族院中的贵族，但更重要的是，公众将被那业已失落于过度军国主义的时代和价值观所鼓舞，从而稳固我们的公众支持。"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai:0 "吁请国体"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai_desc:0 "在复兴明治天皇和大正天皇那辉煌时代的遗泽之外，日本的国体也将从我们的统治中得以稳固。\n\n要做到这些，我们可以把改革称为旧时代的回归来塑造改革派一心为民的形象，从而舒缓社会反对，并按照国体之本义为日本带来新的黄金时代，同时用保守派和军方的过分行为损害他们的名誉。"
 JAP_strength_and_totality:0 "力量和团结"
 JAP_strength_and_totality_desc:0 "当然，我们也可以把我们的派系塑造成一个可以开辟自己道路的派系——日本需要变革，按着保守派设定好的路子继续走下去将会玷污国体，日本重要的国家主权将会被夺走。\n\n然而无论是众议院还是贵族院都不会对此感到高兴的，但要是没有了幕后中人的拖累，我们可以更自由地决定我们改革的总体范围和程度。"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned:0 "劝说破灭者"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned_desc:0 "要按照这条道路建立联盟，我们可以把目光转向国会中的边缘化人物。比如说……那些对岸信介和贺屋路线不满的技术官僚。此外，井野庞大混乱的保守派大帐篷里至少有一些反对者。最后，我们也可以吸纳国会中那些更具独立倾向，厌倦了派阀政治的议员。我们将一个一个地争取可信赖的多数支持，以通过改革法案。"
 JAP_solidify_base:0 "巩固基础"
 JAP_solidify_base_desc:0 "现在，国会中失意或者容易说服的议员已经团结在我们的羽翼下了，接下来要做的就是巩固国会中的改革派阵营。聚餐、钓鱼和游轮旅行想必能巩固改革派的观点，并确保恰到好处的多数和支持度以推动法案。\n\n当然了，我们越强大，我们的敌人——技术官僚、保守派和军方煽动反对浪潮的风险就越大。但时间会告诉我们，开辟自己的道路是否是一个正确的选择。"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality:0 "终止受困心态"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality_desc:0 "日本的财富和繁荣是战争带来的，这固然没错，但在过去二十年间，过度的军国主义、敌意和排外心理已经从上到下渗透了日本的方方面面，并招致了恶果。不论是城市里攻击朝鲜劳工的骚乱，还是常年蠢蠢欲动的大本营，都非常成功地做到了世界范围内的臭名远扬。也许这是一个战时国家应有的样貌，但日本早已远离了这一处境。\n\n为此，我们将施行这样的纲领：不止是在日本，还要在整个世界范围内促进和平，繁荣和开放。毫无疑问，某些派阀不会对此感到开心，但这必将会带来一个政府开放且透明的新时代。"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism:0 "采纳革新主义"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism_desc:0 "技术官僚在国会中是一个极其强大的派阀，还同我们一样强烈反对井野和池田的保守派。但问题是，他们同我们在国家机器需要被如何定义、改革和重构这一问题上有着极其巨大的分歧。\n\n尽管不支持技术官僚国防国家的愿景，但我们仍然可以接纳技术官僚较温和的国有化方案，譬如关键产业国有化和打击财阀影响，这也能动摇技术官僚派系的团结。"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase:0 "开始第二阶段"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase_desc:0 "现在，由于改革派已经团结了自己的队伍，巩固了自身的内部结构，高木提督得以继续我们权力整合的下一步，即如何对付池田和木户的亲密盟友，而不是简简单单地处理掉他们派系中的边缘人物。我们要么与木户和池田达成妥协，要么就把他们丢在一边，由我们自己带头前行。"
 JAP_coalition_equals:0 "平等的联盟"
 JAP_coalition_equals_desc:0 "同池田和木户一道组成一个反对军国主义和强硬派的广泛统一战线为我们在国会中的长期生存提供了一条更安全的道路，但也意味着我们不得不淡化政策中的改革派色彩。\n\n池田的庞大派系能提供一个确保法案通过的确定多数，但是，我们可能会因让步太多而陷入即便通过法案也难以改变现状的窘境。"
 JAP_settling_differences:0 "搁置争议"
 JAP_settling_differences_desc:0 "我们改革派同保守派以及木户的保皇派有着极其巨大的分歧，从经济到军国主义，甚至是如何花费从共荣圈攫取的巨大财富。然而，为了让联盟推动改革，结束军国主义影响，就算要牺牲一些激进的改革，我们也必须保持团结来共同反对军方和井野政府的过分行径。\n\n确认了这一点，我们的联盟终于不单单只有改革派，还拥有那些仍有尊严的保守派和保皇派的支持。"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue:0 "铲除密谋习气"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue_desc:0 "秘密交易，裙带关系，内部密谋，敲诈，贿赂……在井野政府不论你想达成任何事都不可避免地和这些罪行打交道。而这恰恰是提督最厌恶的做法，将会招致缺乏透明度、腐败和行政混乱等一系列问题。\n\n为此，提督和他最亲密的顾问一道，将会从最骇人听闻的罪犯开始，调查那些有着肮脏政治手腕和腐败前科的议员。因为我们即将掌握国会的多数，所以他们别无选择，只能屈服，如若不然，我们也能确保他们政治生命的终结。"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda:0 "同池田合作"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda_desc:0 "池田正之辅是个立场坚定的人——一位严厉的保守主义者，一位性情中人，更重要的是，他还是国会最大派阀的领袖。尽管我们改革派和他们保守派不能在所有事务上达成一致，但至少现在我们因一个共同的目标而团结，即遏制技术官僚和军国主义者。\n\n我们将在国会中取得他的合作以通过压制军国主义的关键立法。同时，我们可以取得一个相对安全的平台以在未来处理……更多的关键性事务。"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido:0 "平反木户"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido_desc:0 "木户幸一是一个有着多重背景的人。一方面，我们的自由化设想借鉴了许多他战后关于军队去政治化的方案，另一方面，他曾在技术官僚和军方的强烈反对浪潮中凄惨地中止仕途。现在他希望在国会中和改革派合作，谁会愚蠢到拒绝他的请求呢？毕竟他同皇室以及贵族院的亲密关系对巩固其支持至关重要。\n\n作为交换，提督许诺修复木户崩毁的形象。这可以通过在翼赞会公报，国会演讲和新闻采访中感谢木户过去的奉献实现。这样的话，这位长者就能活到自己在人民眼中得到平反的那一天。"
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition:0 "机巧联盟"
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition_desc:0 "我们同池田正之辅达成的同盟受到过许多质疑。这些质疑当然可以理解，毕竟改革派本身就脱胎自保守派中更自由的议员，不过时间已经证明，同保守派的同盟是一个明智的行动。在高木首相干练的领导下，联盟的成就超出了预期。我们既成功地遏制了保守派，又从他们同社会经济机构的广泛联系中受益颇深。这一联盟还帮我们维护了帝国议会中的文明形象，公众也因而满意。当然，这只不过是一个开端，而世界才刚刚要见证改革派同池田的联盟将使日本变得多么繁荣。还有更多的事业要做。"
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own:0 "自力更生"
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own_desc:0 "当然了，我们可以将与其它派阀合作的念头置之脑后，转而开辟自己的道路。由此一来，我们可以自由地制定改革政策，但这也会让我们失去一些国会里的支持者。\n\n如果选择这样一条道路，我们应该对一些派阀重拳出击，并边缘化另一些派阀，这样一来就能强迫他们与我们合作，但这样会激怒一些……不那么好说服的议员。"
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises:0 "零敲碎打"
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises_desc:0 "技术官僚群体是我们改革运动坚定的反对者。颇具讽刺意味的是，技术官僚的一些个人成员也是最可能同我们改革派达成妥协的，或许有人会觉得这样的组合不伦不类。但是，凭借改革派的力量，我们不需要在关键政策上向技术官僚做出太多妥协。\n\n我们可以从同技术官僚间的共同观点着手，譬如温和国有化不重要产业或强制重组财阀的小规模海外资产，这些手段有望削弱企业力量，同时强化国家机器。最终，这将让一些技术官僚心满意足，从而妨碍一个反改革派阵线的形成。"
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements:0 "勠力同心"
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements_desc:0 "我们改革事业的支持者分别来自两个截然不同的人群：学生和帝国海军。虽然这二者都支持提督政府的最终目标，但这更多是基于共同反对井野时代的权宜之计。\n\n出版公报，接受采访，以及和支持我们的民意代表进行深入谈话，我们将能够把不同支持者的复杂诉求联系起来，形成对立法的强大支持，同时也可以削弱其他派阀的民众支持度。"
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp:0 "吞并池田派"
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp_desc:0 "池田正之辅是个立场坚定的人——一位严厉的保守主义者，一位性情中人，更重要的是，他还是国会最大派阀的领袖。至少几周前是这样，在那之后，井野政府的倒台，我们对保守派的削弱和改革派自身的增强已经改变了这一局面。\n\n既然保守派已经无路可退，那他们除了和我们保持合作以外别无他途。提督可以轻易说服池田，合作是保持其国会影响力的唯一方法，不然无疑会送给技术官僚壮大的机会。我们双方都不愿意看到这样的可能成为现实，尤其是池田的保守派已经摇摇欲坠。"
 JAP_incorporate_kido:0 "整合木户派"
 JAP_incorporate_kido_desc:0 "木户幸一是一个有着多重背景的人。一方面，我们的自由化设想借鉴了许多他战后关于军队去政治化的方案，另一方面，他曾在技术官僚和军方的强烈反对浪潮中凄惨地中止仕途。如果我们不吸纳这样的人物就太愚蠢了。\n\n虽然木户自身的派阀是国会中最小的，但同木户的合作能为我们提供一张至关重要的王牌，那就是同皇室与贵族院的联系。如果我们在国会中陷入僵局，这能为我们提供打破天平平衡的筹码，更不用说，天皇本人的话语在关键时刻能发挥出多么巨大的影响了。"
 JAP_dealing_with_others:0 "处理其余派阀"
 JAP_dealing_with_others_desc:0 "此前，我们一直在努力塑造自身胜任、公正、坚定自信的政府形象。我们的成功已经极大提升了改革派的声望。在我们声望上升的同时，帝国议会中其他派阀的声望也有一定的下挫。如果我们要证明改革派政府才是唯一可行，唯一可敬的政府，那么我们必须进一步损害反对派的地位。\n\n首相已经下令开展了一项全国性的运动，展示其他派阀是多么腐败、无能和危险。任何捏造都是不被需要的，因为大把大把的事实证据已经摆在我们桌上，只需要被用恰当的方式展示给公众。同时，公众也会明白其他派阀和那些力量有联系，真正忠于的到底是什么。让所有人都知道，反对派唯一能给日本帝国带来的就是跌落尘埃。"
 JAP_the_sun_rises_once_more:0 "旭日重升"
 JAP_the_sun_rises_once_more_desc:0 "现在，政局已经得到控制，腐败也得以遏制，日本社会中的围困心态被终结，类战时的过激行为也被压制。提督用双手创造了一个光辉灿烂的未来。现在我们将专注于经济领域，并研究如何发展出一种适当的技术官僚体制——一个充满专业、努力工作、德才双全人才的未来，当然，所有的这些都体现了我们国体的本质。"
 JAP_push_for_normalcy:0 "走向正常化"
 JAP_push_for_normalcy_desc:0 "我们伟大的帝国在差不多二十年前战胜了美国及其帝国主义盟友。然而，在我们之前那些臃肿的政府仿佛从来没有意识到战争已经结束的事实，许多战时的法律和政策直到现在还是日本生活的一部分。\n\n这带来了一系列问题，僵化而低效的战时体制使得我们难以利用共荣圈提供的经济利益与特权。更重要的是，随着人民对生活水平期待得越来越高，异议也愈发高涨。如果我们的政府还是一个民众授权来统治的政府，这个问题就必须得到解决。\n\n中曾根康弘部长提出了一项逐步中止战时体制的宏伟计划，从而让日本能够从市场力量的全部中受益。"
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges:0 "限制战时特权"
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges_desc:0 "自19世纪末以来，财阀和经连会一直和政府一直保持着密切的合作。即使是在我们的自由化计划中，我们也最好积极保持这种联系。然而，不可否认的是，战时合同和战时补贴已经严重损害了我们的收支平衡，如果我们不注意这一点，我们的财政状况就摆脱不了危险。\n\n因此，我们有必要中止一些较为……夸张的战时补贴和合同，表面上，这是我们改善收支平衡的一种手段，但这实质上将会是迈向正道，拆除财阀与经连会对我们停滞经济难以置信控制力的第一步。"
 JAP_takagi_oppose_from_cartels:0 "打击卡特尔"
 JAP_takagi_oppose_from_cartels_desc:0 ""
 JAP_grease_the_gears:0 "一滴润滑油"
 JAP_grease_the_gears_desc:0 "放松经济管制充满不可控性，逐步瓦解有几十年历史的卡特尔更是一项及其危险的工作。但是，我们可以逐步说服他们，私有化是一个能兼顾国家利益和公司利润的理想做法。为此，中曾根部长将会与财阀和经连会的高层会面，阐述了企业解决经济负规模后长期利润率的增加。\n\n当然，如果这些公司不能被逻辑和数字（以及非常慷慨的私人研发拨款）打动，我们也有许多台面下的手腕迫使他们屈服于政府的意志。\n\n没关系，中曾根部长是经济领域和商业谈判方面的专家，我们会委托他采取必要的手段来实现我们的目标。"
 JAP_easing_nationalization:0 "放宽国有化"
 JAP_easing_nationalization_desc:0 "和企业谈判是一项棘手的工作，而我们的政府在放宽国有资产和企业上有着更大的自由。削减那些无利可图的资产将是一个良好的开端，尤其是那些位与华中地区和南太平洋等遥远地区的资产。\n\n此外，撤销产业报国会——这一《国家总动员法》的遗留产物能提高企业对我们的观感。毕竟就算产业报国会只是个傀儡，没有工会会费增加用工成本总是件好事。\n\n虽然此举肯定会增加企业对我们的支持，但势必会招致军方和技术官僚的怒火，他们肯定会反对松动国家对工业和资产的控制。"
 JAP_privatize_the_railways:0 "私有化铁路"
 JAP_privatize_the_railways_desc:0 "当和平复归太平洋，日本获得了一个不仅巩固在朝鲜和台湾，还在整个共荣圈的控制权的机会。为此，旧政府进行了广泛的国有铁路建设，主要是为了军用。正如我们如今大部分资产的经济困境一样，这些铁路基本没有盈利。\n\n虽然考虑到许多铁路的战略价值，完全私有化整个铁路网不太明智，但我们可以先对日本国内的铁路进行一部分私有化。中曾根部长有个计划，即把东京市内地铁系统作为未来大规模私有化的先行试点。"
 JAP_returning_seized_assets:0 "撤销产业控制"
 JAP_returning_seized_assets_desc:0 "日本西部的工业中心，特别是汽车产业和电子产业，一直是我国工业的支柱。然而，这些产业消耗了大量的补贴，所以将其中一些私有化是促进经济自由化的好方法。此外，这也将会是一次很好的试验，让我们见证日本背景下私有化的效果。\n\n当然，技术官僚肯定会反对我们，他们有许多人认为汽车和电子行业依然是“必不可少的”关键产业。但依靠着国会中温和派的支持，我们应该足以压倒他们的反对。另外，这一行动也不会损害我们同三菱等财阀盟友的关系。"
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading:0 "消除贸易壁垒"
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading_desc:0 "虽然理论上共荣圈旨在促进全亚洲的经济发展（当然是在我们严密的监督下），但却依然被前几届政府的战时条例限制。此外，许多地方驻军中的既得利益者通过主导黑市和不成文特权稳固了他们对当地的控制。这固然对他们的腰包很有好处，但对日本却毫无助益，事实上，这还激起了共荣圈民众对我们的敌对。\n\n作为应对，内阁提议取消战时贸易和资源管制，以促进货物和资本的自由流动。这样一来，我们的企业就能充分利用共荣圈所提供的巨大资源财富，蓬勃发展。从中国的北京到印尼的明古鲁，日本的企业和人民都能迎来繁荣的新时代。"
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries:0 "保持关键产业控制"
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries_desc:0 "虽然高木政府的长期目标是促进日本经济自由化，但一下子放开太多部门的管制将给整个共荣圈市场带来巨大的冲击和经济不确定性。因此，我们的政府最好继续持有国防、钢铁和石化部门的大量国有资产。\n\n此外，受丰田生产模式的启发，中曾根部长还提出了一种既能逐步推进经济自由化，又能将技术官僚和军方拉拢到我们这边的方案，即通过促进自动化和生产线生产等新技术研发，提高上述产业的生产能力。这样一来，技术官僚就会因背叛自己原则而遭到削弱。"
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance:0 "坚持资源主导"
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance_desc:0 "或者，我们也可以专注于我们已有的利益：维持国家在资源开采业的垄断地位。这远比进一步私有化的风险小得多。国家早已在资源开采业中占据了庞大的资产，并在诸如南太平洋和外满洲的偏远地区实现了垄断。\n\n当然，国家完全垄断并不是一个可取的长期目标，为此中曾根部长计划就未来发展问题同财阀高层磋商。在现在这个阶段，财阀以专业知识辅助国控资源开采业的扩张，而作为回报，财阀将在未来的私有化竞标中享有优先权。"
 JAP_a_question_of_labor:0 "劳动力问题"
 JAP_a_question_of_labor_desc:0 "那些为帝国献出无偿劳动的“劳务者”，自愿参加人体实验的“马路大”，还有千千万万中国人，朝鲜人，印尼人都在为日本的利益服务。从九州岛的煤矿到日产在满洲的工厂，不论是自愿还是被强迫，劳工贡献的劳动力都对改善日本经济和人民的生活水平至关重要。然而，随着经济现代化，我们在劳动力问题上也面临着新的挑战。劳动力必须掌握现代化的技能，才能匹配机械化和自动化的生产模式。\n\n我们可以考虑减轻日本对强迫劳动的依赖，从而减轻共荣圈内部的不满情绪，改善我们的国际和国内公众形象。但我们不应该完全抛弃强制劳役这一好用的工具，在那些日本民众不愿意从事的职业中，强制劳役获得的劳动力依然至关重要。不仅如此，降低劳动力成本还能提升我们在财阀和经连会的声望。毕竟，有我们的警卫部队在场，罢工的劳工肯定折腾不出什么结果。"
 JAP_ensure_access_across_the_sphere:0 "拴紧共荣圈"
 JAP_ensure_access_across_the_sphere_desc:0 "从电子产品到最新的汽车，财阀和经连会为共荣圈提供了丰富的商品供应。日本经济的繁荣和强大恰恰就体现在财阀与经连会的成功中。然而，这一成功离不开充足的劳动力与资源供应。如果我们能允许财阀和经连会在全共荣圈内自由“征用”劳工，不但能稳固政府在他们中的地位，还能一定程度上得到国会中保守派的支持。\n\n然而，这一举措无益于我们的公众形象。进步主义者一直主张减少强迫劳动，而极端主义者则主张由国家来主导强迫劳动。而我们也不得不承认，强迫共荣圈仆从国的人民为日本自己的利益服务会激起更多的不满情绪。"
 JAP_keep_our_fingers_on_the_scale:0 "维持国家主导"
 JAP_keep_our_fingers_on_the_scale_desc:0 "虽然财阀和经连会从劳动力的自由流动，尤其是强迫劳动所带来的劳动力中受益匪浅，但却出人意料地遭到了进步主义者，军方和技术官僚的强烈反对。进步主义者还是一贯的观点，强迫劳动是不人道的可憎癌症。而军方和技术官僚则相信，国家机器应该成为实行强迫劳动的主体。\n\n也许更好的方案是加大国家对劳动力市场，尤其是在强迫劳动力市场的掌控。这样一来，我们就能把技术官僚绑上战车，一起推动劳动力现代化。长远来看这也可以削弱企业和军方的力量。但是，这仍有可能激怒支持我们的学生，特别是其中的进步派。"
 JAP_solidifying_our_practices:0 "推广现代操作规程"
 JAP_solidifying_our_practices_desc:0 "现代需要现代工业，而现代工业需要现代化的操作规程。我们已经在本土花大力气推广了高水平的操作规程。当局已经推广了新的安全措施，诸如在使用机器和工具前进行安全检查，加强员工紧急处理事故的能力等。我们也花费了大量精力提高工业部门利用资源和生产的效率。\n\n尽管国内的努力已初见成效，但这些新的方法还没有在整个共荣圈推广。现在正是这样做的时机。整个共荣圈的经济都会随着新模式的推广而快速增长。"
 JAP_ending_emergency_measures:0 "结束紧急状态"
 JAP_ending_emergency_measures_desc:0 "战时政策不但在经济方面，还在日本社会中造成了深远的影响。一直维持的战时法律令日本社会停滞，激发的被围困心态阻碍了社会中有才华的人施展能力，还让我们陷入到叛乱——征兵——叛乱的恶性循环。虽然我们以大东亚解放者的姿态赢得了世界大战，但日本人民却并未从胜利中受益多少。\n\n因此，拥有国会多数和贵族院支持的提督将逐步解除总动员法，解除社会经济管制，最终让本土回到应有的和平状态。这是一个大胆的计划，必然会在民间和政坛掀起滔天巨浪。民众将对此欢欣鼓舞，但技术官僚和军方肯定会激烈反对。"
 JAP_looking_closer_at_the_mobilization_laws:0 "废除总动员法"
 JAP_looking_closer_at_the_mobilization_laws_desc:0 "1938年近卫文麿政府通过的《国家总动员法》时至今日还笼罩着整个国家。虽然在二十年前的战时，这一法案在十分关键，但今天已经是无用之物了。这项法案主要聚焦在工会控制、战略产业国有化、价格管控、配给制、宵禁和媒体审查制度几个方面，严重压迫了日本社会。\n\n就像国会在三十年前所做的那样，我们可以以违宪的角度攻击这一法案。又或者我们可以转而用其不符合经济利益和稳健财政的理由，长远来看放松管制和私有化有利于国家财政。\n\n不管用哪种方式，我们都必须废除这一法案，然后重建日本社会。"
 JAP_loosen_the_price_controls:0 "放松价格管制"
 JAP_loosen_the_price_controls_desc:0 "在战时经济中，政府大幅干涉经济以适应国家的需要，而价格管制就是其中的典型手段。政府通过中央物价统制协力会议规定了必需品的价格上下限，但也不可避免地导致了城乡黑市的涌现和犯罪率的增长。\n\n此外，由于陆海军在铝等战略资源上的激烈争夺，价格管制更是在军事和国防工业中引发了资源短缺。民用工业也深受其害。\n\n凭借着木户派和保守派的支持，废除价格管制应该不会受到太大阻碍。我们还需要部署警察和宪兵队以查封黑市。"

 JAP_lighten_the_punishment_clauses_desc:0 "《国家总动员法》中有十八条都在规定如何处罚违反规定的人，而我们的执法部门将这些法条执行得很好……事实上，有些好过头了。即便到了战后，日本国民也时刻笼罩在被特高检举和惩罚的恐惧之中。社会也因而笼罩在不安定的氛围中，动乱频发。\n\n我们最好宽松刑罚法条，这样既能改善我们的公众形象，又能解放出特高资源，派往满洲和中国等海外不安定地区。\n\n一旦日本社会复归常态，就能在精神和物质繁荣中蓬勃发展，实现自由和法律之间的美妙平衡。"
 JAP_ease_press_regulations:0 "减轻新闻管制"
 JAP_ease_press_regulations_desc:0 "像《朝日新闻》和《读卖新闻》这样的权威新闻机构一直是政府控制舆论的可靠工具，但暗地里，那些未经授权的新闻机构一直在散播对日本生活和更重要的日本政治更“真实”的见解。虽然《国家总动员法》合理的通过发行和许可限制压制了这些异见。但如果我们愿意，可以考虑放宽部分媒体限制。\n\n当然，放松这些新闻管制可以提升公众支持，但是放松管制还有另一个隐藏目的：把新闻武器化，通过直接采访、真实反腐，甚至是一些耸人听闻的新闻报道来打压国会中的反对派。\n\n然而，媒体的报道和曝光是一把双刃剑。"
 JAP_expand_the_education_ministry:0 "扩张文部省"
 JAP_expand_the_education_ministry_desc:0 "自明治维新以来，义务教育一直是日本经济增长和现代化的关键驱动力。日本的教育非常注重科学和先进知识的丰富性，充满了一种强大的、坚不可摧的民族精神。\n\n我们应该把削减其他政府支出而节省下来的资金转移到文部省。日本文部省的扩张将专注于提高教育质量和培训。我们还要尤其关注农村地区和共荣圈各处的日本人社区，以便这些忠诚的日本儿女能够与他们的祖国同胞一样享受平等的教育。\n\n此外，我们还将节省一些费用，更新国家教学大纲，以适应整个日本在战后的新局面。"
 JAP_positive_propaganda:0 "正面宣传"

 JAP_looking_ports:0 "调查港口"
 JAP_looking_ports_desc:0 "海军中的可疑货物流通和其他不当行为传闻引发了审查海军的呼声。尽管首相本人是一名海军提督，依赖海军作为盟友，但依然支持审查日本帝国海军。他希望打消公众或其他人对他反腐行动有失偏颇的质疑。虽然高木首相不愿与他最亲密的盟友为敌，但特事特办。\n\n我们将开始对日本和整个共荣圈的所有主要锚地展开审查。所有的货物都必须经过官方检查，港口的记录也必须每日晚上上交。海军会对货物延迟感到不快，但首相确信他有足够的支持去战胜任何挫折。"
 JAP_deflate_numbers:0 "挤出水分"

 JAP_interview_guard_desc:0 "近卫师团是日本帝国陆军中相对独立的一支，是天皇陛下和皇室的保护者。虽然他们对菊花皇座缺乏影响，但理论上同皇室的紧密关系给了我们调查他们的借口。负责天皇安保的人必须在技能和性格上都是顶尖水平。\n\n首相已经得到了皇室的许可，可以面见一些近卫师团成员。这可以达成两个目的，一是确保近卫师团廉洁，二是打探陆军其他分支的腐败信息。让我们希望近卫师团能在第二个问题上有所帮助。"
 JAP_hsinking_contacts:0 "联络新京"
 JAP_hsinking_contacts_desc:0 "满洲国就像是陆军的游乐场。关东军总部就设立在满洲国首都新京。傀儡溥仪也居住在新京的宫墙内。满洲国总理大臣比起协助调查，更关心安抚帝国陆军。他很可能会试图掩盖陆军的罪行。\n\n我们不去找他，而是去找我们在新京的联络人，展开对满洲军事活动的非正式调查。我们的盟友在满洲国是次要人物，但首相知道这是一个优势，没人会怀疑他们敢在陆军眼皮底下给我们发送情报。"
 JAP_wiretap_headquarters:0 "窃听司令部"
 JAP_wiretap_headquarters_desc:0 "我们已经渗透到了关东军的领土，但还未能深入其内部。首相很满意目前得到的情报，并希望满洲的联络人着手开始直接从关东军司令部获取情报。没有比这更好的选择了。关东军司令部设在新京，类似一座堡垒。让几个特工伪装成关东军士兵，进入几个关键地点，窃听，然后在有人发现之前溜出来。这并不难。\n\n一旦我们的触手深入司令部，就能知道关东军试图保守的秘密。根据已有的信息，他们肯定知道些大新闻。"
 JAP_cracks_alliance:0 "联盟的嫌隙"
 JAP_cracks_alliance_desc:0 "多年来，日本帝国陆军和三井财阀之间存在一个原料同盟。二战期间，土肥原贤二大将曾利用三井的香烟工厂生产了大量掺有海洛因的“金蝙蝠”牌香烟，以在中国制造百万计的瘾君子。两方都靠那些上瘾的“顾客”变得十分富有。然而，当陆军开始支持技术官僚时，他们之间的关系紧张起来。虽然我们不关心他们过去所作所为合不合道德，但我们可以利用日本帝国陆军和三井之间的嫌隙。\n\n首相打算以保留三井那份利润为交换，获取陆军的腐败信息。毕竟现在我们还只是针对日本陆军，而非三井……至少目前是这样。"
 JAP_exploiting_peace:0 "利用和平局面"
 JAP_exploiting_peace_desc:0 "我们对军方的审查得到了大量结果，陆军的腐败简直触目惊心。更有趣的是，调查还揭示了陆军在和平时期有多玩忽职守。看来我们的时机抓得恰到好处。现在是时候将政府的全力施加给日本帝国陆军了。\n\n首相下令赶在陆军反应过来之前立即收缴其各类文件及记录。不论是在大阪的军营还是昭南的殖民地驻军司令部，我们的特工都准备好了。我们会适时知道所需的一切，清除日本帝国陆军中的腐败。"
 JAP_cleaning_technocrats:0 "清理技官"
 JAP_cleaning_technocrats_desc:0 "技术官僚在国会被容忍太久了。他们的国有化和自给自足经济压根儿和我们为日本帝国所定的目标背道而驰。而技术官僚和陆军的关系尤其麻烦，陆军已经从这种特殊关系中尝到太多甜头了。让陆军掌控国会绝对是一场灾难。幸运的是，日本内阁的腐败也蔓延到了技术官僚身上。\n\n技术官僚同陆军中奸诈分子的广泛联系成为了我们攻击的充分证据。事实上，他们的合作一定场合下违反了宪法。这一点，加上我们已经取得的贿赂指控，应该足够震撼整个技术官僚阶层。"
 JAP_putting_down_toseiha:0 "镇压统制派"
 JAP_putting_down_toseiha_desc:0 "226事件和1941年东条英机首相上台后，统制派曾经占据了主导地位，但此后一直处在衰落。现在，这个曾经主导了陆军的派系只是一个老年人活动中心。他们是一群领着闲职的疲惫将领，荣誉大过实际，打算舒适地度过人生的最后一段日子。然而，陆军和一部分帝国议会议员依然把这个虚弱团体的意见看得很重。他们的影响力太大，所以我们必须让他们下台。\n\n统制派将领和各种腐败官员商人的联系，给了我们罢免他们的理由。说真的，有人会注意到这些老人被踢出其荣誉职位吗？"
 JAP_revealing_the_roots:0 "追根究底"
 JAP_revealing_the_roots_desc:0 "看来，我们试图控制陆军参谋本部的努力卓有成效。事实证明，对日本陆军强大势力的隐秘打击是有效的。许多下级士官根本没有察觉到管理层的变化。这对首相来说再合适不过了。尽管如此，一些高级军官还在抵制我们的干涉。\n\n有些人有着足以为其杀人来掩盖的秘密。另一些人可以用伪证拉下台。不管那些证据是否真实，一旦暴露出来就能造成伤害。只要那些不合作的军官下台，高木首相就能巩固对参谋本部的控制。"
 JAP_investigate_conservatives:0 "调查保守派"
 JAP_investigate_conservatives_desc:0 "现在由池田领导的保守派就是前首相井野硕哉领导的帝国议会派阀。这些政客满足于井野一手制造的现状，对任何重大改革甚至是折衷妥协都不感兴趣。腐败如此失控和保守派的不作为脱不开关系。即便现在，保守派已经倒台，仍然十分腐败，乐意用政治上的好处换取贿赂。\n\n高木首相将下令对保守派进行全面调查。要找到非法金融交易和幕后交易的证据并不十分困难，毕竟这些犯罪事实已经时众人皆知的秘密了。"
 JAP_crack_bribery:0 "打击贪污"
 JAP_crack_bribery_desc:0 "贿赂是帝国议会声誉的最大污点。任何足够富有的人都可以轻易向选择的政客“慷慨捐赠”。更糟糕的是，议员们甚至互相贿赂。如果国会还想成为一个高效，可信的机构，这些令人发指的“传统”就必须立刻停止。\n\n前几届政府放任这个问题扩大，而高木首相无意重蹈前任首相的覆辙，他将很快开始严惩贿赂。任何收受贿赂或是行贿的政客都将公开受罚。我们的目标是让任何有罪的人成为公众眼中的腐败蠢货。"
 JAP_investigate_reformists:0 "审查改革派"
 JAP_investigate_reformists_desc:0 "虽然我们就是改革派，但高木首相依然希望对众议院中的改革派议员进行正式调查。首相希望从自己派阀中清除那些可能败坏形象或者违背其原则的人。改革派不能被投机客和伪君子玷污形象。\n\n如果被调查的人确实犯有腐败罪，那就将被立刻开除。有些人认为，改革派本就是相对较小的派系，如此严苛有些过分。但他们没法儿和首相争辩，首相是不会改主意的。"
 JAP_searching_union:0 "彻查产报"
 JAP_searching_union_desc:0 "产业报国会，简称产报，是一个国家控制的工会。产报的成立是为了控制工会工人，清除激进劳工。虽然我们对该组织的运作有着广泛控制，但产报的成员中有许多工人，这意味着这一组织具有相当大的影响力。然而，这一组织领导层随时间变得越来越腐败，他们从产报的金库中取钱以供个人挥霍。这使得安抚工人变得越来越危险。我们必须使产报的领导层恢复正常运转，否则就直接换人。首相下令后，产报就会被彻底审查。"
 JAP_maintaining_reputation:0 "维护声誉"
 JAP_maintaining_reputation_desc:0 "对大政翼赞会的全面审查还在继续，首相开始考虑以何种方式公开这一调查。目前，调查还是一件隐秘的事情。虽然我们不介意公开羞辱那些贪官污吏，公众对目前的进展依然一无所知。没有官方公示，谣言就会满天飞，损害翼赞会的声誉。\n\n高木首相将向全国讲话来遏制流言。首相的目的是让人们明白，腐败的不是大政翼赞会，而是外部腐败渗透了翼赞会。我们要做的是从那些利用不正当手段进行破坏活动的人手中保护翼赞会。对于人们来说，这无疑是一幅鼓舞人心的画面？"
 JAP_determine_involvement:0 "确定涉事华族"
 JAP_determine_involvement_desc:0 "截至目前，贵族院还一直回避我们的审查。我们对此暂持默认态度主要出于下院，即帝国议会的腐败问题实在太过严重。然而，如果要说华族是无辜的，那可就是睁眼说瞎话了。即便华族的名号广受尊重，也很少有人会认为华族是美德和高尚的同义词。毕竟，过去已经有很多针对华族的腐败控诉了。\n\n高木首相决心确保这些指控不会威胁他的政府。让贵族院屈服于贿赂和欺诈无论在任何情形下都是不值得忍受的失败。审查很快会扩大到上下两院，寻找两者之间的任何腐败联系。无论是不是华族，我们对帝国议会成员都有着严格要求。"
 JAP_public_servants_warehouse:0 "巡查每间仓库"
 JAP_public_servants_warehouse_desc:0 "前首相井野并不是一个有着敏锐观察力的人。他听任剧烈经济动荡发生在眼皮底下，似乎对危机的发生毫无想法，或者只是干脆无视了一切迹象。无论如何，他的疏忽造成的影响不能再继续下去了。\n\n上届政府执政期间，各处仓储都是腐败和故意的“管理不善”滋生的温床。没有人乐意看到仓库空无一人的景象。因此，首相聘请了大量公务员巡查各地的仓库。他们的任务是报告任何可疑行为，无论是仓管，工人还是送货人员。在知道粗心大意会酿成什么苦果之后，我们再小心也不为过。"
 JAP_bureaucrats_port:0 "巡查每座港口"
 JAP_bureaucrats_port_desc:0 "港口是帝国基础设施的重要组成部分。绝大部分货品流通都会途径港口。因而维护和恰当管理港口是一项特别重要的任务。遗憾的是，井野政府并没有加以重视。港口成为了公司腐败和严重渎职的切入口。绝不能再让港口和货舱空空如也了。\n\n在首相的命令下，政府官僚将仔细监控共荣圈所有港口的活动，并报告一切腐败或其他可疑活动。我们必须不惜代价保证港口正常运转。"
 JAP_no_member_untouched:0 "无人可逃"
 JAP_no_member_untouched_desc:0 "井野政府倒台的那段时期已经过去一阵子了。井野内阁的前成员和他忠实的翼赞会派阀自从那时起就消失在了阴影中。或许他们认为只要避避风头就能官复原职，但首相可没有忘记他们那罄竹难书的罪行。是时候确保他们永远无法回到权力场了。\n\n我们已经开始会谈，希望在下次选举前取消一部分井野派成员的候选人资格。首相会和其他成员谈话，希望他们能够理智地认清自己只不过是一名大政翼赞会的普通议员，正如他们很久之前就该那样做的。"
 JAP_no_harm_change:0 "无痛变革"
 JAP_no_harm_change_desc:0 "财阀的时代该结束了。虽然这一点还未显端倪，但我们确信这必须成为现实。过去几年财阀的权力斗争和腐败影响已经清楚证明他们无法成为可信的经济基石。\n\n另一方面，经连会在这个艰难时期证明了自己的能力，能够适应现代经济。自从我们掌权以来，他们一直渴望与我们的政府建立积极关系。他们的热情和承诺似乎足够交换我们的资助。另外，日本经济主导权的易手并不是件坏事。"
 JAP_corporate_decentralisation:0 "分散企业"
 JAP_corporate_decentralisation_desc:0 "旧体制的最大缺陷就在于人们迷信与政界勾结的财阀能大而不倒。过去几个月发生的一切证明了这是一个严重错误。东京应该减少对商界的干涉，以避免安田那种事再次发生。我们应该鼓励现有企业向新领域扩张，并将这些领域的中小企业纳入其中。"
 JAP_swapping_contracts:0 "互换合同"
 JAP_swapping_contracts_desc:0 "政府可以将一些长期合同承包给经连会的工业部门。财阀再也不是唯一为东京工作的企业集团了。自由竞争会告诉那些董事，旧体系再也不能保障他们的地位了。经连会会更加繁荣，而财阀也将努力做得更好。"
 JAP_aiding_espionage:0 "资助间谍"
 JAP_aiding_espionage_desc:0 "向经连会提供补贴和贷款可以提升其竞争力，但如果没有一些“更隐蔽”的手段辅助，像三菱和住友这样的庞然大物几乎不可能被超越。虽然对经连会的商业间谍行为睁一只眼闭一只眼可能会引发丑闻，把政府置于好似公司傀儡的处境，但这是值得的，另外，如果我们主动提供我们知道的财阀内部信息，对经连会会更有帮助。"
 JAP_enticing_parliament:0 "怂恿国会"
 JAP_enticing_parliament_desc:0 "帝国议会是大部分政客的舞台，是翼赞会平静海面下秘密交易和小山头暗流涌动的洋底。要说服每个议员相信经连会是更好的选择是不可能的，更不用说说服他们为此投票了。但在某些议员的选区兴建新工厂或机构肯定可以说服他们偏向我们的立场。"
 JAP_working_with_intrigue:0 "阴谋诡计"
 JAP_working_with_intrigue_desc:0 "安田事件的腐败丑闻足以让任何一位首相下台。为了确保我们能够从类似规模的事件中幸存，或者至少和有罪政客作出切割，我们需要一些额外措施。把我们的触角伸进财阀政治的复杂网络很困难，但我们在董事会的耳目将使我们能够在任何可疑交易之前做出反应。"
 JAP_encourage_merge:0 "鼓励并购"
 JAP_encourage_merge_desc:0 "安田财阀和危机中其他严重受创企业的剩余股份和债务，已经是经济回暖的严重负担。我们应该向剩下的财阀提供贷款来收购这些残余资产。这可以挽救许多工作岗位，并为全日本各地日渐扩张机构提供另一批经验丰富的专业人士。"
 JAP_privatize_academic_rd:0 "科研机构私有化"
 JAP_privatize_academic_rd_desc:0 "日本各地有数百名教授向我们申请研究和实验经费，但那些项目不一定符合政府的需求。向企业开放资助研究的渠道可以为科研提供另一种融资渠道。最符合实际，贴近工业发展利益的研究项目将获得最多的资金。"
 JAP_you_scratch_back:0 "企业回报"
 JAP_you_scratch_back_desc:0 "我们的帮助使财阀能够恢复稳定，我们应该让高管明白，政府是财阀的盟友而非敌人。其他企业不会重蹈安田覆辙，一旦我们弥补了系统性的旧缺陷，东京金融不会再一次崩溃，带来类似的衰退了。"

 JAP_colonial_permits_desc:0 "共荣圈蕴藏的巨大资源储备对我们工业和经济的繁荣发展至关重要。许多资源的所有权十分模糊，但一些合同可以规定提取、加工资源的具体细节。这将为财阀提供一个轻松盈利的渠道，同时确保日本工业生产的稳定。"
 JAP_industrial_blank_cheques:0 "工业空白支票"
 JAP_industrial_blank_cheques_desc:0 "财阀恢复运转后，许多董事和高管依然担忧着另一场足以摧毁他们毕生奋斗所得的灾难。我们有着足够的资金满足他们的需要，保证他们的安全。然而，直接的合同或承诺一旦泄露，就可以用来反对我们的政府，因此一些非正式援助是最好的选择，安抚财阀，同时规避风险。"

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Fruits_Of_the_Reforms_desc:0 "高木的政府逐渐稳定，改革派终于可以关注他们的执政纲领了。内阁需要解决井野政府未能解决的诸多经济、殖民地和日益严重的社会政治分歧问题。最后一项如果不能妥善解决，可能会在接下来的几十年内一直困扰日本。幸运的是，高木惣吉首相已经有了所有上述问题的解决方案。\n\n经济问题的执掌者将是中曾根康弘，一位信奉激进经济重组的舵手。对于殖民地问题，提督将恪守日本人论，强调日本是大东亚共荣圈的养育者和保护者。而在社会问题方面，首相决心视情况而定灵活地实现他的改革目标。技术官僚、木户派和保守派已经在日本政治舞台上上演过精彩的表演了，现在，是改革派大展身手的时候了。"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nakasone_Plan:0 "中曾根的计划"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nakasone_Plan_desc:0 "几十年来，日本的经济模式始终没有与时俱进。自从明治维新，日本在一个世纪内始终维持着政府对经济的强力干预和向军工业全面倾斜的政策。然而，最伟大帝国也不能在缺乏改革的情况下生存。日本现今的经济模式没有自由竞争，也不会带来创新，反而是让经济巨头们过于自满，缺乏前进的动力。\n\n中曾根康弘是个行事有计划的人。他摒弃了过去传统的做法，承诺将日本经济引入新模式中。中曾根康弘的目标是实现一个类似美国和其他西方国家的自由化经济系统，通过自由市场和鼓励竞争实现经济快速增长，进而推动社会改革。如果人民能够幸福地享受发展的成果，异议就会大幅减少。"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Push_For_Privitization:0 "推动私有化"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Push_For_Privitization_desc:0 "中曾根康弘计划的第一步是私有化冗余国家机构。长期的经济干预政策积累了大量效率低下的国有资产。前几届政府从未接近，也无意于尝试根除困扰国家的过度政府扩张，将大笔资金注入到于人民福祉无关的领域。这些过度开支榨干了国家财政，真正有用的项目反而缺乏资金。\n\n中曾根康弘的解决方案很简单，把这些赔钱货卖给能够更好利用它们的企业。政府可以拍卖冗余资产，收回投资资金，同时提供更多的投资渠道。随着维护冗余机构的开销大幅降低，政府节约的资金可以通过商业活动重新进入经济活动中。"

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Showa_Steels_Unprofitability_desc:0 "昭和制钢所建于1918年，以天皇陛下的年号命名，是位于满洲国的一家钢铁厂。到中日战争期间，它是帝国乃至于全世界最重要的工业中心之一。然而，昭和制钢所这些年发展所并不好。随着军事开支下降，制钢已经无利可图，成了国家和人民的负担。前几届政府出于尊重继续维持了补贴，但制钢所在那段时间严重消耗了国家的收入。\n\n作为大规模私有化计划的一部分，中曾根康弘向高木承诺，凭借高木在海军中的影响力，昭和制钢所会主动参与到私有化进程中去。像往常一样，高木不情愿地同意了。"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Fiscal_Responsibility:0 "财务责任"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Fiscal_Responsibility_desc:0 "毫无疑问，日本政府关怀自己的国民。通过无数的项目和倡议，政府努力缩小穷人同富人、病人同健康人、失业者同就业者之间的差距。然而许多，甚至是大部分项目都是白做工。中曾根康弘认为，过去的几届政府的开支太大，收益太低。政府为了那些社会的负担承担了太多债务。\n\n财务责任将是高木首相经济政策的关键词。日本公民每年都应纳税，因而政府应该只对纳税人负责。政府必须精简，精简，再精简，直到在经济上可持续。政府只应保持必要的最小规模。无论中曾根康弘还是内阁，都不能原谅人们的懒惰。提督治下的日本不养懒汉。"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Curbing_Government_Spending:0 "控制政府开支"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Curbing_Government_Spending_desc:0 "中曾根康弘认为，每个政府的首要职责都是对它收缴的税负责。日本政府近年来不得不负责国防、福利、经济发展和许许多多其他的事务，财政开支实在太过巨大了。日本为了维持普通日本公民的高生活水平被迫负债，多么有奉献精神，多么对公民负责。\n\n然而，感恩不能维持政府的运转。显然，继续维持高支出是不可持续的。政府将继续本着中曾根提出的财务责任原则，继续削减不必要的开支，努力实现预算平衡。不要为懒汉和乞丐定计划，不要向过度膨胀的军队扔钱，政府应该确保资金流向正确的对象，那些负责任的公民。"

While the youths generally support the end of sterilisation for patients of leprosy and for inheritable conditions deemed undesirable by the public, Katō herself has been rather tight-lipped over the issue.

The Prime Minister is sure that his unfiltered consumer protections act would pass in the Imperial Diet with their support. Therefore, we shall allow the technocrats to operate as they see fit, within reason. It is even possible that the Prime Minister takes onboard some of their suggestions. We have already caused a stir by agreeing to collaborate with them in the first place, so there is little point in trying to moderate the matter.\n\nFinance Minister Nakasone is bound to be most unhappy as a result, but he and his corporate allies do not trouble us at the moment.

Perhaps the boldest among these is their proposal for a \"Protections bureau\". This organization would oversee corporations and have the powers to curtail them should they step out of line. In contrast to a similar proposal by the conservatives, this \"technocratic protections bureau\" would be granted much more direct authority. While this would certainly ensure the Zaibatsu and Keiretsu behave themselves, the bureau itself might have some issues.\n\nThe technocrats have been very clear that they would be heavily involved with its creation and staffing. By giving them the greenlight, they would attain some significant power. However, this is one of the compromises we must make. The Prime Minister is fully aware that there is no backing down now and it is hard to not look at the positives in this particular instance."

With this in mind, the Prime Minister has made it clear that the corporations are not to have a say in the coming changes. Using the information we gathered with our corruption investigations as well as a few pieces of information gathered by the technocrats, we should be able to silence the corporations for the near future. It is doubtful that they wish to make their difficult situation any worse.\n\nIt is undeniable that this harsh tactic has gone against some of the principles of the reformist clique, but Prime Minister Takagi releases that this is the right path forward.

This will be done within reason of course, but it is still important that they are at least somewhat satisfied with the terms of our alliance. Once this is done, it is far more likely that our allies will actively work towards the implementation of the reforms.\n\nThe second part of our plan is just as critical as the fist. We must now choose how we are going to counteract or subdue the influence of the corporations. While some of them are open to negotiation, the others will require the use of more indirect tactics.

Getting the finance minister has been something of a hassle, but it should be of immense value to our cause. Nakasone, due to his great popularity within corporate circles, is the man with the most sway with the keiretsu in the government. He would be more than capable of cutting a few deals with the right people, in order to get some of the corporations off our backs. Given enough time and some of them might even see the light of supporting the new laws. Surely it is good for business to appear consumer-friendly?

However, the sheer scale of such an operation is nearly impossible for the employees of the ministry of finance to handle at the moment. During this critical phase on the road to enforce protective legislation, it is vital that our bureaucracy can function at utmost effectiveness. The Prime Minister has therefore given the green light to expanding the responsible departments to a suitable size.

Not everyone sees the light of this approach unfortunately. The presence of hardliners in the Diet has hindered the Prime Minister's mission to gather enough votes. Regardless of if they are proponents of deregulation or nationalization, these voices are little more than sources of provocation.\n\nSome of the hardliners can fortunately be swayed by promises of compensation or ressaunces of further reforms.

Their rights as consumers are now better defined, and more government oversight is to begin in corporate circles. The latter point takes the form of a \"Protections Bureau\", which would act as a government watchdog, with the power to quickly act upon corporate malpractice and abuse. Although Prime Minister Takagi had originally hoped for a more radical act, it would appear that his concerns have now been mitigated. There is little doubt that this set of reforms will pass through both houses of the Imperial Diet.

Petty names aside, the reforms we are proposing have certainly been somewhat influenced by the input of our allies. The core ideals are largely based on those proposed by the Prime Minister, that of a government that is empowered to deal with the misdeeds of Keiretsu and Zaibatsu alike. However, the involvement of the technocrats has taken these initial ideas further.\n\nShould this act become law then we, and our allies will have the power to greatly curtail the powers of the corporations.

We will order the research, development, and deployment of the most modern nuclear weapons technologies across our Empire. We refuse to be held hostage by our enemies' call to war and claims of armament, and so we must unveil our arsenal so that they, too, will consider threats of retaliation and thermonuclear destruction."

Both of the old men sipped their teas and continued to watch the great stretches of the Pacific waters, occasionally pointing at a bird or another freighter ship charging into the bay.\n\nThey didn't bother bringing any fishing equipment with them, as their cynicism had already judged the government had replaced any desire to support fishing communities with the profits of offshore fishing operations and using the ports for shipping. In fact, these men were far too old to even climb down to the harbor to fish. They had no choice but to watch the buoys dance in the distant waters and listen to the gusts of ocean winds as prisoners of their old age.

Only encouraging the man, Nakasone pulled out a handkerchief and scribbled a rough graph in a weak black ink.

The scribbled handkerchief was placed on the Prime Minister's arm rest as Nakasone continued to babble over intricacies of taxation levels across Japan, seemingly unaware the Kabuki theater was still airing a performance. Embarrassed by Nakasone's ignorance of his surroundings, and as the stringing of the Shamisen grew more intense, Takagi grabbed the handkerchief and leaned over to Nakasone, interrupting him with a dry and low grumble:\n\n\"Look, I'll cut taxes and regulations.

He glanced over the rows of chattering machines, each one manned by a famished and sweaty worker toiling for hours without break. The intense buzz in the air formed a thick mist; industrial chemicals seeping from the churns of production appliances were an awful stench filling Nakasone's nose. He covered his face in disgust, and awkwardly smiled back at his company of advisors, before again gazing at the filthy and cramped factory floor.\n\nThe manager of the sweatshop approached the group of men from the railing's stairs and, with a heavy hand, shook Nakasone's hand, greeting him and thanking him for his visit. Nakasone, in the presence of a fellow business-orientated mind, smiled back and chuckled, and began to confess his appreciation of the great output of the manager's industrial facility. Both the men grinned, and began to talk of plans for the state-backed expansion of the plant in a series of programs to develop the economy. Nakasone and the manager talked for a long while, until the exhausted workers around the factory seemed more interested in the government visit than in their laborious work.\n\nNoticing and signalling a colleague, the manager ordered the workers back to their stations in a blustering scream, and the fatigued operators were hurried back to their buzzing machines. Yelling and shrieking followed, causing a small ruckus before being dissipated by other members of staff dragging workers away to be punished. To Nakasone and his party of advisors, this was a great display of modern industrial discipline and they began to applaud the manager's skill. He returned to the manager with a soft grin, and continued announcing government plans to develop the facility for even greater output."

Still as ever, the Prime Minister called out to Nakasone, but he did not answer; his breath only drew heavier gasps of air.\n\nTakagi opened his eyes and raised his brow, concerned for his colleague. Nakasone was silent for a moment longer, and then began to confess in a shaken voice of his own shortcomings. Hiding his glossy eyes from the Prime Minister, he slowly explained he believed the erratic pace of economic liberalization across Japan was self-destructive, both for him and the empire. Drawing heavier breaths, he confessed further into his worries and stresses that came with the responsibilities of his office - in particular, wondering if he was going to have to live with the shame of dismissal. Nakasone's head was low and his voice grew weaker, though he continued to face the showering rains just beyond the window's glass.\n\nTakagi stood up from his leather chair and made his way over to Nakasone, standing by his side and staring out of the great window, remaining silent for a moment. Upon hearing a few quiet sniffles, the Prime Minister slowly raised his arm to place his hand on Nakasone's shoulders in an attempt to comfort him. \"Moderation,\" the Prime Minister said lightly to assure Nakasone.

The sharpness at which he did this was enough to snap Nakasone to attention, cutting his anecdote about shipping regulation short.\n\n\"How do you think the people in that place live, Nakasone? I suspect they all slave away in fields.\"\n\nNakasone was taken aback by the suddenness of the question, but was quick to provide an answer.\n\n\"It is certainly likely that they live in squalor and I suspect you are correct that they do little in terms of productive work. The same could be said of most of the Chinese labour force, it's a complete waste of manpower.\"\n\nIntrigued by the comments of the Finance Minister, Takagi turned away from the map.\n\n\"Do you think they could be put to better use?\"\n\n\"Indeed they could. Those townsfolk are wasted in the fields. They should be used to industrialize and diversify the local economy. It might even result in them gaining some spending power, which is never a bad thing for a growing economy.\"\n\nTakagi pleased to hear Nakasone provide him with a decent proposal, without it being marred in excessive detail. Making the Chinese townsfolk more productive was undoubtedly good and if they happened to personally benefit too, then that was quite acceptable.\n\n\"Very well, Nakasone.

The company car at the airport had taken him and his assistant directly to the growing industrial district, without as much as a scenic view of the city proper. Nakasone had briefly rolled down the window, but immediately rolled it back up upon inhaling the air. He realised that the hundreds of smoking chimneys should have altered him to not do this in the first place.\n\nThe factories eventually faded away, being replaced by an office complex. At the end of the road was Nakasone's destination, where he would be meeting with the man in charge of the facility he had just passed through. As he stepped out of the car, Nakasone was pleased that the air was considerably more pleasant there, but he did not wish to linger. He was quickly led inside the building to the facility manager's office. The manager himself got out of his chair and swiftly performed a rehearsed bow.\n\n\"We are honored that you decided to visit our plant first, Minister. How has your journey been so far?\n\nNakasone, whose schedule included at least a dozen visits to such plants was quick to change to topic.\n\n\"Everything has been quite satisfactory. Now, if you do not mind, I would very much like to discuss the matter of requisitioning some of your workforce. This would be a relatively short time contract, just some work aimed at developing the local economy. Before you responded, it should be noted that this is a government matter, one that the Prime Minister has taken great interest in.\n\nAh yes, I understand, Minister. I must ask how I will be compensated for such a deal. This will cost us a great deal of time.\n\nHaving expected to hear such words, Nakasone gestured for his assistant to open the briefcase he was carrying. A mere look at the money contained within was enough for the manager.\n\n\"Yes, I think that should do nicely. You have my humblest thanks, minister\".

After laughing and chuckling for hours before, the conversation suddenly became very somber and gloomy as Takagi began to speak of his troubled childhood in the quiet of the night sky that stretched above them:\n\n\"I remember going to bed some nights hungry. I remember my education consisting of learning how to read and write in a brick room. We had chalkboards to write words, and we were beaten for thinking anything above and beyond what our teacher wanted. It was no way for a child to live. I don't want that for the children of today.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister continued to speak of his poor upbringing and education, but was not overwhelmed by emotion. Instead, he was rather cold and bitter, seemingly uncaring of the past he no longer lived in. Nakasone, interpreting this as an opportunity to weigh in, compared his childhood to Takagi's; he smirked and spoke of the silly stories and memories he had with friends. He mumbled about learning French in his adolescence and reading the Aeneid, forgetting all but a few words from each, and poking the Prime Minister as he recalled childhood stories of classroom pranks in his peaceful, idyllic youth.\n\nNakasone took a gulp of champagne, knocking his head back as he swallowed, before returning his vision to the Prime Minister.

The boy hurled open his backpack, drawing sheets of paper and pencils and spreading them across the table before scurrying over to grab a jar of pennies from beneath his father.\n\nThe boy's mother called to him whilst paying attention to her meal, not quite understanding her son's dexterity to his homework, but impressed at his new-found studious attitude towards his work. Language, she assumed, as her son had been piecing together his understanding of the complexities of Kanji characters. As she brought over the wooden bowl of seafood to her husband, she peered down to see the boy's work and gasped - numbers! Small columns and tables were sprawled across the boy's sheets of paper as he used the pennies to count, with answers to simple problems scribbled in pencil lead beneath symbols of multiplication and division. She called over her husband, who in turn hurried over to examine the papers and observe his son.\n\nHe flicked through the papers; each creased sheet reading 'Science' or 'Mathematics', reading with basic problems or chemical formulas with diagrams printed onto them. The boy's father scratched his head and gazed down at him, smiling and clearly proud. Both parents were amazed that even their boy, who lived in rural Hokkaidō, was educated with the standard expected children in the southern islands.

Do you believe that the economy can benefit from such measures?\"\n\nNakasone was already quite aware of a few ways that the economy could gain from government investments in science. The question he posed was merely a way to understand Takagi's own reasoning.\n\n\"Giving grant money to deserving scientists could greatly speed up the pace at which new technologies enter the market. The corporations are sure to then fund anything of value at that point, which will make said products more economically viable to the general population.\n\n\"You have clearly thought this proposal through, sir. I think it sounds like a fine idea. However, you should carefully consider your options when it comes to handing out the grants. Our budget should not be wasted on dead-end research.\"\n\nWishing to attend to some intricate matter, Naksone excused himself with a polite bow. The Prime Minister was somewhat surprised that his suggestion had gone down so well. He had been expecting the Finance Minister to either explain to him the intricate details of how to implement a better plan or even dismiss the idea as nonesone.

Another soft breeze blew through the gardens, and the whoosh of leaves brought a heavenly calm to Takagi. For Nakasone, however, he was overcome with an overwhelming anxiety. Turning to Takagi, he expressed his worries that he had not done enough during his time as Minister of Finance, and accused himself of failure before sinking his head in shame.\n\nTakagi, as stoic and serene as ever, grabbed Nakasone by the shoulders and patted him on the back, assuring him that he had nothing to worry about.

Economic liberalization, as Nakasone and Tadashi always argued for, would be pitted against whatever reform plan had taken up Zenjiro's interest. He would side with Zenjiro, there would be some arguments, and ultimately they would forge a compromise so that Japan could continue to progress. This procedure had become so commonplace that they would sometimes skip straight to the compromise segment.\n\nTakagi took his seat, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled the weekly reports until he could see the recent news going about. But... something was off. The cabinet had been unusually silent as he was entering, rather than their typical rowdiness. Zenjiro was leaning forward, prepared to speak. Strange. Zenjiro wasn't the type to jump into arguments. And, for some ungodly reason, Kido was missing.

The youth has, for reasons yet unknown, been experiencing an uptick in anti-government behavior. Now, that isn't abnormal, but the rate and scale of this all is... bewildering. Across the Home Islands, local governments are reporting vandalism and disobedience en masse. Nothing has been concluded, but we suspect that our lack of social reform may have something to do with it.

A woman being denied to a political position was a regular act of oppression, no different to the ones they all experienced day after day. The beating and mutilation of an innocent woman just for carrying around the wrong book was the limit of their patience, however. They kicked at the walls, preparing their feet for the real thing. Out of their backpacks and purses, they unfurled wooden clubs and antique guns. They were going to fight, if need be. A leader of the students' union marched onto a lunch table, and as they began to speak the mob silenced itself.\n\n\"Let's get this over with. The government and police have transformed this spark into a flame. The police no longer enforce law and principle. Instead, they're all thugs. Criminals who march across our streets, beating and maiming anyone who threatens their hegemony. Where once they stopped wrongdoers and misfits, they have transformed into your local death squad! A terrorist organization the government has taught us to call 'law enforcement.' It is in this period of sorrow we must act. Get the government working for the greater good, I say! Tomorrow, a couple hours after schooling has ended, let us all congregate by the university's lecture hall. Once we get the chance, we take over and proclaim our message. Get this out to other universities, the times are going to change whether they want it to or not!\"\n\nThe mob chanted to the tune of revolt. They raised their fists to their chests and foreheads.

 japtakagirecon.41.d:0 "They walked through the halls of Keio University, average students and scholars, born into a world of tradition without a notion of revolution or change. All of that had changed once a single word had stormed through their minds and ink, Katō. With Katō, they were at last able to see the injustice that surrounded them, and with knowledge, they could fight that injustice. This generation was not unified, however. Although all followed Katō, they varied from reformers to revolutionaries. One question lingered in the minds of those who wanted change: how do we make the government listen? Protests, riots, terror? No matter, things had to change somehow, and they would be the ones to bring it about. News was going around that universities across the nation were all staging incidents to force the government's hand. Keio was special, in that regard. Its students were those uplifted from the lower class, the next generation of parvenus. The student body itched at the trigger, prepared to take extreme action to bring about Katō's vision.\n\nThe bell rang, and so the students dragged out backpacks, purses and packages. What emerged was weaponry, make-shift batons and bludgeons, even the occasional pistol. They stormed the halls, breaking through into the general offices of the university. The teachers took their chance to evacuate, and in their absence the PA systems were left open for use in the student's mission. A grainy, blaring voice spread their message throughout the halls, classrooms and dormitories of the university. \"Spread the word, the next generation has taken command of Keio University. Our demands are simple, and the living conditions we ask for are matched across the world. First, a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho. We are not barbarians who freely murder our own citizens over their skills and abilities. Secondly, the government must answer for the beating and maiming of all those, across the nation, who have done nothing but read the works of Katō Shidzue. Katō's autobiography should be unbanned, and the government should rein in the police force. Such acts are crimes against morality. Lastly, the government should, as should have been done already, support the victims of the fallout of the economic crisis. The question remains, until our demands are fulfilled, who do you serve?\""

He could not remedy ills if he was ignorant of the facts. Zenjiro's foreboding message of a discontented youth had proven deadly accurate. If Zenjiro looked anxious or prepared to give a speech, Takagi would know something was up. As Takagi threw his briefcase onto the board room table, he searched for Zenjiro's face. After looking...\n\nWhere was he? Zenjiro was missing, but at least the rest of the cabinet had arrived, even Kido. Takagi could recognize when something was wrong, Zenjiro was not the type to miss his meetings.\n\nHe shot into the conversation, looking to break the aura of mystery surrounding the past month. \"Where is Zenjiro? Look, just tell me what is going on. You are my cabinet, are you not? If something is wrong, why have I not heard of it?\"\n\nKido looked about. The rest of the cabinet were sheepishly silent. Although he didn't want the task of reining in Takagi, he had become numb to the less enviable aspects of politicking. \"Takagi, Zenjiro is missing because of the students. The youth have staged a series of purposeful 'incidents' across universities all throughout the nation. Most importantly, the students of Keio University have occupied the school grounds and are refusing to give up until their demands are met. A woman, Katō Shidzue, almost made it into the Diet, but upon failing she published her autobiography, which has inspired widespread protests, revolts even. They want the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho and a smattering of other demands. Zenjiro is attempting to defuse the situation, and it is my belief that we can still negotiate with the students.\"\n\nTakagi looked around the table. Nakasone, although keeping quiet, was clearly seething with rage. His elbows rested on the table, and his hands covered his mouth.

He had gotten this far, and the students had agreed to step down if, and only if, the government took action concerning their core demand of repealing the Kokumin Yuseiho. Of course, this wasn't preferable, but at least they agreed to step down at all. Takagi summoned his cabinet for an emergency meeting, so that they could agree to what sort of action they should take. Nakasone would be adamantly opposed, that was-\n\n\"Takagi, please. The whole point of this maneuver was bait and switch. They agree to step down in exchange for us taking action, and once they do step down, we intervene and put a silent end to these shenanigans. We were never meant to actually fulfill our end of the deal, we agreed to that. This was supposed to teach them a lesson without risk of harm, for fear of further backlash. We've accomplished what we've set out to do, there is no more discussion to be had. Arrest the students, put them up for the crimes they have committed in vandalizing and destroying Keio University's property, and move on. As I said earlier, we are not puppets of prepubescent mobs.\"\n\nUrgh. Nakasone was at it again. He couldn't accept a single gesture of good faith, any sign that we're not the corrupt backstabbers our youth sees us as. That's how Nakasone wins, compromising in a way such that he doesn't have to compromise. Perhaps- no. No more. We will demonstrate to our constituents our character and moral fiber. Besides, perhaps investigating the legitimacy of the Kokumin Yuseiho wouldn't be a bad idea?\n\n\"Nakasone, it is already decided. A committee will be formed to investigate the constitutional legality of the Kokumin Yuseiho. If we are not to act, the youth will view us as backstabbers. Protests, and perhaps more revolts will arise across the nation. This is the least we can do.

Takagi's piecemeal and unenthusiastic pace of social reform had not, it turned out, put an end to the youth movement's desire for progress. The Keio University Incident was what was on the headlines, a betrayal as it was painted. The students had only wanted a few reforms, most of all the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho, which continued to see through that supposed 'inferiors' were murdered or sterilized. Takagi's bandaid remedy to the deaths of innocents was not, in retrospect, a gentle way to approach the issue. Sure, a committee was formed to question the legality of the Kokumin Yuseiho, but it did nothing and continued to do nothing. Katō wrote a scathing op-ed in all mainstream newspapers, who were all too happy to accept the circulation of their papers for free. It was on everyone's minds: the youth movement was ever more enraged, and Takagi could not continue to prevent the march of social progress.\n\n\"Takagi Sōkichi claims to be the leader of the reformist faction of the Yokusankai, and yet his actions are painted with the colors of blind reaction and the blood of the honorable. Every day, a man, woman or child is forever more deprived of a future wherein they can birth life of their own, all due to a label of inferiority gifted to them by our government. Every day, thousands of infants, innocent souls just given consciousness, are forcefully deprived of their parents to be exterminated en masse in the fires of our government's bloodlust.

The students offered little resistance, and what they could muster all paled in comparison to military weaponry. A gang of roving military policemen investigated the end of a corridor, the lights having been shattered in the chaos of the past week.

He was sloppily dressed, his suit hanging loosely on his body. A stream of papers leaked from his briefcase with every shamble of his legs. Something had happened, and he would have to take the fall. It was never meant to come to this; Takagi did not want anyone dead from these antics. Yet, people were dying. Not just those students, but every infant killed due to the Kokumin Yuseiho. Some would say Takagi was buying into the propaganda, but he couldn't ignore the reality of sterilization and extermination which pervaded the Japanese system. He was supposed to be a reformist, a reformer. What had happened...?\n\nTakagi pushed into the boardroom, exhausted after the long night of scheduling and fuming at the notion that students had died under his administration. It was an unusual sort of anger for Takagi. He was never a furious or vindictive man. He took his anger out in controlled bursts of frustration, always in the form of pragmatic analyses turned attacks. He could be hostile, yes, but never openly enraged. This day would be different. This day, Takagi was explosive.\n\n\"Nakasone. What have you done? There are students, children, dead on the floor of Keio University because of your actions, your propositions! Why... Why could we not have negotiated? Why did you have to suggest we crack down, we beat down children? You act like lives and people are nothing. I truly wonder, Nakasone. Why do you do what you do? Is there any reason you oppose a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho? From the looks of it, you mindlessly put your faith in systems which are killing people. Killing people, Nakasone!

He was, too, a student with radical dreams once. He thought he could transform the navy from the inside into a liberalized, less militaristic organization. He had succeeded, but these children had not. Frustrated by an oppressive system, they rebelled. They lost, of course, in the most tragic of ways. Takagi shed a few tears as he looked over their cobblestone plaques. The fog and humid mist of the horizon was all that would welcome his sadness.\n\nA few camera flashes and forlorn questions thrown pitifully against his back greeted his return to the reality of Japan and its politics. Some straggler journalists had followed him here, so it seemed. Even in the abyss of the mind, he could not attain privacy. Takagi turned to the journalists, prepared to make an announcement.\n\n\"To all of those who may be listening in, I would like to make a promise. The deaths of these students, dark though it may seem, were acts of martyrdom for a righteous cause, and I will see to it that their cause does not die before justice is done. This situation will be handled appropriately. It has been my resolve, ever since the beginning of my premiership, to see to it that the innocent and good-willed do not experience pain for nothing. I cannot undo their deaths, but I will fight for their legacies.\"\n\nThe rains were picking up again, and with their arrival Takagi made his leave.

He threw away the reports and began to scan through the article and its defaming content, trying not to become overwhelmed with fury from the scrap of political dissent.\n\nThe article decried the 'horrible abuses of the Takagi government' as brutal and barbaric, branding the Prime Minister as 'not worthy of Japan.' Takagi smirked, skeptical of Katō's sanity, and continued flicking through the article's claims. He came across phrases such as 'treasonous against the freedom of humanity' and 'a misogyny amplified to imperial standards', and chuckled harder at the outrageousness of their claims.\n\nAfter reading some of the terms to Kido, the Prime Minister found Katō's section on the recent student protests. She remained ambiguous over her support of the student protests, but noted that the more Takagi's police used violence, the more violent the students would grow. Takagi, lost for words, read this over many times. The students grew louder and louder each day, motivated by their resistance against law enforcement. He had already thought it, already seen it.

Bearing hundreds of signs and placards, the protesters call for an end to the Kokumin Yuseiho as well as various pieces of Tōjō-era wartime legislation. They marched towards the Diet, chanting cries of reform like a vast swarm of wasps. The mass gathering of protesters buzzed through the city, frothing at the mouth in search for anyone to hold accountable.\n\nTakagi sat with his cabinet in his office, the crowds only a few streets away. Law enforcement redirected the masses of people, but the Prime Minister knew they'd eventually reach his building. He tapped his finger repeatedly on his desk; his eyes fixated on the air in front of him as he thought about what to do. The room was sweating with a bothered worry, until Foreign Minister Kuranari Tadashi groaned and yelled, \"We have to do something. These are radicals, Prime Minister! Who knows what they will do if we let their grubby hands near our legislature. Look outside - it's treason!\"\n\nTakagi glanced at the irritated man before returning his vision to the thin air. He was still and silent, but sweating profusely. The faint roar of the protests grew louder and louder as the march continued, with law enforcement regrouping closer to the cabinet's office. Behind them, they had left destruction in their path, litter across the streets and windows smashed near outbreaks of violence. Clashes with law enforcement became more frequent, now visible from the windows of Takagi's offices. He peered from behind a curtain and turned back to his cabinet, all eager to hear his next move.

There is a growing possibility that failure to handle this matter will shift public opinion away from us.

Hasty dismissal of the protests had only caused more problems. Eventually, it was Kido Kōichi who broke the uneasy silence.\n\n\"A more careful and prolonged application of force will solve this. Once the students release that their actions will only be met with force, they will return to their classes.\"\n\nHorikiri was the next to speak.\n\n\"I disagree. If we meet them with force, they will only become more emboldened and radical. Let us attempt negotiations again. Once someone reminds of how reforms are actually made, they will give in.\"\n\nBefore any sort of argument between his two ministers could begin, Takagi held up a hand to quiet them.

We ask only to be included in matters that shape our future, that we feel strongly about. The government will have to put up with us until our demands are met!\" The student was met with applause from his fellows.\n\n\"Your concerns have been noted, but the decisions concerning your involvement have already been made.

He insisted it was far beyond what was necessary for the students; it was inessential to be so draconian, yet all of his pleas were met with a solemn frown from Takagi. Zenjiro darted his head back to the window and was silent for a moment. He peered out over the city and at the great marvels the empire had built in the last fifty years. He gulped, knowing the Prime Minister was right to combat the protests, and began to speak slowly to Takagi, \"And... what do you want to be done?\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, now a few feet away and sitting behind his desk, began to list operations and times for meetings to coordinate the use of the Tokkō with the rest of his cabinet.

To remedy this, I introduce to you all the well-spoken, and possibly the most intelligent girl I have met: Ito Sachiko!\n\n(THE SPEAKER STEPS DOWN FROM THE MAKESHIFT PODIUM AND 'ITO SACHIKO' BEGINS TO SPEAK)\n\nGood evening to you, friends. I'm sure you are all aware of the secret meetings Sato is leading under the code name 'Oboke Yui', and I am here to relay to you the next: in three days, not far from the Keio University libraries. You will find us there at precisely 11pm, and we will be discussing a range of topics from 'how to handle police dogs' to 'feminism and birth control.' If you can make it, please do come - but before you do, I have some key information first...\n(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)"

 japtakagirecon.57.d:0 "After the commotion of another closed session in the Diet, Kishi and Ikeda caught the Prime Minister on his way out of the building. Carrying a slim briefcase, Takagi turned back and greeted the two men with a confused frown, shaking their hands firmly. Usually, these men would heckle and jeer at his government in the chamber, harassing his legislative attempts with all kinds of vetoes and ideological opposition. It confused the Prime Minister to see his adversaries greet him so familiarly.\n\nKishi and Ikeda grinned throughout the entire interaction with a smug aura about them, chuckling and smirking with the Prime Minister. They congratulated him for his 'bravery' to 'deal with' the students with appropriate law enforcement and security measures. \"Brave, a man such as yourself fighting back,\" Ikeda snickered, wiping his nose as he gagged on his own laughs. The Prime Minister was unimpressed, keeping a straight face. In what felt like a backhanded compliment, Kishi noted he especially admired the retaliation of riot police fighting back at radicals in the crowd, possibly alluring and humoring Takagi's pacifism relative to their dexterity to call for repression.\n\nTakagi shook their hands once more, thanking them for their presence, and left to return to his estate, unsure of the true intentions of the interaction. As Takagi stepped into his car and the chauffeur closed the door behind him, Kishi and Ikeda waved at him from the steps of the Diet. The smug grins smeared across their faces revolted the Prime Minister, now trying to distract himself by fiddling with the locks on his briefcase."

 japtakagirecon.58.t:0 "The Root of the Problem"
 japtakagirecon.58.d:0 "The cabinet sat in a boardroom and passed about leaflets containing excerpts from the student manifestos currently circulating around areas afflicted with protests. The cheap yellow lightbulb that hung above the men buzzed as they flicked through the colorful flyers. The hum drilled into their minds, driving them insane under the mounting pressure of civil unrest in the streets of Japan. Takagi dashed some of the flyers in front of him and fell back in his chair, rocking forward and back in an attempt to keep himself calm.\n\nKido, sifting through sheets and sheets of paper, took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. He cleared his throat, and spoke to the Prime Minister: \"They're all saying the same thing. They want incomprehensible and revolutionary change.\" A deafening silence followed, only broken by the sound of creasing paper and the occasional sigh of a minister. Nakasone, with tired eyes and sweat clinging to the inside of his suit, groaned to Takagi, noting that their demands were outrageous and could never be satisfied. Takagi raised his brow, acknowledging the irrationality of the radicals put things in his favor, but he was not comforted to be in such a precarious position.\n\nThe cabinet stayed in the boardroom into the late hours of the night, eventually stripping down their overcoats and blazers to work with rolled-up sleeves and loosened ties. As the clock struck two in the morning, they had come to a consensus. The men gazed at the piles and piles of pages they had gone through and noted the core ofwhat the protesters demanded - fix the economy and repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Takagi, dwarfed by the sheer amount of material, stood back in awe and understood that either the crisis must be dealt with soon, or else he would be."

 japtakagirecon.59.d:0 "The cabinet had gathered at the Prime Minister's estate for drinks in the afternoon, taking a break from official appearances but still hard at work discussing policy as a unit. Nakasone, with somewhat of a spring in his step, poured glasses of water for the Prime Minister and the others to cool them down, listening to tunes on the radio. As he merrily approached Zunjiro, the security minister scowled and muttered: \"What makes you so bloody zany?\", dimming Nakasone's mood and reducing him to a quiet shell of his cheerful self.\n\nKido, sprawled out on a leather chair, sat back and engaged with Takagi in discussing any possible outcome of future efforts to legislate and ignore the agenda of the protesters. The Prime Minister chuckled, cynical of the Diet's attention to detail, and shook his head. Kido nodded, understanding of Takagi's pains and began to involve Nakasone and Tadashi in the discussions between the five of them. Soon after, a buzz disrupted the music on the radio, and Nakasone dragged himself from his seat to turn it off.\n\nAt the very last moment, Takagi whipped his head around and demanded Nakasone turn the volume up. The five sat there and listened, not quite knowing what to expect, and all of them leapt from their positions upon hearing the news - a huge protest with thousands of attendees had gathered in the Tokyo suburbs, sounding more radical than before. The Prime Minister's eyes widened as he looked back to Kido, and Nakasone's head fell into his hands. Calling for Zenjiro to get a hold of the head of Tokyo's law enforcement, a cold sweat climbed up Takagi's back as his face grew red with worry."

 japtakagirecon.60.t:0 "For The Sake Of National Security"
 japtakagirecon.60.d:0 "The Prime Minister sat in his estate with Kido and Zenjiro, eating lavish dishes of fresh fish and vegetables. They sat at a fine-clothed table surrounded by two servants who repeatedly refilled Kido's glass with wine, and occasionally went off to return with more extravagant meals for the men. Takagi was starving, and any food would be good enough to get him thinking straight again. The three made the occasional comment about their lunch as they chewed through the expensive delicacies, until Takagi began to make a point of his position as Prime Minister.\n\nKido and Zenjiro listened diligently to Takagi, who sat explaining his dilemmas to the two whilst eating his sea urchin and fresh salmon. He debated about putting an end to the protests once and for all, much to Zenjiro's surprise, and asked if suppression would drown out the radical cries. Talking of police raids and mass arrests, the Prime Minister risked jeopardizing his entire support base in his impassioned ramblings. Zenjiro stopped eating and listened very carefully to him, momentarily glancing over at Kido who was lost for words at the sheer nature of Takagi's argument.\n\nAfter taking a sip of water, Takagi then continued to contemplate - now wondering if he should simply invite Katō over for an honest discussion. The Prime Minister looked towards Kido whilst rambling, and Zenjiro attempted to hold back a snicker. Kido kicked him from under the table, and continued to pay attention to a reflecting Takagi. He nodded and returned one-word replies to the Prime Minister, attempting to hide his hesitance under a blanket of cool approval. Takagi then leaned back in his chair, signalling for another glass of water, and pondered for a while - what would be the right choice? Perhaps more importantly, how would he want to be remembered?"

 japtakagirecon.61.d:0 "Keikichi,\n\nI write to you this letter to tell you that I need your help and your advice. You are a politician, and you've lived and worked in the heart of politics in Japan for longer than I have. It seems that I am being dragged into that heart more and more these days. I am sure you have seen and heard much of the student movement that has taken the streets these past few months. I am so very happy to see young people here stand up for themselves and fight back. Such a movement for genuine reform has been long coming in this country. I cannot say I agree with all their demands, but I suppose I am somewhat older than them! I hope this does not undermine their hard work, as I fear the older generations will not be so radical as they are... My public support for these students has had some unexpected consequences. It seems that I have ended up becoming some of a figurehead for this movement, despite my hesitations. While it has been good to provide them with this support, I must say the attention from the political establishment is becoming uncomfortable.\n\nThe Prime Minister has recently expressed interest in meeting with me and I am deeply unsure as to what I must do. He speaks of negotiation and compromise, but I wonder if that is truly what he, or those he represents wants. Agreeing to meet with him, even if it does illicit a workable compromise, might push me further into the limelight. I don't want to suffer through another arrest like I did all those years ago.\n\nAs you can see, I need your aid. You know how to deal with politicians and bureaucrats, you've stood against the YSK for years and called for reforms all the while. What do you do in situations like this? I hope you are well and that this letter does not cause you too much bother\n\nMy Deepest Thanks,\n\nShidzue."

 japtakagirecon.62.t:0 "On Youth Activism And Reproductive Rights"
 japtakagirecon.62.d:0 "It has been over thirty years since the implementation of the now deeply controversial Kukumin Yuseiho. Since then, it has been used to suppress the rights of women, while masking itself in a guise of protecting the population from genetic disease. Failure on the part of the government to address this long-standing issue has caused numerous problems over the decades. While Prime Minister Takagi has recently opened a commission to \"re-examine\" the kokumin yuseiho, it is doubtful that much will change through this process. What is clear, is that the youth of this country are no longer willing to sit by and allow their future to be decided by the older generations. Can we really blame them for protesting the government's sluggish response to the changing times? I do not think so. When a piece of legislation affects around half the population's rights to their own bodies, is it truly so unreasonable that many young people in Japan today wish to see the kokumin Yuseiho go?\n\nIt is narrow-minded to view the student protests as merely a spark of rebelliousness. I believe they demonstrate the will and demands of a much larger section of the population that has been too suppressed, both politically and socially, to speak up prior to now. These are laws that affect the fundamental rights of women and they stand in the face of progress and equality. The activism of the youth in the face of government stubbornness should be seen as an inspiration and a bright hope of future reforms towards a more equal society. The Kokumin Yuseiho must now be repealed and replaced with something more fitting with the times we live in. It is my hope that the student's hard work can demonstrate this to the government."

 japtakagirecon.63.d:0 "Some time had passed since Prime Minister Takagi had reached out to Katō Shidzue. Despite being ever so clear to present this as an opportunity for compromise and progress, it now appeared that she most likely had other plans. However, her silence had in fact given Takagi more time to think about his position. Had too much time passed at this point for the negotiations to prove fruitful? Was meeting with Katō too great of a risk? Fortunately for Takagi, a new solution presented itself firstly through a knock on the door.\n\nHaving been told to come in, it was Kido Kōichi who entered the office.\n\n\"Prime Minister, I understand that Katō has not been in contact with you?\"\n\n\"That is correct. Do you have some sort of suggestion for me?\n\n\"That is exactly what I have for you, sir. I believe it would be wiser that someone visit Katō in your stead, possibly myself or Horikiri. It would be a private meeting, one that you can dictate the terms of without having to be in attendance yourself.\n\nIt did not take long for the Prime Minister to see the wisdom of this, which he signified to his deputy with a nod.\n\n\"Then I would suggest you inform Katō of this change of plan immediately. Enough time has been wasted and I dread to think what could happen if Nakasone or Kishi were to speak to her first.\"\n\nKido bowed and departed to make the necessary calls for the meeting. The Prime Minister felt grateful for his deputy's quick thinking, although he wished he had spoken to him about the matter sooner."

 japtakagirecon.64.d:0 "Entering the small, wallpapered room with a clipboard in his hand, the finely-dressed Kido made his way over to sit across the wooden table from Katō Shidzue. He extended his arm out to greet her, to which she bowed her head and looked away. Kido, foreseeing the awkward tension of the meeting, took a deep breath and began to get comfortable.\n\nHe wiggled in his chair momentarily, before resting his arms on the table and speaking to Katō: \"I knew Ishimoto Keikichi. A good man; he really stood up for what he believed in. Saying that, we could never agree.. He would always be adamant in bringing up issues no one else cared about. I respect his firm loyalty to such a cause. He must've been a hell of a husba-\"\n\n\"Do you respect my firm loyalty to a cause, Mr. Kido? Are we not here to discuss matters far more important than private affairs?\"\n\nKido sat in awe, stunned by Katō's interruption. She was a difficult and unwieldy force to be reckoned with, he noted, and could not help but be intrigued by her passions for such an absurd cause. Nonetheless, he had a duty to piece together what she stood for, and understand her role in the recent chaos spreading throughout Japan's cities. Putting the clipboard to the side and crossing one leg over the other, Kido began to question Katō on her political positions and theory. He was seized by her theses, creating great mental notes on her postulations over the state of modern Japan. Kido nodded and smiled - he couldn't get enough of her bullshit."

 japtakagirecon.65.d:0 "\"Haven't I already made it simple, Mr. Kido? A total abolition of the Kokumin Yuseiho. It is an insult and affront to the equality of the sexes and the respect of the nation.\"\n\nKatō sat across from Kido, quite pleased with herself. She was firm and her position was immovable; she held her chin up and looked down upon the pampered Mr. Kido. They had been discussing her feminist theory for over an hour now, and Kido listened casually whilst scribbling notes. He sat across from her and watched from behind his clipboard, recording key pieces of information to be passed on in a later report, though at moments he found himself doodling during her over-scrupulous ranting.\n\nEventually, she had finished speaking and Kido saw his chance; referring to his notes, he glanced back up at her and prodded her with loaded questions:\n\"I appreciate your passion, Miss Katō. I do ask, if I may, what grand solution to wipe away the 'Patriarchal Dictatorship' would repealing a single law be? Do you speak out for a second about the sterilisation clause? For a woman of modern academia, you have left a lot unclear.\"\n\nKido had a despicably smug look across his face. He had caught Katō out, and she was red-faced and furious. The meeting ended inconclusively, and although Kido left with his ego thoroughly stroked, none could claim victory over the other."
 japtakagirecon.65.a:0 "A quagmire."
 japtakagirecon.66.t:0 "The White Queen's Revelation"
 japtakagirecon.66.d:0 "Kido had arranged to meet Katō again over tea, where they shared a pleasant interaction in the gardens of The Kantei. The two conversed whilst listening to birdsong and the breeze brushing through the Japanese maple leaves. Gradually, Kido prodded Katō to ask about her stance on the sterilization clause of the Kokumin Yuseiho, to which she cleared her throat and blinked a few times in astonishment. Kido chuckled, insisting he was curious as she did not relieve him with an answer in their last interaction. Comforted by the tranquil and serene environment, she began to disclose her thoughts to the well-dressed and cunning Mr. Kido:\n\n\"In truth, my opinion... well I have no opinion. I have no problem with the sterilization clause. I have not come into any friction with it, and I don't understand how anyone would, frankly.\"\n\nKido's eyes lit up like stars as he nodded, maintaining his facade of genuine interest to keep her talking. Nudging his fingers across the underside of the table to check the bugging device was still recording, Kido broke into a firm smile that seemed to approve of Katō's stance. She explained herself, and every word he treated as a gift. She mentioned, somewhat reluctantly, that if the student's found out about this opinion she would be treated as an outcast and as an enemy. Kido's smile spread across his face, delighted her confessions were being recorded on tape, and his amiable expressions urged her to divulge further. He could barely contain his glee; this was all the evidence Kido needed, and he was already thinking of ways to blackmail her as he gazed into her eyes."

 japtakagirecon.67.d:0 "With entire folders packed with information, as well as dozens of tape recordings, Kido returned to the Prime Minister's office with a sharp smile on his face. Indeed, as he presented the bounties of information to Takagi, the Prime Minister let out a genuine smile that stuck from cheek to cheek throughout the entire meeting. Kido, briefing Takagi with any and all information he needed to know about Katō, spoke for a long while, dashing between anecdotes and figures to help him make sense of the operation.\n\nTakagi stood up from his seat, still listening to Kido, and reached for a couple of luxury, expansive glasses from behind a cabinet. He poured a small amount of his finest champagne for himself and his colleague as Kido began to announce his news of the tapes. Thoroughly impressed, Takagi could not be more happy with the lengths Kido had gone to to gather the evidence required to keep Katō under his finger. They raised their glasses, and sipped from the wine with a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe Prime Minister fell back into his chair and exhaled a sigh of relief. Nodding his head in approval, he noted to Kido that he thought Katō was an idiot, but a useful one that had potential to be the unraveling of the student movement. With a sense of achievement, both Takagi and Kido took another sip of the champagne and sat back in their chairs, taking in this moment of personal victory."

 japtakagirecon.68.t:0 "Using Connections Wisely"
 japtakagirecon.68.d:0 "As Takagi's Deputy, Kido worked particularly hard with making sure the nobility remained supportive towards the Prime Minister. However, Takagi's recent policy pushes would require all of Kido's connections and guile to successfully sell it to the Kazoku. The Deputy Prime Minister's task would be to convince some of the more conservative nobility of supporting Takagi. While he had no chance of winning them all over, there were some that could be convinced through flattery and conversation. As such, Kido had gathered his chosen candidates for lunch.\n\n\"Esteemed gentlemen, I am honored that you have all accepted my invitation to lunch.\"\n\n\"We could hardly refuse when you take us to lunch here, Kido.\" This comment was met with polite chuckles from Kido and the rest of the nobles around the table. \"I hope whatever business you wish to discuss will not ruin this meal. I do understand it has something to do with that dreadful woman Katō, yes?\"\n\n\"I am afraid so gentlemen. Yet, I do ask that you hear me out, The Prime Minister has agreed to implement some of Katō's reforms and he requires your support to succeed. I understand that you are far from keen to see Katō get her way, but this a matter of saving the nation from disaster in the long-term. These small reforms will pacify the student protests and restore order to the streets. Besides, most of the changes will go unnoticed by most people. They are mostly symbolic gestures that will ultimately protect national polity.\"\n\nIt would have been incorrect to describe the assembled Kazoku as convinced. Kido could tell that he had not entirely won them over, but planted the seeds of consideration in heads. Stressing the issue would not do any good.\n\n\"I do not need to hear a yes or no right now, gentlemen. Please consider what I said in your own time. Now, let us enjoy the rest of this luncheon.\" Forcing the nobility to act was unwise. It was better to give them the idea that they were making the decisions."

 japtakagirecon.69.d:0 "It had been some time since Ishimoto Keikichi had seen Katō in person. While they had remained fairly amicable over the years since the divorce, they usually spoke over the phone or through letters. This time however, Katō had been adamant about meeting him in person. Ishimoto felt it was best not to refuse and therefore invited her to meet him at this office in the Imperial Diet building. Katō was slightly surprised to see Ishimoto eating his lunch when she arrived.\n\n\"This was the only time in my schedule that was open. Hopefully you don't need too much time to say what you need to\"\n\n\"I'm going to need a favor. I won't lie, it's quite a big ask, but I need you to do this.\"\n\nThe old politician sighed before finishing the food on his plate. \"Go on then, you might as well tell me what you want.\"\n\n\"As you know, the Prime Minister and I have come to an agreement regarding reforms to the Kokumin Yuseiho. He is planning to move forward with these reforms and put them to a vote in the Imperial Diet. However, it's not clear how much support Takagi has for this. That's why I need your help.\"\n\n\"I think I see what you want. You want me to whip up independent support for the Prime Minister, correct?\"\n\nKatō gave a simple nod as a reply.\n\n\"Do you really think this is worth it? Some piecemeal reform to get the youth off the government's back for a few years?\"\n\n\"I need you to understand that this is probably the best shot we have of implementing some genuine reform. When was the last time we had a chance like this to make things better for so many people? At times like this, you're going to have to put away your distaste for the Prime Minister to achieve something good.\"\n\nIshimoto remained silent for a good few seconds, but expression changed to that of reluctant acceptance. \"Fine, I'll see what strings I can pull for you. You're going to need a lot of help to pull this off.\""

Those who were yet undecided on the matter of the Kokumin Yuseiho were also keen to hear the reform bureaucrat speak; perhaps he could help them make up their minds. The Prime Minister and his supporters were less than enthused. Finally, Kishi stood up from his seat among the rows of representatives.\n\n\"From its inception, I have been an opponent of this government. The ideological direction of the Prime Minister has swayed Japan off course and led us down into a shameful state. I had expected as much from this government, but I had not expected them to now stoop even lower. In the face of protesting students, the Prime Minister has bowed his head in defeat!\"\n\nKishi paused to allow his fellow technocrats to laugh for a few moments, keeping a close eye on Takagi's facial expression.\n\n\"As for what the Prime Minister is offering these students in the hopes of appeasing them, it is nothing short of the gradual destruction of our society. This government will surrender the moral fabric of the nation under the guise of being diplomats and populists. Talks of reforming laws such as the Kokumin Yuseiho violate the Kokutai itself! This, of course, begs the question of how far this government is prepared to tear Japan apart. Will the Kokutai soon be examined by a commission? Will the Taisei Yokusankai be forcefully disbanded? I dread to think what will happen if the Prime Minister is not stopped. Those men in this room who still have your dignity, your morals and your conscience, I ask of you to vote against any proposed reform to the Kokumin Yuseiho. The very future of the nation is otherwise at risk.\"\n\nKishi was met with great applause by his fellows as he sat down.

He was a conservative, and he stood against such sweeping reform. However, with such a precarious and uncertain political climate, Ikeda relied on stability, even if it came from this Prime Minister. After what felt like hours of tense reasoning, Takagi felt like Ikeda was on a knife's edge; with a bit of bartering, he could be convinced. The old man was wary of even mentioning any attempt to repeal the Konoe-era law, and sighed out of frustration - despite everything, Takagi's plan was the safest option for the stability of the nation.\n\n\"It's hardly religion, Ikeda. It's our last chance - there's no saying the Taisei Yokusankai will survive if we don't pass this through. The old law will go, but a new one will fall in its place. You have my word, the protections will stay in place.\"\n\nIkeda slowly shut his eyes. He bit his lip and slowly nodded, his hands sinking to his sides as he visibly began to concede to the Prime Minister. Takagi approached him with a smile and patted him on the back, thanking him for his support. Ikeda shook his head and made a point, noting that his support will disappear the moment legislation deviates from this promised path. Takagi, assuring Ikeda, grabbed his hand and shook it firmly.

Starting early in the morning, they had all spent their day trying to gather every last scrap of support or influence they could collectively muster. Before they began their meeting, they had all taken a moment to breathe. When Kido and Horikiri had entered the office they too were quite clearly out of breath. The three men sat around the Prime Minister's table, and Takagi began by explaining what he had managed throughout the day.\n\nThe Prime Minister had focused on his connections among the navy, hoping to limit their involvement in the matter or even get them to support him. Takagi had also worked to shore up the reformist clique in the diet, to ensure that none of them had any sudden ideas about how to vote. While the Prime Minister was not calling upon the largest pool of support, he was undeniably bringing in old allies that had always been fairly reliable. Takagi was therefore grateful for Horikiri and Kido, who had contacts of their own to call upon.\n\nAs expected, Deputy Prime Minister Kido had contacted numerous members of the House of Peers as well as a few officials in the Imperial Household. Meanwhile, Horikiri had spent his time hunting down potential allies in the House of Representatives.\n\nAll of this they told the Prime Minister, who, while clearly listening, was locked in deep consideration. Before ending the meeting for the night, Takagi summarized his feelings on the matter.\n\n\"Even with all the allies we have gathered, the favors we have called in, and whatever other methods we have deployed, it is not yet clear whether we can be sure of victory. This is the beginning of the job, and I do not suspect it will be much easier to finish. We have stabilized our foundations, but now we must build a highrise.\""

He had spoken for almost twenty minutes, describing his new policy drive to the National Diet. His elucidations were clothed in a unique pragmatism; he was aware of the traditions and duties he had to uphold as Prime Minister but also conscious of the increasingly popular demands of the students who stood to protest in the streets again. Takagi stood tall and firm, yet his words sailed over the heads of many sitting in the hall.\n\nIt became more and more obvious towards the conclusion of the Prime Minister's speech that the Diet was split. Independents and Kidoites nodded and applauded the motions of Prime Minister Takagi, hailing him as a wise and pragmatic mediator. The same could not be said for the technocrats and many of the conservatives that filled the Diet's seats, as they shook their heads and audibly protested the speech with low groans and mumbles. An empty applause sounded throughout the great hall. From his podium, even with the supportive grins of allies in the Diet, it was clear that many would not even consider supporting him after voicing his intention to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.

Takagi was beyond arguing with her as they had for months now, and simply snapped at her that the Diet was not cooperating with any attempt to revoke the law. He spoke down to her, scowling that the necessity to appeal to conservatives and independents in the Taisei Yokusankai was their only hope to gain a majority. It was daunting to the Prime Minister; he found himself at a stand-still - how could he convince moderates and conservatives to vote in favor of such a radical and reformist action?\n\nKatō, turning to the Prime Minister after a brief moment, suddenly proposed a counter offer as Takagi pinched the bridge of his nose in an exhausted and defeated frustration. She mentioned, to appease those who oppose the repeal, he could introduce legal protections expanding state welfare, childcare, and even legalizing abortion. Takagi looked up from his enraged despair, and with a confused smile he wagged his finger at her smug face. He refused to show his excitement; he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of being right. As he quietly signaled a servant to get on the phone to Kido, Katō smiled and began to listen to the birdsong of the gardens, finding peace in the Prime Minister's non-verbal gratification."

 japtakagirecon.75.d:0 "\"Prime Minister, where are you going with all of this?\"\n\nIn what was supposed to be a private conversation, Ikeda and Takagi argued in a boardroom in the National Diet building and the two men accused each other of all kinds of political malpractice. After a particularly heated moment, Takagi rubbed his brow and asked for Ikeda's honest opinion of the move to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Ikeda inhaled a large breath, and then relented, mentioning he was personally apathetic. What mattered, he insisted, was that the government had a system in place to defend the traditional morality of the nation. National Eugenics Law or not, Ikeda confessed, many conservatives would support a respectful homage to the traditions of the empire in the budget and government policy proposals.\n\nTakagi was silent, staring at the man in confusion. Surely it was not that easy, he thought, in denial of the whole affair. The Prime Minister, now at relative ease compared to the anger of the earlier argument, could not hide his astonishment; he had the information he needed to get the conservatives behind a replacement bill. He still had to wrestle with the legislature, but understanding the Ikeda's platform on abortion and other issues gave him information key to drawing up a potentially successful bill in the National Diet. The question was, how much should he give them?"

They all hurried out of the room except for Nakasone, who spent some time wiping the lint off of his overcoat. Takagi stopped him once Kido had shuffled out of the door, and asked the minister about his family and personal life. After a short but amiable exchange of conversation, Takagi brought up the recent movements to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.\n\n\"To be totally honest, sir, I support the repeal. It's a better alternative to overbearing state power. It's not perfect, but all things considered I think it's the best way forward.\" Nakasone nodded, and spoke frankly to the Prime Minister after affirming his loyalties. Takagi, pleased to hear this, stood upright and proud to shake Nakasone's hand. In a political scene where rivals critiqued him from all sides, the Prime Minister was pleased to know that his ministers shared the same opinion as he did. He knew this was expected of his own government, but was grateful nonetheless that he could find at least some peace being surrounded by his closest aides and colleagues."

The 'Eugenics Protection Law', his government penned it; a bill drafted to be debated in the Diet and approved by the legislature, receiving royal assent as soon as possible to sap at the magnitude of the ongoing nagging protests.\n\nOutlining its provisions, the Prime Minister had danced between his intentions with the law, finally mentioning its specific amendments to the status quo - the legalization of abortion as a medical procedure outside of necessity and the continuation of the practice of sterilization in medical facilities. The air in the chamber suddenly grew thick and tense as Takagi began to sweat beneath his suit. He could feel the disapproving gaze from traditionalists in the Diet prickling his skin.\n\nHailing the potential of the legal reorganization to bring positive social reform to Japanese society, the Prime Minister continued his speech with a calm and cool composure, hiding his panic from political rivals. As he began to finalize the final clauses of his bill, Takagi's irritated eyes drifted over to the seats on the right of the chamber; dozens of conservatives had collected their belongings and attempted to leave mid-session, clearly outraged at what the Prime Minister had presented to them. The speaker called them back, but to no avail. Feeling powerless, Takagi stood behind his podium and stared into the thin air, tired of facing constant friction in his efforts to solve the empire's troubles."

He cleared his throat, and peered across the chamber, brushing the room with his stern gaze - determined to pass this bill he had fought so intensely for. Takagi began to speak to the Diet, reading from a prepared speech, and maintained a calm and controlled decorum to distinguish his own authority over the diverging interests tearing the Taisei Yokusankai to pieces.\n\nComplete with all amendments, such as tightened restrictions on the period of pregnancy termination and a government-approved gynecological code of ethics, the bill had been taken apart and pieced back together many times over to find approval from the conservatives in the House of Peers. Takagi waved the bill, priding it for its comprehensive covering of modern attitudes towards women's health, whilst acknowledging a respectful relationship it had with traditional morality seen as virtuous across the nation. Despite this, however, the amendments did not inoculate the Prime Minister from scrutiny, and scowls from conservative factions of the Taisei Yokusankai were frequent as he gazed into the crowds of men scoffing at his works.\n\nThe Prime Minister finished his speech and sat down in the lukewarm tumble of applause that sounded from the Diet floor. He rested his breath and checked his pulse, calming himself down to remain still as the speaker began to gesture a vote."

She rushed to the bathroom, the dissolved remains of her dinner and lunch ending up in her toilet. She reached for the toilet paper, ripping off a piece to wipe her mouth. Her breathing was labored; her mouth and throat were thoroughly dried out. She rested, face lying on the rim of the toilet. It was not until a faint light shone through the window that she stood up, ever so cautiously. She looked at the mess in her toilet wondering how long this cycle of getting up to vomit and then going back to bed had gone on.\n\nShe flushed it away. Maybe she could ask her boyfriend what was going on? He was in the medical department, after all. Surely he'd know something.\n\nRolling her lover's number on her phone, she wondered all of the possibilities of what was going on with her. The thought struck her suddenly - 'What if you were pregnant?' As she listened to the ringing tone, Keiko stared into the distance, a stark realization sinking into every part of her being. Ignoring the voice greeting her, she looked down and realized what happened; they had been unprotected when they did 'that'.\n\nKeiko spoke into the phone: \"I think I'm pregnant.\""

She heard the door creak slightly, looking up from her lap to see a woman in scrubs with a folder in hand.\n\n\"As to be expected, you're pregnant.\" The nurse read off of the file, looking at Keiko afterwards. \"With your situation, I would get an abortion.\"\n\n\"Are there any alternatives?\" Keiko asked. \"I don't want an abortion on my record.\"\n\nThe nurse's face softened. Internally, Keiko screamed, 'I don't want your pity!'. Externally, she remained neutral.\n\n\"No. There aren't any alternatives other than keeping the child.\"\n\nShit. She was stuck between two options she didn't want. There's too much risk in keeping the fetus - it would send her studies down the drain, not to mention the sheer cost involved. On the other, having an abortion was risky. What would her mother say? She saw the commercials; they convinced her it was abhorrent. But maybe it was the better thing to do. She couldn't sacrifice years of school now. She couldn't afford it.\n\n\"Fine. I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Follow me, then.\" The nurse began to walk to the hallway, with Keiko following."

She wondered how she could explain her choice to Takako - she had told Keiko to remain celibate when she first entered university, after all.\n\n\"Keiko, what's the matter with you?\" Takako had placed her chopsticks on the napkin, looking straight at Keiko. In a flash, she was sitting up straight, picking up noodles and slurping them up.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Keiko sipped some broth.\n\n\"I've noticed that you've been looking - how do I say it - agitated? Out of it is a better term.\" Takako shifted a little, with her hands acting like they too showed concern for her.\n\n\"It's nothing.

It's nothing to be worried about.\"\n\n\"If you want, we can go shopping for a nice coat.\" Takako offered, picking up the chopsticks once more.

Anything for her daughter.\n\nNow, Takako waited outside of Keiko's dormitory, buzzing into the building. She smiled, now that she was out of the cold. If Keiko was right about one thing, it was that the weather was enough to make someone get in a bad mood. She silently thanked Keiko's roommate, bowing slightly, before knocking on her door.\n\n\"Coming!\" Takako could hear Keiko rushing to the door, looking disheveled. She had probably just woken up.\n\n\"Good morning, Keiko. Can I come in?\" Takako asked, slightly raising her eyebrows. Keiko silently let her through, leaving shortly thereafter to go to the bathroom. This gave Takako time to look around her room, maybe see what she was up to. She noticed the yellow medical booklet on her desk. Did she have a doctor's appointment recently? It wouldn't hurt to check, right?\n\nIt started out well: Takako had flipped through the booklet, page by page, reminiscing on fond memories of when Keiko was but a tiny child. As she made her way to the last pages, she began to focus on her doctor's appointments. Maybe she had health problems? She turned to the second-to-last page, reading the information. Her eyes bulged out, processing the information laid bare before her. Her daughter had an abortion?\n\nIn her horror, Takako didn't notice Keiko's footsteps. A voice rang out: \"I can explain.\""

Nakasone folded his arms and scratched his chin, then pointed at the Prime Minister with an accusing scowl, demanding an explanation.\n\n\"I just can't fathom why you would think this would be a good idea, Takagi. Have you not seen our budget? We are already squeezing the coffers dry as we speak.

Adamant to prove himself, the minister attempted to coordinate himself and question Takagi further, but could not gather his words under the pressure of Takagi's disapproving glare.

Time and time again they proudly voted against his reforms, with smug looks on their faces, and now the Prime Minister was here to convince them otherwise.\n\n\"Prime Minister, we are simply not convinced your legislative proposals are appropriate in bringing 'reform' to the empire. We cannot stand for your misappropriation of our nation's traditions and customs. Some would call it an outrage!\"\n\n\"Mr. Miki, what respect do you have for integrity and custom when you attack this government by voting down our every effort to improve this nation? Where is the honor when you vote down bills that could help us fight poverty and corruption? Our government can and will work with you if you would only let us; this is a matter of supporting the empire in times of, frankly, great instability.\"\n\nTakagi extended his hand towards the two men, explaining further that he wished to have their support in the Diet to defend the empire from civil unrest. Ikeda and Miki appeared embarrassed as Takagi had cornered them, caging their loyalty with their own credences. The Prime Minister grinned as they both shook his hand after a long pause - the bargain had worked, and the conservatives had given in to the pressure."

They chuckled and debated further, surrounded by the natural serenity of the garden.\n\n\"You know, Nakasone, your seat in the Prime Minister's government has really binded you to a single path. Takagi's actions have taped you to the image of reform and short-sighted change,\" Kishi sighed, before continuing, \"It's a shame really... but there is a way out.\"\n\nHe looked over to Nakasone, who was eager to hear from someone far more experienced than he was. Forgetting the political maneuvering and Takagi's warnings about the man, he could not resist asking Kishi more.\n\n\"My son, we've done it in the past,\" Kishi chuckled, \"Even the Americans do it. I have no real issue with Takagi's attempt to bring in a surrogate law after the Kokumin Yusehio is repealed. A powerful opposition will defund and neglect the surrogate law to punish the Prime Minister, rather than wasting energy fighting him for it.\"\n\nNaksone was struck with surprise and intrigue; he could not have come up with a more sinister yet wildly effective strategy to strike in the Diet. Kishi, even as an old man, had his despicable wits about him at all times.

The law aimed to expand state-run orphanages and sponsored childcare, funding youth institutions with millions of yen. Takagi read out his intentions to the chamber with a strong pride in an attempt to gather attention from listening members, but few seemed interested in his proposals.\n\nEven noting the preservation of the sterilisation clause, Takagi was astonished to witness a great lazy apathy that had swept the Diet. He felt a confusing frustration; in all of his years of experience, nothing had prepared him to react to such sloth and general disinterest in this chamber. Takagi was puzzled, and as he looked to the side to prompt his cabinet for aid, they too were bewildered by the occasion.

It had been precisely seven hours since she first arrived, and another eight since she first woke up. The weight of her fatigue cascaded down on her shoulders, bringing her closer and closer to the brink of collapsing. Yet Katō did not.\n\nThere was cleaning to do, not to mention giving the cats their food. Ever since rats were discovered to be infesting the place, they had adopted five strays to keep them at bay. Katō idly wondered why they couldn't have just hired exterminators to snuff out the rats. Not to mention that she and Michi had to replace the floorboards in the playroom next week. Katō sighed, brushing her hands when she had finished distributing the cans of cat food.\n\nDinner would have to be cooked, both for herself and the children. Just more work to do.

If you don't mind, I'll just watch.\" The boy nodded his head slowly, letting Katō take a seat next to him.

Taking the chocolate, he began speaking.\n\n\"I know now. I know why I was separated from my original parents.\" Kaori sighed. \"I'm a bastard - a filthy Korean. My name, the name that I was given when I was born, that is, is actually Min Yoongi.\" Hot tears flowed down his face, as heavy as the tapping rain outside. Katō could hear his sniffling and heavy breathing, struggling to keep his composure in the face of all-consuming fear. \"If you want to - if...\" The sound of sniffling and hiccups swallowed whatever else he had to say.\n\nKatō looked ashamed. A tense silence filled the room for several minutes, seeming to suffocate any and all conversation before it could ever start. Min Yoongi, Naya Kaori, the camellia boy, all three parts of his identity disappeared, and a scared boy was laid bare before Katō's eyes.

She noted that she is disappointed that she could not thank them both in person due to unforeseen consequences, but did express that she regarded them as men of virtue in an otherwise dejected Japanese political landscape. As he read words of respect from Katō, Takagi was overcome with a sense of honor; despite the Diet heckling her as a radical and misandrist, he felt proud that he treated her with the same respect he expected of others.

Compromising and throwing away potential for real economic restructuring consumed the Prime Minister, as he regretted leaving much of it up to the whims of Nakasone out of frustration. Takagi looked down to what he considered tainted hands, dirtied with his involvement in the political corruption and coercion he railed against in the beginning of his career. He wondered if it was a necessary evil, or simply avoidable if he just tried harder.\n\nBiting his lip, the Prime Minister retreated to his desk, falling into his leather chair and scratching his chin. He gulped and felt an overwhelming passion - after all of the struggles between these few triumphs, Japan had barely tasted reform.

He lived where the Prime Minister would live, and he sat where the Prime Minister would sit, but he could not command authority in the Diet for much longer. Conservatives branded him a coward and a traitor; reformists vilified him in accusations of despotism - he felt there was no balance to be struck anymore.

Listening to the distant honking of horns and the chanting of protesters from his position, he held his hands behind his back and took a deep breath. He could not find peace in simply glancing at the monument of Japanese civilization anymore; it brought him nothing but cynicism and fatigue.\n\nThe newspapers this morning read that thirty more students had been reported dead following clashes with law enforcement in the rioting, and Takagi of all people felt pained by this most. He shut his eyes and reflected, questioning if he had done enough in his position of power across the empire. The Diet could barely agree on anything, and Japan's youth, a significant portion of the public, would forever remember him as a tyrant. Takagi was overcome with an immense dread, only noticeable in his deeper breaths and glossy eyes. After a gulp, he hearkened towards the darkening sky beyond the glass and turned to his desk to find a pen. Neatly writing a few words, he glanced up and slowly guided his eyesight across the office before returning to his paper.\n\n\"Resignation,\" he thought, as he took in a deep breath of the misty office air, \"it's the only way.\""

 japtakagirecon.96.d:0 "Tokkō agent Kanda Kyo always liked to get a clear picture of his target's daily life before he acted. He had done this sort of work for the Tokkō so many times that it was a mere routine for him. From his car, or an empty building nearby, he could watch his target throughout the day, making sure to keep note of when they left their house and for how long. After about a week of this partner, Kanda had a detailed idea of just how his target spent their time.\n\nKatō Shidzue had been an interesting target for Kanda. Katō was not oblivious to her current position, as she always checked the lock on her doors twice before heading out. She would also wear dark sunglasses and a hat which obscured her face. She would do this every time she left the house, always scanning her surroundings before heading to her car. Once his week of observation had ended, the Tokkō agent was ready to begin his real task.\n\nAs usual, Katō left her house at twelve o clock, something she had done for the past four days. Kanda was not especially interested in where she was going, only that she would likely be gone for at least two hours. That was more than enough time for him to work. Stepping out of his car, he headed over to Katō's house and quietly picked the simple lock. Once inside, he wasted no time in wiretapping both the phones in her home andre-locking her front door. After which he drove off in his car back to Tokkō HQ. Of course, he did not want to miss the results of his work.\n\nOnce Katō had returned home Kanda and his colleagues began to listen in. Only a few minutes after she had got in the door, the phone rang.\n\n\"Katō, we need to meet with you at the book club at ten o'clock tomorrow. 'Thoreau', 'Fitzgerald' and 'Hemmingway' will be there when you arrive. They'll be waiting at the corner table for you when you arrive. The address is Kawaguchi-ku Sashima 2-4-1\".\n\nThe brief conversation was more than enough evidence for the Tokkō. They would now be able to begin the next step of their investigation."

He now had been joined by three of his fellow agents, whose orders were now to arrest Katō and, if deemed appropriate, the people she was meeting with. Their destination was the book club as described in the phone call they had recently listened in on. In order to blend in, they would enter the club as plainclothes and wait for the targets to arrive. The Tokkō themselves arrived at the location at precisely twenty-past eight. As to avert suspicion, the agents all entered at random intervals. The book club was little more than a large, converted basement. The walls were lined with bookshelves, and a desk had been placed in front of what might have been a back room. The agents began to read or make small talk with the friendly, if cautious staff. So far, they were the only people there.\n\nAt around half-past nine, a man entered, who made his way over to the corner table. Three minutes later another man entered, who dallied around the shelves before joining the first man at the table. Finally, a woman entered the club and sat herself down at the table. By quarter to nine, none of the three figures had left their spots and no one else had entered. Kanda therefore judged it to be time to act. After a quick gesture to his fellow agents, he drew his gun and pointed it at the corner table.\n\n\"All of you, get your hands up now. Do the cover names 'Fitzgerald','Hemingway' and 'Thoreau' mean anything to you\"\n\nThe trio at the table now had four guns pointed at them. While seemingly frozen with fear, they still managed to nod in response to the question.\n\n\" ood. Now get in the back room. Move slowly.\"\n\nThey did as they were told and were followed in by two of the Tokkō. Kanda turned his attention to the book club staff.\n\n\"Don't either of you dare to say a word. I need you to pretend like nothing happened.\"\n\nA shot rang out from the back room, as the body of the woman slumped into the doorway.\n\n\"Are we understood?\""

She wondered if it truly helped her avert unwanted attention, but it felt reassuring enough. Katō had passed the book club on her way to park her car, so it did not take her long to find her way back. She headed down the stairs and pushed open the door with the little bell on it. It was quiet inside. Despite the club's relatively small size, the only people she could see were the two members of staff. They did not do as much as greet Katō as she stepped inside. Immediately, she noticed that the corner table was unoccupied. Her watch told her she was exactly on time. The feeling of panic began to set in as she turned to look at the staff for a possible answer. The brief look she got from one of them turned panic into fear. With only his eyes, the staff member seemed to say:\n\n\"Run\"\n\nKatō turned back towards the door and raced up the steps. She was stopped in her tracks by three men, all pointing guns at her. Before Katō could verbalize a plea for understanding or dialogue, the butt of a pistol connected with the back of her skull. A moment later, she hit the ground."

Fittingly, it was Security Minister Horiki Zenjiro who brought it to the Prime Minister's office. He, and Deputy Prime Minister Kido, now waited to hear the news of Katō's arrest. For the benefit of the ministers, Takagi read the report aloud.\n\n\"At twenty-past eight this morning, four plainclothes agents entered an underground book club where Katō Shidzue was scheduled to meet three individuals. Upon identifying these individuals, the agents proceeded to draw their guns and arrest them. However, a struggle with one of the suspects insured, resulting in their death. The suspect, as so far only been identified by her cover name 'Thoreau'. At nine o'clock, Katō entered the building briefly before attempting to flee. She was promptly arrested by officers outside the building who were waiting in a nearby vehicle. The suspects were then taken to Tokkō Headquarters for questioning. Katō was then neutralised along with the two other suspects.\"\n\nTakagi finished reading and let the report fall onto his desk. Kido's face was a picture of confusion.\n\n\"Horikiri, surely this cannot be the entire report. What have they done to Katō?\"\n\n\"I checked with the Tokkō twice, this is their report.\"\n\nBefore Kido could demand that the Security Minister demand more information, Takagi cut him off.\n\n\"The details of what happened to Katō no longer matter. It's the consequences we should be worrying about. She was the figurehead of the protests and now she's missing. Once word of this spreads to the general public, they'll be no end to the chaos on the streets. We need to prepare for this, immediately.

 japtakagirecon.100.d:0 "The once lively and optimistic student movements that had filled the streets of Japan's cities had been replaced with two distinct forms of protests. Rioting had spread across the country like a storm, with its epicenter in Tokyo. There, armored police and water cannons had become common sights. Dozens of arrests were made each day and several universities had even been stormed by the police. While life carried on in Tokyo, an oppressive mood hung over the city. Yet In the quieter corners of Tokyo,, peaceful gatherings were still able to take place. At the spot where Katō Shidzue had last been seen, a candlelit vigil had begun, with hundreds in attendance. Apart from the sounds of distant police sirens, the street was completely quiet. At the top of the steps down into the book club basement, a number of signs had been placed with messages of appreciation for Katō and her activism. A young woman, one of the many students in attendance that had personally spoken to Katō, began to read a message she had written. The student hoped that somehow, whether Katō was, she would hear it and know that her sacrifice was not in vain. Before she had a chance to begin reading, a police car pulled up.\n\nRoof-mounted speakers loudly blared for the crowds to disperse, claiming that they were blocking a busy road. Without warning, the street began to flood with police, who set about dismantling the vigil. Those who did not move out of their way were beaten down or shoved forcefully to the ground. As more and more of the students attempted to get away, they found themselves surrounded by police from nearly every angle. What at first seemed like warning shots from the approaching police quickly began to hit the fleeing students. Panic and chaos set in, and the struggle to get away became increasingly desperate. Those caught by the police were pushed into vans and driven away, or otherwise beaten until let go. By the street was empty, the bodies of three students lay lifeless among the remains of the vigil."

 japtakagirecon.101.d:0 "News of the killings in Tokyo quickly spread throughout the country. Where once Tokyo had essentially been the only city that was being rocked by intense riots, now Nagoya and Osaka were also deeply affected. As the authorities' response to the demands of the students grew harsher and harsher, it seemed that the protesters only became more determined to fight back. Smashed windows, overturned cars and fires in the streets were now a common sight across several major cities. More peaceful gatherings were met with crackdowns from the police as soon as they sprung up. Simply being in some form of attendance was enough to warrant an arrest. Once released, they were usually beaten and bloodied, their bodies acting as a warning sign for what could happen if they did not stop protesting. Some were not so lucky. Many seemed to disappear, both literally and from police records. Others suffered the extreme brutality during the riots themselves. \"Inaccurate warning shots\" and \"falls\" were common excuses for the mounting pile of bodies.\n\nEven as the police deployed these measures against anyone found during a riot, it did nothing to end the unrest. The riots continued, growing larger and larger each day, as each death or disappearance added fuel to the fires. By this point, it was largely impossible for the general population to ignore the events happening outside their windows. Everyone knew a nephew or neighbour's child who had been blasted by a water cannon or bashed by a riot shield. Everyone had heard the stories of parents losing their children, deaths which the police or national media had yet to acknowledge.\n\nTokyo, Nagoya and Osaka were lit at night by the fires of unrest while similar flames promised to be enkindled across more cities. For the Prime Minister Takagi, the situation was exactly what he had hoped to avoid. Not only had he lost control of the protests, but now even the police were causing him trouble. Takagi could do little more than hope for a solution to materialize in time."

 japtakagirecon.102.d:0 "Takagi sat with his cabinet in a dark room in the Kantei. The room was silent, with the exception of the distant roars of riots from an open window, and was only illuminated with the silver moonlight pouring into half the room. The men sat around a single table, all turned to face the window and pondering over the volatile future of their administration after the recent explosion of chaos in the streets of Tokyo.\n\nAfter another short period of silence, Nakasone scoffed and began to speak. He called for strong suppression; expanding the presence of law enforcement in the streets; increasing surveillance throughout the city; and using the Tokkō to undermine, infiltrate, and alienate the proponents of civil unrest throughout the country. Pointing to Zenjiro, Nakasone mentioned he thought that this was the best and only way forward - noting that the rioters had forced the government's hand to take this violent path. Takagi sat still, seemingly unresponsive to the proposal as he gazed into the night sky.\n\nKido cleared his throat with a dry cough and proposed an alternative. Raising a middle ground, the Prime Minister could continue to use force in the most violent riots, whilst simultaneously strengthening the committee to reexamine the Kokumin Yuseiho. Kido noted that this would not only alienate the most radical propagators, but also amalgamate moderates in a coalition that would work with and under the government's influence. Takagi was calm and silent, looking back at his cabinet with a genuine smile for a brief second before returning to his thoughts on the urgent matter at hand."

The father of the household, a wealthy veteran, demanded his teenage daughter watch the address with him. He had lectured her about the virtues of patriotism, trying to connect with her in supporting the government in such turbulent times.\n\n\"Citizens of our great nation, I greet you this evening to discuss the gathering threat to our great nation. I will not waste your time with pretty words and colorful images; the violence in our streets is unacceptable. The great chaos born from simple disagreement between us has erupted into unnecessary destruction and disorder. It is not worthy of the empire and all our forefathers have given us.\"\n\nThe father smiled, seeing the Prime Minister on the television, but lost his joy when looking over to his apathetic daughter, who seemed disinterested in the appeals of Takagi to end the riots.\n\n\"... Which is why this government has decided to strengthen the commission to reform the Kokumin Yuseiho. If the Emperor's subjects want change, change they shall get - we will begin hard work to craft an all-inclusive settlement of this issue once and for all. However, this can only be completed with the cooperation of all parties involved, and an end to the riots.\"\n\nThe teenage daughter scoffed, rolling her eyes at the broadcast - much to her father's disapproval. She grumbled, hurling insults at the Prime Minister for his arrogance and misogyny before storming off to her bedroom. The girl's father was astonished and remained still in his seat, shocked by the encounter. He returned his attention back to the television, and noticing the speech had ended, he softly sang the occasional word of 'Kimigayo' along with the broadcast."

With your recent calls to end the violence and appeal to reason, it seems like the protests are beginning to clean themselves up.\"\n\nTakagi, barely conscious and exhausted from working, took a moment to process what Zenjiro had told him. He rubbed his eyes and stretched, and as he flicked through the documents he sprung into action.\n\n\"As you can read in the dossier, our surveillance has reported that the moderate student unions have begun dispersing from the streets, and are now encouraging their members to write to their MPs instead.\"\n\nTakagi's spirits raised almost in an instant; he jumped from his seat to march over to Zenjiro, shaking his hand and thanking him for his work. He sprinted back over to his desk in the next moment and leapt to action, and with a new wind he continued the task at hand.

Bystanders were swarmed in the masses of protestors; women and children feared being caught up in the violence; normal life came to a halt in the affected areas.\n\nThe crowds of protests turned their attention to ranks of armored police divisions who were now marching down the wide Tokyo streets. It was late evening, though the night sky was lit with the embers of dumpster fires and makeshift floodlights. Supported by armored vehicles, the police units trudged forward towards the chaotic crowds now scampering to face them. Bracing, they lifted their shields as thrown bricks and other debris clattered against their armor. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted, and many officers were outnumbered by the maddened students.\n\nSuddenly, a crashing burst of water shot across the road and hurled many students to the ground. The water cannons were used to support the encircled officers and back the students away from them. Moreover, the pop of teargas canisters among the ruined streets dispersed many of the rioters, allowing the police units to sweep in and contain the demonstrations. Students were beaten in the streets, and hundreds of arrests were made that night. The rioters had become a threat to Japanese civilization itself, the Prime Minister claimed, and to combat this he approved law enforcement with the order to treat them as such."

Uncomfortably obliging, Takagi dismissed the minister and was overcome with a concerning sense of defeat.\n\nBargaining with the idea, Takagi thought deeply after Nakasone had left his office - how could he be cornered like this? Such was the reality, however, and the Prime Minister had little choice but to accept it. His influence over the cabinet was diminishing, and Nakasone's break from the established line could be the beginning of the end for the government.

The roar of volcanic fury swept through the land and seas, as if the embers of Hell had risen to Earth to scorch the untamed wild of the islands in the South Pacific. Running for cover, locals dispersed into the woodlands in search of shelter but mostly found themselves entrapped within, the now dense and scalding air burning their skin. Immense clouds of ash towered over the surrounding villages and snaked into the air, dwarfing any vestige of human civilization that survived the damning blast.\n\nIn the distance, an unusually large fleet of Japanese ships approached the islands, riding the crashing waves in armed droves. In the cooking-hot sun, the metal ships sailed the seas and navigated the coast to observe the chaos. Sailors scattered in groups on the deck of the titanic ships, gazing at the explosive marvel spewing great clouds of ash and rivers of steaming-hot lava. They watched from afar, in absolute awe of the terrific sight of nature's cruel beauty, seemingly ignoring the wailing pleas of natives for evacuation, continuing to witness the fearsome strength of the natural world as it ravaged the peace and fertility of the isles."

Yet the consequences of her failure only made the act even more thrilling.\n\nRight before sunset, she began her great heist. She had snuck through the window of the bathroom with a bit of noise, but nothing loud enough to give her away. For a moment, she doubted herself. What if she really was caught? What if they found out her parents' names? What would they do to her family? Her mother always chastised her for her antics, but her friends called her the Monkey of Dapu. She grinned. She wouldn't dare let that reputation die now. She'd have a prize for them yet.\n\nShe slipped her way into the hallway, then the kitchen and finally, the living room. She looked around, and for a moment in the darkness of the dimly lit room she couldn't see anything; then, there it was, hanging from the wall. Climbing atop a table, with some effort to reach, she seized it.\n\nThen, a door slammed. Footsteps echoed in the hall, and the girl's blood ran cold. She stumbled off the table and darted back the way she came, into the bathroom and right out the window into some bushes. She sighed in relief, her heart pounding. She looked down at her prize, and she would've giggled with joy if she weren't trying to be inconspicuous. Slowly, she slipped the blade away from its sheath, the last light of the sun twinkling off of its shimmering steel. The Japanese so loved their swords, passing them down from one generation to the next over hundreds if not thousands of years. They cherished them as symbols of honor, of family, of wisdom. In a way, they were the embodiment of Japan's glory and destiny to rule all the corners of the east.\n\nAnd now one was in the grubby hands of the Monkey of Dapu. She couldn't help herself; she giggled. She couldn't wait to show her friends!"

His loader remained silent next to him, reading a magazine, the man was useless until the action started. The chief regarded him for a moment before glancing back into the boresight, moonlight shimmering over the peaceful waters, showing its beauty to him and only him. He had fallen in love with the sea at a young age, and even now, years later, that love had not waned. He knew that he'd stay in the navy until retirement, out here with the waves and gulls, it was the only place that made him truly, wholly, happy. He'd never leave it of his own volition.\n\nThen he saw it, a light coming from the coast the destroyer had been cruising along for the better part of an hour. Show time. He whacked his loader on the shoulder without looking away from his sight, rotating the gun to face the light and zooming in with his sight. It was a small coastal village from the looks of it. A large fire burned in the center of it, with people dancing, enjoying the night. He saw the happy faces of celebration on each man, woman, and child's face. He began calculating the range in his head, adjusting the elevation, and with a terrible blast, he fired.\n\nThe white phosphorus shell sailed flawlessly into the crowd of people, encompassing all around the fire in a burning white cloud. The closest buildings instantly ignited as the fire began to spread. People ran out of the white cloud, flesh melting from bone, faces twisted in horror and pain. He fired again, and again, and again, as fast as his loader could breach a shell.\n\nWhen it was over, nothing remained of the village but burning rubble.

Some distrusted their words, seeing them as too good to be true, but, well, they wouldn't have been there if they refused. In the end, they all saw no better option to escape the brick wall their lives were approaching.\n\nWhen they arrived on the isolated Vitu Islands and the downtrodden were forced off ship, many suspicions among them were raised. The officers finally announced the true intentions of this journey; they were there to establish an outpost to act as a foothold for the island of New Britain south of there, for the glory of the Empire and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. They would be given adequate rations and starting supplies, but otherwise they would have to utilize the islands' own resources.\n\nThat was when the panic began. In truth, almost none of them knew how to build even a hut of straw, much less how to fend for themselves on a group of tiny islands thousands of kilometers away from home. Some began by protesting, desperately trying to explain how it must've been some kind of mistake. They begged, they pleaded, but the crew and the guards responded only by stern orders to get to work. Then a man tried to seize an officer's gun, a blow was struck, and suddenly the entire 'expedition' tried to storm back onboard.\n\nChaos reigned for a full hour, and when the dust settled, five of the volunteers lay dead, their blood spilt on a distant beach. Frustrated, the crew threw the boxes of rations to the survivors and set sail for home, not even giving them the supplies. As the sun reached its noon zenith, a lone volunteer cried out in frustration and fear."

Attempting to negotiate, the businessmen tried every trick they knew to convince the natives to leave and alluded to financial compensation, but to no avail. With every word the businessmen uttered, a deeper red flush of anger swept over their faces as they too began to realise the ignorance and insanity of their proposition.\n\nIn their dealings, an altercation arose from a dispute; the natives were outraged at the ignorance and greed shown by the foreigners. The negotiators retreated back to their encampment, scampering to escape from the increasingly rowdy crowds now gathered to heckle at the negotiators. With the failure to make a deal, it had been noted by field command that the marines were sanctioned to use deadly force in response to any resistance; they cocked their rifles and leapt from the back of military vehicles, marching to the settlements with cold, objectifying stares.\n\nMoving into the small village, the marines opened fire and mowed down the natives for having the gall to resist the \"negotiations\". The crackle of gunshots and wails of natives could be heard from the distance as the surveyors awkwardly awaited clearance from the IJN. Runaways were shot, homes were burned, and survivors were beaten for their disobedience.

Ever since the power had gone out - it had never come back on for about five years - they had all agreed to light up the streets by whatever means they could. For Fen, it was porch lights, for others, it was via lanterns and candles. As she fiddled with the batteries, the day finished its transition into dusk. One minute, the streets were dark. The next, all of the street and the houses were soaked in golden light.\n\nTens of people, from the elderly, to the children who had barely learned to walk, rushed out of their homes, stunned by the sudden brightness.

If Ruogang was lucky enough, he would be home by ten, but even then the only thing he could do during a coveted moment of solitude would be to prepare a simple dinner, set an alarm, and hope that he wasn't tired enough to oversleep. There must be another way, he thought.\n\nAn old mountain road. Feng once told him that he sometimes takes it just to escape traffic jams.

The road was covered in potholes, ruined by age and poorly lit with flickering bulbs only every few minutes. Even a seemingly safe stretch of the path could be dangerous. It was almost nine, and as his urge to speed up the journey bubbled in his chest, Ruogang stepped on the gas pedal and clenched his hands on the wheel. His eyes were tired and drowsy.

They hammered and drilled chunks of the ore from the walls of the mine for hours at a time, but the twinkling glimpse of a shiny, silver material had caught Sung-Nam's eye. Acknowledging that supervisors were absent in the early hours of the morning, the impoverished miners discussed and gathered around the vein; no one knew what the material was, but split equally between them, it was sure to sell for a high price.\n\nSome time after his tiresome shift, Sung-Nam went to the local market, filled to the brim with the chatter of people and little shops packed with trinkets and fragrances. Bargaining with a merchant, he sold the mineral for a hefty sum, almost half of his usual salary.

Everybody hated him, yet no one wanted to vote for anyone else.\n\n\"Mayor Tanaka,\" a reporter raised his hand. \"A question?\" Well, might as well. At least this guy's showing curiosity, perhaps indulging him would enliven the crowd. Maybe not. It was best to try anyway.\n\n\"Ah yes, young man! What is it?\"\n\nA little taken aback by the Mayor's manners, the reporter paused for several moments before he continued. Awkwardness filled the space of silence. \"Well,\" he began. \"did you outsource the concrete and cement used in constructing this bridge to a cheaper, non-government sanctioned corporation?\" Now everyone was interested. Bored stares turned into nervous glances, and the crowd was stunned.\n\n\"Well, I-\" Tanaka began. \"I think that's enough for today.\" With a snip of his scissors he christened the bridge, but no one clapped. The next morning's newspaper issue featured Tanaka's embarrassing gap-tooth and was headlined: BORING MAYOR CAUGHT RED-HANDED IN CORRUPTION SCHEME."

 japtakagirecon.139.d:0 "Emissaries from across the Sphere have gathered to discuss the fate of Northern Borneo, stepping from airplanes in a flamboyant show of international cooperation. The Prime Minister, however, had no tolerance for the flashing cameras, hurrying the diplomats into a great hall to begin the talks and finalize the agreements for the end of the North Borneo Military Administration.\n\nDebating and discussing around a round table, the Prime Minister guided talks between the three nations about the territorial future of the region. Proposing many plans to the diplomats, Takagi attempted to juggle the specific and sometimes unreasonable demands of each emissary, exhausting him and his patience. In a particularly heated argument between the three, Takagi stepped away from the bickering diplomats for a moment and thought to himself, who was the Prime Minister in the room if he served these power-hungry representatives like a slave? They had apparently not noticed his momentary disappearance, and he scoffed and braced for hours of squabbling, returning to his duty with tired eyes and a forced smile."

 japtakagirecon.140.d:0 "Takagi met with his cabinet in the early morning. Almost all of his men were tired, some still yawning from barely putting themselves together when crawling out of bed, but Takagi was wide awake and freshly prepared for action. Capitalizing on their early fatigue, he came at them with a swift proposal. In order for the settlements in New Britain to be profitable, the government had to subsidize the development of the region promptly by pumping millions of Yen into the local economy.\n\nThe sheer cost of the proposal shook his entire cabinet awake as they were taken aback by the magnitude of the proposed investment. Nakasone let out a deep breath of air and cackled, unable to contain his laughter at the proposal. The Prime Minister wasn't so humored, and scowled at the minister for his inappropriate, half-awake reaction. After spending a while explaining to his men the necessity of the investment, and the stakes if they were to retract their administration's subsidizing oversight, the cabinet approved of the proposal, much to Takagi's relief."

It flapped its majestic wings proudly, and irked its head back and forth as it strolled down the sandy beaches. The boy was pleased to be distracted from his Japanese class; he hated the subject, and would miss it at any opportunity he could take.\n\nMs. Asagiri, the boy's Japanese teacher, noticed his negligence and screamed his name, demanding he came to the front of the class. He was violently pulled from his serene daydreaming as the entire class of students turned to gaze at him with worry. Shocked with horror, his teacher furiously marched over to him with a deathly stare; she took his hands and dragged him to the chalkboard.\n\nHe was interrogated in front of his peers, and he broke down into tears out of lonesome embarrassment. She heckled his name mockingly, and beat him with a cane to punish him for his laziness in class and neglect of his study of the Japanese language. Ashamed and humiliated, the boy whimpered further, crying and wailing as his fellow students watched on, frozen by fear."
