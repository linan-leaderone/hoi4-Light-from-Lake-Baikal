 ILG.1.t:0 "A Call From Rome"
 ILG.1.d:0 "Surrounded by half a dozen of his most trusted aides and subordinates, the General let out a heavy sigh, then turned to the myriad of maps and charts that covered the large table in the middle of an otherwise plain meeting room. Not much time was present to prepare the bases for the arrival of new troops, officers, and volunteers, and thus most of their meetings and all of their dwelling took place in drab military warehouses, which at the very least offered an escape from the desert's heat.\n\nPrior to the Call, the sizeable Algerian garrison was mostly neglected to fighting a losing war against the Arabs, against the pied-noirs, and against their own commanders who themselves were desperate to free up resources for more productive theatres. Indeed, some of the men now present were still dealing in task-forces and insurgency tactics, seemingly unaware that the campaign which they were now drawing up would be the largest since the Second World War.\n\nGiuseppe himself has earned his spurs fighting in old Yugoslavia, and was willing to turn a blind eye to some of their naivety. And yet, as the discussions turned increasingly to nuanced debates of the theoretical, he saw the need to interfere.\n\n\"This is not a matter of this passway or that. This. This is not a conflict of skirmishes and villages, This is a battle. A battle of cities, and railways, and will. The Duce has declared that Algeria will be a battlefield, and I intend to deliver him a victory. The Spaniards will rue the day they first looked across their blasted side of the border and thought they saw opportunity, and if they do not, then I intend to personally accept their surrender from the port of Casablanca. You are here to do your part for the eternal march of our Empire, so will you?\""

 ILG.2.t:0 "An Offer They Can't Refuse"
 ILG.2.d:0 "Mohamed Boudiaf was not a particularly intimidating character - the man was dressed in a western suit, and an onlooker who chanced to meet him might use the word 'smart' to describe his character. But smart was not good enough in the world of diplomacy. The natives were not on a single knife's edge, but trapped between the blades of a scissor.\n\nThe meeting was arranged with considerable speed, and two men now sat in an airy living room somewhere south of Constantine. Quickly settling into French as a common language between them, Italian negotiations with the Algerian FNL henceforth began. Only a few hours later, Italy's ambitions had made very little progress.\n\n\"Here. Here we have undeniable proof of a series of crackdowns the Iberians carried out in the eastern provinces, Italy offers all of her condolences and only asks that-\"\n\n\"The Italian garrisons have killed sixteen of our men this past week. Thirty civilians were buried this month alone, we do not wish to hear of condolences.\"\n\n\"And...\" The man continued, feigning a confidence that was slipping by the second. \"And only asks that it be allowed to prove its dedication to the Algerian cause by offering a new set of reforms.\"\n\n\"The French tried reforms.\" The revolutionary replied.\n\nIt took days before an agreement was reached. One which, on paper, granted Algeria minor reparations and significant autonomy. It was truly a blessing then, that Rome did not intend to follow through with empty words, written on meaningless paper."
 ILG.2.a:0 "Dispatch received."
 ILG.3.t:0 "Iberia Attacks!"
 ILG.3.d:0 "The inevitable has finally come to pass: After a short period of complete diplomatic silence from Iberian Algeria, armed militias have been spotted crossing the border in Cabilia, Touggourt, Adrar, and several other regions along the Italian frontier. Although war has not been officially declared by either of our countries, one thing is clear: Iberia has begun a military offensive directly into Italian Algeria.\n\nUpon hearing of the situation, the initial response from mainland Italy has been disappointingly unalarmed - vague promises for extra shipments of equipment and manpower, and sometimes, nothing more than words of support. The ability for our inevitable calls for reinforcement to successfully maneuvere the tense political situation in Rome is not certain, and if the mainland decides that the cost of holding Algeria to be simply too great, it is possible that we may be left with very little, if any, additional support from Italy for the remainder of the war. Adding onto our troubles, this conflict shall certainly exacerbate our already significant issues with banditry; as more and more of our security forces are redirected to the Iberian front, and increasing amounts of our already scant supplies is lost to the scorching Algerian desert, roving hordes of native bandits may find easy opportunities for convoy raiding, further hurting our supply.\n\nIn any case, all of our currently deployed military forces are quickly beginning to mobilize, and any additional militias we can muster are being activated. As our few operational aircraft scramble off their runways, and ragtag groups of native platoons begin their trek through the Algerian desert, many question if we are capable of actually staging an offensive into the Iberian military government to expel their forces from Algeria entirely, and failing that, if we are capable of even repelling the incoming Iberian assault. Regardless, the battle for Algeria has begun."
 ILG.3.a:0 "We must repel the Iberian Invaders!"
 ILG.4.t:0 "A Call From Rome"
 ILG.4.d:0 "Only a few hour's notice gave Mario Pirani the time he needed to prepare for the call.\n\nMattei had always joked that, if the Duce was to take a walk into his office one day and ask him to salute out of courtesy, then the ENI would be shut down on that same day. Since then, Mario had gained a better grasp of the pigsty that had become Italian politics, and more than enough betrayed comrades to haunt him for a living.\n\nYet even all of those years later, a call from the PNF - And it was still the PNF, no matter how Ciano chose to tell it - still left a bad taste in his mouth.\n\nAlerted by a tip from one of his men in the ministry, the chairman of the ENI expected the call and made his preparations in advance. If knowledge was indeed power then he would need all the strength he could muster to overturn the new strand of stupidity that had overtaken the government as of late: War would blow past and cast away everything the ENI had worked towards for the past decade, and he was not the only one that thought so. In Iberia, every investor with a head on their shoulder was begging for conflict to be averted just as desperately as he was.\n\nCarefully calibrating his words and making conformations with his various connections in Lisbon and Algiers, Pirani prepared as best he could for the trial that was to come. His theme, he had decided, would be the one word that both Dictators and Dogs of war could both read and fully comprehend.\n\nWhen the phone rang, he answered with a smile.\n\n\"I am not talking of peace, no. I have no desire to subject Italy to the humiliations of a war forfeit.\" He leaned back, \"What I am talking of, dear sir, is profit.\""
 ILG.4.a:0 "...And Algeria is an opportunity like no other."
 ILG.5.t:0 "The Palma Conference"
 ILG.5.d:0 "PALMA DE MALLORCA, REUTERS\n\nSpanish sun warmed the proverbial white dove today as Italian and Iberian diplomats met on the island of Mallorca to discuss the ongoing tensions in Algeria. A de jure French colony, the African nation has been thrust into the de facto rulership of Italy in the east and Iberia in the west since the end of the Second World War. After the fall of the Triumvirate alliance, both Italy and the Iberian Federation have been attempting to expand their respective spheres of influence, and for leading politicians in both nations, this means an expansion of the colonial programs in the Algerian hinterland.\n\nEmpire is as empire does, however, and competing colonial programs naturally lead to direct conflict. Seeking to avoid a return to the colonial wars of the Victorian age, Iberian leadership bucked expectations and proposed a meeting of the two Mediterranean powers to discuss the future of Algeria. For their part, the Italians enthusiastically accepted such an opportunity to \"reaffirm the Italian dedication to a peaceful and collaborative Mediterranean\".\n\nWith memories of Malta still fresh, the success of this conference is anything but assured. In Madrid and in Rome, leading conservatives wish for a show of strength, and to militarily wrest Algeria from the opposing power. To many onlookers, the current \"Palma Conference\" is simply a reverse Chekhov's gun: a misleading distraction before the conflict devolves into barred teeth and bloody fists. Still, in Palma de Mallorca itself, hope seems to spring eternal as Italians and Iberians shake hands and make deals-- constructive state-building plans have been proposed by one side and thoroughly considered by the other, and it seems that an agreement of co-rulership is close to being reached.\n\nDespite jingoistic and pessimistic objections, the bells of La Seu seem to be sounding for peace and not war. Leading policy correspondents seem optimistic that this is serious proof of the good-faith liberalization of the regimes on both sides of the Balearic Sea. Perhaps, with time, democracy shall return to fair Europa."
 ILG.5.a:0 "Peace was always an option!"
 ILG.6.t:0 "The Palma Conference"
 ILG.6.d:0 "Having spent the past few weeks in frantic communication with the PNF in Rome, the Iberians in both Madrid and Lisbon and his own network of allies and aides dispersed across both sides of the Algerian border. The Palma conference was nothing less than a triumph for Mario Pirani.\n\nAlways weary before meeting an audience, he spent the last few hours he had before the conference's start making changes to the speech he intended to open with, standing beside Portuguese ambassador Alberto Moreira. The two men had developed an excellent working partnership that managed to, against all odds, prevent a potentially ruinous war from torching both nation's assets and investments in Algeria. And now, as he walked past the various delegations that both Italy and Iberia sent to represent their interests, he offered a curt nod to the native Algerian mission - which he himself had helped negotiate with - and a small grin to the group of ENI representatives that occupied the row below that of the PNF's own delegation, showing just how far the company's influence had gone with its efforts to foster peace and cooperation between Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon now successful.\n\nHis work was far from done. It was, after all, only just beginning. But when the man stepped up to the podium and began thanking those attending for having made the journey, he could not help but feel his chest swell with pride: War was all but averted, in no small part due to his own work."
 ILG.6.a:0 "\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Palma.\""
 ILG.7.t:0 "Iberian Algeria Surrenders!"
 ILG.7.d:0 "Through the blood, sweat, and tears of native and Italian forces alike, we have triumphed over Iberia!\n\nWith Italian-Algerian forces marching through Oran, as well as the loss of control of the vast majority of the Algerian desert, Iberia has accepted defeat. It has begrudgingly arranged for all of Iberian Algeria's territorial possessions to be formally turned over to our military governorate, and seeing no other option, the Iberian-Algerian Governor Jorge Jardim has been forced to return to Iberia.\n\nHowever, we are forced to make a difficult decision: In order for any any semblance of stability to return to the war-torn country, we must end the current military government and replace it with a more permanent political system, one which is hopefully capable of maintaining stability and lasting peace.\n\nWe could respect our previously made promises of autonomy to the Algerian people, and establish an Algerian Republic, headed by FLN chairmen Ferhat Abbat. This state, although close to Rome, would be a democratic nation, independent from direct Italian meddling. Although we would cede the ability to directly dominate Algeria, the newly-formed country would continue to be squarely in our sphere of influence, allowing us to retain significant influence on the region.\n\nAlternatively, we could walk back on our promise, and establish an Algerian puppet state under the direct supervision of the native politician Said Boualam. Such a state would remain effectively part of our empire, and would serve as a useful bargaining chip with the French State, as well as provide an extended direct front with the Iberian Union in case of further aggression. However, Boulam is widely disliked by the populace for his anti-independence stances, and such a move could incite the already-high tensions between the current government and the native people to a boil.\n\nWith the future of Algeria in our hands, what decision do we make?"
 ILG.7.a:0 "Algeria shall remain under our direct control."
 ILG.7.b:0 "We must honor our promise to the Algerian people."
 ILG.8.t:0 "Birth of the Algerian Mandate"
 ILG.8.d:0 "\"Well then,\" Pirani said, hope in his voice, \"have we reached a mutual agreement?\" The conference had been ongoing for several hours now, marked by periods of concessions, affirmations, and a sense of overarching fatigue. The Iberian diplomat looked down for a moment, quickly resetting his gaze squarely on Pirani and the rest of the Italian delegation.\n\n\"I suppose so.\" Several reserved, but still audible sighs could be heard throughout the spacious room. \"We'd like to discuss some of the specifics, of course, but yes, we find these conditions palatable.\"\n\nWord had quickly reached the Duce of the successful conference; as artfully explained to him a few days prior, the proposed plan would have Algeria been ruled under a dual-mandate. Instead of maintaining the vague borders between the various occupation zones, Iberian and Italian soldiers alike would keep the peace, with a functioning democratic state being built on the sands of Algeria, one which represents both native and settled inhabitants in the running of the country. A favorable outcome, of course, the Duce remarked. While there was a plausible chance of Italy winning the war that seemed so inevitable only a short time ago, neither the region nor the expected public outcry against a war made fighting such a war worth it, whether it be in the long or short term.\n\nIn any case, Algeria has been spared the horror of war, but a tumultuous future awaits it still. If either Iberia or Italy decides to withdraw from the territory, the Duce knew, the remaining country would be forced to choose to either spend significant amounts of resources maintaining it, or to follow suit and abandon Algeria entirely. Still, all of Italy can enjoy the triumph of peace for today."
