 POLITICS_SOBHUZA_II_DESC: "出生几个月后，埃斯瓦蒂尼的索布扎二世国王就被推上了王位，成了有史以来世上在位时间最长的君主。1953年，他见证了埃斯瓦蒂尼的完全独立，如今，他又巧妙地与南非利益相结，一同对抗德国人。索布扎二世曾见证无数君主的诞生、加冕与下葬，而他则率领人民走过一代又一代岁月。他的统治似乎还将持续多年。"

 SWZ_south_african_kingdom_desc: "Eswatini has had a tumultuous history over the last few years. The Kingdom was at first anything but, independent in name only under South Africa, and reduced to another exploited province with the rise of the Afrikaaner Volkstaat. However, with the Volkstaat's collapse, Eswatini has reasserted itself as a proper nation and hopes to build a proper nation from the corpse of South Africa."
 SWZ_uncontrolled_nepotism: "失控的裙带关系"
 SWZ_uncontrolled_nepotism_desc: "For most of its history, power, and money in Eswatini have been with the ruling house of Dlamini, and even through all the chaos of the last few years, this has been the case. As a result, nepotism runs rampant throughout the country's administration, hampering the ability to find skillful civil servants and leaders. This chronic problem has led to weaknesses both in the bureaucracy and the military"
