 POLITICS_Klaus_Barbie_DESC:0 "The Butcher of Lyon makes his new home in Danzig, bringing his old troops, his old ideas, his old means- but new, fresh amounts of blood.\n\nMany words come to mind when the name Klaus Barbie is brought up, and few of them are good. A Gestapo and SS functionary during the war, Barbie made his name on wholesale slaughter, keeping the French in check during the occupation. Such cunning brutality quickly brought him to the forefront of SS operations, and his drive- and promotions- never slowed. Soon, he was sent to Germany by direct order of the Reichsführer, a critical part of Heydrich's support in East Prussia- and an eye kept on the protégé.\n\nOnce the Bürgerkrieg was won, Barbie was reassigned to Danzig, ordered to keep his eye on Heydrich under the guise of \"Anti-Partisan actions\"- a move that has paid off in full, as Heydrich splits from Himmler and Germany breaks apart again. Barbie's hold on Danzig and the surrounding area remains stable, even in these troubled times- and with native partisans to the north, potential treachery to his south and west, and few allies to the East, his determination has only grown.\n\nBarbie is the unshakeable eye of Himmler's forces, a siphon of intelligence and codes. The SS-Standartenführer does all he can to deliver the information that Himmler expects of him, and he doesn't mind torture, murder, kidnapping, arson, or any other unsavory method to do it. Indeed, there's a reason the Reichsführer puts such trust in him- with his focus on ideological purity, it seems likely he'll stay with the founder of the System. However, if some misstep occurs, and he begins to have doubts of Himmler's intentions,  it would certainly do Heydrich much good to shut down such a wealth of stolen secrets- and, perhaps, use them for his own ends.\n\nOlder, wiser, but still as cunning and brutal as he ever was, there's no doubt that Barbie is one of the most dangerous men in Germany today, no matter what happens around him."

 KLB_anti_partisan_specialty_desc:0 "The German Civil War has weakened the Reich's grip upon Europe, and allowed the Untermenschen to show their ugly faces in areas where they would once have been afraid. The power struggle in Germany has only encouraged this sort of degenerate behavior, with several slavs having the audacity to call themselves free men. There is only one response to this ludicrous sense of national pride, and that is found at the end of a rifle.\n\nKlaus Barbie, the Butcher of Lyon and the leader of the Intelligence Operation in Danzig, has thoroughly trained his men and aides in the art of suppressing those who would see themselves lifted above the Aryan race. So brutal are the methods of Barbie and his compatriots that it is an ongoing debate whether he means to scare the Poles into submission with his savagery, or if he intends to wipe out the race once and for all.\n\nLeft to their own devices in Eastern Europe, these anti-partisan soldiers will certainly do more than just collect intelligence."

 KLB_logistical_stronghouse_HH_desc:0 "Within the streets of Danzig runs a grand and hastily assembled intelligence operation. Throughout the city, Klaus Barbie's operatives have occupied buildings to utilize as listening posts, intelligence nexuses, and operational centers in their endeavor to scrounge up every bit of information on Heydrich and his allies to send to Nanzig. With any luck, Barbie might chance upon a gold mine of information which will shift the tides of this internal strife, and perhaps even put him in the golden pages of Reichsführer-SS Himmler's books..."

SS officers loyal to Barbie and his organizations have begun to go missing unexpectedly, seemingly whisked away from existence. Those that are found are oft found mutilated, tortured, or dead. Resistance to the Butcher of Lyon's brutality stirs under the intelligence nexus of Danzig, and it has grown too large to be ignored."
