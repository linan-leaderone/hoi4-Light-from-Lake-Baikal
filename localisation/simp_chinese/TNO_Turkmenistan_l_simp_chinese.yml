 TRK_Fragmented_Tribes_desc: "土库曼斯坦的社会和政治结构几乎完全由生活在其境内的土库曼部落组成。政治上，它们是波达支持的基础，但也是他某些改革的最大障碍。\n\n部落不希望改变他们的方式或支持土库曼斯坦的发展，找到一种既能左右他们又不让他们失去信心的方法是这个年轻国家面临的最紧迫的问题之一。"
 TRK_Question_Of_Identity: "身份认同问题"
 TRK_Question_Of_Identity_desc: "土库曼斯坦是一个国家，但还不是一个民族。事实上，现在剩下的是一个完全被摧毁的更大国家——苏联——的遗迹。这让土库曼斯坦处于一种没有自己身份的奇怪边缘状态。\n\n是什么造就了土库曼人？是我们脚下的土地吗？我们声称属于自己的部落吗？这些都是迟早需要回答的问题，国家团结起来、采取一致行动的能力取决于它。"
 TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road: "现代丝绸之路"
 TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road_desc: "历史以一种有趣的方式重演。早在古代，丝绸之路是贯穿中亚的伟大贸易路线，连接着古代世界的远东和远西。因此，现在和以前一样，土库曼斯坦发现自己处于新丝绸之路的中心。\n\n与中亚其他国家和中国西北部相比，土库曼斯坦是相对稳定的灯塔；尽管看起来冷酷无情，但这吸引了寻求庇护和利益的人来到我们家门口，张开双臂拥抱他们对我们帮助很大。"
 POLITICS_PODA_ANNAORAZOV_DESC: "土库曼的革命并未随着苏联的陷落而终结，苏联及其代表的意志，始终是土库曼人民的坚定信仰。不过，当伊朗趁苏联陷落之机入侵土库曼斯坦时，俄国官僚和行政人员却抛弃土库曼人民，飞也似地逃回家乡。于是，保卫土库曼斯坦的重任落到了一位医师、一位保卫者身上，波达·安瑙拉佐夫，一位土生土长的土库曼人。\n\n率领一帮由土库曼部落民、苏维埃游击队员、朋友以及盟友组成的乌合之众，波达不仅击退了伊朗人的进犯，还将同时入侵的阿富汗人赶回老家。这位撒马尔罕的英雄立下赫赫战功令举国动容，自然，他就被提名为土库曼斯坦主席。然而，治国远难于战胜敌军。战争结束后，波达过了几年比上战场或疗伤还要难受的生活，这样的日子使他压力倍增。\n\n波达尽力统治着土库曼斯坦，但他终究不是个管理者。虽然他坚信布哈林主义，但他也发现，自己有时会被身边的顾问、部长、将领、盟友和官僚牵着鼻子走。在这里面，有些人同样深信着布哈林主义，而其他人尽管十分敬佩他（他同样敬佩这些人），却支持着与他所提倡的布哈林主义原则背道而驰的思想。随着时间一点一点流逝，他们的态度也越发不明朗。有时，这样的生活会让他希望能再一次开赴前线。"

 POLITICS_MIRSAID_SULTANGALIYEV_DESC: "If any man in Central Asia today represents its traumatic and conflicting heritage from the last few decades, it is Mirsaid Sultangaliyev.\n\nBorn in Bashkiria, deep in the most Russified parts of Eurasia, Mirsaid was an early follower of the revolutionary ideas spreading like wildfire across Russia - seeing in them the solution to the imperialist oppression clamping down on the minorities and Islamic faith, and the way forward for the organization of these peoples. His time in Baku in the early tens and twenties pushed him further to the Bolsheviks' path, and when his time came to fight for the Revolution he did so with aplomb, using his familiarity with national movements in Central Asia to cripple the Whites - earning the trust of none other than Vladimir Lenin himself in the process.\n\nAll seemed set for a steady rise through the Soviet ranks as a representative of the Turkic nationalities of the USSR and its Islamic people - a rise which never came. The rest of the Party remained suspicious of his tolerance of regional nationalism and religion, and so Mirsaid remained marooned in Central Asia, far from the decision-making, working steadfastly to improve the local situation but without much hope of influencing the top.\n\nThat was, until the Nazi war machine crushed the USSR entirely and left its peripheral republics reeling in a chaotic void of power. Now, Mirsaid Sultangaliyev stands as a symbol of Turkic cooperation amongst those left standing - still believing in the end goal of Marxism-Leninism but adapted to truly serve the people instead of the Russian despots in a far-away capital."
 POLITICS_ZIYAUDDIN_BABAKHAN_DESC: "Hailing from the line of Ahmad Yasawi comes another great Turkic scholar of the Islamic Faith. Ziyauddinhan Babahan was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and grew up among the faith, following in the footsteps of his father in the early years of his life and being educated by Shami Domla, whose theology and politics influenced his own greatly. When Kalinin accepted the request of Uzbek and Turkmen Imams to establish the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (or SADUM for short) during the Second World War, his life took a distinctly different turn, not one of mere theology, but of politics in turn. Though officially his father led the organization to start, as its secretary, much of the administrative duties fell to Ziyauddinhan.\n\nWith Islam in one hand and Marxism in the other, Ziyauddinhan sought to shepherd the faithful of his homeland fairly and equitably. Training of the clergy, the management of charity, and the publishing of religious material fell to himself and the organization that he ran. As the war took a sour turn for the USSR, it fell to him in turn, to be their guide and protector as the Union disintegrated, and more and more of the people of Central Asia turned to the faith for truth and comfort. Even after the war's end, Ziyauddinhan continues to fight this good fight.\n\nThese days, he is far from home, running SADUM from the safety and security of Turkmenistan. Both he and his organization represent a sense of continuity and structure remaining from the days of the Soviet Union. In spite of everything that has happened, the dual spirit of Marxism and Islam lives strong, and socialist thought justified by his interpretations of Islamic law provides an additional avenue to security and to justice in a world that so often lacks both."
