 POLITICS_LUTZ_GRAF_KROSIGK_DESC:0 "作为一位保守派律师和声名狼藉的前任财政部长，鲁茨·什未林·冯·科洛希克伯爵第一眼看上去不太像是那种统治一片德国疆土的人。他被可恨的冯·巴本任命为财政部长，并在纳粹党夺权之后通过放低身段、对希特勒的盲从和坚持党的路线保住了自己的位置。他依靠自己表面上的整合经济的能力取得了希特勒的信任和尊重，让他得以在50年代的经济崩溃之后逃过一死。不过这次希特勒的尊重没有保住他的位置。\n\n在失去财政部长的位置之后，他辗转数个政府部门，成为一个漂泊不定的文员。后来，元首对他大发慈悲，考虑到他的处境艰难，命他担任波默恩-摩赫恩保护领的保护官。\n\n科洛希克踏入保护领政坛时的心态一半是恐惧，一半是决心向元首展现自己的能力。自然，波默恩-摩赫恩作为一个国家可谓是千疮百孔，游击队频繁摧毁这里所剩无几的基础设施。要让这个保护领重新运作起来需要下一些功夫，也需要做出一些革新。当然，德国肯定不会喜欢这种革新，不过只要不让他们知道就没问题了。"
 POLITICS_KURT_DALUEGE_DESC:0 "Born in a small Silesian town, Kurt Max Franz Daluege was always a German through and through, thriving in the military culture of the old empire. Daluege joined the Nazi Party in the early years, and soon moved onto the SS, serving as head of the Ordnungspolizei for many of the prewar years. It was a post perfectly suited for a sociopath such as himself, and Daluege was highly effective at crushing partisans and dissenters.\n\nSo it was that when Daluege was sent to Bohemia after the defeat of the Soviet Union it felt, to him, as if he was being stripped of his rank for little reason. But despite his distaste for the position, Daluege was convinced that he would return to the centre of German politics soon enough, and so he continued to exercise a callous cruelty towards those he watched over. As Himmler undertook his coup, Daluege could do nothing but watch from his post in Prague. The return to central German politics never came.\n\nLack of a position in the inner party did not truly put Daluege down, however. He has since built his network in Bohemia, even betraying SS principles and working with the Czech Resistance in the years after the West Russian War, allowing them to grow under his supervision and using them to undermine the garrison when he saw fit. When the civil war came, he called upon his network and chased the garrison out of Prague, declaring himself Oberstgruppenführer. There are few outside the SS who would support his coup, and the fanatical actions that are sure to follow.\n\nBut in Daluege's eyes, he has has been shunned long enough by Germania. Let decadent fools shout across the continent. Daluege now holds the power in Bohemia, and nobody, not in his own realm, not in Germany, not even in Burgundy, is going to take it from him."
