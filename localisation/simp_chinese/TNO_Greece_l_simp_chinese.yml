 POLITICS_THEMELIS_DESC: "如同现代希腊与横跨全世界的亚历山大帝国之间的关系一样，乔治斯·塞梅利斯仅仅是先总统塞奥佐罗斯·潘加洛斯一个黯淡的影子。精明强干的潘加洛斯曾从合作效府手中夺取权力，并说服意大利让他来恢复希腊的稳定，而糊里糊涂的塞梅利斯执政至今还没有什么出彩表现。潘加洛斯得到了保安营的忠诚，并且至少在表面上准备好了治理希腊的计划，而塞梅利斯不仅得不到自己政府的忠诚，还没法在公众面前掩盖住政府中盛行的腐败作风。\n\n尽管在雅典的大街小巷都可以听到人民在抱怨总统的碌碌无为，但他并不是不了解国家的局势有多么动荡，只是他担心的事情比老百姓担心的还要严重得多。他受制于意大利宗主和一派军官，前者能容忍塞梅利斯政府，仅仅是因为不会给自己找麻烦，后者则是因为军官们强取豪夺的行为得到了总统的准许。塞梅利斯并非不会用希腊人民的利益来中饱私囊，但他有时也会好奇这种状态还将持续多久。"
 POLITICS_DIMITRIOS_PSARROS_DESC: "无论是雅典还是罗马的国王，都让希腊长期蒙受暴君强加于人民的血泪之苦。历经数十年惨无人道的暴君掠夺，这个国家变得前所未有地贫瘠且弱小。然而，反抗精神依然深深扎根于人民心中，希腊最勇敢的儿女正冒着生命危险，建设一个他们可能无法亲眼的未来。即使是他们的队伍中，也很少有人像德米特里奥斯·普萨罗斯那样甘冒风雨、久经战阵，他确实是希腊抵抗运动中一位受尊敬的人物。\n\n普萨罗斯出生在希腊中部一个不起眼的村庄，年纪轻轻就成为了国家的忠仆，参与过20世纪初的历次战争。作为埃莱夫塞里奥斯·韦尼泽洛斯手下自由民族主义的狂热信徒，普萨罗斯在第一次世界大战期间奋不顾身地投入支持协约国的临时国防政府麾下，也曾在1935年参与了失败的韦尼泽洛斯派政变。当其他韦尼泽洛斯派将意大利入侵视为推翻君主制的绝佳时机时，普萨罗斯只看到一个国王将取代另一个国王，随即他化身为自由斗士，转入地下活动。他的抵抗组织“国家社会解放组织”规模虽小，但颇受尊敬，战争结束后，他们与希腊国家共和联盟巩固了彼此意识形态上的相似之处。\n\n吉齐基斯政府崩溃后，普萨罗斯因其地位与声望获得了临时总统的头衔。他和他在共和联盟的战友们即将实现他们建立自由的希腊共和国的梦想，但前进的道路上仍有很多挑战。持续的共产主义叛乱和彻底的经济破坏威胁着新希腊，但如果普萨罗斯能成功解决这一切，他就获得了建立一个让韦尼泽洛斯为之自豪的国家的丰厚基础。"
 POLITICS_KOMNINOS_PYROMAGLOU_DESC: "科姆尼诺斯·皮罗马格卢自少就为希腊人民的解放而奋斗。在希腊参加一战的前一年，年仅17岁的他就加入了民兵组织，反抗奥斯曼帝国对希腊人的种族灭绝。在他与土耳其人斗争了六年后，1922年，他大胆营救了200名被围的希腊士兵，并参与了1922年革命，这些为他日后在希腊自由主义者中赢得了巨大声望。1938年，他因激进的自由主义主张被梅塔克萨斯独裁政权流放，但三年后他回到了希腊，反抗意大利傀儡政府，并一跃成为抵抗组织“希腊全国共和联盟”的领导人之一。\n\n整个四五十年代，皮罗马格卢致力于团结自由主义者和改良社会主义者，以履行共和联盟在希腊建立代议制民主的使命。可叹，法西斯铁拳把他逼到了希腊最偏远的乡村，而与共产主义的“希腊民族解放阵线”的暴力冲突使反法西斯运动一盘散沙。共和联盟创始人纳波利翁·泽瓦斯于1957过世后，皮罗马格卢成了该组织的领导人。他于1963年促成了共和联盟与民解阵和解，并一手缔造了统一战线以对抗塞梅利斯政府，最终在1964年建立了希腊临时共和国。经过了40年的爱国斗争，皮罗马格卢成为了希腊30年来的首个民选总统。\n\n皮罗马格卢雄心勃勃，要为全体希腊公民建立起广泛的医疗教育保障，这得到了强硬社会主义者和左翼资本家的支持。而右翼反对派则认为他的计划代价高昂，会使希腊的工业化努力付诸东流。就连其党内极左翼人士也批评他对工业化与劳工权益视而不见。"
 POLITICS_PANAGIOTIS_KANELLOPOULOS_DESC: "Born to a wealthy family in 1902, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos developed a passion for political science early in his life, and was an accomplished lawyer and respected scholar before his 30th birthday. Elected president of the Social Insurance Institution in 1934, Kanellopoulos was a rising star in the Greek republic, but alas, with the fall of Greek democracy, he found himself exiled to a small island in the Cyclades. Arrested by Italian forces in 1942 after attempting to establish a resistance group, he miraculously escaped captivity and shortly thereafter joined EDES.\n\nKanellopoulos was an unusual fit within the largely republican EDES, being a conservative-leaning monarchist. A hindrance to his influence within EDES for most of his time in the resistance, it became an enormously valuable asset to himself--and the resistance movement more generally--in gaining moderate conservatives' support for the provisional government. It was for his ability to appeal to the provisional government's many skeptics that Psarros appointed him interim deputy prime minister. Shortly thereafter, his promises of an economic golden era for Greece earned him the presidency, becoming the first democratically elected head of state Greece had seen in three decades.\n\nNow Kanellopoulos seeks to rapidly industrialize and modernize the Greek economy, to escape from the poverty which the Greek people endured through decades of dictatorship and warfare. By abolishing most of the stringent financial regulations put in place by the collaborationist government, he believes that both foreign and domestic investment will naturally follow, and transform Greece from forgotten backwater into a bonafide jewel of the Mediterranean."
 POLITICS_ANDREAS_PAPANDREOU_DESC: "In a world where extremes are the norm, Andreas Papandreou and the EDA seem out of place. Himself son of EPEK's party leader Georgios Papandreou, Andreas is a relative newcomer in Greek politics, having fled his homeland due to his leftist inclinations during Metaxas's regime. He found himself studying economics at Harvard in America, graduating with a PhD before joining the United States Navy in its war efforts until its inevitable defeat, after which he worked as a professor in numeros universities across North America.\n\nDuring the late 50's, after a little over a decade spent in the New World, Papandreou came back to Greece at the enquiry of various EDES figures - namely Konstantinos Karamanlis -, in prevision of post EEE Greece. Now, a few years after setting foot back on his homeland, Andreas finds himself President of Greece after its second elections since the fall of the EEE.\n\nMarking a stark contrast with the first members of the EDES, Andreas is intent on following his predecessor's measures in establishing a welfare state. Some speculate he might even further them, as his supporters chant his slogan \"Allagí! - Change!\""
 POLITICS_GEORGIOS_PAPADOPOULOS_DESC: "Few had ever heard of Georgios Papadopoulos before 1964. The son of a schoolteacher in a remote village, young Georgios saw enrolling in the Military Academy as a path out of poverty--and perhaps more importantly in his mind--a path towards greater power. He has been clawing his way to greater power ever since. He sought military glory as an artillery second lieutenant in the Second World War, and only two years later joined his erstwhile enemies to find power within their ranks. Through the 1940s and 1950s he gradually rose through the ranks of the Security Battalions. But while Papadopoulos could tolerate working under Theodoros Pangalos, he had nothing but loathing for the weak-willed and incompetent Themelis. Thus, Papadopoulous established IDEA, a secretive group which aimed to replace the government and put Papadopoulos at its head.\n\nIt was treason of the highest order, and necessitated the greatest secrecy to succeed. On the eve of revolution, Papadopoulos had established an extensive network of contacts within both the Greek government and with Greek insurgent groups. He was trusted by the Italian Duce and not suspected by Themelis. When EAM and EDES combined forces and ousted Themelis, he appealed to the Italians to assist him in a coup to restore order and prevent the spread of communism. They agreed, and now Georgios Papadopoulos and IDEA reign over the Greek nation.\n\nHis stated aims are ambitious, bordering on quixotic, to rapidly industrialize the Greek nation, to purge it of communism, unite the nation behind traditional Christian values, and achieve economic independence from Italy. His administration is brutal and arbitrary in its punishments, acting with consequentialism taken to its most violent extreme. His ability to remain in power will depend on maintaining amiable relations with Italy, securing his regime against the threat of terrorists in the hills and nefarious agents within his own government. Most importantly, he must ensure that the Greek people remain tightly under his thumb--sufficiently respectful and fearful of the security forces so as not to boldly protest in the streets, and not desperate enough to rise up anyway."
 POLITICS_GEORGIOS_GRIVAS_DESC: "The European political landscape following World War Two saw many self-styled patriots collaborating with the fascist invader and Georgios Grivas is no different. Grivas was born in Cyprus and moved to Greece in his early adulthood to embark on a career as an officer in the Greek Army, against his family's wishes. Right after his graduation in 1919, he was immediately posted on the Asia Minor front of the Greco-Turkish War, where he distinguished himself for his bravery. The failures of the war convinced him that only a strong hand could save Greece and bring forth Enosis, the reunification of all rightfully Greek territories. For that purpose, he created Organization X, an ultranationalist, monarchist cell within the Greek army and plotted for the eventual revolution that would defeat the liberal traitors in the government and give Greece her rightful place in the world.\n\nBut even the best plans laid by men can still be thwarted and that's what happened to Grivas. The revolution actually happened in Greece, but a liberal one. The fascist regime in Rome needed a loyal man in Athens and Grivas was just what they needed. Enticed by promises of power and wealth, Grivas aligned himself with the fascist invader, Organization X became the Party X of National Resistance, and from Athens he heralds a new era of strength, glory and prosperity for Greece. All while the Italian fascist jackboot rests on the neck of his motherland. While he might think otherwise, Grivas is no longer a loyal son of Greece. He is nothing but another puppet for a foreign regime like any other."

 gre.1.d:0 "To look at the recent change in the state of being as a singular revolution might be a bit misguided. Certainly, revolution occured in Hellas, but it was far from a unified effort. Though the plain cross of EDES, the crowned cross of Organization X, and the standards of various defecting army units and Security Battalions marched side-by-side into Athína, their visions for the future of the nation clashed drastically.\n\nIt is perhaps a mercy that the bulk of all the revolutionary forces converged on the capital at once, so that none could claim legitimacy over their ideological rivals. The only thing that they agreed upon was that this was not a republican, a monarchist, or a militarist revolution, but a Hellenic one, and it would be there that common ground was found.\n\nOut from the Hellenic Parliament, once a bastion of cronyism and corruption, emerged the leaders of revolution. Komninos Pyromaglou, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Georgios Grivas, and Georgios Papadopoulos walked in the sight of revolutionary, civilian, and hastily-assembled press alike on the steps, hands clasped in hands.\n\nAs one, they raised their fists to the sky, and with this firm display of revolutionary solidarity, they proclaimed with one voice the formation of a new provisional government to oversee the Hellenic state. The government would be modeled like the Parliamentary Democracies of Pre-War Europe, and as a People, they would decide what the path of Hellas would be.\n\nThe fate of Hellas is far from certain, but now more than ever, the people of the nation have hope for the future. Now it is time for Hellas to move forward once more."

However, even that chance is slipping away. After months of endless fighting, our troops being constantly assaulted, ambushed and routed, Attikí is the only true stronghold we can rely on.\n\nEven though occasional rumors of partisans carrying out resistance activity in the suburbs of the capital have reached Rome, the area still remains the only one we safely hold. Thus, we must make our decision on what our response will be. The High Commissioner to Greece, Luigi Mascherpa, who represents our interests there, has remained neutral on this issue so far, awaiting for a response from the government, but he seems to possess a better understanding of the situation on the ground.\n\nThe honorable Admiral and his closest advisors have debated the best course of action for days now, and little seems to have come out of it. As the National Resistance closes in on the capital, and threatens to end the EEE government, an immediate order to the Italian garrison must be sent. What shall it be?"

Before any power and influence Italy can exert on its former ally ends forever, Duce Ciano has decided it is time to hold actual negotiations on its future. As our best diplomats work day and night to contact the provisional government and begin talks, a formal conference must be arranged if we are to sign lasting peace.\n\nMany ideas have been thrown around about the location of this conference, and it has now become a question of whether we want to have the upper hand by holding it somewhere we have control, or hold it on Greek land.

Created by the communist party at the very start of the occupation, its aim was to become a \"popular front\" that would unite all ideologies to achieve a common goal the nation's liberation. This was never achieved, as most of the center and the right looked to alternatives such as EDES to join. However, that did not stop EAM from growing more and more, becoming the first resistance organization to shift from a small circle of select units and guerrillas to a nation-wide movement that encompassed every corner of the country.\n\nThe fall of the collaborationist regime in Athína has changed the situation dramatically, as the socialist organization is free to continue building up troops and influence in the government. This has made some people in the cabinet and the army rather worried, even afraid that it puts the carefully built order in the Balkans in danger.\n\nRecently, we were approached by a group named the \"Sacred Bond of Greek Officers\", also known as IDEA. They are a group of ambitious military commanders in the mess that is the current Greek army, and they have dedicated themselves to fighting communism. They have been the ones to inform us of the latest EAM operations, and have even offered to help in the investigation.\n\nThe troops of the National Liberation Front, especially active in the mountainous areas of Greece, have amassed significant support and are possibly preparing an offensive, both literally and figuratively, to seize control of the Provisional Government.

Obviously, this mission has failed, as is evident by the fact we are currently negotiating with the new regime that overthrew our allies. Still, the question of what our garrison force will do once Greece gains its full independence remains.\n\nThe Greek negotiators have been quite insistent on Italian withdrawal from their soil, but there is still room for deciding the exact details of that. For example, High Commissioner Mascherpa has suggested a program by which Italian military presence will be reduced to 30% of its original size.

Their proposal was the maintenance of Enosis, the term for the union with Cyprus, as a concession by Il Duce. What we have mentioned as a counterpoint is the great difference between the situation there and in Greece itself. While the partisans have seized control of the mainland, Cyprus is still under our firm control. Even though EOKA, the radical group advocating for Enosis, has intensified its activities as a result of the victory of the resistance, it has not been enough to force us to evacuate.\n\nThe possibility of a democratic plebiscite has also been considered by diplomats of both countries. A referendum organized jointly and held under the supervision of our garrison seems like a good middle ground, and it would show our commitment to liberty and justice.

Then there are those who are of a more conciliatory mind, accepting that the Greeks had proven untrustworthy in the past, but arguing that the downsides to an only-Italian operation outweigh the problems that involving the locals on the campaign and occupation would cause.\n\nEither way, Italy will face fierce opposition from an incensed and defiant Greek people, but this decisions could make the difference between a stable, friendly Greece, and a hostile, mutinous one. No one knows which path will lead where, though, and the Duce will need to make the final call."

 greneg_ita_scorza.3.d:0 "We have ships moving into position to the east and south of Athína, and boots on the ground are starting to gather on the Hellenic coast while the Royal Air Force dominates the sky above the turbulent peninsula the rebellion has taken control of. It's going to take some time, but we will soon be ready to move against the rebels, but before we do that, we ought to draft and deliver to them a list of demands. If we can avoid a fight, we should do so.\n\nOf course, it's easy to decide on the bulk of the demands. The standing Greek rebels will stand down, Italian forces be allowed to re-establish control over the peninsula, the formation of a new government underneath Italian supervision, that all is well and good. But the question of amnesty has proven to be difficult to come to an agreement on. Some argue that we need to take a hard-line stance against the ringleaders and generals of this rebellion, if we are to prevent the same thing from happening again, or happening in other parts of the Empire's sphere of influence. Others argue that an offer of amnesty would- should the leadership of the rebellion refuse, allow disillusioned and forward-thinking generals to defect safely and make the campaign that much easier.\n\nSeveral Greek leaders- in particular, notable Security Battalion veterans and other former collaborators- have already expressed interest in laying down their weapons in exchange for guarantees from the Empire, one such leader has even suggested that he could mediate negotiations between the two sides. These statements only serve to both enrage the hardliners, and simultaneously encourage the more lenient commanders."

 greneg_ita_scorza.4.d:0 "From the bow of the Impero, Athína looked much smaller than it had when he'd left it. Then again, Admiral Luigi Mascherpa hadn't expected to ever return to the city. He only wished that it hadn't been in order to hold a gun to its head.\n\nThe bay south of Athína was littered with the cruisers and destroyers of the Regina Marina, as well as the occasional supply convoy making its way towards Hellas to supply the Royal Army present there. For simple police action, the sight of it conjured long-buried memories of the sounds and smells of the World War.\n\nThe Admiral peeled his eyes from the city and to the man in charge of the operation, Admiral Antonio Legnani. A cruel and harsh leader by all accounts, but those traits were expected out of a submarine captain, no matter how high they rose afterwards. Even still, Mascherpa made his appeal.\n\n\"I strongly urge you to reconsider this, Admiral. Th-\"\n\nLegnani interrupted, as he often did during these conversations. \"Do you now? I must not have noticed the last hundred times you urged me, but now that it's a strong urging...\" His mouth twisted into a mocking smirk as he spoke.\n\nWith an accusing finger gestured at his fellow admiral, Mascherpa's voice rose. \"The Impero is clearly visible from the city, the Hellenes see the guns, they see the ships, our point is made! There's nothing to gain and much to lose by shelling the city!\"\n\nLegnani shook his head as his eyes turned out towards Athína. \"What good is a threat if they don't believe we will follow through with it? I think your time among the Greeks has made you sentimental, admiral.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Legnani brought up Mascherpa's time as the High Commissioner in Hellas, but that didn't stop him from taking the bait. \"It is not sentiment, only practicality!\" He spat back. \"We'd only serve to embolden the rebels and drive more Hellenes to join them!\"\n\n\"And is this simply a civil disagreement? We're here to punish Greeks, not befriend them.\" He turned on his heels before Mascherpa could respond. \"Besides, it's too late. I've already requested permission from the Duce. Best hope the Duce loves the Greeks as much as you do, my friend.\" Mascherpa could practically hear the condescending smile on his face as he walked away."

As gaudy and ostentatious a thing as Ernesto Botto had ever seen.\n\n\"Always with the Ancients...\" He muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand, handing the flyer back with the other. He shifted his weight onto his right leg, the sound of the iron prosthetic causing the floorboards beneath him to creak quietly. \"When did we turn from an Air Force to school teachers?\"\n\n\"I just thought they might be more receptive to-\" The man from Ministry of Popular Culture began to make his retort, but Botto was already walking away.\n\n\"We need to remind them of their hopeless position, paperman,\" called back Ernesto \"Iron Leg\" Botto on his way out the door, \"not of factoids. Try to have something worth its ink when I return, or else explosives may replace your papers.\" It wasn't a long walk from the offices to the armory, though to call either makeshift, hastily erected front line structure by their name felt severely inappropriate. Botto gave the doorless frame of the building a knock as he entered, seeing that there was no one to greet him, he made himself at home instead.\n\nBombs were lined up against the far wall of one of the few additions onto the building made out of concrete, bombs that should they be needed, would blast Athína to rubble. But something seemed... Off about them. Upon closer inspection, the reason became obvious. Painted on each of the bombs was a seemingly personalized message.\n\n\"Stay in Your Caves\" on one, and \"This One's for Gotzamanis\"; \"Augustus is Back\" sat next to \"Pyromaglu! Suck my Cock!\" Apparently, the pinnacle of wit and cleverness that you could expect out of Italian bomber crews.\n\n\"Commander! I didn't hear you come in!\" Piped up the quartermaster, scrambling up behind Botto, only to follow his gaze and realize what Iron Leg was reading, and his complexion began to whiten.\n\n\"I am... Curious, quartermaster. What exactly is the value in these... Writings?\"\n\n\"Insults to demoralize the Greeks when we bomb them, of course.\"\n\n\"I see. And... They are supposed to read these... When, exactly?\" Botto turned his gaze back to the quartermaster, who had no response save to rub the back of his neck nervously. \"Just get the men back to work, we need to drop something, and if it isn't bombs, they may very well be papers instead.\""

While for now they had to set up shop along the barren coastline of the Aegean Retreat, the time for organization was ending, and the time for action was beginning.\n\n\"It is always better to act in reply.\" Two men marched along the coast, two of the principal commanders of the upcoming battle, named Operation Corinth, Enrico Martini and Tito Agosti. The two men could not be more different, and that was reflected in the argument that they currently had.\n\n\"Reacting is what you do when you are on the defensive, Martini. In case you haven't noticed, we are the invaders here.\" Agosti retorted, a finger pointed towards Martini's chin.\n\n\"And what more would a partisan love than to see a column of tanks roll right into their traps? We should hold and let the rebels show their hand, they will no doubt be eager to retake the land we've occupied already.\"\n\nAgosti looked out and into the Greek interior, before gesturing broadly to the vague silhouette of Piraeus's harbor in the distance. \"Look at it, Piraeus sits there, ripe for the taking. It is near enough that we don't need to fear your terrifying partisan, and its fall will send a signal to the rest of the rebels.\"\n\n\"It's a foolish decision. There's no point in taking Piraeus without having some idea of the ability of the Greeks to make a counteroffensive. We'd only be overextending ourselves!\"\n\n\"We could extend ourselves along the whole of Greece if we should wish it.

The previous government had expressed concerns about their growing influence, though had assured us that they could be handled.\n\nThis assessment has proven exaggerated, and in the absence of a central authority, the armed forces are either in disarray or have defected to the resistance. The EAM adheres to radical left-wing ideologies, specifically varying flavors of socialism or communism. Their leader, Velouchiotis, has taken nominal control, and has declared that the Greek revolution has been successful.\n\nThis is an unacceptable development, and we cannot have these dangerous radicals so close to us. There is no option for negotiation as they would demand the recognition of their communist state, and would destabilize the entirety of the Balkans. Direct intervention is necessary before Velouchiotis can establish a degree of stability to the nation.\n\nOur military forces have been mobilized on the Albanian-Greco border, and naval invasion forces are preparing to launch from our ports.

Yet, despite his party's eagerness - and his own - in silencing their opposition, the President seems set on keeping the young democracy alive - or at least to keep parts of its apparatus, something discerning the movement from the more authoritarian regime that was the USSR.\n\nTime shall tell whether democracy endures in Greece, or if Kyrkos buries its embers in his effort to make Greece a socialist state."
 POLITICS_SPYROS_MARKEZINIS_DESC: "Spyros Markenzinis was born the son of an Athenian MP, and throughout his childhood he was groomed for a life of civil service. In 1936, at the age of 27, he was selected to provide legal counsel to none other than King George II himself. But ten the war came, and the king lost his throne. Between 1941 and 1973, Markezinis lived as a historian, compiling a comprehensive four volume political history of Greece from 1920 to 1936. He was nearly finished compiling his magnum opus, a three volume history of Greek Politics between 1936 and 1964, when, in a move that surprised Markezinis as much as it surprised the Greek nation, Papadopoulos asked him to become the new Prime Minister of Greece.\n\nHis selection was not completely random of course. Markezinis is a staunch conservative and anti-communist with social views comparable to those of Papadopoulos, having run a fiery conservative campaign for parliament in 1964 in the weeks before the IDEA coup. During those weeks, he had met with Papadopoulos on several occasions, and in the subsequent years they maintained an infrequent correspondence. Markenzisis was chosen because Papadopoulos believed he would be compliant while also effectively maintaining the illusion of liberalization.\n\nAs prime minister, Markezinis believed himself to be the bridge that connects the present day Papadopoulos's military junta to a true parliamentary democracy in the near future. To that end, he has brought other center-right politicians into the administration, to assist him in designing a new Greek constitution, holding new elections, and establishing the new government. The new constitution is now in effect, and under it, Markezinis is now officially the head of the Greek State, but nevertheless, much of the true power of state still rests in the fist of Georgios Papadopoulos."

Mass surveillance, sponsoring terrorism abroad, arrest and weeks of torture without trial, no methods are too extreme to defend the Greek nation and its government.\n\nFrom his days as a student in the military academy, to those weeks fighting in the hills of Albania, to his interrogations at the Makronisos concentration camp, to his overthrow of Themelis and his reorganization of the Military Police, Ioannidis stopped at nothing to further his own power, and to weaken, attack, and torment his enemies. The quiet hand that guided Greece behind the scenes when Papadopoulos was president, Ioannidis now emerges from the shadows to become the master of Greece.\n\nHis war against communism continues, leaving behind a trail of broken bones, emaciated bodies, and shattered psyches. Now, he seeks to rebuild the Greek nation to greatness, pursuing autarky that Greece may no longer suffer foreign manipulation, and intensifying suppression of any anti-government sentiment, that Greece can remain strong against its enemies, both those who would dare threaten invasion from without, and those who would threaten insurrection from within."

However, Mavros' meteoric rise over the course of a short and chaotic election cycle - only the second such cycle in Greece's renewed democracy - cannot be denied.\n\nBorn on a small Greek island off the coast of Anatolia, Mavros went on to study law in Athens and Berlin. When the Italian invasion began, he took up arms like many Greeks, and fought on the Albanian front. Upon the Italian landing in Athens, he quickly found his way into the administrative arm of the EDES, where he served in various administrative posts before national liberation was achieved. Following the reinstatement of democracy, he founded the Center Party, a small, liberal party positioned between Greece's main political blocs.\n\nMavros now leads - through happenstance and luck - a massive realignment in Greek politics.

These are not pleasant policies and there are some who will be forced to tighten their belts, but we must do everything in our power to maintain our combat capabilities."
 GRE_EAM_the_specter_of_fascism: "法西斯的幽灵"
 GRE_EAM_the_specter_of_fascism_desc: "The EEE, that vile gang of traitorous scum, rule no more from Athens at the bidding of their masters in Rome. However, this does not mean that we are free of their loathsome legacy. True, their leaders may be dead or captured and their membership scattered, but we are in no position to track down even half of those who collaborated with the Italian occupiers. Even if we could, it would be even more difficult to stamp out all sympathy for the old regime. Many of the elites of Greek society these past two decades have benefitted from their corruption and the suppression of the workers. They may well give assistance to Italians when they inevitably return, if only to prove their loyalty, and there is precious little we can do to stop it. We go into battle with one-arm tied behind our back, but that means only that we must give even more of ourselves into this ultimate battle. We will show no fear to such phantoms!"
 GRE_EAM_the_specter_of_reaction_1: "反动派的幽灵"
 GRE_EAM_the_specter_of_reaction_1_desc: "The war may be over, but our domestic troubles are just beginning. During the war itself, we had a clear target: the invading Italians and the remnants of their fascist stooges remaining from the EEE regime. Now though, we are confronted with a much more complicated problem. Fascists, monarchists, bourgeois liberal capitalists. All reactionary, all a threat to the revolution. They will need to be dealt with one way or another.\n\nThe fascists are the first group we must prioritize, they are violently opposed to the revolution and are no doubt even now planning sabotage and counterrevolution.\n\nThe monarchists too despise our newfound freedom and wish to once again hang the milestone of monarchy around our throats. Their movement, spearheaded by the Nea Organosi X and its leader Georgios Grivas, has taken in many new recruits from the old military. It seems even former republican officers are willing to back a kingdom if it allows them to stop us. They will need to be very carefully monitored, although for the moment they have yet to move.\n\nFinally, we must stamp out the considerable liberal sentiment that still exists. While the EDES was largely willing to aid us in fighting off the Italian invasion, now that the immediate danger is passed our temporary alliance has already collapsed. Liberalism presents the least immediate threat to be dealt with, but deal with it we must if we ever hope to be truly secure."
 GRE_return_of_the_occupation: "Return of the Occupation"
 GRE_return_of_the_occupation_desc: "When the collaborationist regime collapsed after two long and miserable decades the people of Greece rejoiced. It seems they rejoiced prematurely.\n\nNow, just as they did in 1941, Italian troops swarm about the countryside and in the cities under the control of their resurrected puppet regime. Retaliation against the civilian population for the revolution has been widespread, but this is only fanning the flames of resistance within the now twice-beaten Greeks. The Italians and their collaborator allies found the first occupation difficult enough to handle, and there are signs that they may have finally bitten off more than they could chew in attempting to break a liberated people."

 GRE_Constantine_II_2: "康斯坦丁二世"
 GRE_Constantine_II_2_desc: "It had long been the dream of Constantine, nephew of George II, to finally end his exile and return to his home as the king that he rightfully his. That dream has now been fulfilled, but in a way that Constantine could hardly have anticipated. With the red revolution overthrowing the Italian puppet regime, Constantine assumed, as had many others, that the monarchy was well and truly doomed to the pages of history. At the decisive moment however, the revolution faltered, and into the gap rushed none other than NOX, the staunch monarchist group turned Italy's new favorite ally amongst the Greeks in the wake of EEE's failure to maintain control. With the birth of a NOX-run Greek state came an opportunity and an invitation. Georgios Grivas, head of the newly-proclaimed \"Hellenic Union\" personally invited Constatine to claim his birthright. Constantine found it impossible to refuse. Now he is Constantine II, although whether he is indeed the King of the Hellenes or simply a farce depends on who one speaks to."
 GRE_reign_of_the_security_battalions: "Reign of the Security Battalions"
 GRE_reign_of_the_security_battalions_desc: "With the return of the collaborationist regime has also come the return of the despised Security Battalions. The Battalions were first raised in 1943 to supplement the first collaborationist regime's security forces and have been a plague upon Greece ever since. In the war and the years since, these ruthless dogs of the Italian invaders were known for their brutality and now, with the Italians back and eager to teach the Greeks a lesson, they have let their hounds run wild. As if to flaunt their utter disinterest in the actions of their pawns this time around, they have handed over control of the new regime to Georgios Poulos and his so-called \"Government of Hellenic Purity\". Poulos has been given carte blanche to run his state just as he ran his death squads back during the war - utterly without mercy."
