 POLITICS_PETROS_POGHOSYAN_DESC: "No beast in human skin, no desolate Russian prison, no amount of guns, men and bullets could keep Petros Poghosyan from his beloved Armenia.\n\nWhen the Ottomans forced his countrymen to perish in the cruel desert heat, he struck back alongside his fellow patriots like an avenging angel of death, watering the earth with the blood of Djemal Pasha for his crimes. When the Soviets invaded Armenia, Petros was taken by those cruel Russian commissars and forced into the bitter arctic gulags in Vorkuta. Even the frozen chain fences of the Soviet Union could not hold him, and when the prisoners of Vorkuta took flight, Petros was free once more to return to beloved Armenia, a nation still in chains.\n\nThe avenging angel has wasted no time in taking up arms once more, linking back up with his fellow conspirators of ages past to plan the restoration of the Armenian nation and people. The coming war will be long and hard-fought, this Petros knows, and such petty concerns as ideology and faith matters little when the gun is to the head of an entire nation.\n\nWoe be to the Turkish oppressor, for forty years were not enough to rid them of Poghosyan, and now it is certain. §RNothing will ever be.§!"

 ARM_Fedayeen_Gather_desc: "亚美尼亚人民长期受到土耳其人的压迫。我们被他们殴打、束缚、折磨乃至被屠杀，而这一切的源头只是一个早死之人的寥寥宏愿。现在，我们的人民聚集起来了，我们要复仇。\n\n我们勇敢的费达伊集合在一起，为战争做好准备。这会是一场光荣又值得歌颂的斗争。只要人民一日支持我们，我们就一日不会放弃，不会投降，§V直到亚美尼亚人最后一滴鲜血以祖国的名义干涸为止。§!"

 ARM_Operation_Nemesis: "行动：涅墨西斯"
 ARM_Operation_Nemesis_desc: "亚美尼亚政府只为了一件事走到一起：将亚美尼亚人民完全从土耳其的压迫下解放出来。在追寻这一目标的过程中，其他一切都显得无关紧要。他们对善政毫无兴趣，他们不关心国内政策或者外交关系等微不足道的问题。因为没有时间让他们分心。面对自由，一切都要为之让道。他们不在乎以后的命运，只要他们还能复仇，家人的血还未流尽，一切手段就都是正当的。"
 ARM_Gevork_Vartanyan: "格沃尔克·瓦尔塔尼扬"
 POLITICS_GEVORK_VARTANYAN_DESC: "The identity of the Armenian agent \"Anri\" has eluded Turkish forces since the end of the Second World War. The codename belonged to the leader of the Sons of Hayk, though the vast majority of the organization's own members knew no more than anyone else. At the culmination of decades of planning, as insurgent cells were activated across the mountains, forests, and towns of Armenia, this agent's true name was revealed to the world - Gevork Vartanyan.\n\nA mere sixteen years of age when he began working in Soviet intelligence, Vartanyan was responsible for the capture of hundreds of Axis agents. When Moscow fell, he reorganized his contacts in what was left of Soviet-Armenian intelligence into a clandestine insurgent organization - the Sons of Hayk. Where the Dashnaks chose to let their presence be known to the occupiers, the Sons of Hayk sought to maintain complete secrecy in their operations. Though Vartanyan's name was not known to the Armenian people, his deeds were, and when he finally cast off the veil of secrecy, his movement was met with overwhelming popular support.\n\nSo let his name now be known to both Armenian and Turk - the final phase of the operation has begun, and Armenia's liberation is at hand!"
