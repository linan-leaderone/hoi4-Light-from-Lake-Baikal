 POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC: "贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁出生在一个参与过独立斗争的高种姓家庭，作为一个印度人，他却没有经历过多少印度本土传统文化的熏陶。他在英国本土完成了英式教育之后才返回家乡。之后，他作为圣雄本人的得力助手参与了国大党的独立斗争，这为他赢得了大众的支持与国大党的领导地位。因此，当大英帝国最终在1943年耻辱地崩溃时，他登上了国家领导人的宝座。\n\n但领导权不只掌握在他自己手里。在西部扩张主义倾向高涨的阿富汗、东边源源不断的日本威胁以及国内争相独立的王公贵族之间，尼赫鲁选择了为国家利益而妥协，放弃了自己的一部分权力，邀请苏巴斯·钱德拉·鲍斯和印度国民军组成联合政府，以维护印度的主权与领土完整。但这个联盟注定不会持久，随着印度在与阿富汗的战争中失利，他唯一的选择是切断与他昔日的伙伴与战友的联系，看着他逃往东方，在加尔各答组建一个与他敌对的苦涩政权。\n\n现在，尼赫鲁只剩下半个国家可以治理，但他仍然试图建立他和国大党其他成员所设想的印度——一个摆脱了困扰其他前殖民国家的专制，获得独立、社会主义、世俗和民主的共和国。二十年来，他作为总理为实现这一目标而鞠躬尽瘁。但现在看来，他的时代即将结束了。也许他无法在自己的有生之年内解决国内问题并看到印度的统一。但为了印度的利益，他的遗产注定会延续千古。"
 POLITICS_MORARJI_DESAI_DESC: "Morarji Desai's political life began with activism. Together with Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and countless others, Desai joined the Swaraj movement against the British, landing him in jail for several years. His spirit and leadership during this time earned him much acclaim, which would only grow further during the Second War of Independence. Desai was responsible for the ceasefire agreement that ended the fighting and established lasting peace. In the old days of the united Indian National Congress, Morarji Desai stood as one of its most prominent and formidable members. Although often at odds with Prime Minister Nehru due to their differing views, many considered Desai to his natural successor. Had the party stayed together after Nehru's death, he might indeed have taken over leadership. That day never came though, and so Desai founded his own, conservative party in the wake of Congress' collapse. Already popular, Desai attracted most of the conservatives of the old INC to his Janata Party, forging it into the definitive organization of the Indian center-right.\n\nDesai himself is regarded as somewhat of a moral crusader, as well as somewhat religious and somewhat nationalistic man which has certainly flavoured his political career. It is however his moderate, anti-Hindutva, and secular nature that has won him his popularity and success as a politician and party leader. Desai is also openly opposed to independence for Indian Muslims, instead believing that the issues in the region can be better solved if they were to stay part of India. Like all those involved in politics, Morarji Desai is a complex figure. He is both a strict religious moralist and a secular, moderate conservative. It is perhaps because of this blend that he was able to lead a party and now an entire nation. Desai has served India in many ways prior, but now he will guide it by his own hand."

 POLITICS_CHAKRAVARTI_RAJAGOPALACHARI_DESC: "From a western outlook, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's policy and beliefs are nearly as complex as his name. He is simultaneously socially liberal and conservative, both supporting free trade and the status quo, and at the same time saying that India must change and that India is perfect. However, Rajagopalachari follows an ideology which has died out in the aftermath of the Second World War; classical liberalism. Considered relevant in only a few countries, Rajagopalachari's belief in this system is enough to show that he is an elder statesman.\n\nRajagopalachari fought peacefully alongside many others for India's independence from Britain. However, while many others supported and even endorsed socialism, he saw that the restriction of the market was nearly, if not equally as terrible as the fascist restriction of rights. Nonetheless, as the fight for Indian independence devolved into a war for it, and, from there, a brother war. Rajagopalachari knew that Nehru's propaganda about Bose's desire to exterminate all followers of peace was a total fabrication. Nonetheless, he saw Nehru as far more approachable from an economic standpoint than Bose, and sided with him over a dyed-in-the-wool socialist.\n\nAfter the war, Rajagopalachari found himself on the conservative wing of Congress, alongside such minds as Morarji Desai. While the two were on the same side, they could hardly be considered allies, and their distrust was mutual; Rajagopalachari saw Desai as too extreme, and Desai saw Rajagopalachari as too moderate. Despite this, the two fought together as a bulwark against socialism. Now, however, Rajagopalachari has won, with his newfound Swatantra Party. In a nation filled with socialists, though, it will be difficult for him to hold the line."
 POLITICS_JB_KRIPALANI_DESC: "Jivatram Bhagwandas Kripalani has seen much in his great, long life. For five decades, he has been deeply involved with Indian politics, from colonial rule to independence and the years after. In his early years, Kripalani joined up with the growing independence movement following the return of the Mahatma from South Africa. During the early 1920s, Kriplani worked as a lecturer of history and English while serving as part of the non-cooperation movement. He would become a close adherent of the Mahatma, and was given the task of spreading his teachings to other parts of India. Later on, he would be on several occasions arrested for more direct actions against colonial rule, including organising protests and for distributing anti-British material. Kripalani would be invloved in the top affairs of Congress througout the late 1920s and into the next decade. By this point, Kripalani had also turned to be a firm adherent of Gandhian ideals, particularly those relating to socialism.\n\nWhile independence did finally come to India, the nation was quickly split in two by war between the Nehru's Republic and Bose's Free India.\n\nKriplani, saw the way to victory in the elections through cooperation with other prominent socialists, which would indeed prove to be successful in the elections. Kripalani is now leader of the Republic of India, committed to the principles of Gandhian Socialism, light agrarianism and resistance against Japan. Yet there is much work for him to do to secure his position - winning an election means when there is always someone to take your place by any means necessary."
