 japdlc.1.t:0 "孙殿英将军被逮捕"
 japdlc.1.d:0 "数天前，经过批准，孙殿英被极司非尔路76号释放。孙殿英提醒自己：以后绝不能与秘密警察打交道，特别是在他要退休的时候。孙殿英已被释放，至少在公职方面，他摆脱了76号对他怀疑的重担。进一步的审讯看上去没让他屈服半步，76号从孙殿英嘴里掏不出什么情报，只好继续用那个办法。在孙殿英坐在窗户边开始抽起廉价香烟时，孙殿英不禁猜想，他的同僚是否也会被审问。不过他这边的事情已经结束了，继续打扰他的生活没什么好处。\n\n因此，随着孙殿英打开公寓门，一个巨大的“惊喜”很快来到他身边：三名宪兵队军官的注视，以及一个紧张兮兮的翻译官。两名宪兵队特工甚至都没有假模假样地行军礼以示对军人的尊重，就把孙殿英抓了起来，而另一名特工开始念出他们给孙殿英定下的罪名。\n\n孙殿英老将军被粗暴地塞进一辆普普通通的卡车后面，同时那名中国翻译官尽力把新信息传达给他。孙殿英确信宪兵队不会对他怎么样，事情会跟极司非尔路76号那次一样，他难以抑制地预感到这次的审讯也许会花更长时间。\n\n很快，中方政府便注意到孙殿英被逮捕并消失在宪兵队本地机构的深处。虽然大部分人感到忧虑，但是他们难以解释日本特务机构的动机，他们只是简单地走进老将军的安乐窝，甚至都没有通知任何中国政府机构。政务透明的要求成为命令，这一命令直接来自中华民国国防部参谋本部。看到自己的同僚被如此无礼对待绝对是种赤裸裸的挑衅，无论宪兵队背后的力量在共荣圈有着如何巨大的权力，他们都触及了绝对不该触碰的红线。"

Deciding that they were clearly being given only a fraction of what was actually available for them to read, the agents set about demanding direct access to the navy archives.\n\nIt did not take long for the army minister to take note of what was happening. His response to what seemed to him like a severe transgression was to dispatch a letter to the Home Minister. It arrived just as he was about to sit down for dinner. The letter was short, written with a considerably more genial tone than the Home Minister was used to the army minister using. The intent revealed that more usual tone.\n\nThe army minister had written to express his concern that the investigation into Dai Li was focusing its attention in the wrong places. Not only was this a serious worry for the Daihonei, but the manner in which the investigation was being carried out seemed to bother them as well. While deeply polite in its prose, the letter ended with a warning:\n\n\"We fear that should your agents continue along their current course, they may perhaps cause more trouble then they are worth\"\n\nThe Home Minister, by now used to such hints or threats, decided that this was just a sign that he was looking in the right direction. He would allow the investigation to carry on, quite unimpeded."

 japdlc.505.d:0 "Simply put, the investigation could not find anything relevant to the conspiracy. The navy, ever reluctant to submit to interrogations and to hand over their files, had still provided the investigating agents with enough information to reach a conclusion. It was certainly a disappointing end to another few weeks of hard work for them.\n\nThey had examined financial, recruitment and diplomatic records for tracers of anything incriminating, and turned up empty handed. Interviews provided little else of use to the investigation. Even a number of ships were searched; cargo was opened and checked and some boats were even partially dismantled to check for hidden compartments or storage areas. Nothing beyond the official records was ever found. It would never be quite possible to tell exactly what the navy was doing, for there was certainly a number of secrets that they would rather die than let slip, but they were not harbouring the pawns of Dai Li.\n\nWhile the lack of proper results was never a positive, the Home Minister was at least relieved to be able to check the navy off the list. The amusing thought of holding any and all meetings relevant to the Dai Li situation on navy ships from this point crossed his mind before he regained focus. There were other paths for the investigation to pursue. He hoped that they would be resolved as easily as the navy had been.\n\nSome had suggested that attempting to clear the army of suspicion would be a wise choice. It was in many ways quite dangerous to let either branch of the military operate without being cleared of suspicions, especially if Dai Li had turned so many officers into his puppets. Yet examining the military had certain... political complications too, just as with the navy.\n\nAs the Home Minister began to retire for the night, his head was filled with the choices he would once again have to make. It was never an easy choice, seemingly growing more difficult as the options narrowed. Failure seemed like a dangerously palpable possibility as this point. It would be another long night for the Home Minister."

 japdlc.506.d:0 "If the investigating agents had hoped for their efforts to continue underhinderd now that their superior had put his foot down, then they were gravely mistaken. The army, already somewhat reluctant in their cooperation, quickly turned against the agents in subtle ways.\n\nInterviews began to drag on for much longer. The officers being questioned would either jump around answering the agents, or produce absurdly long answers that never seemed to quite reach any sort of true meaning. The investigators met great difficulty in even getting the army to provide them with officers willing to be questioned. If they ever agreed to be interrogated, they would arrive late or only comply with meeting the agents at particularly late or early hours.\n\nNot even physical evidence could be relied upon at this point. The army was surprisingly happy to honour the request made by the investigators to see a number of files relating to their finances, recruitment and interactions with other sections of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the files were not suddenly lost in transit across the bureaucratic web, then they ended up being severely damaged in transit. The few files that did arrive in decent condition turned out to be the wrong documents and were sent back, never to be heard of again.\n\nThe investigators back to the Home Minister did not paint a picture of a particularly functional work environment for his agents. Despite it all, some scant progress had been made, mostly by rearranging ripped, or possibly shredded, papers. This had been part of what he had anticipated the army's initial response to be. There was still much work to be done, and yet at the same time, the pressure was becoming a serious problem. The Home Minister could either continue his investigation, or cut his losses and try another route. Neither option seemed particularly pleasant to him as he considered the possibilities to come."

There were many more ships to search, interviews to conduct and files to analyse. In order to see the job done at twice the pace, the Home Minister had arranged for reinforcements to be sent to the investigation sites belonging to the navy.\n\nThe navy was ready too. After realising that the agents would not back down from their tasks, they had realised that a new strategy would need to be employed. The navy would seek to delay and tamper with the investigation as much as possible. With the discreet blessing of both the admiralty and the Daihonei, the navy was fully prepared to hinder the agents of the Home Minister as much as they could.\n\nOn the very surface, little seemed to change for the investigation. The navy, still ever hostile in tone, did in fact agree to comply with whatever the agents required. Beneath the surface, however, there was a distinctly different environment awaiting them as they searched for clues. Ships due to be searched were suddenly sent out on assignment. Files were mysteriously transferred between archives for indefinite amounts of time. If they survived this endless journey, the documents would either be severely damaged or occasionally and miraculously arrive as intended.\n\nThe investigation ground to a sickening halt. In terms of viable leads, the agents where now dealing with the crumbs of breadcrumbs. It was uncertain if they would be able to garner much of anything from what little they had at this point. The Home Minister was naturally displeased with the development, as he had hoped the navy would back down. Yet again he would have to consider whether the secrets of the navy were truly worth the trouble - perhaps he could strike out against them in his own way to counter their efforts."

 japdlc.510.d:0 "As they so often do, the trail was found far from where the investigation had least expected it. The Home Minister, as per his job description, had contacts in virtually every branch of the Japanese government and military. Most rumours therefore made their way to his ears sooner or later. Loose lips in the Daihonei provided him with a rather peculiar fact: A number of Kenpeitai officers were on their way to Shanghai. Not only this, but orders supposedly from a Dai Li agent had just been intercepted outside the city. It was simply too big of a coincidence for the investigation to pass up on.\n\nWith a sense of direction restored, the investigating agents rushed to their new target. The investigation would look towards local officials for possible leads. A large enough bribe or a serious enough threat made all but the most stubborn of them comply with the investigation. Piece by piece, the trail reformd once again, all of the Kenpeitai agents had booked into the Astor House Hotel.\n\nIt was simple enough to 'win' the hotel over to their side. A phone call from the Home Minister assured the Astor House's manager that they would receive a rather generous donation should they comply with the investigation's demands. Relatively few of the officers left the hotel for more than a stroll through the streets, most stayed in their rooms or gathered in the lobby to discuss trivial matters. Yet after about two days of this seemingly dull routine, the officers would one by one visit the reception desk and book themselves into the conference room. They would all be attending some sort of meeting between two and five o'clock the next day, and at least two unnamed individuals would be joining them.\n\nAs the day of the meeting arrived, the investigation, together with local police units, stood ready to burst into the hotel conference room and arrest all those present. For that to happen, they would need the express approval of the senior investigating officer, who acted as an emissary for the Home Minister. Until he gave the command, the agents of the Home Ministry would watch the meeting, lest they miss some important building."

After the fourth, or possibly fifth threat of \"dangerous consequences\", The Home Minister had grown tired of their ubiquitous content; for as long as letters from the Daihonei continued to arrive at his office, the Home Minister knew that the investigation was not complete.\n\nThe state of the investigation was at that time feeling like that of someone trying to fit a jigsaw together with only a fraction of the required pieces. The rest of the jigsaw was locked away and guarded day and night. This was the true focus of the investigating agents at the present. While a skeleton crew worked on deciphering the information they had available to them, the rest of the agents worked on devising plans to acquire the documents they truly needed to actually make a breakthrough.\n\nIn the dead of night, a black car stopped a few streets away from the naval archives. The building was eerily quiet as the two agents who had just exited their vehicle headed towards it. It didn't take long for them to notice the lack of any guards outside the front gate, which had instead been crudely secured with a chain. After realising that there were no signs of life on the inside of the archive compound either, the chain was removed by way of bolt cutters.\n\nThe archive entrance itself had not even been shut properly, with one door hanging quite ajar, swaying slightly with the breeze. With something undoubtedly wrong with the naval archives, the two agents determined that they were possibly walking into a trap. Using the scant moonlight, one agent pointed a hand mirror at an angle through the open door to reveal... nothing. It was not that the reflection revealed no guards or that there was nothing of particular interest immediately inside. No, the archive's main hall was empty of anything at all. Every document, recording and file was missing. Pinned to the wall opposite the door was a note, labeled in large characters as:\"For the Home Ministry\"\n\n\"Due to security concerns regarding a number of our archives, including this one, the army minister has seen fit to move their contents to a number of new and secure locations. The admiralty and the Daihonei humbly apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused\"\n\nThe investigation was at this point practically pleading with the home minister to find an end to the conflict with the navy, or otherwise focus on other leads regarding Dai Li.

This unease seemed to grow all the more real as the seconds ticked by, summoning up images of the Home Ministry agents being caught in a trap themselves. Just as quickly as those images were summoned, they were then banished by an agent speaking over the radio...\n\n\"Wait... I think we might finally have something.\" A particularly unremarkable man, who had nearly escaped the attention of the agent stationed near the hotel's entrance, had just entered the conference room. To the agents monitoring the development from afar, he looked as though he might have been just another Kenpeitai officer, using a heavy coat and wide-brimmed hat to cover disguise himself out on the streets. Yet as he removed his garments, it became clear that he was very much not just another of the assembled men.\n\nHis clothes were not what caught the eyes of the agents, but his face. That was a face they had seen before. During the very beginning of the investigation, a dossier containing files on anyone close to Dai Li not accounted for during war had been passed around. The very same face had appeared in an old photograph of Dai Li, standing right beside him. The man in Astor House had aged of course, but it could be him.\n\nA near deathly silence took hold over the agents, as they watched the Kenpeitai calmly listen to the Dai Li operative, as if they had all met many times before and become the most trusted of allies.

While the investigation might need to hold off on their most aggressive and uncomfortable methods, there were still plenty of options for how they could squeeze information out of the Dai Li operative.\n\nThe Kenpeitai agents on the other hand, were left in their cells. The investigation had little interest in the mere acomplacies of the Dai Li, especially now that they had a direct link to the man himself.

His broken limbs were suspended to keep them straight while healing, only served to drag out his excruciating experience. An anaesthetic was of course readily available, as the agents were ever so willing to inform him. There was a catch, as expected. The anaesthetic was available to him should he be willing to part with everything he knew about Dai Li and his connections to the Japanese army.

Behind clothes and bolted doors, the agents of the investigation began their bloody and agonizing work.\n\nOne by one, the Kenpeitai officers were escorted to a small room at the back of the police station. After an invariable amount of time, they would return. Some had been cut, others beaten, some had been burned and others seemingly electrocuted. The investigation knew that they could withstand most forms of torture, and that killing one of them 'by mistake' would not soften them up during questioning. This would be a battle of attrition.

Officers who had expressed great faith in the military soon arriving to release them were specifically told that they had been abandoned by their superiors.

Did you not question how forthcoming they were about Dai Li? Did you even examine any of the information they sent you?\"\n\nThe investigating agents leaned in and demanded an explanation. \"I worked for Dai Li, but that was decades ago. I have no idea what has become of him. For all I know, he could be living as a hermit in Tibet!

From the Imperial Palace, it looked as if today would be beautiful, idyllic, even.\n\nLines of uniformed men marched from the navy's base in Yokosuka. Their destination: the palace. The civilian government had failed the people of Japan, and it was up to her sons in the armed services to save her from doom. They were a curiosity to bystanders; armed to the teeth and wearing khaki uniforms, they walked the streets in full view of all they encounter on the way.\n\nThey were not alone in this line of thought. From the Saitama Prefecture, the army made their own move. Laws and propriety be damned; now is the time for the inferiors to rule from below, outside the structure. If all it took to save Japan were only a few violations of the rules, they would do it every time.\n\nThese conflicting forces would come against one another like waves against a wall; in the middle of Japan, they met. Unslinging their rifles and pointing it at each other, yet refusing to fire, they would garrison the buildings in the capital, maintaining the unstable equilibrium.

Both sides waved placards, yelled accusations, and threw small fragments of debris across the road at their opposition. Enraged and impassioned by the crowds, a student broke from the front-lines of the pacifists' crowd and charged to skirmish with a band of particularly aggressive veterans, and a great swarm was compelled to follow him. A great roar erupted from the street, followed soon after by the chatter and collision of makeshift batons, shields, and other equipment fashioned as weapons to fight the opposition.\n\nGreat crowds of people clashed in small groups throughout the street, tumbling on the floor and tussling with each other against brick walls and metal debris.

The emperor had even arrived late to the privy council meeting, which was particularly unusual. For half an hour, he had remained silent, barely even moving his eyes to look at the assembled council. Even the words of the lord keeper of the privy seal had not stirred the emperor enough to say even a simple \"yes\" or a \"no\".\n\nRegardless, the privy council was desperate for the emperor to speak, as it seemed increasingly likely that his voice would be the only thing that would calm the country. Protests against Nishi's sentence had become increasingly common and most were growing in size by the day. No amount of policing or promises by the government had so far worked. Indeed, the emperor's voice was in fact their last chance.\n\n\"Your Imperial Majesty, we once again beg of you to consider our request. Think of your subjects, think of your empire!\"\n\nWithout as much as a word, or a chance in his facial expression, the emperor stood up and departed from the room.

In the brief moments he had stayed in the cell, Nishi had found the time to consider what he would say before his execution. He would reaffirm his innocence, and once again call on the military to do what was right for the nation. He did not wish to die, but fear was not what filled his mind when he thought about the execution. If anything, he felt disappointed at the state of the nation. How could the emperor let this happen?\n\n\"Sir? Colonel Nishi, are you there?\"\n\nFrom out of the shadows came the figures of three prison guards.\n\n\"What do you want? Do you have something for me?\" The colonel was unsure how to react to their respectful tone.\n\n\"We do sir. We've brought you the means to freedom.\"\n\nThe cell door sprung open and the three guards carefully stepped inside. Nishi quickly got to his feet, still suspicious of what seemed like something too good to be true.\n\n\"And what might that be?\"\n\nThe first guard stepped forward, bowed and presented Nishi with a pistol. The second one also bowed, but he presented the colonel with his own sword, retrieved from the armory of the nearby garrison. Nishi's careful paranoia has been converted to subtle trust.\n\n\"There's a car waiting for you at the back of the prison, sir. We'll escort you there, but after that, we can't go further.\"\n\nNishi took both the pistol and the sword before he saluted the three guards. \"Let's go.

He packed a few valuables into a large bag, before Nishi realised he had yet to check the stables. Leaving the bag on his bed, he quickly headed out into the garden. To the colonel's great relief, Jupiter was still in his stable, happily munching away on a pile of hay. Nishi gave him a hug around the neck, and then realised that he would have to leave his prize horse behind.\n\nThat was of course only true if Nishi was to go into hiding. As he looked at Jupiter, the colonel had a thought. There was one more way he could be saved from execution. If he could make an appeal directly to the emperor, then the charges would no longer matter. There was of course a risk that the emperor would not hear his plea or that he would be shot before he could make it to the Imperial Palace. The car would get him there, but why would he use such a meaningless vehicle? There was only one way Nishi was going to do this.\n\nThe colonel gathered the reins and saddle from the stable and attached them to Jupiter. If he was to die, or be pardoned, Nishi would go to his fate in his own way. He would let all of Tokyo know that he was a man of conviction and courage.

When a squad of police cars headed after him, the people of Tokyo only grew more amazed and bewildered.\n\nNishi had not met much trouble on his journey until he reached the city center. The police presence was greatly heightened there; a result of the protests. The element of surprise had favored Nishi though. He was able to ride along the sidewalks and alleyways, providing momentary respite from the police cars. His path was still a chaotic one; Jupiter came close to trampling several bystanders along the way. Nishi would disappear down one street and then reappear moments later; always ahead of his pursuers. Attempts at erecting barricades were soon found to be pointless too. After all, what waist-high obstacle could stop a showjumping horse?\n\nAs Nishi reached the Imperial Palace gardens, his plan became clear to the police. Pursuit through into the park was impossible for the cars; their only hope was that the Imperial Guard could stop him - said guards had orders to kill anyone who attempted to break into the palace. However, the sight of Colonel Nishi charging straight at them on horseback was enough to freeze them in their tracks. In the end, it was the gate to the palace that stopped Nishi.

The charges that I stood accused of were naught but hyperbole and slander. I defended myself as a man of honor, who wishes nothing more than to serve the emperor and his empire. Yet in spite of my just cause, I was still found guilty by jury and sentenced to death! I stand before you, to plead for forgiveness and a pardon, if you believe I am worthy of one. If Your Majesty does not, then I will accept my fate. I am ready to face death if I must!\"\n\nNishi bowed in the direction of the palace, still clinging to the gate with one arm.

It was hard to judge the reaction of the Imperial Guard captain. He merely gestured for the corpse to be removed from the scene. Although this was done swiftly, several civilians had witnessed the shooting from across the river.\n\nNishi's death quickly became a rallying-cry for the anti-militarist cause. A beloved officer was now a martyr; all due to the military's corruption and overreaching power. The very facts of death added fuel to the fire too. The guards responsible for the shooting became the living images of the rash soldier; overconfident and over-empowered in society.\n\nAs protests continued across the major cities of Japan, the usual placards and banners were joined by images of Colonel Nishi. Some were paired with messages: \"When will the madness stop?\" and \"He will not be forgotten\" were common. Indeed, who could forget a man who only sought to achieve redemption in his final hours?"

The swathes of crowds gathered to protest the recent treatment of Nishi were maddened by the intense rays of sun beating down on them. They were divided into two groups; veterans, who set up small encampments outside of the Diet Building to demand the full force of the law to fall on Nishi, and pacifists, who urged the government intervene to diffuse the situation entirely with a full pardon.\n\nThe intense heat spread a hysteria between the two crowds heckling from either side of the street. Both sides waved placards, yelled accusations, and threw small fragments of debris across the road at their opposition. Enraged and impassioned by the crowds, a student broke from the front-lines of the pacifists' crowd and charged to skirmish with a band of particularly aggressive veterans, and a great swarm was compelled to follow him. A great roar erupted from the street, followed soon after by the chatter and collision of makeshift batons, shields, and other equipment fashioned as weapons to fight the opposition.\n\nGreat crowds of people clashed in small groups throughout the street, tumbling on the floor and tussling with each other against brick walls and metal debris. The stench of violence grew thick in the warm sun, and brutality became a common sight between the groups. Eventually, law enforcement had arrived in heavily-armed droves to diffuse the chaos, but even their sirens and loud-speakers could not prize many off of barbarically mauling and attacking their own countrymen in the streets of the capital."

This is something not worthy of our nation, nor it is deemed acceptable in the eyes of this eternal throne.

Yet before Nishi was placed into the vehicle, a call for the guards to stop rang out across the ground.

The government had tried to suppress it, but someone had leaked the result. Nishi was to receive an Imperial Pardon.\n\nThat was all it took.\n\nThe crowds exploded into fury. They were relentless in their verbal fury against the officers. They cursed Nishi, they cursed the government, they cursed the military, some even cursed the Emperor.

There was no civility, there were brawls that had to be broken up.

The military offered no solutions, no hope for recovery. That left only the Emperor. A new Imperial decision could calm the public, and hopefully the army as well. It was a difficult decision, but these were difficult times.

Kido Kōichi certainly had no desire to see Japan fall to chaos, and once he granted them an audience the nation could begin to recover from this disaster.\n\nA few hours later, the minister he had instructed to contact Kido contacted the Prime Minister. Picking up the phone, the Prime Minister asked, \"How was the meeting with Kido?\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was shaky, \"There was no meeting, Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kido Kōichi, cannot be found.

Claims that the Emperor has been too passive in the past, and that the current government was completely inept, were mostly met with affirmative nods.\n\nHowever, when the discussion turned to the failures of the Yokusankai, one man made his dissent clear, \"What you're discussing is unconstitutional! I will not stand by and see my creation-\"\n\n\"I think we are all in agreement that this nation has had enough of your creation, Konoe,\" replied Kido, interrupting the former Prime Minister, and a wave of agreement shut down any other objections Konoe could muster. Kido continued, \"While the Privy Council has been rather inactive since the 1930s, desperate times call for desperate measures. If the civilian government is inept, and the military is gutted, then it falls to us to lead Japan away from destruction. Nobody else has managed to do so,\" this sentiment is once again echoed by the rest of the Jushin, with Konoe and a small handful of others remaining silent.\n\nAs the meeting adjourned, Kido and Higashikuni stayed behind.

We have come to request of you an audience with the Emperor, so that he may grant us a second imperial action.\"\n\nKido's face remained stoic as he listened to the Prime Minister's plea, and after a long moment of silence filled the room, he replied, \"Prime Minister, I will not grant you an audience with the Emperor.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n\"Your government has proven its ineptitude with its failure to contain the current disaster.

Was it ultimately something to celebrate?\n\nAnother hour, and a third of the Yokusankai resigned.\n\nAnger and cynicism gave way to confusion and nervousness. Some cheered, some were more hopeful. A majority were growing more confused. Something was going on beyond; this was not just a response to the chaos. It was one thing for a government to resign, it was another for the Yokusankai to join them. Confusion only grew when more rumors reached the crowds across Japan.\n\nMore government officials were resigning, at local and national levels. Ministers, accountants, aides, heads of agencies. Within three hours nearly every leading civil servant had resigned, some with a terse explanation, most with no explanation at all. A foreboding gripped the crowds as the implication of what was happening dawned on them.\n\nThere was only one body, one individual, who had the power to force the government to do this, and as the hours passed, and more and more resigned from their posts, the truth could no longer be denied."

They refused to listen...\n\n... and were gunned down, the few streets they had occupied painted red with their blood. Such was the fate of the remaining public believers in democracy in the rule of law."

 japdlc_endgame.17.t:0 "Regression"
 japdlc_endgame.17.desc:0 "The Dai Li Conspiracy had laid the divisions in Japan bare in ways few had expected, for with the rise of Mutō Akira Japan tumbled headlong back into the darkest depths of military dictatorship at a time when it needed such governance the least.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army unveiled its cabinet, now utterly dominated by Army men and maybe one or two civilian lackeys. The army men had taken the opportunity to kick the Navy to the curb, leaving them only with the customary post of Navy Minister.\n\nPublic order and subjugation to the military fiat had become the name of the game. The Yokusankai were given a choice: \"get in line, or we will make you.\" The press, too, was not spared. From the Asahi or Mainichi all the way down to the village papers in places like Shōdoshima or Muroram, all of it was shuttered en masse by military directives. The NHK and other broadcasting corporations were also ruthlessly restricted, with even pre-coup propaganda works harshly scrutinized for potentially unpatriotic concepts.\n\nJapan had succumbed to paranoia in the worst way possible even while they purported to be making their way past it. With soldiers on every corner, the Empire was being forced to withdraw troops from Asia even as its satellites increasingly asserted themselves.\n\nThe Emperor, observing all these goings-on and seeing a repeat of the era before the Second World War, shuddered and held his peace. Once more he successfully repressed the urge to speak, as he had virtually every single time his words could have made a difference in these matters. He could not repress the doubt that this era of military rule would be far less successful than the first."
