 SLF_lessons_first_civil_war_desc: "早在南非战争期间就时有布尔游击队袭击，只需寥寥数人就能给人们带来极大的创伤。但现在，随着人民邦的瓦解，情况发生了逆转。布尔人的战术现在将成为敌人们最可怕的梦魇，正如它曾经也是我们的梦魇一般。"
 SLF_governmental_rivalries: "政府宿敌"
 SLF_governmental_rivalries_desc: "The Liberation Front that formed after the Volkstaat's collapse is as unstable as it is diverse. All for their own reasons, everyone from progressives in the Defense Force, to moderate Boers, to Native Africans all find themselves fighting together for a common cause, but with different motivations. While this is good news for Viljoen's government in terms of manpower, command is a nightmare and often devolves into battles for influence."
 SLF_Constand_Viljoen: "康斯坦德·维尔容"
 POLITICS_CONSTAND_VILJOEN_DESC: "In theory, Connie Mulder's restored South African government can count on the loyalty of the Union Defense Forces (UDF). As with most things in South Africa, reality is far more convoluted.\n\nConstand Viljoen belongs to a clique of younger officers who despised the Graff's government unwillingness to compromise with the native population. Although he initially defected to the Boers at the outbreak of the War, the entry of the Afrika-Schild and the Volksraad submission to Hüttig caused him to rescind his betrayal and rejoin the Union Defense Forces. From there, he rose to prominence as one of the UDF's most competent military commanders.\n\nViljoen was intelligent enough to go into hiding once it became obvious that the Schild would win the war. From his internal exile, Viljoen made clear his view that it was the politicians and their racial inflexibility that had lost South Africa, and later the Afrikaner Volkstaat, its freedom. Now in control of the lion's share of the reborn UDF, Viljoen is determined to prevent this from happening again. To many, Viljoen's bizarre claim that a Boer state is not incompatible with majority African rule carry the implication that he wishes for a federated South Africa.\n\nAlmost immediately, the general's insistence on closer cooperation with native African forces caused a break with the Cape Town government, from which the SALF is effectively independent. While Hüttig's agents and Malan's Boers remain Viljoen's immediate concern, the General's ultimate aim is to create a new multiracial order that will prevent South Africa from being divided and conquered ever again. If Mulder, the natives, or anyone else proves an obstacle to this, Viljoen won't hesitate to turn his guns on them."
